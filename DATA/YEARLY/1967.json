Province of Manitoba, [1967] S.C.R. 128\nDate: 1967-01-24\nEdith Alice Duthoit, as Executrix of the last Will and Testament of W.H. Duthoit, Deceased, and Edith Alice Duthoit (Applicants) Appellants;\nand\nThe Province of Manitoba (Respondent) Respondent.\n1966: November 17, 18, 21; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nExpropriation\u2014Compensation\u2014Appraisers\u2019 valuations of expropriated lands not accepted by arbitrator\u2014Court of Appeal right in varying arbitrator\u2019s award and in accepting appraisal of one of the appraisers as furnishing proper basis on which to fix compensation.\nThe Province of Manitoba expropriated certain property of the appellants. The property in question comprised three parcels of land. These parcels whilst not contiguous were close together and approximately 2 miles distant from the resort area of Grand Beach on the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg. Prior to the expropriation there were reports in the press of statements by the Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Provincial Government as to plans by that government to develop the Grand Beach area as an outstanding resort and recreational area. The arbitrator, appointed pursuant to s. 17(1) of The Expropriation Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 78, found that the best use to which all three parcels could be put was subdivision into building lots for summer cottages.\nAt the hearings before the arbitrator two appraisers were called, one by the appellants and one by the respondent. The respective valuations arrived at were $187,136 and $25,800 and the difference being so great it was agreed, at the urging of the arbitrator, to call a third appraiser. The latter estimated the value of the lands at $27,070. The arbitrator accepted none of these valuations but made an award of $58,242. On appeal, the Court of Appeal reached the conclusion that the appraisal of the third appraiser should be adopted. Accordingly, by a unanimous judgment of that Court the compensation allowed to the appellants was fixed at $27,000 plus interest from the date of taking possession. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed to the extent of substituting for the sum of $27,000 fixed by the Court of Appeal the sum of $28,953.85.\nThis was not a case in which the arbitrator enjoyed any particular advantage over the Court of Appeal by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses. The Court of Appeal was right in varying the award and in accepting the appraisal made by the third appraiser as furnishing the proper basis on which to fix the compensation. That appraiser, as pointed out by Guy J.A., had dealt carefully and methodically with the principles governing the fixing of compensation to be paid for expropriated property and applied them to the lands in question. The arbitrator had been led into error by attributing undue importance to the statements of the Minister of Industry and Commerce.\nIn arriving at his valuation of Parcel No. 3, which was $6,350, the third appraiser assumed that when subdivided it would yield only 39 lots. It was, however, agreed by counsel and stated in a letter to the arbitrator that this number should have been 51 instead of 39. In view of this admission the figure of $8,303.85 should be substituted for that of $6,350 and consequently the total awarded by the Court of Appeal should be increased by $1,953.85.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, allowing an appeal from an arbitration award respecting compensation for expropriated lands. Appeal allowed to limited extent.\nA. Kerr Twaddle and George A. Brown, for the appellants.\nW.E. Norton, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] pronounced on June 10, 1965, allowing an appeal from an award made by His Honour Judge Molloy on December 22, 1964, and fixing at $27,000 plus interest from the date of taking possession the compensation allowed to the appellants for their property expropriated by the respondent. His Honour Judge Molloy had awarded the sum of $58,242. He was sitting as an arbitrator appointed pursuant to s. 17(1) of The Expropriation Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 78. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was brought pursuant to s. 70 of the same Act and s. 31 of The Arbitration Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 9. In this Court the appellants ask that the award of the learned arbitrator be restored.\nThe relevant facts are set out in detail in the reasons of the Court of Appeal and of the learned arbitrator and a very brief summary will be sufficient to indicate the basis of the decision at which I have arrived.\nThe land in question comprises three separate parcels referred to in the proceedings as Parcels 1, 2 & 3. These parcels whilst not contiguous are close together and approximately 2 miles distant from the resort area of Grand Beach on the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg and about 58 miles from central Winnipeg over provincial highways.\nParcel 1 consists of a triangular piece of land containing 17.65 acres with a frontage of about 1,750 feet on Lake Winnipeg.\nParcel 2 consists of a rectangular area of 19.5 acres about 470 feet wide by 1,800 feet long which has no lake frontage, but is only a little over a quarter of a mile from the Grand Beach Lagoon.\nParcel 3 consists of a tract of 27.3 acres of irregular shape having a frontage of some 1,100 feet on the Grand Beach Lagoon.\nThe learned arbitrator found that the best use to which all three parcels could be put was subdivision into building lots for summer cottages.\nParcel No. 1 had been purchased by Mrs. Duthoit in 1940 for $50 but the value as sworn to by her was $500 at that time.\nParcels 2 and 3 were purchased in 1960 for $1,000 each. The lands in question were expropriated by the respondent on March 12, 1962. At the hearings before the arbitrator an appraiser, Mr. Rhone, was called by the appellants and an appraiser, Mr. Farstad, by the respondent. The difference between their estimates of value was so great that the arbitrator urged the calling of a third appraiser and a Mr. Turpie, a man of many years experience agreed upon by the parties, was persuaded to examine the property and give his appraisal. The valuations arrived at by these three witnesses were as follows:\nAppellants\u2019 Appraiser Mr. Rhone\nRespondent\u2019s Appraiser Mr. Farstad\nThird\nAppraiser Mr. Turpie\nParcel No. 1\n$100,000.00\n$15,700.00\n$14,120.00\nParcel No. 2\n50,773.00\n5,900.00\n6,600.00\nParcel No. 3\n36,363.00\n4,200.00\n6,350.00\n$187,136.00\n$25,800.00\n$27,070.00\nThe arbitrator accepted none of these figures but, as already stated, made an award of $58,242. Prior to the expropriation there were reports in the press on March 15, 1960, and August 22, 1960, of statements made by the Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Provincial Government as to a plan by that government to develop the Grand Beach area as an outstanding resort and recreational area.\nNeither Mr. Duthoit nor any of the appraisers were of opinion that these statements would add significantly to the value of the expropriated lands but, as is shown in the reasons of Guy J.A. who gave the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the learned arbitrator attached great weight to them.\nAfter having \u201ccarefully reviewed all the evidence and the exhibits filed and the reasons advanced by the learned Arbitrator for his award\u201d and having \u201cgiven anxious consideration to the arguments of both counsel\u201d, the Court of Appeal reached the conclusion that the appraisal of Mr. Turpie should be adopted.\nGuy J.A. after stating concisely and accurately the rules to be observed in fixing the compensation to be paid for expropriated property, pointed out that Mr. Turpie had dealt carefully and methodically with these governing principles and applied them to the lands in question. He was of opinion that the learned arbitrator had been led into error in reaching a figure more than twice that arrived at by Mr. Turpie by attributing undue importance to the statements of the Minister of Industry and Commerce. In all of this I agree with Guy J.A. This is not a case in which the learned arbitrator enjoyed any particular advantage over the Court of Appeal by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses. At the commencement of his reasons, he says:\nThree appraisals of the subject land were submitted to me. The Applicants called Mr. M.R. Rhone and the Crown called Mr. E.K. Farstad. A third appraisal was made by Mr. Andrew Turpie, upon my suggestion, in view of the wide divergence in the opinions of the other appraisers. I find no reason to prefer any of these gentlemen over the others by reason of qualifications, experience or conduct as witnesses.\nThe task of the appellants in this Court is to satisfy us that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is wrong; but, for the reasons given by Guy J.A., I am of opinion that this is a case in which the Court of Appeal was right in varying the award and in accepting the appraisal made by Mr. Turpie as furnishing the proper basis on which to fix the compensation.\nOne point remains. In arriving at his valuation of Parcel No. 3, which was $6,350, Mr. Turpie assumed that when subdivided it would yield only 39 lots. It was, however, agreed by counsel and stated in a letter to the learned arbitrator that this number should have been 51 instead of 39. In view of this admission it appears to me that the figure of $8,303.85 should be substituted for that of $6,350 and consequently the total awarded by the Court of Appeal should be increased by $1,953.85.\nWhile on this comparatively minor point the appellants succeed, the main attack on the judgment of the Court of Appeal has failed and under all the circumstances I think there should be no order as to costs in this Court.\nIn the result I would allow the appeal to the extent of substituting for the sum of $27,000 fixed by the Court of Appeal the sum of $28,953.85. In all other respects I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I would make no order as to costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed to limited extent; no order as to costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: George A. Brown, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fillmore, Riley & Company, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1965), 54 D.L.R. (2d) 259.\n",

The offer was accepted in writing on February 3, 1964. From time to time these materials were delivered under the contract as the builder required them, and the last materials supplied under the contract were delivered in June 1964. The builder, from time to time, telephoned individual orders for special material\u2014prefabricated lintel angles. These lintel angles were supplied as the telephone orders were received. The last of these orders was filed on October 14, 1964, and the appellant filed a lien on November 16, 1964, for a claim which included the balance owing on the original contract together with whatever was owing on the lintel angles.\nIn the submission of the appellant, the supply of lintel angles kept the lien alive and the claim, having been filed within thirty-five days after the last of the materials was furnished, as required by The Mechanics Lien Act, 1960 (Alta.), c. 64, was in time. This submission was ruled against at trial, and, on appeal, the decision of the trial judge was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. A further appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was a finding of fact by the Courts below that the lintel angles subsequently supplied by the appellant were unrelated to the material supplied under the original contract\u2014welded wire mesh. In a situation such as found here, where there was a contract to supply certain material for a fixed price and the subsequent supply of material outside the contract, the lien claimant could not tack on the subsequent supply of materials outside the contract and thus keep the lien alive.

(1929), 64 O.L.R. 94, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. Appeal dismissed. John A.S. McDonald, Q.C., for the appellant.\nR.J.G. McBain, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The problem involved in this appeal is whether in a case where there is a contract to supply certain material for a fixed price, the subsequent supply of material outside the contract will keep a mechanic\u2019s lien alive. Milvain J. decided that it would not. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal[2] with McDermid J.A. dissenting. In my opinion, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.\nBy a quotation dated January 23, 1964, Hectors Limited, the appellant in this Court, offered to supply Willmar Construction with 8,500 square feet of welded wire mesh (approximately 120 tons) for $24,821. This offer was accepted in writing on February 3, 1964. From time to time these materials were delivered under this contract as the builder required them, and there is a finding of fact that the last materials supplied under this contract were delivered in June 1964. No lien was filed until November 1964. If there had been no other dealings between the parties, the filing of the lien was clearly out of time, for the statute requires it be filed \u201cwithin thirty-five days after the last of the materials is furnished\u201d.\nHowever, from time to time the builder telephoned individual orders for special material\u2014pre\u2011fabricated lintel angles. These lintel angles had nothing to do with the original quotation for the supplying of welded wire mesh. They cannot be regarded as extras to that contract. They were supplied as the telephone orders were received. The last of these orders was filled on October 14, 1964 and the lien was filed on November 16, 1964 for a claim which included the balance owing on the original contract together with whatever was owing for the lintel angles. If the supply of lintel angles kept the lien alive, then the claim, being filed within a period of thirty-five days from October 14, 1964, was in time. This is the submission of the appel- lant, Hectors Limited, and it is this submission that has been ruled against both at trial and on appeal.\nThe Appellate Division founded its judgment on the general principles stated in Whitlock v. Loney[3], a decision of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc. These general principles are stated in 13 C.E.D. (Ont. 2nd), p. 347, as follows:\nWhere material is supplied under a prevenient arrangement or under a continuing or entire contract, it makes little difference how long a time elapses between deliveries, so long as the lien is filed, within thirty-seven days after the furnishing or placing of the last material \u201cso furnished or placed,\u201d and the date of the last material being furnished is all that is of importance. Under s. 21(2), it becomes wholly immaterial whether the material is furnished under but one contract or under fifty; and it will be seen that this is independent of the completion of the work but if there is a contract to supply certain material for a fixed price, the subsequent supply of material outside the contract will not keep the lien alive.\nThe Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in the Whitlock case found that the facts proved what has been referred to as a prevenient arrangement or a continuing or entire contract. For that reason they upheld the lien. But they recognized that in a situation such as we find here, and which the Alberta Courts have expressly found to exist, a lien claimant cannot tack on the subsequent supply of materials outside the contract and thus keep the lien alive.\nThere are decisions to the same effect, both before and after the Whitlock case, in the Ontario Court of Appeal\u2014Rathbone v. Michael[4]; and Fulton Hardware Co. v. Mitchell[5].\nIn Rathbone v. Michael there was a contract to furnish certain specified materials for the sum of $1,700. The last delivery under this contract was September 16, 1908. Further material was supplied between August 1 and October 8, 1908, on separate orders from time to time. A divisional Court first found that this further material was outside the contract and that the time of delivery of material outside the contract did not extend the time for filing the lien to include a claim under the original contract. On an application to adduce further evidence before the same Court, it was found that the additional material had been improperly charged as an extra outside the original con- tract and that it should have been charged under and as part of the original contract. The lien was, therefore, upheld. This admission of new evidence and the affirmance of the lien was upheld on an appeal to the Court of Appeal; see: Rathbone v. Michael[6]. The underlying assumption of all the judgments is that if the materials had not been supplied as part of the contract, the filing of the lien would have been out of time.\nFulton Hardware Co. v. Mitchell, supra, is to the same effect. Here there were two contracts, one for a roof for $3,806, and another for a skylight. There were also materials supplied not connected with either of these contracts. The point in issue is stated in the judgment of Meredith C.J.O. at p. 473:\nIt is contended on the appellant\u2019s behalf that, inasmuch as all the work done and materials supplied for purposes of the two contracts, as well as the materials supplied for purposes outside the two contracts, were charged for in one running account, and work was done on the roof contract within the 30 days, the lien for the materials is saved.\nMeredith C.J.O. approved the principles enunciated in Whitlock v. Loney. The judgment of the Court is contained in the following paragraph from p. 474:\nThere is nothing in the evidence to indicate that all the work which was done and all the materials that were supplied were done and furnished under one continuing contract; but on the contrary, the work done and the materials supplied for the roof contract were furnished under a separate contract from that as to the skylight and that as to the materials. What was supplied under the last mentioned contract would, no doubt, come within the principle relied on by the appellant, and it is to such a contract that the language of Riddell, J., in Hurst v. Morris (1914), 32 O.L.R. 346, at p. 351, must have had reference.\nCounsel for the appellant relied entirely on Hurst v. Morris[7] and George Taylor Hardware Ltd. v. Canadian Associated Gold Fields Ltd.[8]. These are not cases where, as here, there was a contract to supply certain material for a fixed price and the subsequent supply of material outside the contract. They were cases where the material was supplied under a prevenient arrangement as required from time to time. As Meredith C.J.O. pointed out, this was the situation that Riddell J. was referring to in Hurst v. Morris when he said:\nThus it becomes wholly immaterial whether the material is furnished under one contract or under fifty, and it will be seen that this is independent of the completion of the work. Most of the difficulty in this case arises from not considering the language of the Statutes.\nHere we have a finding of fact by the Alberta Courts that the lintel angles subsequently supplied by Hectors Limited were unrelated to the material supplied under the L original contract\u2014welded wire mesh. Consequently, they followed the principle stated in Rathbone v. Michael and Fulton Hardware Co. v. Mitchell and held that Hurst v. Morris and George Taylor Hardware Ltd. v. Canadian Associated Gold Fields Ltd. had no application.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cohen, McDonald, Filer & Sallenback, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.: Burnet, Duckworth, Palmer & Tomblin, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent, City Investment Corporation Ltd.: Barron, Barron & McBain, Calgary.\n[1] (1966), 56 W.W.R. 449, 57 D.L.R.

Airgo Ltd. was the proprietor of a commercial air service and was insured with the defendant company under a policy of aircraft liability insurance. In an action brought pursuant to s. 95 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 190, in respect of the unsatisfied judgment recovered by the plaintiffs against Airgo Ltd., judgment at trial was rendered in favour of RC and VC. The trial judgment having been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, a further appeal was brought to this Court.\nThe defence was limited to the interpretation of an exclusion clause in the Declarations of the policy. It was contended on behalf of the insurer that the flight in which RC and VC were injured was not one for which indemnity was provided in the policy because it was not conducted \u201cin accordance with the licences issued to the insured\u201d in that it was an international flight for which no authorization had been obtained from the appropriate authorities contrary to the provisions of Airgo\u2019s operating licence and it was a night flight which the company was not authorized to make under the conditions of its operating certificate.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the evidence of the regulations governing \u201cnavigation of foreign civil aircraft within the United States\u201d, the nature of the authorization required from \u201cthe appropriate authorities\u201d was a permit according to the aircraft in question \u201cthe privilege of taking on or discharging passengers, cargo or mail subject to the right of the state where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable.\u201d The Court held that failure to obtain this authorization was not such a breach of a condition as to result in the aircraft being used for a purpose not authorized by Airgo\u2019s licence, and that it did not have the effect of invalidating the licence.\nAs to the submission that \u201cnight flying\u201d was excluded from the coverage provided by the policy, the words in the operating certificate \u201cunder day Visual Flight Rules only\u201d related exclusively to the rules as to visibility from time to time in force for daytime flights and it followed that conformity with these rules, which was not disputed in the present case, constituted conformity with the operating certificate in that regard, whether the flight was conducted by day or by night. At the time of the accident the aircraft in question was being used under Visual Flight Rules which were \u201cin accordance with the licences issued to the insured by the Air Transport Board\u201d and was accordingly in this regard being used for a purpose within the terms of the policy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Stewart J. Appeal dismissed.\nAlastair R. Paterson, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nWilliam R. McMurtry, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal by Orion Insurance Company from a judgment rendered in favour of Robert and Violet Crone by Stewart J. at the trial of an action brought by the respondents pursuant to the provisions of s. 95 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, in respect of an unsatisfied judgment recovered by them against Airgo Limited, the proprietor of a commercial air service which was insured with the appellant under a policy of aircraft liability insurance.\nSection 95 of The Insurance Act reads as follows:\nWhere a person incurs a liability for injury or damages to the person or property of another and is insured against such liability and fails to satisfy a judgment against him in respect of his liability and an execution against him in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, the person entitled to the damages may recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\nRobert and Violet Crone sustained bodily injuries on May 19, 1961, when an aircraft, in which they were passengers and which had been chartered by Robert Crone Pictures Limited from Airgo Limited for a flight to Washington, crashed at night in a wooded area near Elmira in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, U.S.A. At the time of the crash the aircraft was being operated by one Leo Brando a servant and agent of Airgo Limited.\nIn the action brought by Robert Crone, Violet Crone and Robert Crone Pictures Limited against Airgo Limited and its servant Brando, the first two plaintiffs claimed damages for personal injuries resulting from the negligent operation of the aircraft and breach of contract in failing to carry them safely on the chartered trip, and the Robert Crone Company claimed damages for loss of the services of its employees. No appearance was entered by either defendant and on an assessment of damages Mr. Justice Walsh awarded $7,452.93 to Robert Crone, $15,000 to Violet Crone and $15,500 to Crone Pictures Limited. Execution against Airgo Limited in respect of these damages was returned unsatisfied and its servant Brando has left the country.\nWhen the present action was brought before Stewart J. pursuant to s. 95 of The Insurance Act, he gave judgment against the insurers for the damages awarded to Mr. and Mrs. Crone in the Airgo action together with interest from the date of the award, but held that the claim by the Crone Company was not one for which the statutory action could lie. This latter finding was not made the subject of appeal by the Crone Company either to the Court of Appeal for Ontario or to this Court, and accordingly the sole remaining issue in the present appeal is whether the judgment of Mr. and Mrs. Crone against Airgo Limited is one for which indemnity is provided in the Aircraft Liability Policy issued by the appellant.\nThe relevant portion of the insuring agreements recited in the policy reads as follows:\nNOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF the payment of the specified premium total and the Declarations contained herein and subject to the Limits, Exclusions, Terms and Conditions and other provisions of this policy including its endorsements, if any, the Insurer hereby agrees with the Insured, to pay on behalf of the Insured in respect to such Coverages as are specified in paragraph 3 hereof, all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages resulting from:... COVERAGE C\u2014Passenger Bodily Injury Liability Bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any passenger, caused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the aircraft referred to in the Schedule.\nThe coverage specified in para. 3 of the policy in respect of the aircraft in question specified limits of $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each occurrence.\nThe policy in question is made subject to certain exclusions which form a part thereof and include the following:\nThis insurance does not apply...\n(6) while the Aircraft is (a) used for any purpose other than as stated in Item 6 of the Declarations; (b) operated in flight by other than the pilot or pilots specified in Item 7 of the Declarations; (c) used for instruction unless specified in Item 6 of the Declarations;...\nThe defence advanced by the appellant is, by the terms of its notice of appeal to this Court, limited to the interpretation of Item 6 of the Declarations of the policy which reads as follows:\nItem 6. Purposes. This insurance applies only while the aircraft is used for the following purpose(s).\nFlight Training and Aircraft Rental, in accordance with Licenses issued to the Insured by the Air Transport Board, Private Business and Private Pleasure.\nThe italics are my own.\nBy the terms of s. 15(1) of the Aeronautics Act, 1952 R.S.C., c. 2, it is provided that, subject to the approval of the Minister, the Air Transport Board may issue a license to operate a commercial air service to any person applying therefore but notwithstanding the issuance of such a license it is stipulated by s. 15(5) that:\nNo carrier shall operate a commercial air service unless he holds a valid and subsisting certificate issued to him by the Minister certifying that the holder is adequately equipped and able to conduct a safe operation as an air carrier over the prescribed route or in the prescribed area.\nThe certificate pursuant to which Airgo Limited was carrying on its operations at the time of the accident was originally issued on August 21, 1959, and at that time had reference only to a license to operate a commercial air service between points within Canada and to recreational flying and aerial advertising from a base at Toronto, Ontario. This certificate was, however, on October 13, 1959, endorsed so as to refer to a license No. 251\/59, dated September 15, 1959, which was in force at the time of the accident, by which Airgo Limited was \u201clicensed\u2026subject to the conditions herein stated to operate a Class 9-4 International Non-Scheduled Charter commercial air service to transport persons and\/or goods from a base at Toronto, Ontario.\u201d The flight in question was an \u201cInternational Non-Scheduled Charter commercial air service\u2026\u201d of the type authorized by this License, one of the conditions of which provides that:\nPrior to conducting an international flight under this Licence, the Licensee must obtain the required authorization from the appropriate authorities of the foreign government concerned.\nIt is to be noted also that the operating certificate issued to Airgo Limited certified that that company was \u201cadequately equipped and able to conduct a safe operation as an air carrier from a base at Toronto (Island Airport), Ontario with the types of aircraft and under the conditions hereinafter set forth:\nNon-scheduled charter, recreational flying, and aerial advertising commercial air services, using landplanes and seaplanes, under day Visual Flight Rules only.\u201d\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that the flight in which the Crones were injured was not one for which indemnity is provided in the policy in question because it was not conducted \u201cin accordance with the licences issued to the insured\u201d in that it was an international flight for which no authorization had been obtained from the appropriate authorities contrary to the provisions of Airgo\u2019s operating licence and it was a night flight which the company was not authorized to make under the conditions of its operating certificate.\nThe submission that \u201cnight flying\u201d was excluded from the coverage provided by the policy is based entirely on the contention that the words \u201cunder day Visual Flight Rules only\u201d as they occur in the condition which forms a part of the operating certificate are to be read as meaning that the certificate was only valid in respect of daytime flights and that an aircraft which was being used at night was therefore not being used for a purpose \u201cin accordance with the licences issued to the insured by the Air Transport Board\u201d as required by Item 6 of the Declarations.\nIt appears to me, however, that the words \u201cunder day Visual Flight Rules only\u201d are to be construed as limiting the use of the insured aircraft to periods when the conditions as to visibility conform to the rules established for daytime flying under the provisions of the Air Regulations and by directions made by the Minister in that behalf. Whether these rules differ from the rules, if any, governing night flying is, as it seems to me, a matter which must depend on the Air Regulations and ministerial direction made pursuant to the Aeronautics Act which are from time to time in force. The Visual Flight Rules which appear to have been in force at the time of the flight in question make no distinction between day and night flying. (See Air Regulations 540 and 541 and Air Navigation Order Series 5 No. 3).\nIn this regard it is admitted in the factum filed on behalf of the appellant that the \u201cVisual Flight Rules apply equally by day and night\u201d and it is further stated that:\nThe Appellant has never sought to deny liability under the contract of insurance on the grounds that at the time of the accident the aircraft was being operated in conditions which were below the weather minima for VFR flights. The Appellant\u2019s position is that it was a condition of the relevant Operating Certificate No. 1571 that all operations of Airgo Limited should be by day only and it is common ground that at the time of the accident the aircraft was being operated at night. I am, as I have indicated, of opinion that the words \u201cunder day Visual Flight Rules only\u201d relate exclusively to the rules as to visibility from time to time in force for daytime flights and it appears to me to follow that conformity with these rules, which is not disputed in the present case, constitutes conformity with the operating certificate in that regard, whether the flight be conducted by day or by night. I am accordingly of opinion that when conducting the flight in question, Airgo Limited was the holder of a valid and subsisting operating certificate as described in subs. 5 of s. 15 of the Aeronautics Act and that at the time of the accident the aircraft in question was being used under Visual Flight Rules which were \u201cin accordance with the licences issued to the insured by the Air Transport Board\u201d and was accordingly in this regard being used for a purpose contemplated in Item 6 of the Declarations.\nIn support of the contention that the coverage afforded by the policy did not extend to an aircraft conducting an international flight for which the licencee had not obtained \u201cauthorization from the appropriate authorities of the foreign government concerned\u201d, the appellant tendered the evidence of the Assistant Executive Director of the Aeronautics Board in Washington who produced as an exhibit the Special Regulations governing \u201cnavigation of foreign civil aircraft within the United States\u201d. From a perusal of this evidence and of the relevant regulations, it appears to me that the nature of the authorization required from \u201cthe appropriate authorities\u201d was a permit according to the aircraft in question \u201cthe privilege of taking on or discharging passengers, cargo or mail subject to the right of the state where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. (Regulation 375.42).\nBy s. 6(d) of the Aeronautics Act \u201ccommercial air service\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cany use of an aircraft in or over Canada for hire or reward\u201d and I am of opinion that \u201cinternational...charter commercial air service\u201d must therefore be treated as meaning \u201cuse of the aircraft\u2026for hire or reward\u201d which in my view constitutes \u201caircraft rental\u201d within the meaning of Item 6 of the Declarations which forms a part of the policy and which, as has been stated, limits the \u201cpurposes\u201d for which the aircraft is insured to \u201cflight training and aircraft rental in accordance with licences issued to the insured\u2026\u201d\nI do not, however, think that the words \u201cin accordance with\u201d as they are employed in this context are to be construed as requiring strict compliance with all the conditions which are attached to the operating licence issued to the insured, but I am rather of the opinion that they are to be treated as synonymous with \u201cauthorized by\u201d and that if the flight is of a kind for which the insured holds a valid and subsisting operating licence it does not cease to be used for one of the purposes for which indemnity is provided in the policy simply because the insured has not complied with all the terms of the conditions which are attached to that licence.\nIn the present case, as has been indicated, the licence authorizing the insured to operate \u201cinternational non-scheduled charter commercial air service...\u201d was issued subject to the conditions therein stated, but one of those conditions stipulated that \u201cunless otherwise provided herein the licence shall remain in effect until suspended or cancelled\u201d. This is to be contrasted with the wording of the Certificate of Airworthiness which was considered in Survey Aircraft Ltd. v. Stevenson et al.[2] In that case there appeared above the signature on the certificate the words: \u201cThis Certificate is only valid subject to the above compulsory conditions being fulfilled and until the date shown on page 4 hereof.\u201d\nThere are two conditions in the operating licence in the present case breach of which would, in my opinion, result in the aircraft being used for a purpose not authorized by the licence and therefore not covered by the policy. One of these is the condition that the licencee \u201cshall not operate unless he holds a valid and subsisting operating certificate...\u201d, and the other prohibits the licencee from undertaking any forms of operation except within the limits of continental North America and the territorial waters thereof.\nI am, however, of opinion that failure to obtain \u201cthe required authorization from the appropriate authorities of the foreign government concerned\u201d is not such a breach of a condition as to result in the aircraft being used for a purpose not authorized by the licence, and that it does not have the effect of invalidating the licence.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the insured aircraft at the time of the accident in question was being used for \u201cinternational\u2026charter commercial air service\u201d for which the insured held a valid and subsisting licence and I am reinforced in this view by a consideration of s. 15(10) and (11) of the Aeronautics Act which provides:\n(10) Where in the opinion of the Board an air carrier has violated any of the conditions attached to his licence, the Board may cancel or suspend the licence.\n(11) Any air carrier whose licence has been so cancelled or suspended may appeal to the Minister.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the aircraft was being used for one of the purposes for which indemnity was provided in the policy and that under the circumstances and by virtue of s. 95 of The Insurance Act, Mr. and Mrs. Crone were entitled to recover from the appellant the amount of the judgments which they obtained against Airgo Limited.\nI am in agreement with Mr. Justice Stewart and with the Court of Appeal in awarding to the respondents interest on the original judgment obtained by them in their action against Airgo Limited.\nHaving regard to all the above I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIt should perhaps be mentioned that although the judgment in favour of Mr. Crone was for a sum of less than $10,000, it was agreed by all concerned that leave to appeal against this judgment should be granted.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Manning, Bruce, Paterson & Ridout, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Bassel, Sullivan, Holland & Lawson, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 221, 53 D.L.R.

The appeals will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nIn the first action, a cross-appeal by the respondent Albert Missiaen (referred to hereunder as AM) as to the amount of general damages awarded to him was then fully argued and judgment was reserved.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed; in the first action the cross-appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial varied by substituting for the sum of $12,000 general damages awarded to the respondent AM the sum of $22,000. The sum of $12,000 at which the trial judge assessed the general damages of AM included (i) loss of salary from one year after the accident to the date of trial, (ii) his prospective loss of salary, (iii) the prospective payments to a housekeeper plus the cost of feeding her, (iv) damages for pain and suffering, (v) damages for loss of the amenities of life. Assuming that the life expectancy of AM at the date of the trial was only three years, the shortest period suggested in the \u201cguess\u201d of a medical witness, the total of items (i), (ii) and (iii) exceeded by more than $3,000 the total award of general damages and nothing remained to compensate him in regard to items (iv) and (v), that is to say for the fact that from a healthy and active old age the accident had turned him into an invalid, practically never free from pain.\nIn these circumstances, the amount at which the general damages were assessed was so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate. The proper amount was not susceptible of precise calculation. It was the duty of the Court to endeavour to deal with the matter as would a properly instructed jury acting reasonably, not attempting to award \u201ca perfect compensation\u201d but seeking to fix an amount reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the injuries suffered. The Court was of the opinion that the general damages should be increased by $10,000.\nAPPEALS and CROSS-APPEAL from judgments of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, dismissing appeals and a cross-appeal from judgments of Farthing J. in two actions brought as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Appeals dismissed; cross-appeal in the first action allowed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.B. Tuer, for the appellants.\nArnold F. Moir, Q.C., and John A. Weir, for the respondents, A. Missiaen and M. Missiaen.\nAdrian G. Smith, for the respondents, H. Bast and A. Bast.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014On June 1, 1963 at about 10 p.m., an automobile owned by the appellant Kern, driven with his consent by the appellant Jackson and in which Helen Bast was a passenger was in collision with an automobile owned and driven by the respondent Albert Missiaen in which the respondent Mary Missiaen was a passenger. Albert Missiaen, Mary Missiaen and Helen Bast all suffered personal injuries.\nAs a result of the collision two actions were brought, the first by the Missiaens against Jackson and Kern and the second by Helen and Anthony Bast against Jackson, Kern and Albert Missiaen. These two actions were tried together by Farthing J. who found that the collision was caused by the gross negligence of Jackson, absolved Albert Missiaen from blame and awarded damages against Jackson and Kern jointly and severally as follows:\nTo Albert and Mary Missiaen, special damages.....................................\n$ 8,624.49\nTo Albert Missiaen, general damages......................................................\n$12,000.00\nTo Mary Missiaen, general damages.......................................................\n$ 5,000.00\nTo Helen Bast and Anthony Bast, special damages...............................\n$ 1,605.80\nTo Helen Bast, general damages..............................................................\n$10,000.00\nThe second action as against Missiaen was dismissed with costs but it was ordered that the plaintiffs should recover from Jackson and Kern the costs which they were required to pay to Missiaen.\nIn each action Jackson and Kern appealed as to the findings in regard to liability and as to the quantum of general damages.\nIn the first action Albert Missiaen cross-appealed asking that the amount of the general damages awarded to him should be increased. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissed the appeals and the cross-appeal with costs.\nIn the first action, Jackson and Kern appeal to this court and Albert Missiaen cross-appeals asking that the award of general damages to him be increased.\nIn the second action, Jackson and Kern appeal; there is no cross-appeal, Helen Bast and Anthony Bast ask that the judgment of the Appellate Division be affirmed.\nAt the commencement of the hearing in this Court we requested counsel to deal first with the question of liability. Counsel for the appellants did not argue that the concurrent findings of gross negligence against Jackson should be disturbed but submitted that the greater part of the blame should be placed upon Albert Missiaen. At the conclusion of the arguments of all counsel on this branch of the matter the Court retired and on returning gave judgment as follows:\nIn this Court it is not questioned that the collision out of which this appeal arises was caused in part by the gross negligence of the driver of the appellants\u2019 car. The question whether or not the respondent Albert Missiaen was guilty of contributory negligence is one of fact and we find ourselves unable to say that we should interfere with the concurrent findings in the Courts below absolving him from blame. The appeals will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe cross-appeal of Albert Missiaen as to the amount of general damages awarded to him was then fully argued and judgment was reserved.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge as to the physical results of the injuries suffered by Albert Missiaen are am ply supported by the evidence and are as follows:\nAt the time of the accident on 1st June, 1963 he was 82 years of age and in remarkably good health. He was working every day. He did his own gardening and that of three of his sons, and looked after their cottages at Pigeon Lake. A few months before the accident he had no trouble passing a medical exam for his driver\u2019s licence. His most serious injuries are those affecting his legs. Before the accident he said he could walk \u201cmiles and miles\u201d. Now his left leg is tired and the right hurts in the hip where it was dislocated. He can only walk with two sticks and only about 100 feet at a time. He can\u2019t tie his shoe laces. He always has to sleep with a cushion under his left knee. Pain in his leg makes sleep difficult. He gets pain in his neck if he lies on his right side. He still enjoys his meals. He can\u2019t go out in the winter now but still enjoys getting out in good summer weather.\nDr. F.G. Day, an orthopaedic surgeon, said that Mr. Missiaen was very severely injured, the main injury being to the hip joint and clavicle. In hospital he developed chest trouble from having to stay so long in bed. His right hip is his principal trouble at present. It is almost fixed in one position because there is no fusion. If there were, he would be much better off. The only remedy would be to remove the head of the femur and replace it with an artificial one. The doctor said he would not recommend such major surgery for a man of his age as he would hardly have the necessary \u201cdrive\u201d to put him through the post\u2011operative period. Dr. Day said that Mr. Missiaen suffered a great deal of pain, so much so that he cannot walk or sit or lie in bed without suffering. The doctor fixed his disability at 50 percent of total, which is just about double the degree he had ever before estimated. He said he was surprised to hear that Mr. Missiaen had said in evidence that he could walk about a hundred feet at one time\u2014a longer distance than the doctor would have thought possible.\nFrom his own evidence and that of Dr. Day, it was made quite clear that this unfortunate old man is anything but a malingerer. From a remarkably healthy and active old age this accident has turned him into an invalid who is practically never free from pain\u2014even his sleep being frequently interrupted thereby.\nThe learned trial judge also found that prior to the accident Mr. Missiaen, who had farmed for the greater part of his life, had always been an extremely active man, that after he retired he kept himself busy at work not too heavy for him, that he kept the grounds in front of his sons\u2019 company office in proper shape, that he did a lot of work at the summer cottage of one of his sons, 54 miles away, driving himself out there in the morning and back to Edmonton in the evening, that he was employed as the caretaker of the sons\u2019 business premises at a salary of $210 a month although possibly during the two or three years prior to the accident this may have been an over-payment made because of the family relationship. For one year following the accident, the sons\u2019 company continued to pay the monthly salary but since then Mr. Missiaen has not received any salary. Because of the physical condition of himself and his wife resulting from the accident, he has to employ a housekeeper at a salary of $150 a month to care for the two of them.\nAt the trial the witness, F.G. Missiaen, produced a list of items of special damage and supporting vouchers totalling $8,624.49. This was not seriously challenged in cross\u2011examination and neither the list nor the vouchers were made an exhibit. However from an examination of the evidence of this witness and the comments of counsel it would seem that this total (which was the amount at which the learned trial judge assessed the special damages) does not include any loss of salary or any expense for feeding the housekeeper but does include the amounts paid to the housekeeper up to the date of the trial.\nFrom this it follows that the sum of $12,000 at which the learned trial judge assessed the general damages of Mr. Missiaen includes (i) loss of salary from one year after the accident to the date of trial, (ii) his prospective loss of salary, (iii) the prospective payments to the housekeeper plus the cost of feeding her, (iv) damages for pain and suffering, (v) damages for loss of the amenities of life.\nItem (i) would be in round figures $2,520.\nItems (ii) and (iii) together, even excluding any allowance for the food and lodging of the housekeeper, would amount to approximately $4,300 a year.\nAt the time of the trial, in June 1965, Dr. Day was asked in cross-examination as to Mr. Missiaen\u2019s life expectancy; he replied that while he would \u201conly like it recorded as a guess\u201d, he thought \u201cit would not be much longer than three or four years\u201d; later in his evidence while emphasizing that it was a guess rather than an estimate, he suggested the possibility of the period being ten years.\nIf one assumes that Mr. Missiaen\u2019s life expectancy at the date of the trial was only three years, the shortest period suggested in Dr. Day\u2019s \u201cguess\u201d, it is at once obvious that the total of items (i), (ii) and (iii) exceeds by more than $3,000 the total award of general damages and that less than nothing remains to compensate him in regard to items (iv) and (v), that is to say for the fact that, to quote again the words of the learned trial judge:\nFrom a remarkably healthy and active old age this accident has turned him into an invalid who is practically never free from pain\u2014even his sleep being frequently interrupted thereby.\nIn these circumstances, it appears to me that the amount at which the general damages were assessed is so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate. The proper amount is not susceptible of precise calculation. It is, I think, our duty to endeavour to deal with the matter as would a properly instructed jury acting reasonably, not attempting to award \u201ca perfect compensation\u201d but seeking to fix an amount reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the injuries suffered. In my opinion the general damages should be increased by $10,000.\nIn the first action, the appeal is dismissed with costs, I would allow the cross-appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division and direct that the judgment at trial be varied by substituting for the sum of $12,000 general damages awarded to the respondent Albert Missiaen the sum of $22,000. In the second action the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs; cross-appeal in first action allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clement, Parlee, Irving, Mustard & Rodney, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondents, A.

Beckett, Building Commissioner (Respondents) Respondents.\n1966: June 23; 1967: February 7.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Application for separate building permits for foundation and superstructure of apartment hotel\u2014Permit issued for foundation\u2014Subsequent passage of amendment to zoning by-law to prevent construction of apartment hotels in area\u2014Whether building plans approved by inspector prior to passage of amending by-law\u2014The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, s. 30(7)(b).\nThe appellants were builders who intended to build an apartment hotel on a lot which they purchased, conditional upon their ability to obtain a building permit. Later, having been informed by the respondent municipality that a permit would be issued, they waived the condition and became bound to purchase the land. On March 2, 1964, they applied for two permits, one for the foundation and one for the superstructure. This was in accordance with the established practice which allowed the applicant to commence work sooner and avoided the delay which would ensue if all plans and drawings had to be examined in complete detail before work could commence. The deficiencies, if any, with relation to the superstructure would normally be worked out between the parties as the work progressed.\nA permit for the foundations was issued on April 2, 1964, and as a result the appellants entered into construction contracts. An endorsement on the plans indicated that they were approved on or about March 18, 1964. On April 6, 1964, the township passed an amending zoning by-law, the object of which was to prevent the appellants and others from building apartment hotels on sites already chosen by them.\nAn application for mandamus to compel the issue of the building permit was dismissed as to the permit for the superstructure. On consent of the parties, the judge who heard the application was asked to enlarge it to include a prayer for a declaration that the plans for the building had been approved by the building inspector prior to the date of the passing of the amending by-law and that the plans were therefore approved within the meaning of s. 30(7)(b) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296. This declaration was granted.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the municipality and held that the proposed building was not an apartment hotel within the meaning of that term as denned in the zoning by-law prior to its amendment, and that consequently, its erection was prohibited by the provisions of the by-law even before amendment. On appeal to this Court, the appellants sought restoration of the declaratory judgment given by the trial judge. Held (Martland and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ.: The application for the building permit was in conformity with the by-law prior to its amendment.\nAs submitted by the appellants, the approval contemplated by s. 30(7)(b) of The Planning Act was approval with relation to zoning questions. The plans for the proposed apartment hotel were approved by the building inspector prior to the date of the passing of the amending by-law. The plans were therefore approved within the meaning of s. 30(7)(b) of the Act.\nPer Martland and Hall JJ., dissenting: Approval of the plans of a building, within the meaning of s. 30(7) of The Planning Act, meant that kind of approval by the building inspector which would be requisite for the issuance of a building permit. No such approval was ever given in this case, nor were the appellants ever in a position to demand that it be given.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Brooke J. Appeal allowed, Martland and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and J.E. Sexton, for the appellants.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and M. McQuaid, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellants are builders who intended to build an apartment hotel on a lot which they purchased for $199,500, conditional upon their ability to obtain a building permit. They brought an application for mandamus to compel the issue of the permit. Brooke J., who heard the application, dismissed it as to the permit for the superstructure of the building. A permit had already been granted for the foundations. On consent of the parties, the judge was asked to enlarge the application to include a prayer for a declaration that the plans for the building had been approved by the building inspector prior to the date of the passing of an amending by-law No. 18758 and that the plans were therefore approved within the meaning of s. 30(7)(b) of The Planning Act. The judge made this declaration.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the municipality and held that the proposed building was not an apartment hotel within the meaning of that term as defined in the zoning by-law No. 7625, and that consequently, its erection was prohibited by the provisions of the by-law even as it stood before an attempted amendment which I will deal with later.\nOn this appeal the appellants seek the restoration of the declaratory judgment given by Brooke J. Mandamus has disappeared from the litigation.\nBefore making the conditional contract for the purchase of the land, the appellants had ascertained that it was zoned \u201cGeneral Commercial\u201d according to zoning bylaw No. 7625 of the municipality and that apartment hotels were a permitted use. On March 2, 1964, they applied for permits for the foundation and excavation and for the superstructure. They delivered at the same time two sets of architectural and structural plans, together with a sketch of survey. The plans were for a 231-suite apartment hotel.\nBefore waiving the condition in their agreement of purchase and thereby binding themselves to complete, the appellants, wishing to be satisfied that a permit for the apartment hotel would be issued, made enquiries of the municipality and were informed on the 28th and 30th days of March, 1964, that a permit would be issued. Relying upon this information, they immediately waived the condition and became bound to purchase the land.\nThe practice of applying for two permits, one for the foundation and one for the superstructure, requires explanation. It had become well established and was based on convenience. It allowed an applicant to commence work sooner and avoided the delay which would ensue if all plans and drawings had to be examined in complete detail and approved in their entirety before work could commence. The deficiencies, if any, with relation to the superstructure would normally be worked out between the architect and engineer on one side and the corporation on the other as construction went along.\nOn April 2, 1964, permit No. 60133 was issued to the appellants to excavate and erect the foundation for the proposed building. The endorsement on the plans indicated that they were approved on or about March 18, 1964. The plans, as filed, did not offend the zoning by-law prior to its amendment. As a result of the issue of the permit on April 2, 1964, the appellants entered into construction contracts for amounts exceeding $350,000. They had also already entered into engineering and architectural contracts. On April 13, 1964, the council of the respondent instructed the building commissioner not to \u201cprocess any applications for building permits for apartment hotels which have been or may hereafter be submitted to the Building Department\u201d. On April 15, the building commissioner wrote the appellants that the plans did not comply with the zoning by-law No. 7625, as amended by by-law No. 18758, which amendment was purportedly passed by the township on April 6, 1964, four days after the granting of the permit to the appellants. The object of the amending by-law was to prevent the appellants and others from building apartment hotels on sites already chosen by them.\nThe submission of the appellants is that they were entitled to build a high-rise apartment hotel under by-law No. 7625. The Court of Appeal has found that they were not so entitled for reasons that counsel for the municipality is not prepared to support. I will set out the relevant definitions in the zoning by-law:\n\u201cApartment Hotel\u201d shall mean a building or portion of a building used mainly for the purpose of furnishing living quarters for families by the month or more than a month, and not for any period of less than a month, and having at least six suites of rooms for rent, and having a restaurant or dining room, but shall not include an hotel or ordinary lodging house.\n\u201cDwelling Apartment House\u201d shall mean a building containing more than four (4) dwelling units each unit having access only from an internal corridor system.\n\u201cDwelling Unit\u201d shall mean a separate set of living quarters designed or intended for use or used by an individual or one family alone, and which shall include at least one room and separate kitchen and sanitary conveniences, with a private entrance from outside the building or from a common hallway or stairway inside.\n\u201cHotel\u201d shall mean a building or part of a building in which a minimum of six rooms is provided for renting as dwellings, usually on a temporary or transient basis, with no facilities for cooking or housekeeping therein; but with a public dining room.\nThe ratio of the Court of Appeal is that the intended building was not an apartment hotel but a \u201cdwelling apartment house\u201d; that such a building even on a site within a C1 Zone could not be erected under by-law No. 7625 unless it conformed to the provisions applicable for a building in an RM zone. This is expressed in the following passage from its reasons for judgment:\nHaving concluded that the projected building is a \u201cdwelling, apartment house\u201d, and that as such it clearly does not conform to the provisions applicable to such a building in a RM5 zone, its erection on a site within a C1 zone was not permissible under By-law 7625 as it stood at the date of the application for the building permit.\nAt the time of the applications for building permits the municipal officers thought that they were in conformity with the zoning by-law; that the proposed buildings were apartment hotels within the terms of the by-law and that they could be built on land which was zoned (C-1)\u2014General Commercial Zone\u2014as this land was. No one thought of classifying these buildings as Dwelling Apartment Houses restricted to a height of three stories, and counsel for the municipality, in this Court, made no attempt to argue this. I think that it is clear that when these excavation and foundation permits were granted, the applications were in conformity with the by-law prior to its amendment.\nThe next branch of the appeal is the submission of the appellants that their plans were approved within the meaning of that word as found in s. 30(7)(b) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, prior to the passing of the amending by-law 18758. Section 30(7)(b) of The Planning Act reads as follows:\nNo by-law passed under this section applies,...\n(b) to prevent the erection or use for a purpose prohibited by the by-law of any building or structure the plans for which have, prior to the day of the passing of the by-law, been approved by the municipal architect or building inspector...\nThe appellants say that the approval contemplated by s. 30(7)(b) is approval with relation to zoning questions. On the other hand, the municipality says that the approval of plans contemplated by s. 30(7)(b) is the issue of the building permit. In other words, if a builder cannot get a mandamus for the issue of a building permit, then he must lack the necessary approval under s. 30(7)(b). The judge favoured the submission of the appellants. I think that he was right in making this declaration. The building permit for the foundations and excavation was actually issued. The plans for the superstructure were in the hands of the municipality. The very issue of the excavation and foundation permit indicates that whatever objections there might be to the plans of the superstructure were of such a character, being deficiencies with respect to the building by-law alone, that they would normally be worked out between the parties as the work progressed. I think that these appellants had the approval of the municipality and that the judgment of Brooke J. should be restored.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and para. 1 of the order of Brooke J. to the following effect should be restored:\nIT IS DECLARED AND FOUND that the plans as submitted by the Applicants for the proposed apartment hotel were approved by the Building Inspector prior to the date of the passing of the amending by-law, being By-law 18758 of the Respondent Municipality, and that the plans were therefore approved within the meaning of Section 30(7)(b) of the Planning Act.\nThe judgment of Martland and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014This case relates to one of three applications which were disposed of at the same time by Brooke J., each seeking an order by way of mandamus, directed to the respondent corporation and to the respondent Beckett, its building commissioner, to issue a building permit to permit the applicant to build an apartment hotel. The other two applicants were Ample Investments Limited and Tashan Limited. Reasons were delivered in respect of the application of Ample Investments Limited, which also applied to the other two applications. Brooke J. refused to make the order requested, but, on consent of the parties, enlarged the application to include a prayer for a declaration that the plans for the building had been approved by the respondent Beckett before passage of amending by\u2011law No. 18758. This declaration was granted. His decision was reversed on appeal. The appeals from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in respect of all three applications were argued at the same time before us.\nThe facts are stated in the reasons of my brother Judson. In each case the applicant had obtained a permit limited to the excavation and erection of the foundation of a building. These were issued, in the case of the appellants, on April 2, 1964, in the case of Tashan, on April 3, 1964, and in the case of Ample, on April 6, 1964. By-law No. 18758 was enacted on April 6, 1964, and its effect was to prevent the construction in each case of a building of the type contemplated in the area where it was proposed to be erected, in that, inter alia, a limitation as to height was imposed. The respondents contend that this amending by-law was applicable in each case. The appellants contend that it did not apply because of the provisions of s. 30(7) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, which provides as follows:\n30. (7) No by-law passed under this section applies,\n(a) to prevent the use of any land, building or structure for any purpose prohibited by the by-law if such land, building or structure was lawfully used for such purpose on the day of the passing of the by-law, so long as it continues to be used for that purpose; or\n(b) to prevent the erection or use for a purpose prohibited by the by-law of any building or structure the plans for which have, prior to the day of the passing of the by-law, been approved by the municipal architect or building inspector, so long as the building or structure when erected is used and continues to be used for the purpose for which it was erected and provided the erection of such building or structure is commenced within two years after the day of the passing of the by-law and such building or structure is completed within a reasonable time after the erection thereof is commenced.\nThe application of that subsection depends upon whether or not the respondent Beckett had, prior to the enactment of by-law No. 18758, approved the plans of the appellants\u2019 proposed building.\nThe learned trial judge summarizes the evidence of Beckett on this point as follows:\nMr. Beckett in his evidence stated that the plans of the superstructure were considered prior to the issue of the permit for excavation and foundation, but only in so far as they related to excavation and foundation. The plans for the excavation and foundation, which are some of the plans filed, are clearly stamped over the signature of Mr. Beckett \u201capproved for building permit for excavation and foundation only.\u201d There is no stamp of approval marked on the rest of the plans filed. As to the application for the building permit for the superstructure, Mr. Beckett states that there was a preliminary examination made of these plans but that they were returned to the owner with a notice endorsed on them, \u201cNeed further lay-out plans for superstructure permit\u201d to advise that there were deficiencies in the documents submitted for this purpose. It appears from the cross-examination that this objection relates to one of the plans which is entitled a typical floor plan and on which it is noted that on alternate floors this plan would be reversed. For clarity, the building inspector has required a separate plan for the alternate floors. Mr. Beckett stated that at the time of the launching of this application further examinations were made of the plans and they revealed a number of deficiencies, some of which were touched upon in his cross-examination. In addition he stated, on cross\u2011examination, that no specifications for the superstructure had been filed and as a result certain aspects of the construction were not clear, e.g., while the plans called for brick, there were no specifications as to the type of brick. The learned trial judge found that the building plans had been examined and approved as to their compliance with the zoning by-law No. 7625 as it then stood. He further stated that:\nThe plans in so far as they related to the superstructure had received consideration and had undergone preliminary examination prior to the issuing of the permit for excavation and foundation.\nHe concluded that there had been approval within the meaning of s. 30(7) of The Planning Act.\nIt was contended by counsel for the appellants that approval of the plans as to compliance with the zoning by-law was an approval within the meaning of subs. (7). I do not accept this submission. Paragraph (b) of the subsection refers to approval of the plans of a building or structure. In my opinion this means the approval of the plans in relation to the issuance of a building permit. Subsection (7) was intended to remove from the application of a zoning by\u2011law a building already constructed and in use, and a proposed building which, in the absence of the by-law, the owner of the land was legally entitled to construct on the day the by-law was passed. An opinion by the building inspector that a building of the kind proposed in a set of plans would not offend an existing zoning by-law is not an approval of the plans of the building in this context.\nThe requirements to be met before the approval of plans of a building and the issuance of a building permit are described in Chapter 1, Section 6, of By-Law No. 6110 of the respondent. It provides, in part:\n6. DUTIES OF THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER\nThe Building Commissioner shall:\n(a) Examine all applications for permission to do work in connection with building;\n(b) When the prescribed fee has been paid, and the application, drawings, specifications and block plan or survey conform to the requirements of this By-law, and all other applicable governmental regulations, stamp the drawings and specifications with the approval stamp of the Building Department, issue the permit together with one set of the approved drawings and specifications to the applicant, and retain the other set...\n(c) If the matters mentioned in any application for a permit or if the drawings, specifications or block plan or survey submitted with the application indicate to the Building Commissioner that the work proposed to be done will not comply in all respects with the provisions of this By-law and all applicable governmental regulations, refuse to issue a permit therefor and no permit shall be issued until the application, drawings, specifications and the block plan are made to conform to the requirements of this By-law and all applicable governmental regulations.\nSection 6(b) clearly contemplates the submission of both drawings and specifications before the drawings can be approved, and the approval of both, at the same time, before a building permit may be issued. The respondent Beckett, on the date of the enactment of by-law No. 18758, had no authority to approve the building plans, because on that date not only were there deficiencies in the plans filed, but, in addition, no specifications had been filed.\nIt is clear that on that date the appellants were not in a position to demand the issuance of a building permit because the learned trial judge expressly refused to grant an order by way of mandamus to require the issuance of such permit, and no appeal was taken from that decision. He said:\nAccepting the statements made by Mr. Beckett as to the deficiencies in the material and having considered the provisions of the building by-law, particularly as to the need for filing specifications, I cannot in these circumstances at this time require the respondent municipality to issue the building permit sought.\nIn my opinion, approval of the plans of a building, within the meaning of s. 30(7) of The Planning Act, means that kind of approval by the building inspector which would be requisite for the issuance of a building permit. No such approval was ever given in this case, nor, in view of the decision of the learned trial judge, were the appellants ever in a position to demand that it be given.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, MARTLAND and HALL JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Arnup, Foulds, Weir, Boeckh, Morris & Robinson, Toronto.\n",

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1966: May 25, 26; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nSolicitors\u2014Professional negligence\u2014Solicitor retained by lender in preparation and registration of chattel mortgage on certain equipment as security for loan\u2014Later discovery that equipment not at reported location and probably not owned by borrower\u2014Whether solicitor negligent in failing to anticipate borrower\u2019s criminal conduct.\nOn Thursday, July 17, 1958, the appellant S, a partner in the appellant firm of solicitors at Calgary, was asked to represent the respondent in the preparation of a chattel mortgage on some industrial equipment as security for a loan of $13,000 to be made by the respondent to one A. The latter in describing the equipment gave a serial number which S, on making inquiry, discovered could not be the proper number. T, who controlled and was the president of the respondent, was advised by S to make a personal inspection of the equipment but he said that he did not have time. He intimated to S that the matter was urgent, as A required the funds promptly in order to accept an option.\nA told S that the location of the equipment was at Hinton, Alberta. This would necessitate registration of the chattel mortgage in Edmonton. He also gave the name of the company which he said was using the equipment. S telephoned to his agents in Edmonton, giving the information which he had obtained and asking them to check it.\nAt a further meeting the next day A furnished what he alleged was the correct serial number of the equipment. S was advised by a finance company that they had financed equipment for A in the past of the kind described by him. This information was confirmed in writing by the company on Monday, July 21. The confirmation gave the serial number of the equipment and stated that a lien of $22,000 had been satisfactorily retired by the debtor.\nOn the Friday, the chattel mortgage was drawn and executed and was forwarded to S\u2019s agents at Edmonton for registration with a letter asking that it be ascertained that there was no prior encumbrance against it. T delivered to S the respondent\u2019s cheque for $13,000 payable to the appellant firm. S was instructed to deposit with the bank on which it was drawn a letter confirming the registration of the chattel mortgage in order to have it certified.\nThe chattel mortgage was registered on Monday, July 21, and, after certification of the respondent\u2019s cheque, S delivered to A the appellant firm\u2019s cheque for $13,000. At the time he had received the written confirmation of the finance company. On the same day, in the late afternoon and subsequent to delivery of the cheque, S received a telegram, from his Edmonton agents advising that they were unable to locate the officers of the company which, according to A, had been using the equipment.\nIt later transpired that the equipment was not at Hinton, and probably was not owned by A. The sum of $5,000 was collected by the respondent from him. The respondent\u2019s action against the appellants for the balance of $8,000 advanced, and interest, was dismissed by the trial judge, who held that S was not negligent in failing to anticipate criminal acts on the part of A. The trial judgment was reversed on appeal, and an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nS had explained to T that it was impossible to obtain absolute proof of ownership of the equipment. His understanding of his duty was that he was to ascertain that there was a properly described piece of equipment, that he was to register a chattel mortgage against it, not subject to any prior encumbrance, and that if he had some evidence of ownership which he considered satisfactory the money could be released. He felt that the information from the finance company did constitute evidence of ownership, sufficient to satisfy him that, within the terms of his instructions, the money could be disbursed.\nIn the light of these circumstances the Court was not prepared to disturb the finding with respect to negligence made by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], reversing a judgment of Riley J., dismissing an action against solicitors for professional negligence. Appeal allowed.\nW.R. Brennan, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nG.R. Forsyth, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an action for professional negligence brought by the respondent company against a firm of solicitors in Calgary in respect of the payment of certain funds of the respondent to one Arnoldussen.\nOn Thursday, July 17, 1958, R.W. Tiffin, who controlled and was the president of the respondent, attended at the office of the appellants along with Arnoldussen to consult Mr. T.W. Snowdon, a partner in the appellant firm. Snowdon was asked to represent the respondent in the preparation of a chattel mortgage on some industrial equipment, in the principal amount of $16,000, as security for a loan of $13,000 to be made by the respondent to Arnoldussen. A question arose as to the proper description of the equipment. Arnoldussen gave a serial number, which Snowdon checked, by telephone, which he learned could not be the proper number for equipment of the kind described. Arnoldussen then undertook to get the proper description the next day.\nSnowdon suggested to Tiffin that he go and actually examine the equipment\u2019s serial number and determine its existence, but was told that Tiffin did not have time and also that time was not available if Arnoldussen was to be accommodated. It was intimated to Snowdon that the matter of the loan to Arnoldussen was urgent, because he required the funds to accept an option before it expired on the following day. Later, according to Tiffin, the option was extended until Monday, July 21.\nArnoldussen told Snowdon that the location of the equipment was at Hinton, Alberta. This would necessitate registration of the chattel mortgage in Edmonton. He also gave the name of the company which he said was using the equipment. Snowdon telephoned to his agents in Edmonton, giving the information which he had obtained and asking them to check it.\nA further meeting occurred on the following day, Friday, July 18. At this time Arnoldussen gave the serial number of the equipment and referred to prior financing of the equipment by a finance company with an office in Calgary. Snowdon checked this information with the finance company by telephone, and was advised that they had financed equipment for Arnoldussen in the past of the kind described by him. This information was confirmed in writing by the company on Monday, July 21. The confirmation gave the serial number of the equipment and stated that a lien of $22,000 had been satisfactorily retired by the debtor.\nOn the Friday, the chattel mortgage was drawn and executed and was forwarded to the Edmonton agents for registration with a letter asking that it be ascertained that there was no prior encumbrance against it. Tiffin delivered to Snowdon the respondent\u2019s cheque for $13,000, payable to the appellant firm. Snowdon was instructed to deposit with the bank on which it was drawn a letter confirming the registration of the chattel mortgage in order to have it certified. The chattel mortgage was registered on Monday, July 21, and, after certification of the respondent\u2019s cheque, Snowdon delivered to Arnoldussen the appellant firm\u2019s cheque for $13,000. At that time he had received the written confirmation of information from the finance company. On the same day, in the late afternoon and subsequent to delivery of the cheque, Snowdon received a telegram from his Edmonton agents advising that they were unable to locate \u201cofficers of Pinto\u201d. This was the name of the \u2018company which, according to Arnoldussen, had been using the equipment.\nIt later transpired that the equipment was not at Hinton, and probably was not owned by Arnoldussen. The sum of $5,000 was collected by the respondent from him. The respondent sued the appellants for the balance of $8,000 advanced, and interest.\nThe action was dismissed by the learned trial judge, who pointed out that Snowdon had been advised by Tiffin that the transaction had to be completed by the Friday, later extended to the Monday; that Snowdon had advised Tiffin that there was no way of determining absolute ownership on the part of Arnoldussen; that Tiffin had been advised to make a personal inspection of the equipment, but did not do so; that Tiffin feared a possible claim by Arnoldussen if the moneys were not advanced within the time promised; that Snowdon did make inquiries and believed Arnoldussen owned the equipment; that Snowdon was never instructed not to pay over the money to Arnoldussen, but the matter was left to Snowdon\u2019s discretion, Tiffin\u2019s conduct throughout being one of indecision; and that Arnoldussen had sworn an affidavit as to his ownership of the equipment, clear of encumbrances. He held that Snowdon was not negligent in failing to anticipate criminal acts on the part of Arnoldussen.\nThis judgment was reversed on appeal[2]. The reasons for the decision of the Appellate Division are summarized in the following passages from the judgment:\nIn the instant case Tiffin stated he told the solicitor his concern about the integrity of Arnoldussen. A manager of an acceptance corporation to whom enquiries were directed by Tiffin stated he told the solicitor over the telephone \u201cto be extremely careful, make sure that the security involved in this deal exists and that Arnoldussen is in a position to give clear title to it\u201d. Arnoldussen at the first meeting had given false serial numbers for the equipment in question. There can be no doubt that the solicitor knew he was dealing with a possible rogue, as indeed Arnoldussen turned out to be.\n***\nIn a case such as this the solicitor should have anticipated that Arnoldussen might try to defraud the appellant (now respondent). The solicitor here was employed to prevent the very thing that happened. I do not think it is any defence to the solicitor that the acts of Arnoldussen were criminal.\nThe statement by Tiffin to Snowdon concerning Arnoldussen was said to have been made in a telephone conversation on the Friday morning, July 18. Concerning this conversation Tiffin gave the following answer on cross-examination:\nQ. But you never did tell Mr. Snowdon that you were concerned because of past experience with Mr. Arnoldussen as to Arnoldussen\u2019s integrity?\nA. I don\u2019t know if I said it in so many words but I think I said we should be very careful.\nIt is also important to note that it was after this conversation that the meeting occurred on Friday afternoon at which the arrangements for the loan were agreed upon. Whatever concern Tiffin may have had, he was quite prepared to proceed with the loan, to be made on Monday, July 21.\nThe telephone conversation with the manager of the acceptance company occurred after that meeting. It appears that subsequent to that meeting Tiffin telephoned a Mr. Forster in Lethbridge, the manager of an acceptance corporation, who says that he phoned Snowdon on Saturday morning, July 19, and told him to be absolutely sure the security was in existence and that Arnoldussen was in a position to give clear title to it.\nThe error as to the serial number has already been mentioned. However, Arnoldussen did, on the Friday, furnish the serial number which checked with that of the equipment which had been subject to the finance company lien.\nTiffin\u2019s evidence is that he had known Arnoldussen for three to four years and that he had had previous business dealings with him. It was he who brought Arnoldussen to Snowdon\u2019s office. This appears to have been the first time that Snowdon had met either of them, as the evidence shows that, on this occasion, Tiffin did not take the matter to the solicitor who usually looked after legal matters for him. It was indicated by Tiffin to Snowdon that the matter was urgent, as Arnoldussen required the funds promptly in order to accept an option.\nSnowdon\u2019s evidence is that the deal had been completed on the Friday, subject to the confirmation to be obtained from the finance company.\nThe learned trial judge, who heard all of the evidence, reached the conclusion that negligence could not be imputed to Snowdon for failing to anticipate Arnoldussen\u2019s criminal conduct. In my opinion, it was open to him, on the evidence, to reach this conclusion, and I do not think that it should be disturbed.\nThe Appellate Division has defined the terms of Snowdon\u2019s retainer in the terms of the following question put to Snowdon, and his answer to it, on cross-examination:\nQ. Now, sir, in summary do I understand it is your evidence that Mr. Tiffin on behalf of the plaintiff Tiffin Holdings Ltd. left it up to you as that company\u2019s solicitor to obtain and establish satisfactory proof of ownership before the funds were advanced as well as, of course, obtaining satisfactory proof of registration of the chattel mortgage?\nA. Yes, to my satisfaction, that is correct.\nThe words used by Snowdon are \u201cto my satisfaction\u201d and, in my view, the answer should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the other evidence. Snowdon had explained to Tiffin that it was impossible to obtain absolute proof of ownership of the equipment. His understanding of his duty was that he was to ascertain that there was a properly described piece of equipment, that he was to register a chattel mortgage against it, not subject to any prior encumbrance, and that if he had some evidence of ownership which he considered satisfactory the money could be released. He felt that the information from the finance company did constitute evidence of ownership, sufficient to satisfy him that, within the terms of his instructions, the money could be disbursed. He understood that the deal was completed on the Friday, subject to the confirmation from the finance company. In the light of these circumstances I would not be prepared to disturb the finding with respect to negligence made by the learned trial judge.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored. The appellants should be entitled to costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Howard, Bessemer, Moore, Dixon, Mackie & Forsyth, Calgary.\n[1] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 505, 53 D.L.R.

Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, [1967] S.C.R. 189\nDate: 1967-01-24\nPerini Pacific Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nGreater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District (Defendant) Respondent.\n1966: December 5, 6; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Building contract\u2014Action for damages brought by contractor\u2014Loss by way of overhead alleged to have been sustained because contract completion date extended by delays on part of owner\u2014Claim prevented by clause in contract.\nUnder a contract between the appellant and the respondent the appellant agreed to construct a sewage disposal plant within six hundred days next ensuing from the date of receiving notice from the respondent to proceed with the work. Pursuant to the provisions of the contract, the completion date, initially November 25, 1962, was extended to January 10, 1963. Various delays occurred in the course of the work, and the project was not completed before March 4, 1963.\nIn an action brought by the appellant against the respondent for damages the former alleged that it had been delayed in the construction by various breaches of the agreement by the respondent. The respondent counter-claimed for $53,000, the contract having stipulated for payment by the appellant of the sum of $1,000 per day for each day by which the putting into operation of the plant was delayed beyond the completion date.\nThe action was dismissed at trial and judgment was given in favour of the respondent on the counterclaim for the amount of $8,000. On appeal, the appellant\u2019s appeal was dismissed, save as to the counterclaim, the counterclaim being dismissed by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to this Court, the counterclaim was not in issue.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhat the appellant was seeking, in the way of damages, was compensation for loss which it claimed to have sustained, by way of overhead, because the contract completion date had been extended by reason of breaches of the contract by the respondent. This argument could not succeed by reason of a clause in the contract which read in part: \u201c\u2026the Contractor shall have no claim or right of action against the Corporation for damages, costs, expenses, loss of profits or otherwise\u2026by reason of any delay in the fulfilment of the contract within the time limited therefor occasioned by any cause or event within or without the Contractor\u2019s control, and whether or not such delay may have resulted from anything done or not done by the Corporation under this contract.\u201d\nThe appellant was seeking compensation for loss which it claimed to have sustained by reason of delay in the fulfilment of the contract within the time limited, and it was exactly that kind of loss which the above clause said could not be claimed even if it resulted from anything done or not done by the respondent under the contract.\nThe appellant also appealed from the decision of both Courts below in respect of a second action brought by the appellant against the respondent for holdback moneys alleged to be due under the contract. This action was consolidated with the first one. The Court agreed with the reasons given by Davey J.A. for holding that this claim failed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Collins J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.S. Maguire, Q.C., and K.S. Fawcus, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.M. Hayman and B.W.F. Fodchuk, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This action was brought by the appellant against the respondent for damages in respect of various alleged breaches by the respondent of a contract between them in which the appellant agreed to construct for the respondent a sewage disposal plant on Iona Island in the Fraser River. The appellant agreed to construct the plant within six hundred days next ensuing from the date of receiving notice from the respondent to proceed with the work. Pursuant to the provisions of the contract, the completion date, initially November 25, 1962, was extended to January 10, 1963. Various delays occurred in the course of the work, and it was common ground that the work was not completed before March 4, 1963.\nThe appellant alleged that it had been delayed in the construction by various breaches of the agreement by the respondent. The respondent counterclaimed for $53,000, the contract having stipulated for payment by the appellant of the sum of $1,000 per day for each day by which the putting into operation of the plant was delayed beyond the completion date.\nThe action was dismissed at trial and judgment was given in favour of the respondent on the counterclaim for the amount of $8,000. On appeal, the appellant\u2019s appeal was dismissed, save as to the counterclaim, the counterclaim being dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The counterclaim was not in issue before this Court.\nOn the argument before this Court, the number of breaches of contract which the appellant alleged to have occurred had been reduced to three. In each instance it was claimed that the appellant\u2019s work had been delayed, and the periods of delay claimed were 3\u00bd days, 14 days and 69 days respectively. In respect of the first item, the majority of the Court of Appeal held that delay had not been proven. With regard to the second, it was held unanimously that delay had not been proven. The Court found that the respondent had caused delay for a period of 12 days in respect of the third matter, but also held, in respect of this claim, that the appellant had not proved the resulting damage.\nThe damages in each case claimed by the appellant were for increased overhead costs resulting from the delays. The proof of its loss consisted in determining the average daily overhead costs for the entire period of the work, from commencement to conclusion. The loss for each period of delay was then said to consist of the number of days\u2019 delay multiplied by that average daily figure.\nThis was rejected by the trial judge and by all the members of the Court of Appeal. The position of the Courts below may be summarized in the following passage from the reasons of Bull J.A., in the Court of Appeal:\nThe quantum of these items claimed was arrived at by translating the respondent\u2019s fault into the number of days\u2019 delay caused thereby and multiplying the result by a daily average \u201coverhead\u201d (including indirect costs) over the lifetime of the whole construction period, such daily average being calculated by taking the total of those items of overhead and indirect costs incurred from the beginning of the work to its completion and dividing same by the number of the days in that period. Obviously, as found by the learned trial Judge, the overhead referred to continued for other works bearing no relevance to that in respect to which the delays occurred, and the appellant made no effort at all to establish that such overhead (whether in gross or daily average) was increased in any respect by, or had included therein, any amount that could be said to have been sustained either directly or indirectly by the breaches of contract of the respondent. This difficulty was brought to the attention of the appellant by the learned trial Judge during the trial, when he indicated that such daily average overhead claimed was no proof of any amount of loss sustained by the appellant through the delays caused by the respondent, and that he required some evidence of increases in overhead resulting therefrom. This evidence was not forthcoming, and in fact one witness for the appellant said it was not possible to break down the overhead and indirect cost figures to show what was allocatable to the respondent\u2019s breaches of contract. This same difficulty was raised by this Court on the appeal before us, and again we were not directed to any evidence to show any such attributable damage, the appellant maintaining throughout that it was entitled to damages on the basis of the daily average overhead for each day\u2019s delay caused by the respondent.\nWith deference, I am in agreement with what the learned trial Judge in effect held that an average daily overhead amount calculated on the total overhead over the whole construction period divided by the number of days of construction, was not in the circumstances of this case, a proper measure of damages.\nThe appellant\u2019s submission to this Court, in answer to these reasons, was stated in its factum, as follows:\nThe Appellant submits that once it has proved that the contract completion date has been extended by reason of a breach of contract by the Respondent, it is entitled to damages calculated on the basis advanced by the Appellant at the trial. The method adopted at the trial by the Appellant was to show the amount of all the items of expenses or costs for the whole construction period that were extended by the passage of time. To find the cost per day, the Appellant divided this total by the number of days in the construction period. The cost per day was found to be $738.47.\nThe Appellant submits that such a method is the only reasonable method of calculating the cost of the delay because the effect on cost of the breach of contract extends beyond the period in which the breach occurs. In any event, it is submitted that the method of calculation by the Appellant would have been acceptable to the learned Justices in the Courts below if they had appreciated that the result of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of contract caused delay in the overall completion of the contract, or in other words, increased the number of days required by the Appellant to complete the contract.\nThis contention makes it clear that what the appellant is seeking, in the way of damages, is compensation for loss which it claims to have sustained, by way of overhead, because the contract completion date had been extended by reason of breaches of the contract by the respondent.\nIn my opinion this argument cannot succeed in view of the provisions of clause 6-04 of the general conditions of the contract. This clause is one of a group of clauses headed \u201cPROSECUTION OF WORK\u201d and it reads as follows:\n6-04. No Claim against Corporation\nUnless otherwise particularly provided in the contract, the Contractor shall have no claim or right of action against the Corporation for damages, costs, expenses, loss of profits or otherwise howsoever because or by reason of any delay in the fulfilment of the contract within the time limited therefor occasioned by any cause or event within or without the Contractor\u2019s control, and whether or not such delay may have resulted from anything done or not done by the Corporation under this contract.\nThe opening words of the portion of the argument above quoted\u2014\u201conce it has proved that the contract completion date has been extended by reason of a breach of contract by the Respondent\u201d\u2014make it clear that what the appellant is seeking is compensation for loss which it claims to have sustained by reason of delay in the fulfilment of the contract within the time limited, and it is exactly that kind of loss which clause 6-04 says cannot be claimed even if it results from anything done or not done by the respondent under the contract.\nThe claim in respect of the last item of delay was in respect of the failure by the respondent promptly to furnish, and set on the foundations constructed under the contract, six engine generator units, which it was required to furnish under clause 7-05(2) of the specifications. These generators were supplied by a supplier, under contract with the respondent, and proved to be defective. This resulted in delay of the appellant\u2019s work while the necessary repairs were being made.\nThe specifications did not provide any specific date for furnishing them. It must be implied that they should be furnished within a reasonable time so as to permit the appellant to proceed with its work within the contract period. The respondent would, in my opinion, only be legally responsible for such delay in: performing this obligation as would prevent the appellant from completing its work within the stipulated period. But for loss occasioned by that kind of delay there can be no claim because of clause 6-04 of the general conditions.\nClause 6-04 was referred to in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge, but with no specific expression of opinion as to whether it was applicable. In the Court of Appeal, the majority held that it was not applicable, while Davey J.A. did not find it necessary to deal with it. Bull J.A. discusses its application in the following passage in his reasons:\nAs I have indicated earlier, it is not too clear from the learned trial Judge\u2019s reasons for judgment as to what importance he placed on the relieving provisions of article 6-04 of the General Conditions of the contract in dismissing the claims being discussed. As it is my view that the claim was properly dismissed on the grounds set out above, the question of whether it was barred by the provisions of the article need not be considered. However, should I be wrong in my conclusions, or a higher court should consider that nominal damages should have been awarded or a new assessment of damages had, I consider that it might be useful to express my views as to the proper construction of that article. Accordingly I have come to the conclusion that the respondent could not with respect to this particular claim, rely on these provisions. The relief to the respondent is only against damages (inter alia) \u201cbecause of or by reason of any delay in the fulfilment of the contract within the time limited therefor,\u201d notwithstanding that such delay may be the sole fault of the respondent. The claim for damages for the delay being considered has nothing to do with the revised contract completion date of January 10, 1963. It is damages for breach of contract and it is immaterial to that claim whether the contract was completed before, at or after the time limited for completion thereof. The relief given by the article does not purport to cover damages for any delay other than one involving the time limit for completion. Although of no relevance in this appeal, it would appear that the article was designed to and would protect the owner from any claim or set-off by a contractor for liquidated damages or penalties payable by it under an unrelieved completion clause when breach thereof was caused by the owner\u2019s actionable breach of contract; such situations have not been unusual.\nIn view of the position taken by the appellant before us, to which I have already referred, I am not able to agree that:\nThe claim for damages for the delay being considered has nothing to do with the revised contract completion date of January 10, 1963. It is damages for breach of contract and it is immaterial to that claim whether the contract was completed before, at or after the time limited for completion thereof.\nAs already indicated, my understanding of the appellant\u2019s position in respect of the claims urged before us is that, because the delays caused by the respondent extended the work period beyond the contract completion date, full overhead can be recovered for the number of days\u2019 delay which led to that result. I interpret clause 6-04 as preventing the making of that kind of claim. I understand this clause to mean that if the appellant complains that, because of causes or events outside its control, it has not been able to complete the contract within the contract period and has thereby incurred expense, it shall not be entitled to recover such expense from the respondent, even though the respondent had caused such delay.\nThe appellant also appealed from the decision of both Courts below in respect of a second action brought by the appellant against the respondent for payment of the holdback money. That action was consolidated with the other one. The nature of this claim is described in the following extract from the reasons of Davey J.A. and I agree with the reasons which he gives for holding that that claim fails:\nThe plaintiff commenced a second action to recover the holdback money. That action was consolidated with the first one. General condition 7-02 provides that the defendant shall pay the balance of the contract price to the plaintiff 40 days after presentation of the engineer\u2019s certificate that he has accepted the work, and upon delivery by the plaintiff of, inter alia, releases of all its claims and demands under the contract or in connection with its subject matter. The delivery of such a release and payment of the holdback money are thus to be concurrent acts. The plaintiff delivered only a qualified release, which reserved all its claims in respect of the specific matters that have been litigated. The defendant refused to accept it. The learned trial Judge held that since the disputes had not been adjudged until after the second writ had issued and the plaintiff had not delivered or tendered an unqualified release, the cause of action for the holdback money was not complete when the second writ was issued. He dismissed that action, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s bringing a new one when its cause of action was complete. The plaintiff appeals. I agree with the reasoning of the learned trial Judge. The intention of the provision seems to be that if the plaintiff does not release all outstanding claims, and wants to litigate some of them, it cannot get the holdback money until it has done so. So, if the defendant is harassed by expensive litigation, it will have security through the holdback money for its taxed costs if successful. That provision may seem harsh\u2014I do not say it is\u2014or unnecessary with respect to this plaintiff, but that is no ground upon which to relieve the plaintiff from the plain meaning of an otherwise lawful provision by which it has bound itself: Roberts v. Bury Commissioners, (1870) L.R. 5 C.P. 310 at pp. 325 and 326. I would dismiss this part of the appeal.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark & Maguire, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\n",

The invention concerned an apparatus and method for treating polyethylene film so as to make its surface ink-adherent. The plaintiffs alleged a date of invention by Traver, under whom they claim, in late May or early June 1949. The defendant Union Carbide Corporation alleged a date of invention by Adams and Wakefield, under whom it claims, not later than May 3, 1950. The trial judge held, inter alia, that by May 3, 1950, Traver had not made the invention, and in the result dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action and allowed in part the counterclaim of the defendant Union Carbide. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. The finding of the trial judge that by May 3, 1950, the invention in question had been made by Adams and Wakefield was not seriously challenged before this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge was right in holding that by May 3, 1950, Traver had not made the invention. The onus of proof that Traver had made the invention and the date by which he had made it was upon Traver not only because he was asserting an affirmative but also because all the subject matter of these allegations lay particularly within his knowledge. In so far as the judgment at trial deals with the dates on which Traver obtained successful results, even empirically, the trial judge did not believe his testimony or that of those witnesses who sought to support it. The trial judge was justified in rejecting Traver\u2019s evidence. The finding of fact as to the priority of invention made by the trial judge should not be disturbed.\nBrevets\u2014Conflit de demandes\u2014Date d\u2019invention\u2014Priorit\u00e9 de l\u2019invention\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 45(8).\nConform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 45(8) de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, la pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e en vue de d\u00e9terminer les droits des parties relativement \u00e0 leurs demandes pour brevets, en suspens, contenant des revendications que le Commissaire des Brevets a jug\u00e9 \u00eatre en conflit.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an action on conflicting applications for patents. Appeal dismissed.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and R.G. McClenahan, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nHarold G. Fox, Q.C., and Donald F. Sim, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment1 of Gibson J. pronounced on February 18, 1965, in an action brought pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, as amended, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d, for the determination of the rights of the parties in respect of their pending applications for patent containing claims which were found by the Commissioner of Patents to be in conflict.\nThe claims in conflict were numbered C-1 to C-94 inclusive and C-107; they are set out in Schedule B to the reasons of the learned trial judge. After the procedure prescribed by subsections 1 to 7 of s. 45 of the Act had been followed neither of the parties was satisfied with the determination made by the Commissioner and this action followed in which the appellant, E.I. Dupont de Nemours and Company, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDupont\u201d, in its Statement of Claim and the respondent Union Carbide Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cUnion Carbide\u201d, in its counter-claim each asserts that it is entitled to the claims.\nThe respondent Celanese Corporation of America was a defendant in the action but did not appear in the Exchequer Court and the appellants obtained a default judgment against it on April 16, 1964. It takes no part in this appeal.\nThe main issue between the parties is who, as between George W. Traver (under whom the appellants claim) on the one hand and George M. Adams and Sidney J. Wakefield (under whom the respondent Union Carbide claims) on the other hand, was the first to invent an apparatus and method for treating polyethylene film so as to make its surface ink-adherent.\nPrior to 1949 polyethylene film became available in substantial quantities and was widely used as a wrapping material, especially for foods. Its suitability for this purpose was lessened because printing or decoration would not adhere to the film. This created a problem for the whole industry. The invention which is in dispute between the parties furnishes a solution of this problem.\nThe two pending applications which were placed in conflict by the Commissioner were Serial number 650,205 filed by George Traver on July 2, 1953, all rights in which were assigned to the appellant Dupont and Serial number 627,046 filed by the respondent Union Carbide on February 18, 1952, based on an invention made by Adams and Wakefield. The respondent Union Carbide alleges a date of invention by Adams and Wakefield not later than May 3, 1950. The finding of the learned trial judge that by that date the invention in question had been made by Adams and Wakefield is amply supported by the evidence and was not seriously challenged; but the appellants contend that Traver had already made the invention in late May or early June, 1949.\nThe learned trial judge decided that Union Carbide was entitled to the issue of a patent of invention on its application Serial number 627,046 containing claims C-3, C-6, C-9, C-12, C\u201187, C-88, C-89, C-92 and C-93. Each of these claims describes the treatment of polyethylene by exposing its surface to a high voltage electrical stress accompanied by corona discharge to render the surface adherent to subsequently imprinted ink impressions. The disposition made of the other claims in conflict will be referred to later.\nThe finding of the learned trial judge as to what constitutes the invention is expressed as follows:\nDealing first with the invention, I find, on a consideration of the whole of the evidence that the invention was the discovery that the phenomenon which made polyethylene film receptive to ink so the ink adhered to the film was produced by exposing the polyethylene film to a form of electrical discharge; and that the form of this discharge which is essential to the process is aptly described as corona discharge.\nThe corona discharge that I refer to is the term used in its colloquial meaning, and not in its classical meaning, as discussed in the evidence. I find that most experts in the field at all material times used and at present use the term corona discharge in its colloquial meaning to describe the phenomenon which produces the successful result in this matter. In this sense the words \u201ccorona discharge\u201d are used in these reasons, and this use of the words \u201ccorona discharge\u201d correctly describes the material phenomenon which is referred to in the relevant specifications and claims in issue and in the evidence adduced in this action.\nElsewhere in the reasons of the learned trial judge it is explained that the colloquial meaning of the words \u201ccorona discharge\u201d as used in this passage and throughout his reasons, is a form of electrostatic discharge producing a corona which is a physical manifestation resulting when a gas, usually air, has been stressed until a condition is maintained wherein some ionization of the gas is present and oxygen molecular re-arrangement takes place forming ozone, the presence of which may be detected by its pungent odour; a purplish discharge or glow may be seen under reduced light in the vicinity of the metallic parts charged and a sound described as a crackling or frying noise is heard.\nAt the trial and before us counsel for both parties demonstrated the way in which the process works by the use of an apparatus, set up in the Court room, illustrating the fundamental equipment employed to give the necessary treatment to polyethylene film. As was stated by the learned trial judge many variations of this equipment may be devised to produce the desired result and the apparatus demonstrated to us was merely illustrative of the kind of apparatus which may be used for that purpose. It consisted of two electrodes, the first being an oxy-dry tube, that is a glass tube filled with argon gas, and the second being a conductive metal plate placed below the oxy-dry tube and at a distance from it of one-eighth of an inch. Both electrodes were connected to a source of electric current derived from that supplied to the Court room, said to be about 110 volts, and stepped up by means of a transformer to 10,000 volts. The film to be treated was placed on the metal plate and when the current was turned on a corona discharge as described above took place between the two electrodes. It was common ground that this accomplished the desired treatment of the film. As the invention was developed for production of treated polyethylene film on a commercial basis a metal roller was substituted for the metal plate as the second electrode and instead of a single oxy\u2011dry tube several of such tubes were used as the first electrode.\nThe first question which we have to determine is whether the learned trial judge was right in holding that by May 3, 1950, Traver had not made the invention.\nTraver was a witness at the trial and was examined and cross-examined at great length. He testified that the idea of the invention came into his mind early in 1949 and that in May or June of 1949 he caused a printing machine known as a Meisel Press used by Traver Corporation (of which he was an officer and which he controlled) to be equipped with oxy-dry tubes and adapted so that by its use polyethylene film could be, and was, successfully treated. On conflicting evidence, including that of the witness Stopp, who had been the designer of the Meisel Press and stated that it would not be practicable to adapt it in the manner described by Traver, the learned trial judge rejected Travel\u2019s evidence on this point. He concluded his review of the relevant evidence as follows:\nIn my opinion, therefore, the story that successful treatment was had be employing the Meisel Press as told by Traver is not true and I so find.\nTraver also gave evidence that in or about June, 1949, he caused Fred J. Pool, an employee of Traver Corporation, and Arthur Groh, the superintendent of the production department, to set up an apparatus substantially similar to that which was used in the demonstration before the Court, that the gap between the electrodes was one-eighth of an inch, that a current of 10,000 volts was used and that polyethylene film was successfully treated. This apparatus was sometimes referred to in argument as \u201cTraver\u2019s one-tube set-up\u201d.\nTraver went on to state that he thereupon directed Pool to build an apparatus similar to the one-tube set-up by using eight tubes instead of one and a metal foil instead of a plate as the second electrode and that this apparatus also treated the film successfully. This apparatus was referred to as \u201cthe multiple-tube set-up\u201d.\nNeither of these two apparatuses was produced at the trial. Traver said that they had been taken apart and were no longer in existence but that reproductions of both of them had been made in 1955, which was after the controversy between the parties had developed, and photographs of these reproductions were filed as exhibits at the trial.\nTraver said that having obtained successful results with these two machines he instructed Pool to adapt a machine known as a Cameron slitter so that it could be used to treat polyethylene film. The Cameron slitter was used for cutting rolls of paper or film into strips and was adapted for slitting film from a master roll into smaller rolls and rewinding these on separate shafts in such a way as to prevent them from intertwining. When in operation it caused a roll of film on a master band to pass over and under certain rollers before it was rewound.\nTraver said he told Pool to take the knives out of the Cameron slitter and install a bank of several oxy-dry tubes on the top roller so placed that they would be about one- eighth of an inch from the metal roller immediately below with the result that the tubes on the top rollers would correspond to the first electrode and the metal roller below them would correspond to the second electrode in the apparatus which was used in the demonstration before us.\nTraver said that the Cameron slitter was successfully adapted in this way in about September 1949, that he received a letter from Pool regarding it in February 1950, that he himself saw it in operation in April 1950 and that it was used intermittently from as early as February 1950 until early in 1951 to render treated polyethylene film available in commercial quantities, the reason that it was used only intermittently for this purpose being that it was required to carry out the work for which it was designed that is the slitting of film or other material. It was said that the task of adapting it from one form of operation to the other was a simple one which did not take up a great deal of time. It was said that in 1951 an apparatus was built and used exclusively to treat polyethylene film on a commercial basis and presumably thereafter it was unnecessary to make use of the Cameron slitter for this purpose.\nIt was sought to strengthen the appellants\u2019 case in regard to the matters of fact set out in the three preceding paragraphs by the production of certain \u201cjob pockets\u201d. Evidence was given that the procedure at Traver Corporation was to make an envelope described as a job pocket for each order filled, to place in it a sample of the product sold to the customer and to note on the outside of the pocket information as to the name of the customer, the date of the order, the colour specification, bag size and date of shipment. It was said that polyethylene film successfully treated on the Cameron slitter was sold commercially in March 1950 and samples of treated film and the job pockets in which they were said to have been located were produced at the trial and filed as exhibits.\nThese job pockets were not retained by Traver. They with other records of Traver Corporation were turned over to Container Corporation which purchased certain assets of Traver Corporation. They were said to have been found by one Kritchever when he searched the records at the premises of Container Corporation on the instructions of Mr. Dawson who was patent attorney for Traver.\nIt will be observed that, as is not unnatural, all the evidence in support of the date of invention claimed by Traver was as to matters in the knowledge of the appellants and as to which the respondent had no means of knowledge.\nIn his elaborate reasons the learned trial judge examined in great detail the evidence which I have endeavoured to summarize briefly above, as to what, if anything, Traver invented and when he invented it and reached the conclusion that he expressed as follows:\nThe only conclusion therefore that can be reached is that Traver did not nor did anyone under his direction cause to be formulated verbally or in writing a description which afforded the means of making that which Traver alleged he invented, at least up to October 17, 1950.\nIt is a proper conclusion to find that up to that date Traver and the others under his direction were experimenting. But now, in retrospect Traver is saying that he used the oxy-dry tube, 10,000 volts and \u215b\u2033 spacing set-up to get successful treatment and disclosed it, because he now knows that that particular set-up will produce successful treatment, in that corona discharge will be present.\nBut it is clear that all the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs (Traver) was directed to the attempt to prove that sometime early in 1950, and at least prior to the alleged material date of Adams and Wakefield (defendant Union Carbide), namely, May 3, 1950, that Traver successfully treated polyethylene film so as to make it ink\u2011adherent using a process in which the phenomenon of corona discharge was present and that he knew and disclosed this factor as the critical one, and disclosed both verbally and in writing a description which afforded the means of making that which was invented.\nThe attempt was not successful.\nCertainly, neither Traver nor anyone acting under Traver\u2019s directions discovered at least until after October 17, 1950, that isolating corona discharge as the critical factor was the invention.\nI therefore find that the evidence adduced by and on behalf of Traver did not establish that Traver at any time was the inventor of the treatment process involving the phenomenon of corona discharge; and as stated, that alone is the invention which is the subject of these proceedings. Indeed, the evidence adduced by and on behalf of Traver affirmatively established that he was not the inventor of this treatment process.\nCounsel for the appellants do not merely attack this finding as not supported by the evidence; they submit that its wording and that of other passages in the reasons of the learned judge shew that he was mistaken in law in the tests which he applied in determining whether or not Traver was the first inventor. They argue that on the evidence it should be found that prior to the making of the invention by Adams and Wakefield, Traver and his assistants had actually constructed an apparatus which would, and did, produce corona discharge and which treated polyethylene film successfully. Their argument proceeds that the learned trial judge mistakenly held that Traver had not made the invention merely because he did not describe its operation as producing corona discharge and did not discover that any discharge within the corona range would give effective treatment.\nIn support of the submission set out in the last sentence the appellants rely on the judgment of Thorson P. in Ernest Scragg & Sons Ltd. v. Leesona Corporation[2], and particularly the following passage at pages 676 and 677, where the learned President quoted the following statement from the judgment of this Court in Christiani and Nielsen v. Rice[3]:\nThe holding here, therefore, is that by the date of discovery of the invention is meant the date at which the inventor can prove he has first formulated, either in writing or verbally, a description which affords the means of making that which is invented. There is no necessity of a disclosure to the public.\nand continued:\nIt was not intended, in my opinion, that the test laid down in the statement should be all\u2011inclusive. It is clear, of course, that if an inventor can prove that he formulated a description of his invention, either in writing or verbally, at a certain date then he must have made the invention at least as early as that date. It is also clear that the requirement that there must be proof of the formulation of a description of the invention, either in writing or verbally, is neither apt nor necessary in the case of an invention of an apparatus where the inventor can prove that at the asserted date he had actually made the apparatus itself, although there was no formulation of a written or oral description of it. Nor was it intended that the test laid down in the statement should replace the general statement in the Permuti v. Borrowman case (supra) that before a man can be said to have invented a process he must have reduced the idea of it to a definite and practical shape. Consequently, even although the test of proof of the formulation of a description of the invention, either in writing or verbally, at a particular date might be appropriate in determining the date of an invention of a process, it cannot have been intended to exclude proof that the process was actually used at the asserted date, even although there was no formulation of a written or oral description of it at such date. Thus the statement in Christiani v. Rice case (supra) to which I have referred should not be interpreted as laying down a rule that proof that an invention was made at an asserted date must be confined to evidence that a written or oral description of it had been formulated at such date. It may also be proved, in the case of an invention of an apparatus, that the apparatus was made at such date, or in the case of an invention of a process, that the process was used at such date. The essential fact to be proved is that at the asserted date the invention was no longer merely an idea that floated through the inventor\u2019s brain but had been reduced to a definite and practical shape. The statement to which I have referred should be construed accordingly.\nThe argument proceeds that if in fact Traver and his assistants had, prior to the date of the invention by Adams and Wakefield, adapted the Cameron slitter and successfully treated polyethylene film with it, in the manner described by Traver in his evidence, then he would have been the first inventor of that apparatus and process, because he would have actually made an apparatus which worked and afforded a solution to the problem which was baffling the industry. He would not, in the supposed circumstances, have been any the less the first inventor because he neither identified the electrostatic discharge created during the operation of the machine as \u201ccorona discharge\u201d nor realized that successful treatment could be obtained regardless of any variation of the arrangement of the component parts of the apparatus and of the voltage used so long as corona discharge resulted. He would have attained the desired result empirically.\nI do not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion as to the validity in law of this argument because in my view it fails on the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. As I understand his reasons, he has stated that the appellants have failed to satisfy him that Traver had done, even empirically, what the invention does until some time after the complete invention had been made by Adams and Wakefield. The learned trial judge in no way exaggerates the onus that lay upon Traver at the trial to prove that he had made the invention and the date by which he had made it. The onus of proof of these matters was upon Traver not only because he was asserting an affirmative but also because all the subject matter of these allegations lay particularly within his knowledge. It was still however the onus in a civil case and the learned trial judge so instructed himself. In speaking of the conflicting evidence of certain experts he says:\nThe Court is left with the usual legal standard of proof, namely, more probably than not, or as it is sometimes put, the preponderance of believable evidence. And this was the test employed in reaching the conclusions in these reasons where it was necessary to resolve any conflict in such expert testimony.\nand later he speaks of examining:\n(a) the oral or verbal evidence adduced at this trial, and\n(b) the written evidence,\nfor the purpose of determining what credible evidence was adduced to the satisfaction of the Court to enable it to make a finding on the balance of probabilities as to issue of priority of invention.\nFrom a reading of the whole of his reasons it appears to me that the learned trial judge found himself unable to believe the evidence of Traver and those witnesses who, to some extent, supported his story. I have already quoted at some length from those reasons and now repeat one of the paragraphs quoted because it appears to me to contain a clear indication of the view which the learned trial judge took as to the trustworthiness of Traver.\nIt is a proper conclusion to find that up to that date (October 17, 1950), Traver and the others under his direction were experimenting. But now, in retrospect Traver is saying that he used the oxy-dry tube, 10,000 volts and \u215b\u2033 spacing set-up to get successful treatment and disclosed it, because he now knows that that particular set-up will produce successful treatment, in that corona discharge will be present.\nA little later in his reasons the learned trial judge says:\nI have also taken into consideration that it may be that Traver, without any knowledge of what any other inventor was doing, sometime in 1950, after the month of October, did discover that successful treatment could be had by employing the Cameron slitter process, Exhibit 42, providing a \u215b\u2033 gap was used (although there is some doubt that there was any precise knowledge or understanding that the width of the gap was critical using this particular apparatus.)\nThe significant words in this passage are those which I have italicized.\nIf, as argued for the appellant, the learned trial judge was of the view that even if Travel\u2019s evidence as to the successful treatment of film by use of the \u201cone-tube setup\u201d, \u201cthe multiple tube set-up\u201d and the adapted Cameron slitter were accepted, Traver still could not be held to be the first inventor by reason of his failure to identify corona discharge as the essential element in the process, then it would have been unnecessary for the learned judge to consider the evidence as to the job pockets. He does, however, examine this evidence with care and reaches the conclusion which he expresses as follows: On this evidence, I find it is impossible to believe that the Cameron slitter was employed to give successful treatment on any commercial production basis during the year 1950 or that the plastic bags allegedly found in these so-called job pockets were actually in these pockets since 1950 or were from a production run of plastic bags successfully treated by the Cameron slitter in 1950.\nIt may be said that if the learned trial judge disbelieved the evidence of Traver it was unnecessary for him to examine in detail the evidence as to exactly what constituted the invention and what disclosure and claims were made by the parties in regard to it; it is true that this examination would scarcely seem to have been necessary on the sole question of who was the first inventor but it did become relevant to the question of whether the respondent was entitled to a patent and, if so, what claims it should contain.\nWhen the learned trial judge was discussing the nature and extent of the discovery made by Adams and Wakefield he said:\nOn the evidence I find that it was not obvious or natural on March 21, 1950, after the first successful result was obtained, to discover and isolate the corona that was present as the element and the only element that would produce successful treatment of polyethylene film.\nThis discovery which taught that successful treatment could be accomplished by using one of the many combinations of electrodes, dielectrics, spacing and voltage so long as corona discharge was present, was genius and invention of the highest order. And it is not detracted from in the least by the fact that Mr. Traver or some other person employed or acting for him or Traver Corporation or independently, may have obtained without knowing why, even before March 21, 1950 (which, as stated above, I do not find) successful treatment of polyethylene film by using the particular combination of an oxy\u2011dry tube, 10,000-volt transformer, and a \u215b\u2033 spacing and confined solely to such combination, while not recognizing that corona discharge was the essential feature of the invention.\nThe words in the parenthesis which I have italicized strengthen the view which I have formed that in so far as it deals with the dates on which Traver attained successful results, even empirically, the learned trial judge simply did not believe his testimony or that of those witnesses who sought to support it.\nPriority of invention is primarily a question of fact, and, while it is unnecessary to quote authority as to the duty of an appellate court which is asked to interfere with the findings of fact made by a trial judge who has seen and heard the witnesses on whose testimony the findings are based, the following words in the speech of Lord Wright in Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home[4] appear to be peculiarly applicable to this appeal:\nTwo principles are beyond controversy. First it is clear that in an appeal of this character, that is from the decision of a trial judge based on his opinion of the trustworthiness of witnesses whom he has seen, the J. Court of Appeal \u2018must, in order to reverse, not merely entertain doubts whether the decision below is right, but be convinced that it is wrong\u2019. And secondly the Court of Appeal has no right to ignore what facts the judge has found on his impression of the credibility of the witnesses and proceed to try the case on paper on its own view of the probabilities as if there had been no oral hearing.\nAttention has already been called to the circumstance that all the evidence on which Traver sought to obtain a finding in his favour to the effect that he had made the invention prior to Adams and Wakefield was as to matters particularly within his knowledge and as to which the respondent would normally have no means of contradicting him.\nIn considering whether the learned trial judge was justified in rejecting that evidence the following matters may be borne in mind. At the trial Traver told a story as to obtaining successful treatment of film by adapting the Meisel press which story the learned trial judge found to be untrue. It was shewn that in other proceedings relating to the same invention Traver had sworn to a statement as to the date of his invention which was false in fact and the learned trial judge rejected the explanation put forward in an endeavour to shew that this was done innocently. None of the apparatuses with which Traver claimed to have attained the successful result were preserved. Neither Traver nor any of his employees kept any log or systematic record of their experiments with the process. The samples of treated film said to have been marketed early in 1950 were not retained by Traver or Traver Corporation but, as has already been mentioned, were turned over with other records to Container Corporation.\nWhile none of these matters may be of vital importance their cumulative effect adds to the difficulties in the way of the appellants\u2019 argument that we should reverse the finding of fact of the learned trial judge on the decisive question whether Traver had made any invention prior to the date on which Adams and Wakefield had completed their discovery. I have reached the conclusion that we cannot disturb that finding of fact and since it follows from it that Traver was not the first inventor of anything with which this appeal is concerned the appeal fails.\nThe proceedings at trial involved a large number of claims which had been placed in conflict in addition to those as to which the learned trial judge held that the respondent was entitled to the issue of a patent but I do not find it necessary to deal with the disposition made of those other claims as there is no cross-appeal and the respondent simply seeks to support the judgment at trial.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 2 Ex.

Dworkin Furs (Pembroke) Ltd. et al., [1967] S.C.R. 223\nDate: 1967-01-24\nThe Minister of National Revenue (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nDworkin Furs (Pembroke) Limited, Allied Business Supervisions Limited, Alpine Dry Wall & Decorating Limited, M.F. Esson & Sons Limited, Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited (Defendants) Respondents.\n1966: November 15, 16, 17; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Fauteux, Abbott, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Associated corporations\u2014What constitutes \u201ccontrol\u201d\u2014Casting vote\u2014Validity of Articles of Association requiring unanimous consent for motions before meetings of shareholders or directors\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 39.\nThe five respondent companies were assessed by the Minister on the basis that each was associated with one or more other companies within the meaning of s. 39(2), (3) and (4) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and was therefore not entitled to the benefit of the lower rate of tax on part of its income. The issue in all five cases was the meaning of \u201ccontrolled\u201d as found in s. 39(4) of the Act. The Exchequer Court rejected the Minister\u2019s assessment. The Minister appealed to this Court where it was ordered that the 5 appeals be heard together. In the Dworkin appeal, another company owned 48 per cent of the shares in its own name and 2 per cent in the names of Roy and Helen Saipe as its nominees. The other 50 per cent were owned by a third party. Roy Saipe was president of Dworkin but did not have a casting vote in the event of an equality of votes.\nIn the Allied appeal, one Aaron owned 50 per cent of the shares and, as president, had the right to exercise a second or casting vote in the event of an equality of votes.\nIn the Alpine Drywall appeal, one Jager owned 50 per cent of the shares and the other 50 per cent were owned by one Wagenaar. The latter attended the day-to-day operation of the business and Jager, as president, was responsible for the financing, etc. and had a casting vote.\nIn the M.F. Esson appeal, that company was controlled by the Esson family who also owned 50 per cent of the shares of another company. The other 50 per cent were owned by an individual who had been appointed general manager with exclusive authority and who had been given an option, exercisable some 3 years later, to buy the Esson family\u2019s shares. In the meantime, the senior Esson was president of that other company and had a casting vote in the event of an equality of votes.\nIn the Aaron appeal, a group held two-thirds of the shares but a provision in the company\u2019s Articles of Association required all motions put before any meeting of shareholders or directors to have unanimous consent. In the Minister\u2019s view that provision was illegal and ultra vires.\nHeld: The appeals by the Minister should be dismissed. None of the five respondent companies was an associated corporation.\nIn the Dworkin appeal, it was clear, in the light of Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299, which held that \u201ccontrolled\u201d meant de jure control and not de facto control, that the respondent was not controlled by the other company.\nIn the Allied appeal, as was held by the trial judge, a casting vote was not the property of the holder but an adjunct of an office. That right did not give control.\nThe Alpine Drywall and M.F. Esson appeals did not differ from that of the Allied appeal.\nIn the Aaron appeal, the Article in question was neither illegal nor ultra vires. It is beyond question that a majority may bind the minority in a company. A contract between shareholders to vote in a given or agreed way is not illegal. The Articles of Association are in effect an agreement between the shareholders and are binding upon all shareholders.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Corporations associ\u00e9es\u2014Contr\u00f4le\u2014Voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante\u2014Validit\u00e9 de r\u00e8glements exigeant le consentement unanime pour les motions devant les assembl\u00e9es d\u2019actionnaires ou de directeurs\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 39.\nLe Ministre a cotis\u00e9 les 5 compagnies intim\u00e9es comme si chacune \u00e9tait associ\u00e9e avec une ou plusieurs autres compagnies dans le sens de Fart.39(2), (3) et (4) de la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148,et n\u2019avait pas alors droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du taux d\u2019imp\u00f4t moindre sur une partie de son revenu. Il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer dans ces 5 appels le sens qu\u2019il faut donner au mot \u00abcontr\u00f4le\u00bb tel qu\u2019il se trouve dans l\u2019art. 39(4) de la Loi. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a rejet\u00e9 la cotisation du Ministre. Ce dernier en appela devant cette Cour alors qu\u2019il fut ordonn\u00e9 que les 5 appels soient entendus ensemble.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Dworkin, une autre compagnie d\u00e9tenait 48 pour-cent des actions de Dworkin en son propre nom et 2 pour-cent au nom de Roy et Helen Saipe en qualit\u00e9 de personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. L\u2019autre 50 pour-cent \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu par une tierce personne. Roy Saipe \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident de Dworkin mais n\u2019avait pas une voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante en cas de partage des votes.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Allied, un nomm\u00e9 Aaron d\u00e9tenait 50 pour-cent des actions et, comme pr\u00e9sident, avait le droit d\u2019exercer une voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante en cas de partage des votes.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Alpine Drywall, un nomm\u00e9 Jager d\u00e9tenait 50 pour-cent des actions et l\u2019autre 50 pour-cent \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu par un nomm\u00e9 Wagenaar. Ce dernier s\u2019occupait des affaires journali\u00e8res et Jager, comme pr\u00e9sident, \u00e9tait responsable du financement, etc. et avait une voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante en cas de partage des votes.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie M.F. Esson, cette compagnie \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par la famille Esson qui d\u00e9tenait 50 pour-cent des actions d\u2019une autre, compagnie. L\u2019autre 50 pour-cent \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu par un individu qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral avec autorit\u00e9 exclusive et \u00e0 qui on avait donn\u00e9 une option, dont l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tait rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 quelque 3 ans plus tard, d\u2019acheter les actions de la famille Esson. Entre temps, Esson le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident de cette autre compagnie et avait une voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante en cas de partage des votes.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Aaron, les deux-tiers des actions \u00e9taient d\u00e9tenus par un groupe mais, une clause dans les r\u00e8glements de la compagnie exigeait l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 pour toute motion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e des actionnaires ou des directeurs. Le Ministre consid\u00e9ra cette clause comme \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gale et ultra vires.\nArr\u00eat: Les appels du Ministre doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s. Aucune des 5 compagnies intim\u00e9es \u00e9tait une corporation associ\u00e9e.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Dworkin, il est clair, vu la cause de Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299, qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quele mot \u00abcontr\u00f4le\u00bb signifiait un contr\u00f4le de jure et non pas un contr\u00f4le de facto, que la compagnie intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par l\u2019autre compagnie.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Allied, tel que d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s, une vois pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante n\u2019est pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son d\u00e9tenteur mais est un accessoire d\u2019un office. Ce droit ne donne pas le contr\u00f4le.\nLes appels de la compagnie Alpine Drywall et de la compagnie M. F. Esson ne diff\u00e8rent pas de l\u2019appel de la compagnie Allied.\nDans l\u2019appel de la compagnie Aaron, le r\u00e8glement en question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ill\u00e9gal ni ultra vires. Il n\u2019y a aucun doute qu\u2019une majorit\u00e9 peut lier la minorit\u00e9 dans une compagnie. Un contrat entre les actionnaires pour voter d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re n\u2019est pas ill\u00e9gal. Les r\u00e8glements d\u2019une compagnie sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une entente entre les actionnaires et lient tous les actionnaires. APPELS de 5 jugements de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1]. Appels rejet\u00e9s.\nAPPEALS from 5 judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada1. Appeals dismissed.\nG.W. Ainslie and L.R. Olson, for the appellant.\nC.S. Bergh, for the respondent, Dworkin Furs (Pembroke) Ltd.\nR.B. Slater and A. Anhang, for the respondent, Allied Business Supervisions Ltd.\nR.A.F. Montgomery, for the respondent, Alpine Dry-wall & Decorating Ltd.\nG.B. Cooper, for the respondent, M.F. Esson & Sons Ltd.\nR.B. Slater and A. Anhang, for the respondent, Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Ltd.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014These are appeals by the Minister of National Revenue from judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada in the following cases:\nDworkin Furs (Pembroke) Limited v. M.N.R.;\nAaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited v. M.N.R.;\nAllied Business Supervisions Limited v. M.N.R.;\nAlpine Drywall & Decorating Limited v. M.N.R.;\nM.F. Esson & Sons Limited v. M.N.R.\nIn the Exchequer Court the appeals of Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited and Allied Business Supervisions Limited were heard together at Winnipeg by Thurlow J. along with appeals from eight other companies. The appeal of Alpine Drywall & Decorating Limited was heard in Calgary in conjunction with that of another company by Cattanach J. The appeal of Dworkin Furs (Pembroke) Limited was heard in Ottawa by Jackett P. and the appeal of M.F. Esson & Sons Limited was heard at Moncton by Thurlow J. The present appeal concerns the five named respondents only.\nBy Order of this Court dated September 20, 1966, the appeals of the Minister of National Revenue against the five named respondents were ordered to be heard together and the appellant was granted leave to file a joint factum applicable to all five appeals. At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the Court said:\nFor reasons which will be delivered later, the appeal in each of the above cases, except in the case of Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited, is dismised with costs; with respect to the appeal in the latter case, the only points on which the Court needs to hear counsel for respondent are related to Article 6 of the Articles of Association, the Court desiring to have submissions of counsel as to the validity and effect of Article 6.\nThe issue in all five appeals is the meaning of \u201ccontrolled\u201d as found in subs. (4) of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act. Subsection (1) of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act provides that the tax payable by a corporation under Part 1 of the Income Tax Act is 18 per cent of the first $35,000 taxable income and 47 per cent of the amount by which the income subject to tax exceeds $35,000. However, subss. (2) and (3) of s. 39 provide that when two or more corporations are \u201cassociated\u201d with each other, the aggregate of the amount of their incomes taxable at 18 per cent is not to exceed $35,000. Subsection (4) of s. 39 of the Income Tax Act then defines the circumstances under which a corporation is associated with another corporation. Subsection (4) of s. 39 provides in part:\nFor the purpose of this section, one corporation is associated with another in a taxation year if at any time in the year,\n(a) one of the corporations controlled the other,\n(b) both of the corporations were controlled by the same person or group of persons,\n* * *\nThe word controlled as used in this subsection was held by Jackett P. to mean de jure control and not de facto control and with this I agree. He said in Buckerfield\u2019s Limited et al v. Minister of National Revenue[2]:\nMany approaches might conceivably be adopted in applying the word \u201ccontrol\u201d in a statute such as the Income Tax Act to a corporation. It might, for example, refer to control by \u201cmanagement\u201d, where management and the Board of Directors are separate, or it might refer to control by the Board of Directors. The kind of control exercised by management officials or the Board of Directors is, however, clearly not intended by section 39 when it contemplates control of one corporation by another as well as control of a corporation by individuals (see subsection (6) of section 39). The word \u201ccontrol\u201d might conceivably refer to de facto control by one or more shareholders whether or not they hold a majority of shares. I am of the view, however, that, in section 39 of the Income Tax Act, the word \u201ccontrolled\u201d contemplates the right of control that rests in ownership of such a number of shares as carries with it the right to a majority of the votes in the election of the Board of Directors. See British American Tobacco Co. v. I.R.C. (1943) 1 A.E.R. 13 where Viscount Simon L.C., at p. 15, says:\n\u201cThe owners of the majority of the voting power in a company are the persons who are in effective control of its affairs and fortunes.\u201d\nSee also Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights\u2019 Canadian Ropes Ld. (1947) A.C. 109 per Lord Greene M.R. at page 118, where it was held that the mere fact that one corporation had less than 50 per cent of the shares of another was \u201cconclusive\u201d that the one corporation was not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by the other within section 6 of the Income War Tax Act.\nThis definition of controlled applies to all five appeals.\nIn Dworkin Furs (Pembroke) Limited, Dworkin Furs Ltd. owned 48 per cent of the issued shares in its own name and 2 per cent in the names of Roy Saipe and Helen Saipe as its nominees. The other 50 per cent were owned by one Sadie Harris. Roy Saipe was President of this respondent, but the By-laws of the company provided that in the event of an equality of votes, the Chairman did not have a casting vote.\nIt is clear in the light of Buckerfield that in these circumstances Dworkin Furs (Pembroke) Limited was not controlled by Dworkin Furs Ltd.\nIn the case of Allied Business Supervisions Limited, Alexander Aaron was the owner of 50 per cent of the issued shares while two other individuals, Joseph Tomney held 31 per cent and Roy N. Hall 19 per cent respectively. Aaron and Tomney were elected directors of the company on December 17, 1959, for an indefinite period until their term of office should be changed by the shareholders at a subsequent shareholders\u2019 meeting. On the same day Aaron was elected President of the company.\nThis company was incorporated under the Saskatchewan Companies Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 124. The company adopted as its Articles of Association Table A of the Companies Act. Article 46 of Table A reads:\n46. In the case of equality of votes whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded shall be entitled to a second or casting vote. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the fact that Aaron as President had at meetings of Shareholders and Directors a second or casting vote gave him control of the company within the Buckerfield definition of controlled. Thurlow J. held that the existence of the right to exercise a second or casting vote did not give Aaron control. He said:\nthe casting vote, unlike the votes arising from shareholding, which are exercisable without responsibility to the company or to other shareholders is in my opinion not the property of the holder, but is an adjunct of an office.\nand with this I agree.\nIn the case of Alpine Drywall & Decorating Limited, the shareholding situation was that one William Jager owned 50 per cent of the issued shares and Clarence Wagenaar the other 50 per cent. The appellant relied on evidence which established that at the time this company was incorporated, Wagenaar and Jager had agreed:\n(a) Wagenaar would attend to the running of the day to day business of the Respondent; and\n(b) Jager would attend to the corporate end of the business and the arranging of the necessary financing to carry on the business.\nand Jager was elected President of the Company.\nArticles 43 and 45 of the respondent provided:\n43. The president, or in his absence the vice-president (if any) shall be entitled to take the chair at every general meeting, or if there be no president or vice-president, or if at any meeting he shall not be present within fifteen (15) minutes after the time appointed for holding such meeting, the members present shall choose another director as chairman, and if no director be present, or if all the directors present decline to take the chair then the members present shall choose one of their numbers to be chairman. The chairman at any meeting of shareholders may appoint one or more persons (who need not be shareholders) to act as scrutineers.\n45. Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first instance by a show of hands and in the case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall, both on a show of hands and on a poll have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes to which he may be entitled as a member.\nThe arrangement or agreement between Wagenaar and Jager, while it might be said to give Wagenaar de facto control, did not give him de jure control, which is the true test, and this case does not differ from that of Allied Business Supervisions Limited.\nThe case of M.F. Esson and Sons Limited involved determining whether the company was controlled by the same group of persons who controlled Esson Motors Limited. It is a fact that Miller F. Esson, Sr., Miller F. Esson, Jr. and John F. Esson controlled the respondent. Prior to May 7, 1962, the shareholding of Esson Motors Limited was:\nMiller F. Esson, Sr.................................\n66\nMiller F. Esson, Jr..................................\n66\nJohn F. Esson........................................\n66\nTotal.................................................\n198\nOn May 7th, 1962, Miller F. Esson, Miller Esson, Jr., Jack Esson, and Esson Motors Limited, entered into an agreement with Edward Earle McKenna wherein it was agreed:\n(a) McKenna was to be appointed general manager of Esson Motors Limited for a term of three years, and was given complete and exclusive authority to manage the business of Esson Motors Limited.\n(b) The Essons were to transfer one half of the issued capital stock (99 shares) to McKenna.\n(c) The Essons granted to McKenna an irrevocable option to purchase from them the remaining capital stock during the period 29th May, 1965 until 26th May, 1966.\nPursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the shares were transferred so that as of the 7th of May, 1962, the shareholders in Esson Motors Limited were as follows:\nMiller F. Esson, Sr..................................\n33\nMiller F. Esson, Jr...................................\n33\nJohn F. Esson.........................................\n33\n99\nEdward McKenna..........................................................\n99\nTotal.................................................................................\n198\nAt all material times Miller F. Esson, Sr. was President, Miller F. Esson, Jr. was Vice\u2011President and John F. Esson Secretary-Treasurer of Esson Motors Limited.\nBy-law 4(6) of Esson Motors Limited read:\nThe president shall preside at meetings of the board. He shall act as chairman of the shareholders\u2019 meetings if present\u2026\nParagraph (c) of Section 102 of the Companies Act of New Brunswick, R.S.N.B. 1952, Chapter 33, under which Esson Motors Limited was incorporated, provides:\n\u201cIn the absence of other provisions in that behalf in the letters patent or by-laws of the company,\n* * *\n(c) all questions proposed for the consideration of the shareholders at such meetings shall be determined by the majority of votes, and the chairman presiding at such meetings shall have the casting vote in the case of an equality of the votes. Thurlow J. disposed of the casting vote argument as he had done in Allied Business Supervisions Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[3]. He was right in so doing.\nIn the appeal respecting Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited, a company incorporated under the Saskatchewan Companies Act (ibid), the following question had been propounded:\n1. Within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 148, as amended:\n(c) during the period commencing on February 1, 1960, and ending on July 14, 1961, did Isidore Aaron and Alexander Aaron together control Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited?\n(d) during the period commencing on July 14, 1961, and ending on December 31, 1962, did Aaron\u2019s (Prince Albert) Limited control Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited?\nThe shareholding of the Respondent, Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited was as follows:\n1 February 1960\u201414 July 1961\nIsidore Aaron.........................................\n349\nAlexander Aaron...................................\n349\nMargaret Pratt.......................................\n310\nTotal.................................................\n1,008\n14 July 1961\u201481 December 1961\nAaron\u2019s (Prince Albert) Limited.............................\n698\nMargaret Pratt..........................................................\n310\nTotal........................................................................\n1,008\nThis case differs from the others in that there could be no argument that but for Article 6 of the Articles of Association Isidore Aaron and Alexander Aaron controlled the respondent company by reason of holding 698 out of 1,008 shares in their own names prior to July 14, 1961, and thereafter in the name of Aaron\u2019s (Prince Albert) Limited which they also controlled. Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 18 of The Companies Act read:\n18. (1) There may be registered with the memorandum articles of association prescribing regulations for the company, and such articles may adopt all or any of the regulations contained in table A in the first schedule.\n(2) If the articles are not registered or, if articles are registered, in so far as the articles do not exclude or modify the regulations in that table, those regulations shall, so far as applicable, be the regulations of the company in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were contained in duly registered articles.\nThe Articles of Association of the respondent\u2019s company provided in part as follows:\n1. The provisions contained in Table A in the First Schedule of the Companies Act as hereinafter modified shall apply to this company.\n4. A poll may be demanded by one member and para. 44 of the said Table A shall be amended accordingly.\n6. That all motions put before any meeting of shareholders or directors of the company shall require the unanimous consent of all its members, and paras. 46, 47 and 82 of the said Table A shall be amended accordingly.\nParagraphs 46, 47 and 82 read:\n46. In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.\n47. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a question of adjournment, shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such time as the chairman of the meeting directs.\n82. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at a meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present, and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall have a second or casting vote.\nParagraph 44 reads:\nAt any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by at least two members, and, unless a poll is so demanded, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has on. a show of hands been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the book of the proceedings of the company, shall be conclusive evidence of the fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution.\nThe appellant contends that Article 6 above is illegal and ultra vires as being (a) contrary to the provisions of The Companies Act; (b) it constitutes an unreasonable restriction on the rights of a member to have a reasonable opportunity of bringing before the meeting any proposal or matter within the scope of the business of the meeting; and (c) it is contrary to the fiduciary relationship which the directors, at a directors\u2019 meeting have towards the company which require them to give their entire ability to the best interests of the company and its shareholders. All three points may be dealt with together as they extent to which they bind the shareholders of a company.\nThat a majority may bind the minority in a company is beyond question.\nSection 14(b) of the Interpretation Act of the Province of Saskatchewan, R.S.S. 1953, c. 1, provides:\n14. In an Act words making a number of persons a corporation shall:\n(b) vest in a majority of the members of the corporation the power to bind the others by their acts.\nSimilar wording is also to be found in the Interpretation Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 30.\nThe nature and effect of Articles of Association were stated by Duff J. (as he then was) in Theatre Amusement Co. v. Stone[4] as follows:\nThe articles of association are binding upon the company, the directors and the shareholders, until changed in accordance with the law. So long as they remain in force, any shareholder is entitled, unless he is estopped from taking that position by some conduct of his own, to insist upon the articles being observed by the company, and the directors of the company. This right he cannot be deprived of by the action of any majority. In truth, the articles of association constitute a contract between the company and the shareholders which every shareholder is entitled to insist upon being carried out.\nA situation similar to the one here was dealt with by this Court in Ringuet et al v. Bergeron[5]. In that case certain shareholders, Bergeron, Page and Ringuet, had contracted amongst themselves to vote unanimously at all meetings of the company and to vote for each other as directors. The contract provided for a penalty for breach of the contract in the following terms:\n11. Dans toutes assembl\u00e9es de ladite Compagnie, les parties aux pr\u00e9sentes s\u2019engagent et s\u2019obligent \u00e0 voter unanimement sur tout objet qui n\u00e9cessite un vote. Aucune des parties aux pr\u00e9sentes ne pourra diff\u00e9rer d\u2019opinion avec ses co-parties contractantes en ce qui concerne le vote. Le vote pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant du Pr\u00e9sident devra toujours \u00eatre en faveur des deux parties contractantes.\n12. Si l\u2019une des parties ne se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente convention, ses actions seront c\u00e9d\u00e9es et transport\u00e9es aux deux autres parties contractantes en parts \u00e9gales, et ce gratuitement.\nTelle est la sanction de la non ex\u00e9cution d\u2019aucune des clauses de la pr\u00e9sente convention par l\u2019une des parties contractantes.\nFor a period the contracting parties observed the terms of the contract, but later two of the parties began to take steps to oust Bergeron from the management of the company. A shareholders\u2019 meeting was called whereat Ringuet and Pag\u00e9 voted themselves in as a new board of directors. Bergeron was thus completely excluded from the management of the company. He brought action alleging that Ringuet and Page, in failing inter alia to vote for his election to the board of directors, had violated the contract. The trial court rejected the action, but in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench the Chief Justice and Owen J. found for Bergeron, Pratte J. dissenting.\nIn this Court, upholding the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Judson J. for the majority said:\nThe Chief Justice found nothing illegal in the agreement and decided that it should be given its full effect. The ratio of the dissenting opinion is to be found in the distinction drawn between the rights of a shareholder and the obligations assumed on becoming a director. While majority shareholders may agree to vote their shares for certain purposes, they cannot by this agreement tie the hands of directors and compel them to exercise the power of management of the company in a particular way. This appears in the following extract from the reasons of Pratte J.:\n\u00abMais la situation des directeurs est bien diff\u00e9rente de celle des actionnaires. Le directeur est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par les actionnaires, mais il n\u2019est pas \u00e0 proprement parler leur mandataire; il est un administrateur charg\u00e9 par la loi de g\u00e9rer un patrimoine qui n\u2019est ni le sien, ni celui de ses co-directeurs, ni celui des actionnaires, mais celui de la compagnie, une personne juridique absolument distincte \u00e0 la fois de ceux qui la dirigent et de ceux qui en poss\u00e8dent le capital actions. En cette qualit\u00e9, le directeur doit agir en bonne conscience, dans le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat du patrimoine confi\u00e9 \u00e0 sa gestion. Cela suppose qu\u2019il a la libert\u00e9 de choisir, au moment d\u2019une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 prendre, celle qui lui para\u00eet la plus conforme aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur lesquels la loi lui impose le devoir de veiller.\u00bb\nThere can be no objection to the general principle stated in this passage, but, in my view, it was not offended by this agreement. However, the conclusion of Pratte J. was that a director who has bound himself as this contract bound the parties has rendered himself incapable of doing what the law requires of him and that clause 11 requiring unanimity at all meetings had that effect. He also held that clause 11 was not severable and that therefore the agreement was invalidated in its entirety.\nOwen J. agreed that the undertaking of unanimity at directors\u2019 meetings which he considered was required by clause 11 might be contrary to public order but that it was not necessary to decide this since the clause was severable from the other provisions of the agreement to which he gave full effect. The defendants had failed to comply with other clauses in the contract\u2014the voting of Bergeron\u2019s salary, the election of Bergeron as a director of the company and his appointment as secretary-treasurer and assistant general manager.\nThe point of the appeal is therefore whether an agreement among a group of shareholders providing for the direction and control of a com- pany in the circumstances of this case is contrary to public order, and whether it is open to the parties to establish whatever sanction they choose for a breach of such agreement.\nDid the parties of this agreement tie their hands in their capacity as directors of the company so as to contravene the requirements of the Quebec Companies Act, which provides (s. 80) that \u201cthe affairs of the company shall be managed by a board of not less than three directors\u201d? I agree with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice that this agreement does not contravene this or any other section of the Quebec Companies Act. It is no more than an agreement among shareholders owning or proposing to own the majority of the issued shares of a company to unite upon a course of policy or action and upon the officers whom they will elect. There is nothing illegal or contrary to public order in an agreement for achieving these purposes. Shareholders have the right to combine their interests and voting powers to secure such control of a company and to ensure that the company will be managed by certain persons in a certain manner. This is a well-known, normal and legal contract and one which is frequently encountered in current practice and it makes no difference whether the objects sought are to be achieved by means of an agreement such as this or a voting trust. Such an arrangement is not prohibited either by law, by good morals or public order.\nIt is important to distinguish the present action, which is between contracting parties to an agreement for the voting of shares, from one brought by a minority shareholder demanding a certain standard of conduct from directors and majority shareholders. Nothing that can arise from this litigation and nothing that can be said about it can touch on that problem. The fact that this agreement may potentially involve detriment to the minority does not render it illegal and contrary to public order. If there is such injury, there is a remedy available to the minority shareholder who alleges a departure from the standards required of the majority shareholders and the directors. The possibility of such injurious effect on the minority is not a ground for illegality.\nI think that this litigation can be decided on the simple ground that clause 11 has no reference to directors\u2019 meetings. Clause 11 refers to meetings of the company, that is, shareholders\u2019 meetings, and not to meetings of the board of directors. On this point I agree with the Chief Justice, who stated his opinion in the following terms:\n\u00abAu surplus, y a-t-il quelque chose qui r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 la loi, \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public et aux bonnes m\u0153urs qu\u2019un groupe d\u2019actionnaires s\u2019entendent pour contr\u00f4ler et diriger une compagnie, pour devenir ses administrateurs, ses principaux officiers? Il n\u2019\u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pas besoin d\u2019un contrat \u00e9crit pour pareille entente qui intervient chaque jour dans le monde des compagnies, \u00e9tant notoire qu\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019entre elles sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par un groupe d\u2019actionnaires qui souvent m\u00eame ne repr\u00e9sentent pas la majorit\u00e9 des actions.\nL\u2019engagement des co-contractants \u00e0 voter unanimement leurs actions dans les assembl\u00e9es de la compagnie ne saurait lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00eatre invalide; apr\u00e8s tout, chacun des comparants n\u2019a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, \u00e0 la discussion, au droit de faire triompher son opinion avant de se ranger \u00e0 l\u2019avis de la majorit\u00e9 qui en principe doit gouverner.\u00bb I have the greatest difficulty in seeing how any question of public order can arise in a private arrangement of this kind. The possibility of injury to a minority interest cannot raise it. If this were not so, every arrangement of this kind would involve judicial enquiry. Minority rights have the protection of the law without the necessity of invoking public order. This litigation is between shareholders of a closely held company. The agreement which the plaintiff seeks to enforce damages nobody except the unsuccessful party to the agreement. No public interest or illegality is involved.\nI am of opinion that the same reasoning applies here. Control of a company within Buckerfield rests with the shareholders as such and not as directors. A contract between shareholders to vote in a given or agreed way is not illegal. The Articles of Association are in effect an agreement between the shareholders and binding upon all shareholders. Article 6 in question here was neither illegal nor ultra vires.\nThe appeal in respect of Aaron\u2019s Ladies Apparel Limited will accordingly also be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A.

Limited (Claimant) Appellant;\nand\nWascana Centre Authority (Respondent) Respondent.\n1966: November 24, 25, 28, 29; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nExpropriation\u2014Compensation\u2014Public authority given power to expropriate\u2014Municipal by-law limiting use of lands taken to \u201cpublic service use\u201d\u2014Determination of valuation.\nThe appellants held varying interests in certain lands in the City of Regina. The said lands, situated in the vicinity of the provincial Legislative Building and constituting an area described as one of unique attractiveness for development, were governed by a general subdivision by-law, No. 2356, which provided for use thereof for single detached dwellings. Subsequent amending by-laws permitted a limited amount of local business use. A proposed development plan for the area, involving high density residential, commercial and other development, was submitted to the municipal authorities by the appellants, McCallum Hill & Co. Ltd. Although this proposed subdivision was approved in principle, no amending by-laws were enacted to carry it into effect. Rather, by-law No. 3506 was enacted, adopting a community planning scheme which called for the use of the lands for \u201cparks and public open spaces\u201d. This was followed by a by-law, No. 3618, which repealed the previous zoning by-law 2356 and provided that the lands would be designated for \u201cpublic service\u201d.\nUnder The Wascana Centre Act, 1962, (Sask.), c. 46, the respondent was given power to expropriate lands, and on September 18, 1962, notice was given to the appellants of expropriation of the lands in question. Following hearings on the question of compensation for the expropriation, the arbitrator fixed such compensation upon the basis of use for \u201cparks and public open spaces\u201d at $506,500. On appeal by the appellants to the Court of Appeal, it was unanimously determined that the award should be increased to $669,840.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed the opinion of the arbitrator that the value must be determined on \u201cpublic service use\u201d, i.e., the use permitted by by-law 3618 which was in effect at the time of the expropriation, but they were of the opinion that the arbitrator had fixed the value for such \u201cpublic service\u201d use at too low an amount. Brownridge J.A. agreed with the majority, although for different reasons, that the award should be increased to $699,840. He accepted the contention of the appellants that for the purpose of finding the value of the lands expropriated, by-laws 3506 and 3618 and The Wascana Centre Act should all be considered not to have been enacted, and that, therefore, the valuation should be fixed on the basis of the use permitted by the repealed by-law, No. 2356, as amended by subsequent by-laws permitting local business use, with whatever added value the possibility of development in accordance with the proposed plan of subdivision of the area would have given the lands.\nOn appeal to this Court, the appellants sought to have the award further increased.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the basis of the views expressed by the majority in the Court below, the appeal should be dismissed. The arbitrator held on the evidence that by-law 3618 was an independent zoning enactment, part of an overall city plan and not part of the expropriation proceedings\u2014although passed with knowledge of the Wascana Centre scheme. He held therefore that this by-law, in limiting the use of the land expropriated to \u201cpublic service use\u201d, was a determining factor in assessing the amount of compensation. These findings were confirmed by the majority in the Court of Appeal, and on the present appeal the appellants failed to establish that they were wrong.\nPer Spence J.: Brownridge J.A., in his calculations, arrived at his award by the consideration of the proper and well-recognized principle. He took the proper starting point\u2014what a prudent man would pay rather than be evicted. He considered the permitted land use under the general subdivision by-law, excluding the latter by-laws which were, as he found, part of the expropriation proceedings, and he calculated the present value of the potentiality for development discounted by the appellants\u2019 opportunity to carry out the proposed but never authorized scheme of subdivision of the area. Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 712; Re Gibson and City of Toronto (1913), 28 O.L.R. 20, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, allowing, in part, an appeal from an arbitrator\u2019s award of compensation for lands expropriated. Appeal dismissed.\nW.Z. Estey, Q.C., and A. Enplander, for the appellants.\nE.J. Moss and C.R. Wimmer, for the respondent. The judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Mainland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the legal principles which are applicable in this appeal are clearly set forth in the reasons of my brother Spence which I have had the advantage of considering. I agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed but, with respect, I prefer to do so upon the basis of the views expressed by Wood and Maguire JJ.A., in the Court below.\nThe learned arbitrator found that the Community Planning Scheme adopted by by-law 3506, passed by the City Council of Regina on December 5, 1961, represented the state of mind of the city authorities at that time. That Planning Scheme was crystallized in the zoning by-law 3618 adopted on December 28, 1962, of which public notice had been given some months before, and which affected the whole City of Regina. The arbitrator held on the evidence that this by-law was an independent zoning enactment, part of an overall city plan and not part of the expropriation proceedings\u2014although passed of course with knowledge of the Wascana Centre Scheme. He held therefore that the bylaw 3618, in limiting the use of the land expropriated to \u201cpublic service use\u201d, was a determining factor in assessing the amount of compensation. These findings were confirmed by the majority in the Court of Appeal. The Appellants failed to satisfy me that they are wrong and I would therefore dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan delivered on May 19, 1965. By that judgment the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan allowed, in part, an appeal from an award made by His Honour Judge J.E. Friesen, sitting as an arbitrator, who had fixed the compensation at $506,500. The Court of Appeal increased that award to $669,840 and added interest at 5 per cent from September 19, 1962, until the date of payment. The appellants seek to have the award as so amended further increased.\nThe arbitration is to fix the compensation for the expropriation by the respondent of lands totalling 86.15 acres in the City of Regina composed of Blocks H, J, K and L on a plan known as the Hillsdale Commercial registered as No. 60R13698. The appellants Robert A. Kramer, Hillsdale Shopping Centre Limited, and McCallum Hill & Company Limited, all of the City of Regina, hold varying interests in the said lands and, under an agreement between the parties, the compensation for the expropriation should be fixed in two amounts\u2014one to cover parcels H, J and L, and a second to cover parcel K, as the latter alone has improvements thereon. The total amount so fixed is then subject to an application before the Saskatchewan Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for distribution between the appellants.\nThe lands in question which are depicted on ex. C, a copy of the said registered subdivision plan for the area, No. 60R13698, are grouped in an area immediately to the east of the Legislative Building grounds in the City of Regina and the south of but bordering upon Wascana Lake. The Regina campus of the University of Saskatchewan is to the immediate south-east. It was said to be one and one-third miles from the lands in question to the centre of the business district of Regina. Immediately to the south of the lands in question, the present appellants, and others, have developed and sold large residential subdivisions. The lands in question, therefore, were described as an area of unique attractiveness for development and, in fact, the sole undeveloped close-in area in Regina.\nThe lands were governed by a general subdivision by-law of the City of Regina, No. 2356, which provided for use thereof for single detached dwellings. That by-law had been amended by subsequent by-laws which permitted a limited amount of local business use. The appellants McCallum Hill & Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as McCallum Hill, were engaged in a series of plans to develop the area and were in continuous negotiation with municipal authorities for that purpose. A series of proposals similar in the main but with individual differences were submitted. On November 5, 1959, a Proposed Development Plan for North Hillsdale which had been submitted to the City Commissioner, was made the subject of a report to the city council, and on that date the city council having before it the report of the city commissioner and the report of the Community Planning Commission under date October 25, 1959, resolved to endorse the proposals of the development plan as set out on the said plan, sheet No. 2, and approved in principle the proposed shopping mall. The said sheet No. 2 was produced at trial and marked as ex. 30. That proposed plan of subdivision called for the use of Block L, 18.90 acres, for high density residential development; 5.9 acres along New Broad Street for business (small office) buildings development; the use of Block J, 37.87 acres, for office and institutional development; and the use of Block M (not subject to the expropriation here in question), 26.41 acres, for a shopping centre. It will be seen that such a proposal extended very considerably the use permitted by the old subdivision by-law 2356 and its amending by-laws.\nAlthough the proposed subdivision was approved in principle, no amending by-laws were enacted to carry it into effect. Rather, under circumstances to which reference will be made hereafter, by-law 3506 was enacted on December 5, 1961, adopting the Community Planning Scheme prepared by the Community Planning Association. This scheme called for the use of the lands with which this expropriation is concerned for \u201cparks and public open spaces\u201d. That by-law was followed by by-law 3618 enacted on December 28, 1962. It was a zoning by-law which repealed the previous zoning by-law, No. 2356, and provided that the subject lands would be designated for \u201cpublic service\u201d.\nThe Wascana Centre Authority had been created by the Wascana Centre Act which had been enacted by the Legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan, receiving Royal Assent on April 14, 1962. By the provisions of s. 72 thereof, the Act was deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1962. That statute gave to the Wascana Centre Authority the power to expropriate lands, and on September 18, 1962, notice of expropriation of Blocks H, J and L was given to the appellants Kramer and McCallum Hill, and of Block K to McCallum Hill.\nThe learned County Court Judge, as arbitrator, considered the question of compensation for the expropriation at hearings which extended for many days and, in lengthy and carefully drafted reasons for judgment, fixed such compensation upon the basis of use for \u201cparks and public open spaces\u201d at $506,500. Both appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and the Court unanimously determined that the award should be increased to $669,840. Maguire J.A., with whom Woods J.A. concurred, affirmed the opinion of the learned County Court Judge that the value must be determined on \u201cpublic service use\u201d, i.e., the use permitted by by-law 3618 which was in effect at the time of the expropriation, but he was of the opinion that the learned County Court Judge, as arbitrator, had fixed the value for such \u201cpublic service\u201d use at too low an amount. Maguire J.A., considering the possibilities of the lands for such public service use, arrived at a total valuation of $669,840.\nBrownridge J.A., considering the value based on other possibilities to which I shall refer immediately, arrived at a computation, nevertheless, of almost exactly the same amount, so that the members of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan were, for different reasons, agreed that the award should be increased to $669,840. Brownridge J.A., accepted the contention of the appellants that for the purpose of finding the value of the lands expropriated, by-laws 3506 and 3618 and the Wascana Centre Act should all be considered not to have been enacted, and that, therefore, the valuation should be fixed on the basis of the use permitted by the repealed by-law, No. 2356, as amended by subsequent by-laws permitting local business use, with whatever added value the possibility of development in accordance with the proposed plan of subdivision of Hillsdale North (ex. 30) would have given the lands.\nWith respect, I have come to the conclusion that the view of Brownridge J.A., is to be preferred to that of Maguire J.A., with whom Woods J.A. concurred. The standard of valuation in such cases is firmly fixed. It might perhaps be best stated in the words of Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[1]:\n\u2026 the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nA prudent man would pay for the property rather than be ejected from it, the present value of the possibilities for the eventual development of the property for its highest and best use. There is no doubt that the highest and best use of the subject property was that shown on the proposed plan of subdivision of North Hillsdale (ex. 30) which had been drafted by the combined efforts of McCallum Hill and other very able and experienced developers retained by it for such purpose.\nThe submission of the appellants to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and to this Court was that in considering the possibilities for the highest and best use of the lands the tribunal should exclude any limitations on the development of the lands which were in fact mere steps in the expropriating machinery. The appellants cited Re Gibson and City of Toronto[2] and particularly Hodgins J.A., who said at p. 28:\nIf that was its sole purpose, then, I think, it became part of the general scheme and should be so treated. If it is not part of the expropriating machinery as such, it is part of the plan adopted, of which it and the valuation of the lands by arbitration were essential factors. I see difficulties in the way of holding that by-law No. 5545 should be treated as part of the expropriation proceedings. But in this case it makes little difference in the result.\nIt is, of course, accepted law that the value of the land to the expropriating body cannot be included as an element in the compensation. But, on the other hand, that authority ought not to be able, by the exercise of its other powers immediately prior to the taking, to reduce the value of what it seeks and intends to acquire and of which it is contemplating expropriation.\nIn considering whether the doctrine outlined by Hodgins J.A., applies to the circumstances of this case, one must keep in mind that in order to be found to be part of the expropriating machinery one does not need to determine that the limiting by-laws were in any sense the result of a fraudulent conspiracy to deprive the owner of an award to which he was entitled. It should be noted that the appellants, in their factum to this Court, submit:\n7. The Appellants do not allege any bad faith on the part of the council of the City of Regina in passing the community planning scheme by-law and preparing the zoning map for proposed zoning by-law 3618 in contemplation of the passage of the Wascana Centre Act. The Appellants need go no higher than to state that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the City did cooperate with the Government of Saskatchewan in laying the groundwork for the Wascana Centre development.\nIt would appear that, on the other hand, the concept of the Wascana Centre scheme was in every way a commendable proposal in the development of a very attractive area to surround the Legislative Buildings, one of which the citizens of Regina and indeed of Saskatchewan could well be proud. The creation of that concept and its execution, however, should not result in depriving an owner of the valuation of his lands expropriated for the purpose of carrying out the concept, based on the potential development of those lands prior to the creation of the scheme. In the light of this principle, the series of events should be considered.\nI have already cited the zoning applicable to the appellants\u2019 lands up to and including November 5, 1961, and the expression by the municipal council, on that day, of approval in principle of a substantial alteration of that zoning to the advantage of the appellants.\nOn December 22, 1959, a copy of the outlined plan, i.e., ex. 30, was endorsed with the city\u2019s approval under signature of its duly authorized officers and that plan was then registered as No. 60R13698. In the spring of 1960, Mr. Whittlesey, the town planner retained by McCallum Hill, was in Regina and then was informed that the city planning commission was preparing a comprehensive study of the entire city, together with community plans which were integral to that comprehensive study. He was later issued a copy of that comprehensive plan which plan showed the property in question had been zoned for park land. Mr. Whittlesey realized that the use of the area in question proposed by McCallum Hill was illogical in the light of the \u201ccoming, if not already there, Wascana Authority\u201d, and that as a result the possibility of proceeding with the development which McCallum Hill had envisaged was \u201cwithdrawn\u201d.\nMr. Frederick W. Hill gave evidence on behalf of McCallum Hill that he conferred with Mr. Yamasaki in the summer of 1961 and that he recalls particularly in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Yamasaki, who was the architect and planner retained by the Wascana Centre Authority, showed him a plan of the indicated area that\nthey wanted to take in within the Wascana Centre Authority which included these lands which are the subject of this arbitration and these lands were shown on the plan as mandatory to be taken into the authority. They wanted to advise us that this was what they planned to do and asked for our co-operation in any proceeding with any development of these lands, which we agreed to do. From that point on we certainly did not feel that we, either in the public interests or in any way, shape or form, were in a position to undertake any development of the lands or proceed with the plans that we had been developing from these years. As you know, the legislation wasn\u2019t finally enacted until the following spring. Mr. Gilmour, the executive director and secretary of the Wascana Centre Authority, swore that he met Mr. Hill on many occasions, several of which were prior to the time that the Wascana Centre Authority became a legal entity, and that he suggested to Mr. Hill that Mr. Yamasaki in his master plan was recommending that the areas in question be \u201cfor government use\u201d. Mr. Gilmour swore that this would have occurred in the late fall of 1961 or in the early spring of 1962. During this period, by virtue of special legislation, which need not be considered in detail, the City of Regina had enacted a series of holding by-laws. These by-laws permitted application to a special board for exemption from the provisions thereof limiting developments. No such application was made on behalf of the appellants and Mr. Frederick W. Hill explained that the appellants\u2019 cooperation having been requested and granted, there was no purpose in making application to permit a development which obviously could not proceed.\nBy-law 3506 was enacted on December 5, 1961, and approving the general zoning map for the whole city includes a recital which is, in my view, very significant. This recital was quoted by Brownridge J.A., in his reasons for judgment and is as follows:\nAt present these two major areas of public buildings are included in an overall study for the development of Wascana Centre. This study embraces the Provincial Government grounds, the various institutions south of College Avenue, the Douglas Park Sports area, the future University site and other lands around Wascana Lake. Participants in this study are the Provincial Government, the University of Saskatchewan, and the City of Regina. The concept of the Wascana Centre development is a magnificent example of foresight and should provide a stimulus and example to other agencies when programming for public buildings and institutions.\nProceeding with the Wascana Centre scheme, the municipality enacted by-law 3618 about a year later, on December 28, 1962. That was a general zoning by-law for the City of Regina and included the lands in question and all other lands in the municipality. By-law 3506 had limited the use of the lands in question to \u201cparks and public open spaces\u201d. By-law 3618 zoned the lands in question for \u201cpublic service\u201d, a designation somewhat more advantageous to the owner than that which had appeared in by-law 3506. It was this permission for more advantageous use which caused the majority in the Court of Appeal to increase the award to the appellants. Although both by-law 3506 and by-law 3618 required the consent of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, neither bylaw received such approval until January 29, 1963. It is significant that by-law 3618 was enacted and both by-laws were approved after the Wascana Centre Act had been enacted. Under that statute, the Wascana Centre Authority was created with three participating parties\u2014the Province of Saskatchewan, the City of Regina, and the University of Saskatchewan. It will be realized that the latter two, although independent legal entities, were in practical fact very much under the control and guidance of the former. Any municipality possesses any power whatsoever only by virtue of the enactments of the provincial legislature and the University of Saskatchewan is, of course, an institution of higher education largely supported by provincial grants. The Wascana Centre Act set up a master plan for the Wascana Centre and a detailed scheme for land uses in the area composing the Wascana Centre. As I have said, powers of expropriation were granted and there were special references to expropriation of the very lands in issue on this appeal.\nSection 43(1) of the statute as found in R.S.S. 1965, c. 401, provided that upon the acquisition by the Authority of these lands which were designated in Schedule B thereto, the provincial government should pay to the Authority out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the total cost to the Authority of such acquisition. Elsewhere, on further expropriations not dealt with in specific sections, the cost of the acquisition was divided 55 per cent to the government of the Province, 30 per cent to the City of Regina, and 15 per cent to the University of Saskatchewan.\nI am of the opinion that in view of the circumstances to which I have referred above, one can only come to the conclusion that the enactment of by-laws 3506 and 3618 was simply a step, in so far as these lands are concerned, in the setting up of the Wascana Centre and the acquisition by the Wascana Centre Authority of the lands in question. Counsel for the respondent points out that the two by-laws deal not only with the lands in question but with all lands within the City of Regina and that, therefore, there can be no implication that the enactment of the by-laws was part of a \u201cscheme\u201d. To that submission, there are two answers: Firstly, as I have pointed out, no \u201cscheme\u201d in any nefari- ous connotation need be proved, and secondly, whatever the impact and purpose of the by-laws were as to other lands, the impact and purpose as to the lands in question were very plainly to prevent such a development as had been envisaged by the appellants and instead included them in the limiting, although commendable, design of the Wascana Centre Authority.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that it is the duty of the tribunal fixing the award to consider the situation without regard for the enactment of the limiting use in those two by-laws. That situation apart from those two by-laws is, therefore, that to which we must turn in fixing compensation. It was a zoning for single family residences with some limited business permitted in certain small areas, i.e., the situation under by-law 2356 and amending by-laws. The valuation, therefore, is the valuation for those uses plus the present value of any potential increase in value due to a rezoning. No such rezoning ever occurred until the more limiting zoning of by-laws 3506 and 3618. What were the possibilities of development for the use outlined in the proposed plan of redevelopment of Hillsdale North as shown in ex. 30? It is true that that scheme had been approved in principle on November 5, 1959, but by the time the expropriation occurred the whole Wascana scheme had been developed and even if the by-laws which carried it out had never been enacted, the possibility of the appellants\u2019 obtaining, by the time expropriation occurred, the enactment of by-laws to incorporate the scheme in ex. 30 would have been very small.\nBrownridge J.A. pointed out that Mr. Robison, giving evidence for the appellants, had put the valuation upon the potentiality of the development under ex. 30 at $1,500,000, but it is clear that such valuation did not discount the fact that development under such scheme was not possible until the zoning by-laws were amended to permit land use in accordance with that scheme and that event was of only slight possibility. Brownridge J.A. noted Mr. Robison\u2019s evidence, which he quotes as follows:\nMy experience indicates that institutions of a non-profit character have to meet the test of competition in the market.\nBrownridge J.A. accepted that statement and, therefore, concluded that the difference in value of the subject lands between a modified version of the appellants\u2019 proposed subdivision (ex. 30) which envisaged some commercial and high density residential use along with public service on the one hand, and the public service alone, was not as great as it had at first appeared. Brownridge J.A. concluded that the award made by the learned arbitrator was \u201cclearly too small\u201d and that it should be increased. He found that his calculations for increase came very close to the amount found by Maguire J.A., namely, $669,840, and therefore concurred in the increase of the award to that amount\nIn my view, it is not the duty of this Court to engage in calculations or to exercise judgment as to land valuation in the Province of Saskatchewan. It is the duty of this Court to consider whether those calculations and assessment of land valuations were made in accordance with the proper and well-recognized principle. I am of the opinion that Brownridge J.A., in his calculations, did arrive at his award by the consideration of the proper and well-recognized principle. He took the proper starting place\u2014what a prudent man would pay rather than be evicted. He considered the permitted land use under the general subdivision bylaw, excluding the latter by-laws which were, as he found, part of the expropriation proceedings, and he calculated the present value of the potentiality for development discounted by the appellants\u2019 opportunity to carry out its proposed but never authorized scheme, ex. 30.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan. The respondent is entitled to its costs in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Embury, Molisky, Gritzfeld & Embury, Regina.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Moss & Wimmer, Regina.\n[1] [1949] S.C.R. 712 at 715.\n[2] (1913), 28 O.L.R. 20.\n",

Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, [1967] S.C.R. 249.\nDate: 1967-01-24\nKing Edward Properties Limited (Applicant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (Respondent) Respondent.\n1966: November 29; 1967: January 24.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nExpropriation\u2014Compensation\u2014Part of a parcel of land taken\u2014Application of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of valuation.\nThe appellant was the owner of a rectangular parcel of land, part of which was expropriated by the respondent municipality for a roadway. The expropriated land cut diagonally across the appellant\u2019s property from the south-east corner to the north-west corner, thus leaving the appellant with two triangular parcels separated by the road. The highest and best use of these lands was for light industrial use. The appellant\u2019s purpose in purchasing the property was to realize a profit by carrying out a plan of subdivision thereon.\nThe parties being unable to agree on the amount of compensation to which the appellant was entitled by virtue of the expropriation, the matter proceeded to arbitration. An award totalling $90,000 was made by the arbitrator. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, reduced this compensation to $34,000. Schultz J.A. would have awarded $56,000.\nEach appraiser retained by the parties used the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of valuation. The respective valuations given by the appraiser for the claimant were $570,000 and $480,000; those given by the appraiser for the municipality were $492,000 and $517,000. The arbitrator was dissatisfied with the evidence of both appraisers and although the total amount awarded by him equated that advanced by the claimant\u2019s appraiser, it was arrived at by a different method. He awarded $59,000 for the land and $31,000 for severance. In the Court of Appeal, both the majority and Schultz J.A. preferred to use the method of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d valuations. The majority accepted the values of the municipality\u2019s appraiser. They allowed $59,000 for the land taken and having recognized that the remaining land had increased in value by $25,000, made their award of $34,000. Schultz J.A. reduced the \u201cbefore\u201d valuation of the claimant\u2019s appraiser to $539,000 and after deducting $483,000 as the \u201cafter\u201d valuation, arrived at the sum of $56,000. From the judgment of the Court of Appeal an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the award increased to $56,000.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: In cases such as this the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of valuation would seem to be the one which attained the most accurate results. Schultz J.A. considered the matter upon proper and well-recognized principles in both the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d valuation and his conclusion, rather than that of the majority of the Court of Appeal, should be adopted.\nAs to the \u201cbefore\u201d valuation, the view of Schultz J.A. took into account the potentialities of the subject lands at their highest and best use and yet made deduction for the fact that such valuations were only possibilities, and for the costs to which the owner would be put in attaining such valuations. The \u201cbefore\u201d valuation as made by the municipality\u2019s appraiser at the same square-foot rate throughout was unacceptable in that it failed to take into account the fact that the lands in the eastern portion were at a greater distance from an access street than were the lands in the western portion.\nAs to the \u201cafter\u201d valuation, Schultz J.A., in adopting the approximate figure reached by the claimant\u2019s appraiser, recognized that the easterly portion having been turned into a wedge or pie-shaped parcel would, as a result, be more difficult to develop. The municipality\u2019s appraiser had made no allowance for this difficulty in development and had, in fact, increased the valuation of this area.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed. The municipality\u2019s \u201cbefore\u201d valuation, which recognized a generous appreciation in value of $70,000 in the period of seven months from the time the appellant purchased the property, was more realistic than the \u201cbefore\u201d valuation of the owner\u2019s appraiser. The attributed appreciation in value from $419,000 to $570,000 during this period was based on a fanciful plan of subdivision which involved the extension of a street across a railway on the south side of the lot.\nThe real difference between the two valuators in the \u201cafter\u201d valuation was as to the valuation of the easterly triangle. According to the owner\u2019s appraiser there had been a serious depreciation in value here; according to the municipality\u2019s appraiser there had been none. The majority in the Court of Appeal refused to accept this depreciation in value. The expropriation and the fully paved road which resulted therefrom was an improvement for the entire parcel.\n[Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, [1966] S.C.R. 336, referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reducing the amount of compensation awarded by an arbitrator for land expropriated. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nA. Sweatman, Q.C., and T. Mathers, for the appellant.\nD.C. Lennox and F.N. Steele, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014In June 1962 the appellant, King Edward Properties Limited, contracted to buy a rec- tangular parcel of land on the east side of King Edward Street in the City of St. James in Metropolitan Winnipeg. The purchase was completed in December of 1962. On January 31, 1963, the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg expropriated part of the land for the extension of Madison Street.\nThe parcel was one of 28.139 acres containing 1,225,726 square feet. It had a frontage of 1615.9 feet on King Edward Street with an average depth of slightly under 800 feet. It was purchased for $419,000 with a cash payment of $70,000 and the balance secured by a five\u2011year mortgage bearing interest at 5\u00bd per cent. The purchase price works out to 34.4 cents per square foot.\nThe land expropriated for the highway comprised 146,690 square feet (3.368 acres) and it cuts diagonally across the appellant\u2019s property from the south-east corner to the north-west corner, thus leaving the appellant with two triangular parcels separated by the road. The triangular parcel to the west comprised 533,543 square feet (12.248 acres) and the one to the east comprised 545,493 square feet (12.523 acres).\nThe arbitrator awarded $59,000 for the land and $31,000 for severance, a total of $90,000. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, reduced this compensation to $34,000. Schultz J.A. would have awarded $56,000. My opinion is that the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed.\nEach appraiser retained by the parties used the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of evaluation. Here are the valuations:\nBefore value\nFarstad\n(for the owner)\n$570,000\nWhyte\n(for the municipality)\n$492,000\nAfter value\n$480,000\n$517,000\nThe Court of Appeal had first to deal with a wide difference between the two valuations prior to taking. They recognized that the parcel was an attractive industrial site, easy of access to the centre of Winnipeg and suitable for subdivision into large lots for warehousing and distributing plants. But an attributed appreciation in value from $419,000 to $570,000 in a period of seven months was just too much for any Court to swallow. It was based upon a fanciful plan of subdivision which involved a proposed extension of Bradford Street across the CPU tracks on the south side of the lot. The criticism of the majority in the Court of Appeal and their reasons for their preference of the municipality\u2019s valuation are contained in the two following paragraphs, and to me the reasoning is unassailable:\nThis is where, in my opinion, he went astray. He had to evaluate undeveloped and vacant land in view of its highest and best use, namely, industrial purposes for which the land was already zoned. He assumed that a road was available to develop this substantial parcel into smaller parcels where none was in existence. Mr. Farstad further assumed that the cost of this road development, after necessary permits had been obtained, would be charged to the prospective purchasers. He failed to take into consideration the area of land required for the proposed extension of Bradford Street, the obtaining of the necessary permits and plans of survey, and he made no allowance for the costs of opening the proposed street nor for the cost of installation of services,\u2014costs which initially would have to be borne by the applicant. By virtue of the expropriation an adequate fully-serviced road was to be constructed, and in fact was constructed, at the cost of the general Metro taxpayers, with no direct cost to the owners of the adjoining property. Further, the suggested increase in value between June 1st, 1962, and February 4th, 1963, of more than 11c. per square foot is not realistic at all in view of the evidence of sales made during that particular period and previous periods.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Whyte\u2019s approach is by far the better; it is more realistic and absolutely proper. His evaluation of the land before the taking at 40c. per square foot recognizes a substantial enough appreciation in land value between June 1962, and February 1963, and amply allows for all increases in land values in the immediate area during that period.\nThe Court of Appeal, therefore, started with Whyte\u2019s valuation of $492,000, which recognized a generous appreciation in value of $73,000 in seven months. Whyte\u2019s valuation works out to 40c. per square foot as contrasted with the purchase price of 34.4c. per square foot.\nThe \u201cafter\u201d valuation was broken down by both valuators in the same way. Each recognized that the westerly triangle was the more valuable because of the facilities of access. Each also recognized that the northerly tip of the triangle was more valuable than the rest. These are their valuations of the westerly triangle:\nWESTERLY TRIANGLE\nFarstad\nNortherly tip\n63,000 sq. ft. @ 90\u00a2 sq. ft.....................................................\n$ 56,700\nRest of Triangle\n470,543 sq. ft. @ 50\u00a2 sq. ft...................................................\n235,271\n$291,971 Whyte\n64,669 sq. ft. @ $1.00 sq. ft..................................................\n$ 64,669\n468,874 sq. ft. @ 50\u00a2 sq. ft...................................................\n234,437\n$299,106\nThe difference of opinion here is slight and it is attributable to this: Whyte thought that the northerly tip was more extensive than Farstad. He gave it an area of 64,669 square feet instead of 63,000, and he thought that it was worth $1 per square foot as contrasted with 90c. per square foot by Farstad.\nThe real difference between the two shows up in the \u201cafter\u201d valuation of the easterly triangle:\nWHOLE OF EASTERLY TRIANGLE\nFarstad\n545,493 sq. ft. @ 35\u00a2 sq. ft..................................................\n$190,922\nWhyte\n545,493 sq. ft. @ 40\u00a2 sq. ft..................................................\n$218,197\nFarstad values this easterly triangle at 35c. per square foot, Whyte at 40c. per square foot. According to Farstad\u2019s figures, there had been a serious depreciation in value here; according to Whyte, there had been none.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal refused to accept this depreciation in value. They point out that Farstad\u2019s average valuation per square foot for the whole parcel was 46\u00bdc. and they could find no rational explanation for the reduction. They did not accept his reason that the approaches were no longer as good. They said:\nThe expropriation and the fully improved paved road which results therefrom is an improvement for the entire parcel. Access to both parcels is a first-class road, comparable to any of similar type in Manitoba or possibly elsewhere. Further, it forms part of an overall development to give free and easy access from Portage Avenue to Provincial Trunk Highways 6, 7 and 8 into a very progressive industrial area and will most probably generate business through the volume of traffic in the area.\nThe majority reasons allowed $59,000 for the land taken\u2014146,690 square feet at 40c. per square foot. They recognized that the remaining land had increased in value by $25,000 and therefore their award of compensation was $34,000.\nI agree with their reasons and conclusions and I would dismiss the appeal with costs. The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2] which, by a majority (Chief Justice and Monnin J.A.), reduced the award of the arbitrator, His Honour Judge A.R. Macdonnell, from $90,000 plus 6 per cent interest to $34,000 plus 5 per cent interest. Schultz J.A. dissented and would have allowed an award of $56,000 with interest at the same 5 per cent rate.\nThe appellant had purchased the lands from Bridge & Tank (Western) Limited in June of 1962. The lands held originally by the latter company included the whole block from Saskatchewan Avenue on the south to Dublin Avenue on the north, but Bridge & Tank (Western) Limited sold 400 feet southerly from Dublin Avenue across the whole width of the property to the Pepsi-Cola Company Limited in 1961. The sale price was 23 cents per square foot or $10,000 per acre. Therefore, the lands purchased by King Edward Properties Limited contained 28.139 acres with a frontage on King Edward Street along its west limit and along Saskatchewan Avenue or, more properly, the CPR spur line running along the north side of Saskatchewan Avenue on the south limit but with access to no street on the east. The lands were rectangular in shape having a length from north to south of about 1,600 feet and from east to west of about 795 feet. The lands had been purchased by Bridge & Tank (Western) Limited in 1957 at the price of only 4.6 cents per square foot or $2,000 per acre.\nThe appellant purchased the lands from Bridge & Tank (Western) Limited for $419,000, which is at the rate of 34.4 cents per square foot or $15,000 per acre. The rapid increase in value of the lands in such a short period was typical of the situation in this new and expanding industrial area of Greater Winnipeg. The appellant purchased the lands which were zoned as M-2 for light industrial use to \u201cmove this land as soon as possible\u201d and in order to do so drafted a plan of subdivision, produced before the learned County Court Judge as ex. 6. This plan of subdivision called for the extension northerly across Saskatchewan Avenue of a street known as Bradford Street, which extension is shown on the said plan as \u201cproposed Bradford Street extension\u201d. That proposed Bradford Street extension, as sketched on the said plan, ran northerly to the southerly limit of the lands owned by the Pepsi-Cola Company and then turned westerly to continue to King Edward Street. Lots of varying widths lettered from A to G were sketched on the easterly side of the proposed Bradford Street extension. These lands ran from the said extension easterly for about 80 feet to the easterly limit of the lands owned by the appellant which, as I have said, did not abut on any street. Lots, also of varying widths, lettered from I to O inclusive, were sketched on the westerly side of the proposed Bradford Street extension, and lots P to V inclusive were sketched on the east side of King Edward Street, i.e., the westerly edge of the appellant\u2019s lands.\nTo have carried out that subdivision would have required, of course, negotiations with the municipal corporation to extend Bradford Street north and would also have required negotiations with the Department of Transport to permit a new level crossing over the CPR spur line which ran along the northerly limit of Saskatchewan Avenue, i.e., the southerly limit of the appellant\u2019s lands.\nEvidence before the learned County Court Judge upon the arbitration was given by expert appraisers on behalf of the claimant, the present appellant, and on behalf of the municipal corporation.\nThe appraiser for the claimant, Mr. Farstad, made his valuation on the basis of the proposed extension of Bradford Street which I have described and divided his valuations into three different pieces of property\u2014firstly, the lands along the east side of the Bradford Street extension, totalling 361,000 square feet, which he valued at 45 cents per square foot for a total of $162,450; secondly, the lands along the west side of Bradford Street extension, totalling 347,500 square feet, which he valued at 50 cents per square foot for a total of $173,750; and, thirdly, the lands along the King Edward Street frontage, 357,000 square feet, which he valued at 65 cents per square foot for a total of $232,050. This came to a total valuation of $568,250 which he rounded out into $570,000.\nThe appraiser giving evidence for the municipal corporation, on the other hand, Mr. Whyte, simply valued the whole of the lands, before the expropriation, at 40 cents per square foot, rounding out the valuation at $492,000. The appraisers then turned to the valuation of the lands after the expropriation. This \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of arriving at the amount which should be awarded to a claimant upon an arbitration has been used frequently and was approved, inter alia, by this Court in an arbitration dealing with a nearby property: Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg[3].\nThe expropriation consisted in cutting through the property, in a diagonal line from the south-east corner to the north-west corner, of an 80 foot roadway which would be a one-way street northbound. In addition to the actual width of the proposed roadway, the narrow triangle of lands which would have been left at the north-west corner between the new road and King Edward Street was expropriated southerly from the northerly limit of the lands southerly for 460 feet. King Edward Street was to become a one-way street southbound. The result of the expropriation was that the lands now consisted of two roughly triangular parcels\u2014the one to the west side of the new highway running southerly from its juncture with King Edward Street for 1,160 feet, with a width at its northerly limit of only 132 feet and at its southerly limit of 800 feet, the other on the east side of the new street, also triangular in shape, having a north limit of about 680 feet with a depth of about 750 feet, to a sharp point. Both appraisers divided their valuations after expropriation into three parts.\nMr. Farstad, for the claimant, valued the north-west corner of the lands consisting of 63,000 square feet at 90 cents per square foot, totalling $56,700. The balance of the west parcel fronting on King Edward Street he valued at 50 cents per square foot for a total of $235,271. The whole of the east triangle he valued at 35 cents per square foot for $190,922. He rounded out the total valuation to $480,000, i.e., $90,000 less than his valuation before expropriation.\nMr. Whyte, for the municipality, on the other hand, valued the first two parcels at substantially the same amount as did Mr. Farstad, but he valued the large easterly triangle at 40 cents per square foot for $218,197, giving a total valuation of $517,000, as against his valuation prior to expropriation of $492,000, so that he showed an increase in value of $25,000. He valued the actual lands taken for the new street, 146,680 square feet, at the same 40 cents per square foot for a rounded figure of $59,000, so, therefore, he would have assessed the compensation for the taking at the difference\u2014$34,000.\nThe learned County Court Judge, expressing himself as utterly dissatisfied with the evidence of both appraisers, took a figure of $59,000, the offer made by the respondent to the appellant for the lands actually taken, and added to it a $31,000 damage item for severance claimed by the appellant from the respondent during the negotiations, to reach a total award of $90,000. It will be seen that although this sum equated that advanced by Mr. Farstad for the appellant, it was arrived at by an altogether different method, and a method which surely could not be supported.\nIn the Court of Appeal, both Monnin and Schultz JJ.A., pointed out that the learned County Court Judge\u2019s assessment was made on the basis that there would not be any entry permitted to the new public street, while both parties agreed now that adequate access to that public street would be provided, and both Monnin J.A., giving judgment for the majority, and Schultz J.A., preferred to use the well-recognized and firmly established method of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d valuations which had been used by both appraisers and which, it would seem in cases such as this, always reach the most accurate result.\nAs the Chief Justice of Manitoba said in Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, supra, when the appeal in that matter was before the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, \u201cthis places this Court in a position where it must make its own valuation on a proper and recognized basis\u201d. I conceive it the duty of this Court to determine whether the result in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was reached on a proper and recognized basis.\nAs I have already said, the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d method of valuation would seem to be the one which attained the most accurate results. The majority judgment in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba has accepted the valuation made by Mr. Whyte of the property before expropriation, i.e., 40 cents per square foot for the total of 1,225,726 square feet. It must be remembered that the lands were purchased by the appellant for the purpose of realizing a profit from the subdivision thereon. The lands were zoned M-2 for light industrial use and all the evidence is that the highest and best use of those lands was for such light industrial use. The proper development of the potential value of the lands, therefore, could only be attained if they were properly subdivided. The appellant had proceeded toward that end when it drafted the plan (ex. 6) and commenced negotiations for the extension of the street and other matters involved in the subdivision of the property in accordance with that plan.\nThe valuation of the lands before expropriation as made by Mr. Whyte at the same square\u2011foot rate throughout failed to take into account that the lands on the west side then faced on King Edward Street which was, at that time, a street used for traffic travelling in both directions, while the easterly portion of the land ran 795 feet east of that King Edward Street and had access to no street but the said King Edward Street. There could be no acceptable valuation of these lands at the common square foot rate throughout under such circumstances.\nI am of the opinion that Mr. Farstad\u2019s valuation for the claimant based on a subdivision such as ex. 6 and which showed valuation at three different rates, i.e., 65 cents per square foot for the lands facing King Edward Street, 50 cents per square foot for the lands facing the Bradford Street extension on its west side, and 45 cents per square foot for the lands facing the Bradford Street extension on its east side, was a more realistic evaluation of the value of the property, taking into account its possibilities for a fuller and better use. Of course, the division of the lands by the cutting out thereof of the proposed Bradford Street extension would lessen the actual acreage available for sale by the acreage used in the new street, which Mr. Farstad calculated at 160,100 square feet. Mr. Farstad, therefore, made no claim for any evaluation of that latter acreage but, as Schultz J.A. pointed out in his reasons in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Farstad failed to take into consideration the costs entailed in the creation of the Bradford Street extension, and that it was highly doubtful whether such costs could be recoverable from purchasers of the individual sites, after the extension had been completed. It is, of course, sound that in allowing for the potential value of the lands which are to be improved one must deduct the costs to the claimant of making such improvements. Schultz J.A., in his reasons for judgment, did reduce Mr. Farstad\u2019s valuation \u201cbefore\u201d expropriation from $570,000 to $539,000 by this $31,000 item, attempting to make the deduction for such costs of the improvements as would have to be borne by the appellant. It must also be recognized that the subdivision as envisaged by the appellant was only a possibility. As Monnin J.A. said:\nMr. Farstad makes reference not only to unimproved land, as it was, but to value for development and on the assumption that a road existed to service this property, which road in fact did not exist.\nWith respect, the error in Mr. Farstad\u2019s valuation was not in taking into account the road which did not exist but was in failing to take into account the costs to the appellant entailed in creating that road and some discount due to the fact that the creation of that road was by no means assured. There is no proof that the City of Winnipeg would have agreed to an extension of Bradford Street in the fashion envisaged, although it was admitted that such an extension was contemplated by the municipality before the diagonal street was determined upon. There might well be difficulty encountered in the application to the Board of Transport Commissioners to permit a level crossing on the spur line, although the new diagonal roadway does have such a crossing some few hundred feet to the east of that which was envisaged in the proposal for the Bradford Street extension.\nIn Schultz J.A.\u2019s reasons, there is no calculation to show how the deduction of $31,000 was arrived at, but I do not think it is the duty of this Court to attempt such calculation; rather, it is to determine whether the valuation as made in the Court of Appeal was in accordance with proper and recognized principles. In my opinion, with respect, the view adopted by Schultz J.A. rather than that adopted by the majority of the Court of Appeal, does reach a valuation in accordance with proper and recognized principles in that it takes into account the potentialities of the subject lands at their highest and best use and yet makes deduction for the fact that such valuations are only possibilities, and for the costs to which the owner would be put in attaining such valuations. The actual calculations would not appear to be the concern of this Court. Turning next to the evaluation after expropriation, the majority of the Court of Appeal have again accepted the evidence of Mr. Whyte given on behalf of the municipal corporation. In so far as two of the said parcels were referred to by each of the appraisers, i.e., the north-west corner of the lands in the westerly triangle, and the balance of the lands in the westerly triangle, there is very little difference between the opinions of the two appraisers. In so far as the easterly triangle is concerned, Mr. Whyte valued the whole triangle containing 545,493 square feet at 40 cents per square foot, while Mr. Farstad, giving evidence on behalf of the claimant, valued the same triangle at 35 cents per square foot. In the case of Mr. Whyte, this was ascribing the same square foot value to the lands in the easterly triangle after the expropriation as he had ascribed to all the lands in the whole rectangular area before expropriation.\nThese lands in the easterly triangle were, in fact, those which, prior to the expropriation, had been farthest distant from any access, i.e., from King Edward Street. If the 40 cents per square foot was an average for the whole 28.139 acres, then it is inevitable that the lands in the northeast quadrant would have been of a value of much less than 40 cents to average out over the whole rectangle at that rate. Therefore, in fact, Mr. Whyte has increased the value which he put on the lands in the easterly triangle after the expropriation. Mr. Farstad, on the other hand, valued the lands to the east of the proposed Bradford Street extension, prior to the expropriation, at 45 cents per square foot, and has now valued the easterly triangle at 35 cents per square foot. One cannot say that that represents a decrease of 10 cents per square foot in the valuation of lands similarly placed before and after expropriation, as Mr. Farstad\u2019s valuation before expropriation, as I have pointed out above, was based on the proposed Bradford Street extension, which would have made the lands to the east of the said extension accessible to a two-way street and have resulted in a series of rectangular lots A to G in numbering, of varying widths but of a common depth.\nThe result after expropriation is that there is a triangle which is 680 feet wide at its upper or northern end and which narrows down to a sharp point at the southerly end. Mr. Whyte, in his evidence, admitted that such an irregularly shaped parcel does lead to difficulties and that the turning of a rectangular parcel into a wedge or pie-shaped parcel, which is a good graphic description of the result, would make it more difficult to develop. Yet, as I have pointed out, Mr. Whyte\u2019s valuation at 40 cents per square foot amounts to an increase over his valuation \u201cbefore\u201d expropriation. This difficulty in development was recognized by Schultz J.A., when he said:\nIt would appear that the larger triangular Area No. 2 is more difficult of development and is definitely less valuable. In effect, there is considerable agreement in the evidence of the two appraisers on this point, but Mr. Whyte admittedly made no allowance whatever for this fact\u2026.\nHaving regard to the facts I have stated, I am of the opinion that Mr. Farstad\u2019s valuation of $483,000 is the approximately correct one and I would adopt it. Deducting this amount from the $539,000 I have approved as the \u201cbefore taking\u201d valuation would leave the sum -of $56,000 as the amount of compensation payable to the applicant.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that Schultz J.A., has considered the matter upon proper and well-recognized principles in both the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d valuation and, therefore, I am of the opinion that the conclusion which he reached should be adopted.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal and increase the amount of the award to $56,000. Since the appellant, in Part IV of his factum, has stated that it desired that the Court of Appeal judgment be varied only to the extent of fixing the compensation at $56,000, the appellant should have its costs in this Court. The appellant, by the order of the Court of Appeal, was allowed the costs of the arbitration. In the net result, the judgment of the learned County Court Judge has been reduced from $90,000 to $56,000. The order of the Court of Appeal as to the costs of the appeal to that Court should not be disturbed.\nAppeal allowed with costs, ABBOTT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pitblado, Hoskin & Co., Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.C.

That vehicle was in collision with another motor vehicle owned by the respondent company and operated by its servant, the respondent M. The appellant instituted proceedings in the Exchequer Court against the respondents claiming damages to the full amount of the loss sustained by Her Majesty as a result of being deprived of B\u2019s services. The parties agreed that the collision resulted from the negligence of both R and M, and that the former was responsible for it to the extent of 75 per cent.\nSection 99(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, limits the liability of an owner or operator of a motor vehicle to a gratuitous passenger to cases of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the owner or operator. Section 5 of The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 266, provides that where no cause of action exists against the owner or operator of a motor vehicle by reason of the aforementioned enactment no damages or contribution or indemnity shall be recoverable from any person for the portion of the loss or damage caused by the negligence of such owner or operator; s. 9(2) of the same Act provides that the said Act applies to actions by and against the Crown, and that Her Majesty is bound thereby and has the benefit thereof.\nThere was no suggestion of gross negligence or of wilful or wanton misconduct on the part of R.\nThe question in issue was as to whether s. 5 of the latter Act is effective so as to limit the appellant\u2019s claim to 25 per cent of the damages sustained by Her Majesty because of the loss of B\u2019s services, or whether, notwithstanding that provision, there can be recovery of the total loss. The position taken by the appellant was that the Crown in the right of Canada cannot be bound by this provincial legislation because it was never intended to be made applicable to the appellant, and that, if it had been so intended, it would have been ultra vires of the Legislature of Manitoba. The President of the Exchequer Court, decided the issue in favour of the respondents and from that decision the Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe fact that liability may not be imposed upon the Crown, except by legislation in which the Sovereign is named, or that no other prerogative right may be extinguished unless the intention to do so is made manifest by naming the Crown, does not mean that the extent of the liability of a subject may be extended in a case of a claim by the Crown beyond the limit of the liability effectively declared by law. In the present case the Manitoba Legislature was the legislative body which had the necessary jurisdiction to declare such limit.\nThis was not a case in which a provincial legislature had sought to \u201cbind\u201d the federal Crown, in the sense of imposing a liability upon it or of derogating from existing Crown prerogatives, privileges or rights. The situation was that as a result of s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, Parliament enabled the Crown, in the event of an injury to a member of the armed services, to enforce such rights as would be available to a master seeking compensation for loss of the services of his injured servant. What those rights may be can only be determined by the law in force at the time and the place when and where the injury to the servant occurred.\nGartland Steamship Co. and LaBlanc v.

Munro, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nV. Simonsen, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The appellant instituted proceedings in the Exchequer Court against the respondents claiming damages to the full amount of the loss sustained by Her Majesty as a result of being deprived of the services of one Robert James Briggs, a member of the Canadian armed forces. He sustained personal injuries in a highway traffic accident in the Province of Manitoba, while being transported, as a guest without payment, in a motor vehicle owned by one Reykdal. That vehicle was in collision with another motor vehicle owned by the respondent company and operated by its servant, the respondent Murray. It is agreed that the collision resulted from the negligence of both Reykdal and Murray, and that the former was responsible for it to the extent of 75 per cent.\nSection 99(1) of The Highway Traffic Act of Manitoba, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, provides that:\n99. (1) No person transported by the owner or operator of a motor vehicle as his guest without payment for the transportation shall have a cause of action for damages against the owner or operator for injury, death, or loss, in case of accident, unless the accident was caused by the gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and unless the gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury, death, or loss for which the action is brought.\nSections 5 and 9(2) of The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 266, provide:\n5. Where no cause of action exists against the owner or operator of a motor vehicle by reason of section 99 of The Highway Traffic Act no damages or contribution or indemnity shall be recoverable from any person for the portion of the loss or damage caused by the negligence of such owner or operator and the portion of the loss or damage so caused by the negligence of such owner or operator shall be determined although such owner or operator is not a party to the action.\n9. (2) This Act applies to actions by and against the Crown, and Her Majesty is bound thereby and has the benefit thereof.\nThere is no suggestion of gross negligence or of wilful or wanton misconduct on the part of Reykdal.\nThe question in issue is as to whether s. 5 of the latter Act is effective so as to limit the appellant\u2019s claim to 25 per cent of the damages sustained by Her Majesty because of the loss of Briggs\u2019 services, or whether, notwithstanding that provision, there can be recovery of the total loss.\nThe position taken by the appellant is that the Crown in the right of Canada cannot be bound by this provincial legislation because it was never intended to be made applicable to the appellant, and that, if it had been so intended, it would have been ultra vires of the Legislature of Manitoba.\nThe learned President decided the issue in favour of the respondents and from that decision the present appeal is brought. His position is stated in his reasons for judgment as follows:\nIt follows that, as long as the Sovereign relies upon Her common law status as a person to take advantage of a cause of action available to persons generally in the province, and not upon some special right conferred on Her by Parliament, She must take the cause of action as She finds it when Her claim arises and, if the legislature of the province has changed the general rules applicable as between common subjects, the Sovereign must accept the cause of action as so changed whether the change favours Her claim or is adverse to it.\nTo put the matter in other terms, I have reached the conclusion that this case should be decided against the view put forward by the Attorney General, and in favour of that put forward by the defendant, because I am of opinion that, under our constitution, when the Sovereign in right of Canada relies upon a right in tort against a common person, She must, in the absence of some special prerogative or statutory right to the contrary, base Herself upon the general law in the province where the claim arises governing similar rights between common persons.\nIn The King v. Richardson[2], this Court decided that the relationship of master and servant between the Crown and a member of the armed forces was settled by the provision which is now s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, which provides that:\n50. For the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against Her Majesty, a person who was at any time since the 24th day of June, 1938, a member of the naval, army or air forces of Her Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nThe constitutional validity of this section was challenged in Nykorak v. Attorney General of Canada[3], and the provision was declared by this Court to be valid.\nThese cases do not go further than to hold that Parliament has properly declared the existence of a certain legal relationship between the Crown and members of the armed forces for the purpose of determining liability in an action by or against Her Majesty. Section 50 does not purport to establish what shall be the consequences of the relationship in any such action.\nIn Attorney General of Canada v. Jackson[4], it was held, in a case where a member of the armed services had been injured while travelling as a guest passenger in a motor vehicle, that the Crown could not recover damages from the driver of that vehicle because a provision of the Motor Vehicle Act of New Brunswick declared that the owner or driver of a motor vehicle not operated in the business of carrying passengers for hire or gain should not be liable for loss or damage sustained by a person being carried in such vehicle. This Court held that the Crown, as master, could not claim damages for injury to the servant where the latter had no right of action himself. The servant had no cause of action because of the effect of the provincial statute.\nIt was decided, in The Queen v. Sylvain[5], that, the common law action per quod servitium amisit not existing in the civil law, the Crown could not succeed in a claim under art. 1053 of the Civil Code for injuries sustained by members of the armed forces in a collision, in the Province of Quebec, between a military vehicle and that of the respondent, driven by his son.\nIn each of these cases the liability of a defendant to the Crown, in its capacity of master, was determined on the basis of the law of the province in which the injuries were sustained.\nThe applicability of provincial legislation to the federal Crown in a damage claim based upon negligence was also considered by this Court in Toronto Transportation Commission v. The King[6]. As a result of a collision between a street car and a Royal Canadian Air Force truck, an aircraft, loaded on the truck, was damaged. The trial judge found both drivers to be negligent and apportioned the responsibility equally between them. It was held by this Court that while, if the common law alone were applicable, the Crown\u2019s claim would fail, because it failed to prove that the negligence of the street car driver alone caused the damage, the Crown could take advantage of the Ontario Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 115, and could, pursuant to that statute, recover one-half of its damages.\nKerwin J. (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, said, at p. 515:\nThe Crown coming into Court could claim only on the basis of the law applicable as between subject and subject unless something different in the general law relating to the matter is made applicable to the Crown. \u2026.Here, if the common law alone were applicable, the Crown would have no claim by reason of the fact that it failed to prove that the negligence of the Commission\u2019s servants caused the damage\u2026.\nThe Crown is able to take advantage of the Ontario Negligence Act and is therefore entitled to one-half of the damages.\nThis was, of course, a case in which the Crown took advantage of a statutory provision which was in its favour. The right of a defendant, in an action by the Crown, to take advantage of a statute limiting the extent of liability was, however, considered by this Court in Gartland Steamship Co. and LaBlanc v. The Queen[7], in which the Crown claimed in respect of damage caused to its bridge by negligence in the operation of the appellant\u2019s vessel. One of the issues involved was as to whether the appellant could limit its liability to pay damages in accordance with ss. 649 and 651 of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934 (Can.), c. 44. The respondent contended that these sections could not be relied upon as against Her Majesty because the statute did not specifically apply to the Crown.\nLocke J., who, while he dissented on the apportionment of responsibility, delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court on this issue, said, at p. 345:\nThe effect of the sections of the Canada Shipping Act, however, are to declare and limit the extent of the liability of ship owners in accidents occurring without their own fault and privity. It cannot be said, in my opinion, that the Royal prerogative ever extended to imposing liability upon a subject to a greater extent than that declared by law by legislation lawfully enacted. The fact that liability may not be imposed upon the Crown, except by legislation in which the Sovereign is named, or that any of the other prerogative rights are not to be taken as extinguished unless the intention to do so is made manifest by naming the Crown, does not mean that the extent of the liability of a subject may be extended in a case of a claim by the Crown beyond the limit of the liability effectively declared by law.\nIn my opinion this proposition of law is applicable to the circumstances of the present case, and the fact that, in the Gartland case, the statute in question was a federal enactment, while in the present case it is provincial, does not affect the position. The words \u201climit of the liability effectively declared by law\u201d at the end of the statement must mean, in a federal state, effectively declared by that legislative body which has jurisdiction to declare such limit.\nThe Manitoba Legislature has created, in favour of the owner and the driver of a motor vehicle in that province, the right, in the event that injury is caused by that motor vehicle to a gratuitous passenger in another vehicle, the driver of which is not legally responsible to such passenger because of s. 99(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, to have their legal responsibility to pay damages limited to that portion of the loss or damage caused by the negligence of the driver of that motor vehicle. That right is a civil right created by statute enacted by the legislative body which had the necessary jurisdiction. This legislation did not affect any previously existing right of the Crown in the right of Canada created by competent federal legislation. Nor did it affect any prerogative right of the Crown. The appellant would have had no right of recovery at all had it not been for s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act. But, as has already been noted, that section did not create a right of recovery. It merely established a relationship from which certain results might flow.\nTo put the matter in another way, this is not a case in which a provincial legislature has sought to \u201cbind\u201d the federal Crown, in the sense of imposing a liability upon it or of derogating from existing Crown prerogatives, privileges or rights. The situation is that as a result of s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, Parliament enabled the Crown, in the event of an injury to a member of the armed services, to enforce such rights as would be available to a master seeking compensation for loss of the services of his injured servant. What those rights may be can only be determined by the law in force at the time and the place when and where the injury to the servant occurred.\nThe appellant placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in Gauthier v. The King[8], which was given careful consideration by the learned President. In that case, the federal government agreed to purchase from the appellant certain fishing rights, the price to be settled by arbitration. Each party selected an arbitrator, and those two chose a third, but, before proceedings were taken, the government revoked the submission and declared its intention to abandon the purchase. Section 5 of the Ontario Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 65, made a submission to arbitration irrevocable except by leave of the Court. Section 3 provided that the Act should apply to an arbitration to which His Majesty was a party. The question in issue was as to whether the government could revoke the submission and pay damages for breach of the agreement to arbitrate or whether the Crown was bound by the arbitration award, which had been made, after the withdrawal of the government appointed arbitrator, by other arbitrators. It was held in this Court that s. 5 did not apply to a submission by the Crown in the right of Canada. In my opinion that case is not analogous to the present one. The Gauthier case was one in which it was sought to impose a contractual liability upon the federal Crown by virtue of a provincial statute which had changed the common law with respect to the revocation of a submission to arbitration. Anglin J., who delivered the reasons accepted by the majority of the Court, drew a distinction between cases falling within s. 19 (now 17) of the Exchequer Court Act and those falling within s. 20 (now 18) of that Act. Section 19 gave to the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to deal with liabilities (in posse) of the Crown already existing. With regard to those, he said, there was no ground for holding that the Crown had renounced prerogative privileges theretofore enjoyed and submitted its rights to be disposed of according to the law in like cases applicable as between subject and subject.\nThe claim in issue, being one of contract, was within s. 19, and the law to be applied, the cause of action having arisen in Ontario, was the common law, except as modified by a statute binding upon the federal Crown. He regarded the common law right to revoke the authority of an arbitrator as being a privilege of the Crown, which could not be taken away or abridged by provincial legislation.\nOn the other hand, he recognized that s. 20 of the Act had created and imposed new liabilities on the Crown, and that the authorities had decided that in cases falling within that section the Crown\u2019s liability would be determined according to the existing general law applicable as between subject and subject. The reason for this was that \u201cNo other law than that applicable between subject and subject was indicated in the \u2018Exchequer Court Act\u2019 as that by which these newly created liabilities should be determined.\u201d (See p. 191.)\nIt may be noted that it was s. 20 which imposed a liability upon the Crown in respect of injury caused by the negligence of a servant of the Crown.\nThe present case deals with a claim in negligence by the Crown against a subject. It could arise only because of the master and servant relationship deemed to exist between the Crown and members of the armed services by virtue of s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act. In my view that section likewise did not indicate that the legal consequences ensuing from that legislation would be determined by any law other than the provincial law applicable between subject and subject.\nFor that reason, even if the decision reached on the facts of the Gauthier case be accepted (as to which, as the learned President points out, some question is raised by the later decision of the Privy Council in Dominion Building Corporation v. The King[9], respecting the application of a provincial statute to a contract made by the federal Crown), it does not assist the appellant in this case.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E.A.

Section 4 of the Act imposes a tax on the net profits of the sales of ore and also upon estimated net profits on unsold ore based upon actual market value. The trial judge ruled that the statute was intra vires in so far as it imposed a tax on the output sold during the mine\u2019s calendar year; that this aspect of the tax was severable; and that in so far as the statute imposed a tax on output not sold during the calendar year but treated or in the course of treatment, the statute was ultra vires. The Court of Appeal held that the tax imposed by the Mining Tax Act was intra vires in toto as being a direct tax. The plaintiff company appealed to this Court where the constitutional question raised was stated as follows: \u201cWhether section 4 and related sections of the Mining Tax Act, being chapter 237 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1950 as amended by...is ultra vires the Legislature of the province of Ontario in so far as the tax purported to be imposed by that section and the related sections is an indirect tax.\u201d\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wells J.

On October 3, 1961, the respondent made an assignment in bankruptcy and on January 11, 1962, an order was made for his unconditional discharge. The credit union did not prove its claim in the bankruptcy. On April 26, 1965, the credit union filed the assignment with the respondent\u2019s employer and requested the latter to act upon it. The respondent then sought a declaration that he was released from all debts and liabilities incurred by him on or before October 3, 1961, and that the assignment of wages was void and unenforceable. He relied on s. 136(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, which provides that \u201cAn order of discharge releases the bankrupt from all other claims provable in bankruptcy\u201d. The judge of first instance and the Court of Appeal held in favour of the respondent. With leave, the credit union appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe borrowing by the respondent from the credit union created a debt provable in bankruptcy. The debt was not proved in bankruptcy, and it was now gone by operation of law. The assignment was given as a means of collection of the debt. The statutory release of the debtor under the Bankruptcy Act rendered the assignment ineffective as a means of collection.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal by the appellant credit union from an order of Moorhouse J. Appeal dismissed.\nN.R.H. Young and R. Atamanuk, for the appellant.\nR.H. Frayne, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014In Holy Rosary Parish (Thorold) Credit Union Ltd. v. Premier Trust Company[2], the Premier Trust Company, as trustee in bankruptcy of one Robitaille, a wage-earner, sought a declaration that an assignment of wages given by Robitaille to the credit union was void and unenforceable against it. This application was eventually dismissed in this Court but, at the same time, the Court said that the effect of the discharge of the bankrupt upon the credit union\u2019s right to obtain a portion of the wages earned by the bankrupt after his discharge was not in issue in the appeal and that the Court expressed no opinion thereon. This problem is now before the Court. On May 30, 1961, Bye obtained a loan from Holy Rosary Parish (Thorold) Credit Union Limited and at the same time assigned 30 per cent of his wages. The assignment reads:\nASSIGNMENT OF WAGES\nFor value received, I hereby transfer, assign and set over unto the Holy Rosary Parish (Thorold) Credit Union Limited, (hereinafter referred to as the assignee), 30 per cent of all wages, salary, commission and other monies owing to me, or hereafter to become owing to me or earned by me in the employ of Overland Transport Co. or any other person, firm or corporation by whom I may be hereafter employed.\nAND I HEREBY AUTHORIZE AND DIRECT my said employer or any future employer to pay the said 30 per cent of all wages, salary, commissions and other monies to the assignee, and I hereby constitute the assignee my attorney irrevocable to take all proceedings which may be proper and necessary for the recovery of any amount or amounts above assigned and to give receipts for same, or any part thereof, in my name, and I hereby release and discharge my said employers and each of them from all liability to me for or on account of any or all monies paid in accordance with the terms hereof.\nThis is the same form of assignment that was under consideration in the Premier Trust case and appears to be authorized by s. 7(6) of The Wages Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 421, as amended by 9-10 Elizabeth II, c. 103. This subsection reads:\n(6) Any contract hereafter made may provide for the assignment by the debtor to the creditor of a portion of the debtor\u2019s wages up to but not exceeding the portion thereof that is liable to attachment or seizure under this section, and any provision of any contract hereafter made that provides for the assignment by the debtor to the creditor of a greater portion of the debtor\u2019s wages than is permissible under this subsection is invalid.\nOn October 3, 1961, Bye made an assignment in bankruptcy. On January 11, 1962, an order was made for his unconditional discharge from bankruptcy. On April 26, 1965, the credit union filed the assignment with Overland Express Limited and requested them to act upon it. Bye then brought a motion for an order declaring\n(a) that he was released from all debts and liabilities incurred by him on or before the 3rd of October 1961; and\n(b) that the assignment of wages was now void and unenforceable.\nBye relies upon the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, s. 135(2), which reads:\n135.(2) An order of discharge releases the bankrupt from all other claims provable in bankruptcy. There is no doubt that the borrowing by Bye from the credit union did create a debt provable in bankruptcy. The credit union did not prove in bankruptcy. The debt has now gone by operation of law. The assignment was given as a means of collection of the debt. The statutory release of the debtor under the Bankruptcy Act renders the assignment ineffective as a means of collection. Both the judge of first instance and the Court of Appeal have so held and in my opinion correctly.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Young & McNamara, Thorold.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Freeman & Frayne, St. Catharines.\n[1] (1966), 54 D.L.R.

The appellant and the Minister of Labour for Manitoba agreed that the appellant should deposit a sum of money in the Employees\u2019 Wages Trust Account, an account in the control of the Minister of Labour. The amount of that sum of money should be determined by the decision as to whether the appellant\u2019s operations were governed under the provisions of The Employment Standards Act or The Construction Industry Act, and such determination would be made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench upon application on behalf of the Minister of Labour. Thereafter an application was made by the respondent Attorney-General. The trial court judge found that the appellant\u2019s operations were within The Employment Standards Act and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. A further appeal was then brought to this Court.\nThe issue was to determine whether or not the appellant\u2019s operations fell within s. 25(d) of The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20. Section 25(d) in defining \u201cplant\u201d refers to Schedule A, item 1 of which reads: \u201cMining, quarrying and other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth.\u201d\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe word \u201cmining\u201d itself was sufficient to cover the appellant\u2019s operations. Davvell v. Roper (1855), 24 L.J. Ch. 779; Re Morgan, Vachell v. Morgan, [1914] 1 Ch. 910, applied.\nIf the phrase \u201cother works for the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d were to be taken as modifying or limiting the word \u201cmining\u201d, the appellant\u2019s operations would still be covered. The purpose to be attained by the performance of the appellant\u2019s contract was the extraction from the earth of valuable minerals and therefore the construction was for that purpose. The driving into the earth of the shafts, and the driving therefrom of horizontal drifts, was mining.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Wilson J. Appeal dismissed.\nAlan Sweatman, Q.C., and T.G. Mathers, for the appellant.\nA. Kerr Twaddle, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Wilson J.\nThe matter came before the learned trial judge on an agreed statement of facts which is quite brief and which I quote:\nAGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS\nPatrick Harrison & Company Limited (hereinafter called \u201cthe Company\u201d) is a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada and is under contract with International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited (hereinafter called \u201cInternational\u201d) a company with which it has no connection other than under such contracts to prepare shafts and drifts for mines to be used by International for the extraction of minerals at two locations in Manitoba, namely, Thompson and Birchtree. Each undertaking is the subject of a separate contract. A true copy of the contract with respect to the Birchtree undertaking is attached hereto marked Exhibit A. The contract with respect to the undertaking at Thompson is in the same terms except for the specifications as to the work to be performed. The location of each of the undertakings is within one of the areas set out in Schedule B of The Employment Standards Act.\nAt each location, the Company\u2019s heavy equipment consists of compressors, hoists, clams used for sinking shafts which hang from mine timbers, drills, Euclid Trucks and bulldozers.\nAn outline of the work done by the Company is as follows:\nThe area where the shaft is to be sunk is prepared for excavation and the shaft collar is then made down to bed rock in which the bearing timbers are inserted and cemented in. Over this the head frame is built with a bind for the disposal of waste rock. The head frame holds the sheave wheels over which the bucket cables are operated to remove waste rock.\nAfter the collar and the head frame are constructed, benching is commenced, that is, the sides of the shafts are excavated alternatively so that the workmen always have a shelf from which to work. This is continued until the shaft is excavated to the contract depth.\nAs work in the shaft progresses stations are built at designated levels. These stations are starting points for the drifts.\nWhen the shaft is completed, drifts are then driven from the stations in a direction requested by International to the main ore bodies. From the drifts, raises are driven from one level to the other. In the process of driving the drifts track and pipes for water, air and electricity are installed. Once the shaft, drifts and raises are completed the Company is through with its work and International moves in to commence the extraction of ore.\nThe company may on occasions encounter small ore bodies in the process of driving drifts and raises and this ore is put to one side for International. The Company is in no way responsible for the actual extraction of ore.\nOccasionally after the shaft is sunk and the stations constructed, the Company is not called upon to drive the drifts as the station is close enough to the main ore body for International to commence mining from the stations. Not all shafts that are sunk turn out to be mines as International, depending on geological tests, etc., may decide to move elsewhere. The Company sinks a shaft under a separate contract and the driving of drifts in each shaft sunk is a separate contract to the sinking of the shaft. The two shafts in question with drifts from them are however now operating mines.\nInternational treated the payments to the Company under both contracts as capital costs of the mine and not as expenses of operating the mine.\nOn its payroll the Company has designated certain employees as \u201cminers\u201d, \u201ctimbermen\u201d, \u201choistmen\u201d and \u201ctrackmen\u201d.\nAttached hereto is a specimen of the Company\u2019s stationery.\nThe appellant and the Minister of Labour for the Province of Manitoba agreed that the appellant should deposit a sum of money in the Employees\u2019 Wages Trust Account, an account in the control of the Minister of Labour. The amount of that sum of money should be determined by the decision as to whether the appellant\u2019s opera- tions were governed under the provisions of The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20, or The Construction Industry Wages Act, 1964 (Man.), c. 9, and such determination would be made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench upon application on behalf of the Minister of Labour. Thereafter, an application was made by the respondent Attorney-General to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench under the provisions of Rule 536 of that Court which Rule is in the following terms:\n536. Where the rights of any person depend on the construction of any statute, by-law, deed, will, or other instrument, he may apply by way of originating notice, on notice to all parties concerned, to have his rights declared and determined.\nIt will be seen that the whole issue is to determine whether or not the appellant\u2019s operations fall within s. 25(d) of the said Employment Standards Act. That section is, in fact, a definition section, and cl. (d) defines \u201cplant\u201d as follows:\n(d) \u201cplant\u201d means any establishment, works, or undertaking, in or about any industry set out in Schedule A, but does not include any municipal or other public body.\nSchedule A referred to in the definition has as item 1:\n1. Mining, quarrying and other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth.\nThe learned trial court judge was of the opinion that the words \u201cfor the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d related to the immediately antecedent words \u201cother works\u201d, and that they therefore could not be taken to define the word \u201cmining\u201d. The learned judge examined the contract between the appellant and the mine owner, the International Nickel Company of Canada Limited, in detail, to determine whether the subject of that contract was \u201cmining\u201d as that word had been construed in a series of cases to which he referred.\nConsidering the words mining and quarrying alone, with respect, I am in full agreement with the conclusions of the learned trial judge, that the operations of the appellant company would certainly come within the word \u201cmining\u201d. I need cite only two authorities which I adopt in coming to that conclusion. In Davvell v. Roper[1], Kindersley, V.C., said at p. 780:\nMining is when you begin on the surface, and, by sinking shafts, you work underground in a horizontal direction, making a tunnel as you proceed, and leaving a roof overhead.\nAnd in Re Morgan, Vachell v. Morgan[2], Sargant J. said at p. 918:\nThe sinking of the shaft is obviously a process for the performance of working the mines and forms part of the working of the mines, although no single piece of coal should in fact be hewn.\nThe words of the Schedule, however, were not simply mining and quarrying but \u201cmining, quarrying and other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d. As I have said, the learned trial judge took the words \u201cfor the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d as relating only to the immediately antecedent words \u201cother works\u201d. That interpretation would result in three categories being dealt with in the Schedule:\n(a) mining,\n(b) quarrying, and\n(c) other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth.\nIt is difficult to understand why mining should be separated from other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth by the insertion between those two categories of quarrying. It would have appeared more logical to have had the Schedule read:\n(a) mining,\n(b) other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth, and\n(c) quarrying.\nFor the purpose of the present case, however, it is not necessary to consider whether the Schedule applies to the operation of quarrying without the removal of minerals from the earth. The Schedule certainly does apply to mining and to other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth. As I have said, the word \u201cmining\u201d itself is sufficient to cover the appellant\u2019s operations. If the phrase \u201cother works for the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d were to be taken as modifying or limiting the word \u201cmining\u201d, the appellant\u2019s operations would still be covered. The services performed by the appellant under its contract with the International Nickel Company were \u201cmining\u2026 for the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d. The word \u201cfor\u201d is an ordinary English word and should be so interpreted. The fourth meaning assigned to that word in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary and that which I believe is the applicable meaning in the phrase under consideration is \u201cwith the object or purpose of\u201d. The only object or purpose to be attained by the performance of the contract between the appellant and the International Nickel Company was the extraction from the earth of valuable minerals and therefore the construction was for that purpose. Certainly the driving into the earth of those shafts, and the driving therefrom of horizontal drifts, was mining.\nIt should be remembered that what is brought within the provisions of the statute is \u201cany works or undertaking in or about any industry\u201d set out in the Schedule. Certainly a work such as that constructed by the appellant under the contract was a work in or about the industry of mining for the extraction of minerals from the earth. Indeed, the minerals could not be extracted without the construction of the work by the International Nickel Company of Canada Limited or, as in the present case, by a contractor.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nJUDSON J.:\u2014I agree with Spence J. subject to this. I agree with the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal that the words in question mean:\n(a) mining;\n(b) quarrying, and\n(c) other works for the extraction of minerals from the earth,\nand that \u201cmining\u201d and \u201cquarrying\u201d are not modified by the words \u201cfor the extraction of minerals from the earth\u201d.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pitblado, Hoskin & Co., Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Johnson, Jessiman, Gardner, Twaddle & Johnson, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1855), 24 L.J.

The profits from these transactions were held to be a part of the respondent\u2019s income. In 1961, the respondent sold his entire portfolio of second mortgages to the company of which he was the controlling shareholder. The purchase price paid to him exceeded the amount owing to him on the mortgages by the sum of $28,896.71. The Minister taxed this profit as income. The Exchequer Court held that immediately before and at the time of the sale in question the respondent patently was in the money lending business, and that the profit realized from the sale was a capital profit and not subject to tax. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nAs the profits which were derived from the second mortgages were taxable, it appears that their cost or value was relevant in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income from his loan business, and that they therefore constituted inventory within the meaning of s. 139(1) of the Income Tax Act. Section 85E(1) of the Act was therefore applicable and the sale was deemed to have been made in the course of carrying on the money lending business. The profit was therefore taxable.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Pr\u00eat sur seconde hypoth\u00e8que\u2014Entreprise de bailleur de fonds\u2014Vente du portefeuille de secondes hypoth\u00e8ques\u2014Vente d\u2019inventaire\u2014Profit sujet \u00e0 la taxe\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 3, 4, 85E(1), 139(1)(e), (w).\nLe contribuable \u00e9tait l\u2019actionnaire ayant le contr\u00f4le d\u2019une compagnie qui pr\u00eatait sur hypoth\u00e8que. Dans le but de fournir aux emprunteurs des fonds additionnels, le contribuable avancait de son propre argent, avec escompte, sur des secondes hypoth\u00e8ques. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que les profits provenant de ces transactions faisaient partie des revenus du contribuable. En 1961, le contribuable a vendu tout son portefeuille de secondes hypoth\u00e8ques \u00e0 la compagnie dont il avait le contr\u00f4le. Le prix d\u2019achat exc\u00e9dait par la somme de $28,896.71 le montant qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb sur les hypoth\u00e8ques. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 ce profit comme \u00e9tant un revenu. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019imm\u00e9diatement avant et au temps m\u00eame de la vente, le contribuable exploitait une entreprise de bailleur de fonds, et que le profit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par la vente \u00e9tait un profit de capital et non sujet \u00e0 la taxe. Le Ministre en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel du Ministre doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nComme les profits provenant des secondes hypoth\u00e8ques \u00e9taient sujets \u00e0 la taxe, il semble que leur co\u00fbt ou valeur avait une pertinence dans la computation des revenus du contribuable provenant de son entreprise de pr\u00eateur, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence ils constituaient un inventaire dans le sens de l\u2019art. 139(1) de la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu. L\u2019article 85E(1) de la loi \u00e9tait donc applicable et la vente \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le cours de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise de bailleur de fonds. Le profit \u00e9tait donc sujet \u00e0 la taxe.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nG.W. Ainslie, for the appellant.\nArnold F. Moir, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 allowing an appeal from the respondent\u2019s income tax assessment for the year 1962 and holding that the profit which the respondent realized from the sale in 1961 of all the second mortgages which he then held to Associated Investors of Canada Ltd. (hereinafter called \u201cAssociated\u201d), a company of which he was for all practical purposes the sole shareholder, was a capital profit and therefore not subject to tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nThe learned trial judge has found that immediately before and at the time when the sale in question was concluded the respondent \u201cpatently was in the money lending business\u201d and that the bonuses received from second mortgages held by him were taxable as income. The ques- tion raised by this appeal, however, is whether the profit which he realized on the sale of all the second mortgages which were then in his investment portfolio was a profit from the sale of his second mortgage business as a going concern, or whether it was simply a profit from the sale in bulk of his then existing inventory of second mortgages.\nIn conducting his mortgage loan business between 1949 and 1952, it was the respondent\u2019s usual practice to advance to the borrowers 85 per cent of the face value of the mortgages and to then assign and sell the mortgages at their face value to Associated. The profits from these transactions were held to be a part of the respondent\u2019s income in the case of Curlett v. Minister of National Revenue[2].\nBefore concluding the transaction which gave rise to the profit, the character of which is now in dispute, the respondent had changed his method of doing business so that the security given by the borrower was a first mortgage in the name of Associated and a second mortgage in the respondent\u2019s own name, it being understood that the discount to be received by the respondent was to be calculated on the basis of the amount advanced by both Associated and himself, although Associated was not entitled to any part of the discount. All the mortgages that were sold to Associated in 1961 were of this latter type and the net result of the sale was that the purchase price paid to the respondent exceeded the amount owing to him on the mortgages by the sum of $28,896.71, and it is this profit which was not received by the respondent until 1962 which the Minister of National Revenue claims to be taxable as income.\nAt the outset it appears to me to be convenient to reproduce the following relevant sections of the Income Tax Act:\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year. 85E.(1) Where, upon or after disposing of or ceasing to carry on a business or a part of a business, a taxpayer has sold all or any part of the property that was included in the inventory of the business, the property so sold shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to have been sold by him\n(a) during the last taxation year in which he carried on the business or the part of the business, and\n(b) in the course of carrying on the business.\n139. (1) In this Act,\u2026\n(w) \u201cinventory\u201d means a description of property the cost or value of which is relevant in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income from a business for a taxation year;\u2026\nI agree with the finding of the learned trial judge to which I have referred that at the time when the sale of these second mortgages was concluded the respondent \u201cpatently was in the money lending business\u201d and as the profits which he derived from his second mortgages were taxable it appears to me that their \u201ccost or value\u201d was relevant in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income from his loan business, and that they therefore constituted \u201cinventory\u201d within the meaning of s. 139(1) of the Income Tax Act.\nIt is noted by Martland J. in Frankel Corporation Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[3] that s. 85E of the Act had no application to that case because it only became effective in respect of sales made after April 5, 1955. That section, however, undoubtedly, applies to the present case and I am unable to escape the conclusion that in making the sale to Associated Mr. Curlett was disposing of at least a part of his money lending business and that the sale which he made was a sale of property which was included in the inventory of that business. I am, therefore, of the opinion that it was a sale made \u201cin the course of carrying on the business\u201d and was income from that business within the meaning of s. 3 of the Income Tax Act.\nIn holding that the profit made by Mr. Curlett on his sale to Associated was not to be related to the sale of the mortgages but was rather to be treated as the amount paid for his \u201csubstantial money lending business as a going concern\u201d, the learned trial judge said:\nOn the facts of this case, I am of opinion that the said sum of $28,896.71 was not a receipt by the appellant of any part of the discounts or bonuses incorporated in the principal sums payable under these said second mortgages. Instead, it was part of the purchase monies received by him in a bona fide realization sale to Associated Investors of Canada Limited of all the assets of his substantial money-lending business as a going concern.\nWith the greatest respect, I am unable to attach any reality to the conception of \u201cgoing concern\u201d value as an element in a transaction whereby Mr. Curlett sold his inventory of second mortgages to the company which already held all the first mortgages and of which he was, for all practical purposes, the only shareholder.\nFor these reasons, I would allow this appeal and restore the assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue in respect of the profit of $28,896.71 realized by the respondent in the year 1962 from the sale of his second mortgages to Associated. The appellant will have his costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nNo appeal has been asserted in relation to the other questions which were determined by the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A.

At the time of his apprehension, the appellant was in an impaired condition behind the steering wheel of his car with the key in the ignition. The car was in a ditch and could not move under its own power until it was extricated by a tow. The Crown appealed by way of a stated case. The appeal was allowed and the case remitted to the magistrate. A further appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without written reasons. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following point of law: \u201cIs an automobile, which cannot be set in motion by its own power, by reason of conditions existing at the time of the alleged offence, a \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 within the meaning of those words where they appear in the phrase \u2018care and control of a motor vehicle\u2019 in section 223 of the Criminal Code?\u201d\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe true object of the provisions of ss. 222 and 223 of the Code is to cope with and protect the person and the property from the danger which is inherent in the driving, care or control of a motor vehicle by anyone who is intoxicated or under the influence of a drug or whose ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug. The definition of motor vehicle in s. 2(25) of the Code refers to the type, the nature and not the actual operability or effective functioning of the particular vehicle. It is therefore immaterial if a motor vehicle, at the time of the alleged offence, cannot be set in motion by its own power by reason of internal or external conditions.\nDroit criminel\u2014V\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur\u2014Garde ou contr\u00f4le alors que la capacit\u00e9 de conduire est affaiblie\u2014V\u00e9hicule dans un foss\u00e9 et incapable de se mouvoir de son propre pouvoir\u2014L\u2019automobile est-elle un \u00abv\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur\u00bb\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 2(25), 222, 223.\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9, par un magistrat, de l\u2019offense d\u2019avoir conduit une automobile alors que sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e9tait affaiblie, pour le motif que l\u2019automobile n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur dans le sens de l\u2019art. 223 du Code criminel.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, affirming a decision of Balfour J. Appeal dismissed.\nRobert Carleton, for the appellant.\nSerge Kujawa, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The appellant was charged with having, on the 6th day of October A.D. 1963, at Herbert District, in the province of Saskatchewan, the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired, committing thereby the offence described in s. 223 of the Criminal Code. To this charge, he pleaded not guilty and was ultimately acquitted by Police Magistrate C.W. Vause.\nDissatisfied with this determination of the case, as being erroneous in point of law, the Attorney General for the province appealed to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[1], by way of a stated case. The relevant facts and grounds, as well as the question submitted for the consideration of the Court, are set forth in the following terms by the Magistrate:\nIn the early morning, 1.20 a.m., on the 6th day of October, 1963, the accused was found in an automobile in the ditch on the west side of the highway and off the travelled portion thereof. He was asleep seated behind the steering wheel, the key was in the ignition switch, and the ignition was turned off. The motor was not running but was capable of running, as Constable Burch of the R.C.M. Police had attempted to drive the automobile out of the ditch without success and later, after it had been extricated by a tow, drove the automobile back to Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The automobile was at right angles to the highway with the rear wheels in the ditch, while the two front wheels were on the shoulder of the gravel road. The left rear wheel of the automobile was completely clear and would spin freely. The position of the vehicle in the ditch, plus that fact that it was, what is commonly known as \u2018high centered\u2019, prevented movement of the automobile under its own power, and it was absolutely necessary for it to be extricated from its position in the ditch by means of a winch on a tow truck.\nThe evidence clearly indicated that the accused was in an impaired condition at the time of apprehension.\nThere is no evidence to establish that the accused did not enter or mount the automobile for the purpose of setting it in motion.\nPart of a case of beer was found in the rear seat of the automobile.\nNo evidence was adduced to prove the condition of the accused when his automobile left the highway. There was no positive or reliable proof as to the length of time the automobile of the accused had been in the ditch before the arrival of the police constables or when or where he had consumed intoxicating liquor.\nI found as a fact that the accused was in an impaired condition at the time of apprehension by the R.C.M. Police.\nI found as a fact that the accused had care or control of the vehicle at the time of his apprehension.\nI found as a fact that it was absolutely necessary to have the vehicle extricated from its position in the ditch by means of a winch on a tow truck.\nI found as a fact that the vehicle in its position in the ditch was not a danger to the public or property as contemplated by Section 223 of the Criminal Code.\n* * *\nCASE:\n(1) The proceeding was questioned on one ground, namely:\nThat I erred in my finding of law, namely: that the automobile was not a motor vehicle within the meaning of Section 223 of the Criminal Code.\nWith respect to ground (1), in view of the fact that I found the vehicle was not a danger to the public or property as contemplated by Section 223 of the Criminal Code, due to its position in the ditch and my finding of fact that it was absolutely necessary to have the automobile extricated from the position in the ditch by means of a winch on a tow truck, I was of the opinion that the vehicle was not a motor vehicle. I came to the said conclusion based on the test of whether a vehicle is a motor vehicle within the meaning of Section 223, as decided by Rex v. Thornton, 96 C.C.C. The test as stated in the said case was simply whether or not it did constitute a danger such as was contemplated by Section 223.\nThe appeal was heard by Mr. Justice Balfour of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. In his reasons for judgment, the learned judge referred particularly to and quoted extensively from the reasons of MacDonald J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta, in R. v. Rye[2], and from the reasons given by Ilsley C.J., and concurred in by the majority, in the decision of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia, in R. v. Wolfe[3]. On the authority of the decisions of these two Courts of Appeal, Mr. Justice Balfour decided that the Magistrate, in the case at bar, did err in his finding of law that the automobile was not a motor vehicle within the meaning of s. 223 of the Criminal Code and hence remitted the case to the Magistrate for determination in the light of this finding.\nAn appeal was then entered from this decision to the Court of Appeal of the province of Saskatchewan. The Court, constituted of Culliton C.J.A., Hall and Maguire JJ.A., dismissed this appeal, but did not deliver any written reasons.\nAppellant finally sought and obtained leave to appeal to this Court on the following point of law:\nIs an automobile, which cannot be set in motion by its own power, by reason of conditions existing at the time of the alleged offence, a \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 within the meaning of those words where they appear in the phrase \u2018care and control of a motor vehicle\u2019 in section 223 of the Criminal Code?\nHaving heard counsel for the appellant and retired to further consider the matter, the Court then informed counsel for respondent that it was not necessary to hear him and, indicating that reasons for judgment would be later delivered, the Court dismissed the appeal.\nIn the consideration of the question, it is appropriate to note that conditions, preventing an automobile to be set in motion on its own power, are, according to their nature, conveniently differentiated as being either internal, such as, for example, a lack of gasoline, a mechanical breakdown or the like, or external, such as, for instance, a loss of traction attributable to the miring of the automobile in snow or mud. The above question, in the scope of which both internal and external conditions are contemplated, has given rise to conflicting judicial opinions in cases decided under the former Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1947, c. 36, as well as, though to a much lesser and decreasing degree, in those decided under the new Criminal Code. Most of the cases are reviewed in an article mentioned by Mr. Justice Balfour and written by L.K. Graburn\u2014cf. vol. 1 (1958-59) of The Criminal Law Quarterly,\u2014and little would be gained by discussing them here. Sufficient it is, I think, to quote the provisions of s. 2(25) and the relevant parts of ss. 222 and 223 of the Criminal Code and then indicate and consider the nature and basis of the conflict.\n2. In this Act,\n(25) \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d means a vehicle that is drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than by muscular power, but does not include a vehicle of a railway that operates on rails;\n* * *\n222. Every one who, while intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of\u2026\n223. Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable\u2026\nIt should be noted that there was no definition of motor vehicle, in the former Code, and that the present definition was introduced with and at the time of the coming into force of the new Code, to wit, on the 1st of April 1955.\nObviously, every one agrees that the true object of the provisions of ss. 222 and 223 is to cope with and protect the person and the property from the danger which is inherent in the driving, care or control of a motor vehicle by anyone who is intoxicated or under the influence of a drug or whose ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug. At this point, however, the unanimity ends and the conflict arises.\nIn one category of cases, it is held that since protection against the above danger is the true and sole object of the legislation, it follows that, if, when the involved automobile cannot be set in motion by its own power by reason of conditions existing at the time of the alleged offence, there is actually or potentially no such danger, then the automobile cannot be said to be a motor vehicle within the meaning which ought to be given to these words in the context of ss. 222 and 223 and, in such circumstances, these sections have no application. This interpretation is held to be unaffected by reason of s. 2(25) for, defining as it does, motor vehicle as a vehicle that is drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than by muscular power, this definition, it is said, contemplates a motor vehicle actually free of internal or external conditions preventing it to move by its own power. In the other category of cases, it is held that the fact that a motor vehicle is not free of such conditions at the time of the alleged offence, is entirely immaterial. That this is so, since at least the introduction in the legislation of the statutory definition of motor vehicle, is uncontrovertible for, it is said, the definition refers to the type, the nature and not the actual operability or effective functioning of this particular vehicle.\nIn my respectful opinion, the holding in the latter category of cases is the correct one, and R. v. Rye, supra, and R. v. Wolfe, supra, were rightly decided, as also were, amongst others, the cases of R. v. Weaver[4] and R. v. Simpson[5], where the lack of danger alleged and pleaded in defense, was related, in the first case, to an internal condition, and in the second case, to an external condition. The definition of a motor vehicle is in plain and ordinary language. It contemplates a kind of vehicle, not its actual operability or functioning. Its application is not confined to a portion of the Code, it extends uniformly throughout. The definitions of the offences mentioned in ss. 222 and 223 are also couched in a language that is plain and simple and in which nothing, either expressed or implied, indicates an intent of Parliament to exact, in every case, as being one of the ingredients of the offences, the proof of the presence of some element of actual or potential danger or to accept, as a valid defense, the absence of any. On the contrary, these and the other related provisions of the Code manifest the determination of Parliament to strike at the very root of the evil, to wit: the combination of alcohol and automobile, that normally breeds this element of danger which this preventive legislation is meant to anticipate.\nWe are unanimously of the opinion that the question, upon which leave to appeal was granted, must receive an affirmative answer and, for that reason, the appeal, as above indicated, was dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.C.

Included in his estate were shares of a company incorporated in Newfoundland and all the issued shares of a company incorporated in Manitoba. The Newfoundland company maintained several registers for the transfer of shares, including one in Ontario. The Manitoba company maintained only one such register and that was at its head office in Winnipeg. The estate claimed that it was entitled, in computing the estate tax payable, to a provincial tax credit in respect of these shares because their situs was in Ontario, a prescribed province. The Exchequer Court held that the shares of both companies were situated in Ontario. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal as to the shares in the Manitoba company should be allowed; the Minister\u2019s appeal as to the shares in the Newfoundland company should be dismissed.\nAs was held by the Tax Appeal Board and by the Exchequer Court, the situs of the shares of the Newfoundland company was in Ontario.\nAs to the shares in the Manitoba company, the condition prescribed in s. 9(8)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act was not fulfilled. Consequently for the purposes of the Act, the situs of these shares was governed by s. 9(8)(d)(ii). The wording of s. 9(8)(d) is mandatory and appears to be clear and free from any ambiguity. Under its terms, the shares in the Manitoba company were deemed to be situated in Manitoba.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t successoral\u2014Cr\u00e9dit pour taxes provinciales\u2014Situs des actions d\u2019une compagnie\u2014Registre de transferts ou lieu de transfert\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, arts. 9(1)(a), 9(8)(d).\nLors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, le de cujus \u00e9tait domicili\u00e9 en Ontario.

Appel maintenu en partie.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an estate tax matter. Appeal allowed in part.\nD.G.H. Bowman and G.V. Anderson, for the appellant.\nDonald A. Keith, Q.C., and Frank K. Roberts, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWEIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment1 of Gibson J. allowing an appeal by the respondent and dismissing a cross-appeal by the appellant from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board and declaring that under the provisions of the Estate Tax Act, Statutes of Canada 1958, 7 Elizabeth II, c. 29, certain shares owned by the deceased Adam Newton Leckie were property situate in the Province of Ontario, which is a prescribed province.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts.\nThe questions which arise are as to the situs for the purpose of section 9 of the Estate Tax Act of (i) 30,003 common shares and 165 preferred shares of the capital stock of Leckie Enterprises Limited and (ii) 300 shares of the capital stock of Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company Limited.\nAs to the shares in Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company Limited, the Court at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant stated that it was not necessary to call upon counsel for the respondent as on this point we were all in agreement with the reasons and conclusion of the Tax Appeal Board which were concurred in by Gibson J.\nIt remains to consider the question as to the shares in Leckie Enterprises Limited, hereinafter called \u201cThe Company\u201d.\nThe relevant provision of the Estate Tax Act is s. 9(8) (d) which reads as follows:\n9.(8) A reference in this section to the situs of any property passing on the death of a person shall be construed as a reference to the situs of that property at the time of the death of that person, and, for the purposes of this section except sub-section (3), the situs of any property so passing, including any right or interest therein of any kind whatever, shall, where that property comes within any of the classes of property mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section, be determined in accordance with the following rules:\n* * *\n(d) shares, stocks and debenture stocks of a corporation and rights to subscribe for or purchase shares or stocks of a corporation (including any such property held by a nominee, whether the beneficial ownership is evidenced by scrip certificates or otherwise) shall be deemed to be situated\n(i) in the province where the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death, if any register of transfers or place of transfer is maintained by the corporation in that province for the transfer thereof, and\n(ii) otherwise, in the place where the register of transfers or place of transfer nearest to the place where the deceased was ordinarily resident at the time of his death is maintained by the corporation for the transfer thereof;\nAt the time of his death Adam Newton Leckie, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe deceased\u201d, was domiciled and ordinarily resident at Oakville in the County of Halton in the Province of Ontario. He was the beneficial owner of the 30,003 common shares which were all the issued common shares of the Company and the registered owner of all of these except two used to qualify directors who were his nominees and acted entirely on his instructions. The preferred shares had no voting rights and it is not questioned that the deceased was at all times in complete control of the company.\nThe Company was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Manitoba Companies Act on October 2, 1957. Its head office was at all times in the City of Winnipeg. It maintained only one register for the transfer of shares and that register was at its head office in Winnipeg.\nSection 346(1) of the Manitoba Companies Act provides as follows:\n346. (1) The register of transfers of every corporation with capital stock shall be kept at the head office of the corporation, and one or more branch registers of transfers, at which transfers may be validly registered, may be kept at such office or offices of the corporation or other place or places within or without the province as the directors, from time to time, appoint. Both registrars and transfer agents may issue and deliver share certificates in such manner as the directors of the company from time to time authorize.\nThe directors did not authorize a branch register to be kept at any office of the Company in Ontario or at any other place in Ontario.\nOn this state of facts it seems plain that the condition prescribed in clause (i) of paragraph (d) of subsection 8 of section 9 of the Estate Tax Act, quoted above, was not fulfilled and for the purposes of that Act the situs of these shares is governed by clause (ii) of that paragraph and accordingly they shall be deemed to be situated in the place where the register of transfers or place of transfer nearest to the place where the deceased was ordinarily resident at the time of death was maintained by the company for the transfer thereof.\nThe wording of this provision is mandatory and appears to me to be clear and free from any ambiguity. On the admitted facts it has the inevitable result of declaring that the shares in question shall be deemed to be situated in Manitoba.\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. W.O. Davis, who gave the decision of the Tax Appeal Board, and those briefly set out above, I would allow the appeal as to the shares in Leckie Enterprises Limited, dismiss the appeal as to the shares in Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company Limited and direct that the assessment be referred back to the appellant for re-consideration and re\u2011assessment in accordance with these reasons.\nWhile the value of the shares in respect of which the appellant has succeeded is much greater than that of those in respect of which he has failed, success has been divided throughout and in all the circumstances of the case I would direct that there be no order as to costs in the Exchequer Court or in this Court.\nAppeal allowed as to the shares of the Manitoba Company; appeal dismissed as to the shares of the Newfoundland Company; no order as to costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A. Driedger, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Keith, Ganong, Mahoney & Keith, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] C.T.C. 310, 66 D.T.C. 5237.\n",

In 1957 and 1958, the respondent sold some of these shares at a considerable profit. The Exchequer Court held that this profit was the realization of an investment and non-taxable. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge gave full consideration to all the circumstances relied upon by the Minister and rightly concluded that the shares were acquired by the respondent as investments to be held as a source of income in the ordinary course of its business as an investment company, and that the reason it decided to realize these investments after a comparatively short period of time was that, in the opinion of its responsible officers, the shares had reached a price which was unrealistically high.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Compagnie publique de placements\u2014Actions acquises au prix co\u00fbtant\u2014Profit lors de la revente\u2014Est-ce un gain de capital ou un revenu\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 3, 4, 139(1)(e).\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, une compagnie publique de placements, a acquis au prix co\u00fbtant d\u2019une compagnie priv\u00e9e de placements par qui elle \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9e un grand nombre d\u2019actions de la compagnie Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Ltd. et de Quebec Natural Gas Corporation. En 1957 et 1958, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a vendu un nombre de ces actions avec un profit consid\u00e9rable.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nG.W. Ainslie and P. Cumyn, for the appellant.\nR. de Wolfe MacKay, Q.C., and Keith E. Eaton, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment1 of No\u00ebl J. allowing the respondent\u2019s appeal from the assessments of income tax made for its 1957 and 1958 taxation years. The question for decision is whether profits of $703,636 realized in 1957 and $63,932 realized in 1958 on the acquisition and sale by the respondent of shares in Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Limited and Quebec Natural Gas Corporation were income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, as is contended by the appellant, or were realization of an enhancement in the value of investments held by the appellant, as found by the learned trial judge.\nIt is not questioned that the primary activities of the respondent are those of a bona fide investment company but counsel for the appellant argues that the particular transactions, out of which the profit sought to be taxed arose, were speculations constituting adventures in the nature of a trade.\nThe question is essentially one of fact depending on the intention with which the respondent acquired the shares.\nThe learned trial judge has set out the relevant facts in detail and has made reference to several passages in the evidence. I do not find it necessary to repeat these. I am satisfied that the learned trial judge gave full consideration to all the circumstances relied upon by the appellant and having done so he reached the conclusion that the shares in question were acquired by the respondent as investments to be held as a source of income in the ordinary course of its business as an investment company and that the reason it decided to realize these investments after a comparatively short period of time was that, in the opinion of its responsible officers, the shares had reached a price which was unrealistically high.\nIf this finding of fact is accepted, no question of law arises. A perusal of the record in the light of the full and able arguments addressed to us satisfies me that this finding was right.\nFor the reasons given by No\u00ebl J. and those briefly stated above, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A.

The Crown applied under s. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to have the juvenile proceeded against by indictment in the ordinary courts. The Juvenile Court judge made the order asked after hearing evidence of a psychiatrist and from the probation officer, some of which was unsworn. The appellant then applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. This application was dismissed. The Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal. The appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal. Such leave in respect of habeas corpus was not required by virtue of s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code, but it was granted in so far as it related to the request for certiorari in aid.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the merits of this case, and without deciding the question of the jurisdiction of this Court, the order made by the Juvenile Court judge should not be disturbed. It was a discretionary order which he had jurisdiction to make. There is no rule of law, nor any authority, to compel a magistrate or a Juvenile Court judge when making an order under s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to base his opinion solely on sworn testimony.\nDroit criminel\u2014Accusation de meurtre non qualifi\u00e9 contre un enfant\u2014Requ\u00eate pour avoir le proc\u00e8s devant les cours ordinaires\u2014Loi sur les Jeunes D\u00e9linquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160, s. 9.\nL\u2019appelant, un enfant de 15 ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Jeunes D\u00e9linquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160, d\u2019un meurtre non qualifi\u00e9.

Sarchuk, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant, Arnold Glenn Shingoose, a juvenile 15 years of age at the time of commission of the alleged offence, was charged under an information dated April 10, 1966, in Juvenile Court under the Juvenile Delinquents Act as follows:\n\u2026that Arnold Glenn Shingoose a child did on or about the 9th day of April, 1966, at the Lizard Point Indian Reserve in the said Province, commit a delinquency in that he did unlawfully murder George Clearsky and thereby committed non-capital murder contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided Section 206 (2) C.C. & J.D. Act.\nUpon being apprehended, he was brought before His Honour F.W. Coward, a judge under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. On May 2, 1966, an application was made to the Juvenile Court judge under s. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to order that the child be proceeded against by indictment in the ordinary courts in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code in that behalf. Section 9 reads as follows:\n9.(1) Where the act complained of is, under the provisions of the Criminal Code or otherwise, an indictable offence, and the accused child is apparently or actually over the age of fourteen years, the Court may, in its discretion, order the child to be proceeded against by indictment in the ordinary courts in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code in that behalf; but such course shall in no case be followed unless the Court is of the opinion that the good of the child and the interest of the community demand it.\n(2) The Court may, in its discretion, at any time before any proceeding has been initiated against the child in the ordinary criminal courts, rescind an order so made.\nOn the hearing of this application, the Juvenile Court judge received sworn testimony as to the age of the juvenile which established that he was born January 5, 1951, and he was, accordingly, over the age of 14 years. He also heard representations from Crown counsel in which he was referred to a number of decisions relating to s. 9 aforesaid. Following that, he asked for a psychiatric report and a psychological report. He then proceeded to hear representations from the Probation Officer, Mr. Korzeniowski, who was cross-examined by counsel for the juvenile. Mr. Korzeniowski was not sworn. The Juvenile Court judge then adjourned the proceedings until Tuesday, May 24, 1966, at which time the psychiatric and psychological reports were received. Counsel for the juvenile objected that these were not given under oath. The Juvenile Court judge then made the Order complained of.\nThe appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. The application was heard by Bastin J. and dismissed by him. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba and that Court, after a full hearing on the merits, upheld the judgment of Bastin J. The appellant thereupon applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. Leave to appeal in respect of habeas corpus was not required by virtue of s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code. Leave to appeal insofar as the application related to the request for certiorari in aid was granted.\nOn the hearing in this Court, the jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with the order made by the learned Juvenile Court judge in habeas corpus proceedings was questioned, and upon consideration the Court stated:\nMr. Tapper and Mr. Sarchuk:\u2014We think the best course is to hear the argument on the merits reserving the question whether the proceedings taken by the appellant are such that we can deal with the merits. It goes without saying, Mr. Sarchuk, that you will be entitled to argue as fully as you please that in view of the form of the proceedings we cannot deal with the merits. Apart altogether from the procedural difficulties and without passing upon them, I am of the view that on the merits the order made by the learned Juvenile Court judge should not be disturbed. It was a discretionary order which he had jurisdiction to make. The appellant\u2019s contention is that on the hearing preceding the making of the order in question the Juvenile Court judge heard representations of counsel for the Crown as well as reports from the Probation officer and from a psychologist and a psychiatrist which were not given under oath.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Monnin J.A., speaking for the Court, said:\nThe issue before Bastin J., involved the question whether the juvenile had been properly dealt with by Coward J.C.J. Reviewing the record in this matter it is apparent that Coward J.C.J. entered into an extensive enquiry for the purpose of determining whether or not to grant the Crown\u2019s application for transfer. It is plain that he addressed his mind both to the facts and to the governing law. He gave specific consideration to the requirements of sec. 9(1) of The Juvenile Delinquents Act, supra, requiring that no order of transfer to the adult Court be made \u201cunless the Court is of the opinion that the good of the child and the interest of the community demand it\u201d.\nMonnin J.A., without referring to the case by name, was following the decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in Regina v. Pagee[1], in which he had participated. In that case, Miller C.J.M., speaking for the Court, said:\nIn my opinion if Crown counsel outlines to the Juvenile Court Judge reasons which indicate that it is for the good of the child and in the interest of the community that the transfer be made, then the Juvenile Court Judge, after considering any representation on behalf of the juvenile, can, in his discretion, act upon such information and material as is before him. I do not say that sworn evidence could not be given if desired either by the Crown or the defence or by both in support of or in opposition to the transfer, but what I want to make clear is that there is no rule of law, nor any authority, to compel the Magistrate when making an order under s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, to base his opinion solely on sworn testimony.\nWith this I agree.\nThe appeal should, accordingly, be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Micay & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.E. Pilkey, Winnipeg.\n[1] [1964] 1 C.C.C. 173, 39 C.R. 329.\n",

In 1953, it had assembled a number of lots on which it built a number of houses which were later sold. However, some of these lots were required by the city of Edmonton for a school and in 1955, the appellant company received 3 other parcels of land in exchange. The company\u2019s declared intention was to erect apartments for renting on these new lots it received from the city. In 1958, the appellant subdivided one of these parcels into 3 lots, one of which it sold for a cash payment and another lot. The latter was immediately sold. The Minister assessed the profit realized from the 2 sales as part of the appellant\u2019s income. The appellant argued that these sales should be regarded as an unsolicited realization of an investment. The appellant also objected to the presentation of evidence by the Minister that it had sold the balance of the property in 1959 to a shopping centre company. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe evidence concerning the sale in 1959 of the balance of the property which the appellant had received from the city was admissible. That evidence was relevant to show a course of conduct on the part of the appellant. Notwithstanding the fact that the appellant company may originally have intended to build apartments on this land, the evidence disclosed that it had the secondary intention of selling the lands at a profit if it were unable to carry out its primary objective. The property received from the city should be regarded as having been acquired by the appellant as part of the inventory of its business and as having been so held by it when the profit in question was realized. Consequently, the profit was a profit from the appellant\u2019s business within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Transactions immobili\u00e8res\u2014Compagnie de construction\u2014Vente de terrain cens\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis pour des fins de placement\u2014Intention secondaire\u2014Admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve de transaction subs\u00e9quente\u2014Gain en capital ou revenu\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 3, 4, 139(1)(e).\nLa compagnie appelante s\u2019occupait d\u2019acheter des terrains dans le but d\u2019y construire des maisons qu\u2019elle vendait, mais aussi dans le but d\u2019y construire des maisons de rapport. En 1953, la compagnie avait r\u00e9uni un grand nombre de lots sur lesquels elle a b\u00e2ti plusieurs maisons qu\u2019elle a subs\u00e9quemment vendues. Cependant, quelques-uns de ces lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 requis par la cit\u00e9 d\u2019Edmonton pour y construire une \u00e9cole, et en 1955, la compagnie a re\u00e7u de la cit\u00e9, en \u00e9change, 3 parcelles de terrain. L\u2019intention de la compagnie \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9riger des maisons de rapport sur ces nouveaux lots qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7us de la cit\u00e9. En 1958, la compagnie a subdivis\u00e9 un de ces terrains en 3 lots dont l\u2019un a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu pour du comptant et en \u00e9change d\u2019un autre lot. Cet autre lot a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu imm\u00e9diatement. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 le profit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 lors de ces 2 ventes comme faisant partie du revenu de l\u2019appelante. L\u2019appelante a soutenu que ces ventes devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant une r\u00e9alisation non sollicit\u00e9e d\u2019un placement. L\u2019appelante s\u2019est aussi object\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que le Ministre pr\u00e9sente une preuve \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la compagnie aurait vendu en 1959 la balance du terrain qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u de la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 une compagnie op\u00e9rant un centre d\u2019achats. La Cour de l\u2019Echiquier a maintenu la cotisation du Ministre. La compagnie en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa preuve concernant la vente en 1959 de la balance de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante avait re\u00e7ue de la cit\u00e9 \u00e9tait admissible. Cette preuve \u00e9tait pertinente pour montrer une ligne de conduite de la part de l\u2019appelante. Malgr\u00e9 le fait que la compagnie appelante pouvait avoir eu originairement l\u2019intention de construire des maisons de rapport sur ce terrain, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention secondaire de vendre ces terrains \u00e0 un profit si elle \u00e9tait incapable de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution son premier objectif. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue de la cit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par l\u2019appelante comme une partie de l\u2019inventaire de son entreprise et d\u2019avoir fait partie de son inventaire lorsque le profit en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Kearney J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.M. Hope, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and L.R. Olson, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Kearney of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] directing that an order of the Tax Appeal Board be set aside and restoring the assessment of the Minister of National Revenue for the appellant\u2019s taxation year 1958, whereby income tax was levied on a net gain of $23,384 realized by the appellant in a series of real estate transactions which are hereinafter described.\nThe appellant is and always has been engaged in the business of general contracting, and the objects expressed in its Memorandum of Association read, in part, as follows:\n3. The objects for which the Company is established are:\u2014\n(a) To purchase, take on lease or in exchange, or otherwise acquire any lands and buildings, and any estate or interest in, and any rights connected with, any such lands and buildings.\n(b) To develop and turn to account any land acquired by the Company or in which the Company is interested,\nNothing turns on the language of this Memorandum of Association standing alone but it is apparent to me from the evidence that in conformity with these objects the appellant in fact engaged in the business of purchasing land in the Province of Alberta and elsewhere primarily for the purpose of building houses thereon for sale, but also with a view to constructing apartment blocks for renting. The appellant\u2019s course of conduct indicates to me that the lands alone were also available for resale if \u201csomebody came along\u201d who was prepared to offer a sufficiently high price.\nIn the course of its business in the year 1953, the appellant purchased a number of parcels of land in the west end of the City of Edmonton which it later assembled into a block with the approval of the city. This land came to be known as the \u201cParkview Subdivision\u201d and the company there built approximately 300 houses which were later sold. It was one of the conditions of the city\u2019s approval of this scheme that the appellant should provide the necessary land for public services including schools, and when the city decided to construct a large high school in this subdivision the appellant was required to transfer to it about 100 small lots in exchange for which in the month of April 1955 the city transferred to the appellant a number of city lots which the appellant itself selected and which included a property of about 2.85 acres at the corner of 86th Avenue and 83rd Street, then described as lot 42 and sometimes referred to as the \u201cBonnie Doon\u201d property. A further property of approximately 9 acres which was transferred to the appellant was located on the west side of 85th Street. There was also included in the exchange a lot of a little more than 2 acres which was in another area and which is hereinafter referred to as property \u201cx\u201d.\nThe profit of $23,384 which the Minister of National Revenue has assessed as part of the appellant\u2019s income for the year 1958 arose as the result of a replotting of lot 42, hereinbefore referred to. The effect of this replotting was that lot 42 was subdivided into lots 43, 44 and 46, and the appellant transferred the new lot 44 to the Imperial Oil Company Limited in exchange for which Imperial Oil transferred lot 48 to the appellant and paid the sum of $20,000. The appellant then transferred the newly acquired lot 48 to the Lutheran Church for $18,000. It is agreed that this series of transactions gave rise to the profit now sought to be taxed.\nThe contention advanced on behalf of the appellant, which found favour with the Tax Appeal Board, was that at the time when the city lots were transferred to it in exchange for the Parkview School property the appellant had already determined that, apart from property \u201cx\u201d, all the lands were to be used for the construction of apartment buildings which would be held as capital assets so as to provide a permanent source of income for the appellant\u2019s controlling shareholder and his family. On this assumption, it was argued that when the properties were sold without any apartment buildings having been built the sales were sales of capital assets and that any profit realized by the appellant as a result thereof was a capital gain and not income.\nIn the course of delivering the reasons for judgment of the Tax Appeal Board, the learned Assistant Chairman observed that apartment buildings built by the appellant had always been retained by it for the rental income to be had and he went on to say:\nThe plan was that any apartment building put up should be treated as for investment purposes only. On this account, the appellant has never disposed of or parted with any apartment building erected by it. Having been through a heavy housebuilding programme over a period of years and achieved a position of financial independence, the appellant\u2019s controlling shareholder, Mr. G.W. Golden, became more interested in creating and enlarging a permanent source of income for himself and family than in money-making through further building operations.\nAlthough plans and a model of an apartment building to be erected on lots 43, 44 and 46 were prepared for the appellant, none was ever constructed on any part of the property acquired from the city. This was chiefly due to the fact that a very large shopping centre was constructed on adjacent property which, it was felt, would interfere with the value of the appellant\u2019s lands as an attractive site for the apartment building, and negotiations were conducted with the builder of the proposed shopping centre with a view to erecting a large screen to block the view of the back of the shopping centre from the proposed apartments but nothing came of this and the project was abandoned.\nThe evidence of Mr. G.W. Golden, the president and controlling shareholder of the appellant, was clearly to the effect that when it acquired these lands from the city its primary purpose and intention was to use them for the construction of apartment buildings, and steps were undoubtedly taken to this end, but when it became apparent that the sites were not as desirable for this purpose as they had originally appeared to be, the appellant was willing and ready to turn them to account if a sufficiently profitable sale offered itself.\nIn this latter regard, I am of the opinion, for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Kearney, that the evidence which was tendered as to the sale in 1959 of the balance of the property which the appellant had acquired from the city is admissible. See Osler, Hammond & Nanton Limited v. M.N.R.[3], per Judson J. When questioned about this sale, Mr. Golden said:\nI couldn\u2019t afford to build apartments on land that I could get $20,000.00 an acre for. I thought it was a windfall myself. So that the sale was something over $200,000.00.\nQ. Let us put it that way, Mr. Golden, you finally reach a point, you may intend to build an apartment or houses on property, and that may be your intention all along. A. I didn\u2019t go looking for it. It was not for sale. Q. If you were offered enough money or it is a good deal and you are willing to sell, you are willing to sell? A. Well, it was not economical for me to build if somebody came along like this.\nQ. In other words with a price like that it didn\u2019t pay you to keep it for apartments no matter what your original intention had been? A. No.\nI think this evidence is relevant to show a course of conduct on the part of the appellant, and when it is remembered that all of the property which the city transferred to it in exchange for the Parkview School site, amounting in all to about 12 acres, was sold off within four years after the appellant had acquired it, I think it is only reasonable to infer that, at least after the abandonment of the apartment project, these lands were being held for resale as a part of the appellant\u2019s inventory. It is of some significance to note in this connection that the lands were entered in the books of the company in an account under the heading \u201cLand for Resale\u201d.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the appellant may originally have intended to build apartments on this land, I think the evidence disclosed that it had the secondary intention of selling the lands at a profit if it were unable to carry out its primary objective.\nIn this regard, I find it difficult to distinguish this case in principle from the situation which was considered by Judson J. in Regal Heights Ltd. v. M.N.R.[4], although that was a case in which the profit to the promoters arose out of a single transaction for the carrying out of which Regal Heights Ltd. had been expressly incorporated, whereas in the present case the taxpayer is an experienced real estate operator of long standing.\nAn even closer analogy to the situation here in question is, in my opinion, to be found in the case of Fraser v. M.N.R.[5], where the appellant and his associate were found to be experienced operators in the field of real estate and where Judson J., giving the unanimous decision of this Court, reviewed the situation in the following passage at pp. 660-1:\nCameron J., accepted the evidence of the appellant that when the two associates acquired the property, they did intend to attempt to develop the property for rental purposes. He calls this their dominant intention and he says that he is far from satisfied that it was their sole intention at any time. He also finds that they intended to sell at least part of the property if they were unsuccessful in developing it as they planned. His conclusion is contained in the following extract from his reasons:\nIn my view, the whole scheme was of a speculative nature in which the promoters envisaged the possibility that if they could not complete their plans to build and retain as investments a shopping centre and apartments, a profitable sale would be made as soon as it could be arranged.\nIn spite of the Judge\u2019s emphasis on primary and secondary intention, when applied to the facts of this case it amounts to no more than this. He was saying that two active and skilled real estate promoters made a profit in the ordinary course of their business, and this they obviously did. They were carrying on a business; they intended to make a profit, and if they could not make it one way, then they made it another way.\nThis language appears to me to have direct application to the present case.\nI regard the property originally described as lot 42 as having been acquired by the appellant as part of the inventory of its business and as being so held by it when the profit which is here in question was realized. I therefore agree with Mr. Justice Kearney that the profit was a profit from the appellant\u2019s business within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those contained in the reasons of Mr. Justice Kearney, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & MacDonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.S.

Most of the evidence was circumstantial and the accused did not give evidence at his trial. The conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was refused in February 1960.\nPursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the governor general in council, in April 1966, referred to this Court for hearing and consideration the following question: \u201cHad an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by Section 597A of the Criminal Code of Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of such an appeal on a consideration of the existing Record and such further evidence as the Court, in its discretion, may receive and consider?\u201d\nAt this hearing, the Court received a large body of evidence, much of it relating to the medical aspects of the case and also heard the oral evidence of the accused who had not given evidence at the trial.\nHeld: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. would have dismissed such an appeal; Hall J. would have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.\nJoint opinion of the Chief Justice, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that he was the guilty person. On a review of all the evidence given at the trial, the verdict could not be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. The verdict was in accordance with the evidence. Furthermore, the judgment at trial could not have been set aside on the ground of any wrong decision on a question of law or on the ground that there was a miscarriage of justice. It follows that the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal made to it was right. The effect of the additional evidence which was heard by this Court, considered in its entirety, strengthens the view that the verdict of the jury ought not to be disturbed.\nPer Hall J., dissenting: The trial was not conducted according to law. There were grave errors in the trial. Nothing that transpired on the hearing in this Court or any evidence tendered before this Court can be used to give validity to what was an invalid trial.

Christie, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Canada.\nJoint opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, CARTWRIGHT, FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND, JUDSON, RITCHIE and SPENCE JJ.:\u2014On September 16, 1959, Steven Murray Truscott, a boy of 14\u00bd years, went on trial for the murder of Lynne Harper, a girl of 12 years and 9 months. The trial lasted until September 30, 1959, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] against the conviction was dismissed on January 21, 1960. On the same date the sentence of death was commuted to a term of life imprisonment. An application for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was refused on February 24, 1960. At that time this Court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal only in two cases: (a) where there was dissent by a judge of the Court of Appeal on any question of law (there was no such dissent in this case), or (b) on any question of law with leave of this Court.\nBy Order-in-Council P.C. 1966\/760, dated April 26, 1966, pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, His Excellency the Governor General referred to this Court for hearing and consideration the following question:\nHad an Appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A of the Criminal Code of Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of such an Appeal on a consideration of the existing Record and such further evidence as the Court, in its discretion, may receive and consider?\nSection 597A of the Criminal Code of Canada was enacted by 1960-61, c. 44, s. 11, in the following terms:\n597A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a person\n(a) who has been sentenced to death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal, or\n(b) who is acquitted of an offence punishable by death and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of appeal,\nmay appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\nIt came into force on July 13, 1961. On this Reference, therefore, we have power to review law or fact or mixed law and fact.\nThe Court also received a large body of evidence, much of it relating to the medical aspects of the case. It also heard the oral evidence of the accused. He had not given evidence at the trial.\nThe case against Steven Truscott was that he met Lynne Harper in the school grounds on the Clinton R.C.A.F. Station at about 7.10 on the evening of June 9, 1959; that he travelled north with her on the cross-bar of his bicycle on the county road; that he turned into Lawson\u2019s bush, which is about half way between the school grounds and Highway No. 8; and that he murdered the girl there. His defence was that the girl had asked him to take her to the intersection of Highway No. 8 and the county road; that he took her to this intersection and left her there, and when he was part way on his return journey, he saw a car stop at the intersection and pick her up, and that he never saw her again.\nFor an understanding of the evidence, it is necessary to describe the neighbourhood, a sketch plan of which is attached to these reasons. The R.C.A.F. Station is at the southerly end of a county road which goes north to King\u2019s Highway No. 8. This highway runs east and west. On leaving the Station, immediately on the right is the Robert Lawson farm property. Close to the road there are the usual buildings, including a barn. On the left is the O\u2019Brien farm property. At the northerly limit of the Lawson property there are 20 odd acres of bush, mostly second growth ash, elm, maple and basswood. The wire fencing between the bush and the road is not in very good condition. There is an entrance to the bush along the northerly limit. It is referred to throughout the evidence as the \u201ctractor trail\u201d. From the southerly end of the county road to the tractor trail is 3,366 feet. 1,568 feet farther north the Canadian National Railway crosses the road at right angles. Then, 491 feet farther north there is a bridge over the Bayfield River. This bridge is referred to frequently in the evidence. Then, 1,300 feet farther north is the intersection of the county road with King\u2019s Highway No. 8. East from the bridge over the Bayfield River and visible from the bridge there is a swimming hole about 640 feet away.\nWe will first describe the movements of Lynne Harper in the late afternoon and early evening of June 9. She arrived home from school between 5.15 and 5.30 p.m. and she had finished her supper by 5.45 p.m. After supper she left the house for a short time to apply for a permit for the swimming pool for that evening. She could not get the permit because it was necessary for an infant to be accompanied by a grown-up person. Her parents were unable to go with her that evening. About 6.35 she went to the schoolhouse to assist a Mrs. Nickerson, who was conducting a meeting of Junior Girl Guides. Mrs. Nickerson confirms the time of her arrival. Mrs. Nickerson said that Truscott came along shortly before 7 p.m. and that Lynne Harper went over to speak to him and that after a few minutes they left together on foot in a northerly direction, Truscott pushing his bicycle. She puts the time between 7.00 and 7.10 p.m.\nAn estimate of the time was also made by a Mrs. Bohonus, an officer of the Brownie Pack, who came to assist Mrs. Nickerson. Mrs. Bohonus said that shortly after she arrived, she looked at her watch and it was ten minutes to seven. According to her, not more than five or ten or, at most, fifteen minutes later, Steven Truscott appeared and talked to Lynne Harper. Mrs. Bohonus does not say how long they talked or at what time they left.\nThree boys, Hatherall, Westey and McKay, were at the football field adjoining the school and the county road. They saw Truscott and Lynne Harper come from the school area to the county road. Lynne Harper got on the cross-bar of Truscott\u2019s bicycle and the two went north on the county road.\nWe will now deal with Steven Truscott\u2019s movements during the early evening of June 9th before he met Lynne Harper. We begin with the evidence of Jocelyne Goddette. She, Lynne Harper and Steven Truscott were all in the same class, Grade VIII, at school. Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s story was that Steven Truscott had made an arrangement to meet her at Lawson\u2019s wood to show her anew calf. He told her to keep the arrangement quiet because Mr. Lawson did not like people trespassing on his property. She says that he called at her house about 5.50 p.m. and that she told him that she could not come out at the moment because of domestic duties and that she would meet him later if possible. Truscott denies that he made such an arrangement and the call at the house. Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s father said that there was a call such as his daughter described but that he did not know who the caller was.\nTruscott arrived home for supper between 5.15 and 5.30 p.m. His mother sent him to the store at the end of the street to get some coffee. She fixes the time as close to six o\u2019clock because there was need to hurry in order to get there before closing time. He obtained the coffee and returned home. After supper he went out. His mother had told him that he had to be back by 8.30 p.m. because she and her husband were going out and he was needed for baby sitting.\nPaul Desjardine, \u00e0 fourteen year old boy, rode north on his bicycle to go fishing at the bridge over the Bayfield River at about 6.10 p.m. He met Steven Truscott a short distance south of Lawson\u2019s bush. Steven was alone and was riding his bicycle around in a circle on the road. There was no conversation. Truscott denies that there was such a meeting.\nMrs. Beatrice Geiger left her house in the married quarters on the Base riding one of her sons\u2019 bicycles to go to the bridge. This was about ten minutes past six. On the way to the bridge Steven Truscott passed her in the bush area riding his bicycle. They were both going north. Steven went as far as the bridge, stopped a second or two, took a look around and headed south again. She met him the second time at about the railroad tracks. This would be around twenty-five minutes past six or half past six. Truscott said that he did not remember seeing Mrs. Geiger.\nKenneth Geiger, the twelve year old son of Mrs. Geiger, left his home about a quarter or twenty minutes after six to go swimming. He walked to the school and met Robb Harrington and the two boys rode double on one bicycle down to the river. On the way down from the school area to the bridge he saw Steven Truscott. He was sitting on his bicycle in the middle of the road almost opposite the \u201ctractor trail\u201d, which is on the northerly limit of Lawson\u2019s bush. He was facing towards the station. They passed Steven at about 6.25 or 6.27 p.m. Steven said to Kenneth Geiger that Mrs. Geiger was at the bridge and Kenneth Geiger said that he knew that. Robb Harrington estimates the time as being a quarter to seven. Truscott denies that he ever saw or spoke to Kenneth Geiger.\nRonald Demaray saw Steven on the bridge just before he went home. He believes that he got home between 6:30 and 7 p.m. and that it would take him ten minutes to get home from the bridge. As far as he could see, Steven was alone and just seemed to be looking around.\nRichard Gellatly, a boy of twelve years, was at the river on the evening of June 9. He had to return home to get his swimming trunks. He met Steven riding Lynne Harper towards the bridge on the county road about one-quarter of the way from O\u2019Brien\u2019s farm. Gellatly was riding south on his bicycle and Steven Truscott and Lynne Harper were riding north. He met them on the station side of Lawson\u2019s bush, that is, on the south side. He gives the time as 7:25 p.m. He says that he could be a few minutes out. He put on his trunks at home and returned to the river. It was about ten minutes after he passed Steven and Lynne that he went back to the river. He did not see Steven again. He was familiar with Steven\u2019s bicycle. He did not see the bicycle. He said that if it had been lying alongside the road by Lawson\u2019s bush or anywhere alongside the road, he would have seen it.\nMrs. Donna Dunkin drove to the river on the county road from the married quarters on the evening of June 9. She travelled from the married quarters at the station and pulled off the road just north of the railroad tracks. She saw Richard Gellatly riding his bicycle towards the station just as she pulled off the road to park. She also saw Philip Burns, who was walking behind Richard Gellatly. At the time she saw them, they were between the railway tracks and the bridge over the river. Philip Burns would be no more than ten feet behind Richard Gellatly. She placed the time between 7:05 and 7:15 p.m.\nPhilip Burns, a boy of eleven years, who was unsworn, started to go south to the Air Force Station from the bridge on foot. He was behind Richard Gellatly. Gellatly started from the bridge on a bicycle. Burns left at approximately 7 o\u2019clock. He fixes the time because he asked Mrs. Geiger what time it was. She did not have a watch. Sergeant McCafferty was close and he said it was around five to seven. Sergeant McCafferty gave evidence on the point and said that when Mrs. Geiger asked him for the time he looked at his watch and said either ten to seven or ten past seven, he could not remember which. Philip Burns says that he swam over to the south side of the river, put on his clothes and went up on the bridge where he waited around for five or ten minutes after being told the time, then he started for home.\nGellatly had left the swimming hole at about the same time. He went along the north bank of the river and Burns along the south bank of the river. Both were on their way home. They left the bridge at about the same time, Burns on foot and Gellatly on his bicycle. This was between 7 and 7:15 p.m.\nGellatly gave evidence that he met Truscott and Lynne Harper south of Lawson\u2019s bush at a point between the bush and O\u2019Brien\u2019s farm. Burns says that he never did meet Truscott and Lynne Harper or either of them. While walking on his way home, he did meet Jocelyne Goddette and had some brief conversation with her. She was on her bicycle and she was near the south side of the bush closest to the station. She was going north towards the river. Further south along the road near O\u2019Brien\u2019s farm and about two minutes later, he also met Arnold George, who was also going north and was behind Jocelyne Goddette. When Burns met Jocelyne Goddette he had been walking for about ten minutes after leaving the bridge with Gellatly. Michael Burns, a brother of Philip Burns, says that Philip got home about 7:30 p.m.\nJocelyne Goddette, who was thirteen years of age at the time, says, in more detail than we have already outlined, that on Monday, June 8, she had a conversation at school with Steven Truscott. She said to him that on Sunday, the day before, she had gone to Lawson\u2019s barn and had seen a calf there. Steven asked her if she wanted to see two more new-born calves. She said \u201cYes\u201d and he asked her if she could make it on Monday, and she said \u201cNo\u201d. He asked her if she could make it on Tuesday and she said she would try. Then on Tuesday, he repeated his invitation and she told him she did not know whether she could go and he invited her to meet him if she could go on the right-hand side of the county road just outside the fence by the woods. He repeated his warning not to tell anybody. The time for the appointment was six o\u2019clock. She says that he called at the house at ten to six when she told him that she could not go but that she would try later. She had her supper and left the house about 20 minutes after 6 or 6:30, and went towards Lawson\u2019s barn to see if Steven was there. It would take but a few minutes to get to Lawson\u2019s barn. She stayed there for about five minutes. Steven was not at Lawson\u2019s and she went to see if he was at the meeting place. The meeting place was on the right-hand side of the county road just outside the fence by the woods. She met Philip Burns at the southerly limit of Lawson\u2019s bush and had a brief conversation with him. She bicycled north and got off her bicycle and walked slowly looking into the woods. She turned in the tractor trail and went three-quarters of the way in and then looked towards the railway bridge. She shouted Steven\u2019s name twice and then looked towards the woods and shouted it three or four times. She turned her bicycle around on the hard part of the ground and at that point she saw Arnold George going past. Arnold George also saw her on the tractor trail forty feet back. She did not see any sign of Steven on the tractor trail. When she saw Arnold George he was just going past the entrance to the tractor trail. She and George were both looking for Steven Truscott and they had a brief conversation. While they were talking Bryan Glover passed on his way to the bridge. He noticed them but did not stop. She came out of the tractor trail and went towards the river to the bridge. She did not see Steven at the river. She stayed there five or ten minutes and went back to Lawson\u2019s farm. She estimated that she got back to Lawson\u2019s a little before seven. She remained in the barn with Mr. Lawson for an hour and a half while he was doing his chores. The next morning at school she asked Steven why he had not been there and he just shrugged his shoulders.\nBryan Glover says that he arrived at the bridge a minute or two before George. He then looked for some friends on the west side of the river and about five minutes later returned to the bridge, saw his friends on the railway bridge over the river and went to join them. When George arrived at the bridge he says that he went over to the swimming hole, still looking for Truscott.\nThere is obviously something very wrong with Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s times. The jury would have to test her estimate of time along with the evidence of the time when Philip Burns and Arnold George were on the road and spoke to her and Bryan Glover who passed and noticed her, and also the evidence of Mr. Lawson. Lawson says that she first arrived at his barn at approximately 7:15. She left at 7:25. He fixes this time because she asked him the time before she left. She returned in twenty minutes to half an hour later.\nTeunis Vandenpool, a boy of 15 years of age, lived on a farm on Highway No. 8 about a mile and a quarter east of the county road. On June 9 after supper he went swimming. He left his home at five or ten minutes after seven. He went west on Highway No. 8 and then down the county road. He was travelling by bicycle and was at the junction of Highway No. 8 and the county road about 7:15 or 7:20 o\u2019clock. He didn\u2019t see any persons at or near the corner. He didn\u2019t see a car stopped. After he reached the corner he went down towards the bridge.\nBetween the bridge and the railroad is a field and he went down the path leading towards the river. This would be west of the bridge. He had his bathing suit on and he took off his clothes and went in the water. He remained in the water for ten or fifteen minutes and went home. He estimates that he made the return trip to the intersection of the county road between 7:30 and 7:35 o\u2019clock. He arrived home at a quarter to eight. He noticed that when he started to do his homework, which was immediately after he got home. He didn\u2019t know Lynne Harper or Steven Truscott. He did not see a girl on a bicycle on the county road or a boy in red jeans. Truscott was wearing red jeans that evening. There were bicycles parked on the bridge but no persons on the bridge.\nSteven Truscott was back at the schoolyard at 8 p.m. or shortly after that hour. He was back at home by between 8:25 and 8:30 p.m. according to the evidence of Mrs. Truscott, and he was seen at his home by his friend Arnold George about 8:45 p.m. We deal later with the conversation between these two at that time.\nTruscott admitted that he had met Gellatly. He made this admission to F\/Sgt. Johnson and Sgt. Anderson of the Ontario Provincial Police on Wednesday, June 10, and to Sgt. Wheelhouse of the R.C.A.F. and Constable Hobbs of the O.P.P. on Thursday morning, June 11. F\/Sgt. Johnson said that Truscott\u2019s definition of the place of meeting was \u201cjust about the brow of the hill,\u201d which is a short distance south of the tractor trail; Sergeant Anderson that it was \u201chalfway between the intersection at the school, the public school and the bush\u201d, which is about where Gellatly said it was; Sergeant Wheelhouse that is was \u201cabout halfway between where I had picked up Lynne and the crest of the hill\u201d, which is much the same as the admission to Sergeant Anderson.\nThe case went to the jury with five witnesses saying that they did not see Truscott and Lynne on the road. Two of these were actively looking for him.\nThe Crown\u2019s submission was that after he passed Gellatly he turned into the bush with Lynne and that this accounted for the failure of the other witnesses to see him on the road with Lynne. On the other hand, three witnesses who were called by the defence, Douglas Oats, Gordon Logan and Allan Oats, say that they did see Truscott on the road. The first two, Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan, say that they saw him cross the bridge with Lynne on his way to the highway. Allan Oats says that he saw Steven on the bridge alone some time between 7:30 and 8 p.m. Douglas Oats, aged 11 years, said that he was on the bridge over the Bayfield River on the evening of June 9 looking for turtles. Steven Truscott and Lynne Harper came by him on the bridge. He turned around and put up his hand and said \u201cHi\u201d. Lynne was seated on the cross-bar of the bicycle. They were going north towards No. 8 highway. He did not see Lynne again and did not see Steven again that night. He stayed on the bridge until about 7.30 and got home about a quarter to eight. The only time that he saw Steven that night, Lynne was with him.\nGordon Logan, aged 13, first heard that Lynne Harper was missing on the morning of June 10 just before school started. The previous evening he had been down at the Bayfield River fishing and swimming. He saw Steven and Lynne go by on the bridge on Steven\u2019s bicycle. Lynne was sitting on the cross-bar on the bicycle. He made this observation when he was down at the swimming hole. He was out of the water. The two were near the north side of the bridge when he last saw them travelling towards Highway No. 8. He was standing just by the bend in the river on a big rock. This rock is 642 feet from the bridge at water level. He saw Steven about five minutes later when Steven rode back to the bridge, stopped and got off his bicycle. He does not know what Steven did from then on.\nThe presence of Gordon Logan at the swimming hole at 7:30 p.m. was confirmed by Beatrice Geiger, who was at the swimming hole at that time. She also said that there were people on the bridge. She could not tell whether they were men or women or children, or boys or girls. She did not pay too much attention. She thought that from where she was, had she been looking for someone she knew, she could have recognized him.\nAllan Oats, 16 years of age, says that he went for a ride on his bicycle towards the river. He turned back when he was about 800 feet from the bridge. He saw Steven standing on the bridge wearing red pants and a light coloured shirt. He places the time between 7:30 and 8 o\u2019clock.\nThe prosecution suggested that Douglas Oats was mistaken; that on his own admission he only saw Truscott once that evening and that the time must have been 6:30 p.m., when Douglas Oats was looking for turtles at the bridge and Truscott was alone at the bridge. This was based on the evidence of Mrs. Geiger and Demaray.\nGordon Logan\u2019s evidence was questioned on the ground of credibility and ability to make the observation that he claimed to have made.\nThe credibility of Allan Oats was also attacked. He had evidence highly favourable to Truscott on Tuesday, June 9. He said that he mentioned it to nobody except his mother and no one else knew about it until Tuesday, June 16, when he was approached by Mrs. Durnin at the request of Truscott\u2019s father.\nThis conflict between evidence pointing to a disappearance into Lawson\u2019s bush and evidence asserting that Steven Truscott had crossed the bridge with Lynne Harper on his way to the highway and had returned alone, was the critical issue in this case and it was entirely a jury problem. The Judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on the issue was emphatic and clear:\nNow then, it is the theory of the Defence, and they brought evidence to show that, as I say this little Douglas Oats saw them going across the bridge and then, in a few minutes, according to the boy by the name of Gordon Logan\u2014Gordon Logan also says he saw them going north on the bridge and in about five minutes he says he saw Steven return alone. Well, as regards Gordon Logan, it will be for you Gentlemen to say whether you believe his evidence, and it is very important, Gentlemen, because if you believe the Defence theory of this matter and believe Steven\u2019s statement to the police and to other people, that the girl was driven to Number Eight Highway and entered an automobile which went east; it is my view that you must acquit the boy if you believe that story.\nIn other words, I will put it this way. In order to convict this boy, you have to completely reject that story as having no truth in it, as not being true. You have to completely reject that story.\nArnold George says that on the evening of Lynne Harper\u2019s disappearance he went to Truscott\u2019s house about 8.45 p.m. He gives the following account of their conversation:\nQ. What was said?\nA. Well, I asked him where he had been that night and he said: \u201cDown at the river\u201d. I said: \u201cI heard that you had given Lynne a ride down to the river,\u201d and he said: \u201cYes, she wanted a lift down to Number Eight Highway.\u201d And I said: \u201cI heard you were in the bush with her\u201d. And he said: \u201cNo, we were on the side of the bush looking for a cow and calf.\u201d And he said: \u201cWhy do you want to know for?\u201d and I said: \u201cSkip it and let\u2019s play ball.\u201d At the preliminary hearing he had not said anything about Steven saying that he was on the side of the bush looking for a cow and calf.\nTruscott in his oral evidence denied that there was ever any such visit from Arnold George or any such conversation.\nNext, on the evening of Wednesday, June 10, Arnold George says that he had another conversation with Steven:\nQ. And what was said on that occasion?\nA. Well he said that he\u2014like the Police had questioned him and that he had told them he had seen me down there, and it wasn\u2019t me, it was Gordie Logan; and he thought that Gordie was me and he said that I had seen him, so he told the Police that. And down there at his house he told that to me and he said that the Police were going to go down to my place to check up, so I agreed that I would tell them what was just said.\nGeorge did support Truscott\u2019s story in his statements to the police but after the discovery of the body the following day, Thursday, July 11, he retracted them. His evidence at the trial we have already outlined. It was that he had been looking for Steven and had not seen him.\nTruscott, on the reference, denied that this conversation ever took place either on the evening of Wednesday, June 10, or at any other time.\nOn Wednesday evening, June 10, there was talk about the disappearance among five boys who were together at the bridge. These were Paul Desjardine, Arnold George, Thomas Gillette, Bryan Glover and Steven Truscott. Paul Desjardine was telling Truscott that he had heard that he had taken Lynne into the bush. The account of the conversation varies from boy to boy but there is no doubt, according to these witnesses, that a suspicion was being voiced and that Truscott was appealing to Arnold George in support of his denial and that George was supporting him to the extent of saying that Steven was at the side of the bush looking for the cow and the calf.\nTruscott did not give oral evidence at the trial. His defence that he had taken Lynne Harper to the intersection where she had been picked up by a strange car was before the jury in the form of exculpatory statements given to the police. On the reference he did give oral evidence in more detail. He described his movements from the time he left school until he went home to supper. Before supper and just before the store closed, he went to get the coffee for his mother. He left home about 6.30 p.m. and went first to the school grounds. He found no one there and rode down to the railroad tracks on his bicycle. He could see no one at the river so he turned around a couple of times and went back to the station. He said that he met no one on the waydown or back. He stopped at the end of the school and was watching the Brownies. Lynne Harper came over and asked him for a lift down to No. 8 Highway. After a few minutes they walked to the county road and then got on the bicycle. He says that they left at 7.30 p.m. He fixed the time by the school clock. On the way down to No. 8 Highway he passed Douglas Oats on the bridge. He let Lynne Harper off at the highway and rode back to the bridge. When he arrived at the bridge, he looked back and saw \u201cthere was a car pulled in off the highway and she got in the front seat\u201d. He said the car was facing northeast. He described the car as a 1959 grey Chevrolet with what appeared to be a yellow coloured licence plate. He next said that he stayed at the bridge for five or ten minutes and from there saw Arnold George and Gordon Logan at the swimming hole. He then went back to the school, arriving there about 8 p.m.\nOn Truscott\u2019s return to the school grounds there is evidence that there was some curiosity among a group of children about what had happened to Lynne Harper. Several children had seen him leave with her. He came back alone. When asked whether they made any comment to him or whether there was any conversation with them, he replied in the following words:\nI believe one of them asked me\u2014they said \u201cWhat did you do with Harper, feed her to the fish?\u201d and I replied that I had taken her and let her off at Highway No. 8.\nWhen Truscott returned to the schoolyard at approximately 8 p.m, no one noticed anything unusual about his demeanour, conduct or the condition of his clothing. Most of his conversation appears to have been with his older brother Kenneth. This conversation was testified to by three witnesses who were standing fairly close. These witnesses were John Carew, Lorraine Wood and Lyn Johnston. It had to do with an exchange of bicycles and an exchange of shoes. Kenneth Truscott had with him a smaller bicycle belonging to a younger brother. Steven Truscott was going home and he left his own bicycle and took the smaller one with him. There was also some conversation between the two about shoes. Steven Truscott was wearing crepe-soled canvas shoes belonging to Kenneth. Kenneth was wearing a pair of Steven\u2019s high boots. No exchange was actually made.\nThe crepe-soled canvas shoes did not enter into the trial because of a ruling of the trial judge that the prosecution had no right to call more expert evidence. But on the reference a photograph was introduced of the impression of a shoe near the girl\u2019s body. The marks of the rubber in a foot impression near the body of Lynne Harper corresponded with the marks of the shoe worn by Truscott to this extent: The shoes were of similar manufacture, the marks resembled each other, but the most that the evidence proves is that someone wearing shoes similar to those worn by Truscott on the night of the disappearance made a foot impression close to the body of Lynne Harper. There was no further identification. The evidence does not prove that the impression was made by the very shoes worn by Steven Truscott.\nTruscott was unable to state the exact time of his arrival at home but his father and mother were still there. He says that he spent the rest of the evening at home and that the first occasion on which he knew that anything unusual had happened to Lynne Harper was when her father came to the house the following morning, which would be June 10, before he had left for school. The following is his account on the brief conversation at the house:\nQ. What happened when he came?\nA. He asked me if I had seen Lynne.\nQ. Did he ask you or did he ask your mother?\nA. I believe he asked my mother and my mother called me over and\nI informed him that I had given her a ride to the highway.\nQ. Anything else?\nA. I don\u2019t remember anything else.\nQ. Do you remember when the first time you mentioned, if you did mention it, a grey 1959 Chevrolet car to anybody?\nA. I don\u2019t remember who the first one was that I mentioned it to.\nQ. Do you remember when you mentioned it, even if you do not remember who you mentioned it to?\nA. I believe it was the police.\nMr. Harper\u2019s account of the conversation is that Truscott did say on this occasion that Lynne \u201chad hitched a ride on No. 8 Highway\u201d. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Truscott had mentioned the car to anyone on his return to the schoolyard.\nWe have already said in dealing with the evidence of Arnold George that George said that he visited Truscott soon after Truscott\u2019s return to the house to enquire about Lynne Harper. He also gave evidence of another conversation the following evening when he said that he was asked to say that he had seen Truscott at the bridge. We have also mentioned Truscott\u2019s denial of both these conversations.\nTruscott gave his own version of the conversation among the five boys at the bridge on Wednesday evening, June 10. It differs from the account given by the boys at the trial. Their evidence is summarized above. This is Truscott\u2019s account:\nQ. Was there any conversation about Miss Harper?\nA. One of the fellows mentioned something about it, yes.\nQ. Do you remember what it was he said?\nA. He said, \u201cI. heard you had Lynne in the bush\u201d.\nQ. What did you say?\nA. I asked him who had told him this and he said Arnold George did.\nI went over and asked Arnold George and he said he had never told anybody that.\nQ. Were you in the bush with her?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. How was this said when it was said, that he heard you had her in the bush?\nA. More or less kidding with each other.\nQ. Did you make any statement that you were not in the bush, you had just been at the edge of the bush looking for calves, or anything of that nature?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. Had you been anywhere near the bush looking for calves with Miss Harper?\nA. No, I wasn\u2019t.\nQ. Do you remember any discussion about that time about calves in the bush?\nA. No, sir.\nTruscott denied any conversation with Jocelyne Goddette concerning the making of an appointment to go looking for newborn calves. He denied that he called at Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s house about 5:50 p.m. to confirm the appointment. He denied that on the trip down to the river between 6 and 7 p.m. he met Ken Geiger and Robb Harrington. He denied any conversation with Geiger about his mother being at the river. He denied that he had seen Mrs. Geiger or Paul Desjardine during the course of that trip and said that he did not remember any of them giving evidence at his trial. He denied having seen either Robb Harrington, who was with Geiger, or Ronald Demaray, who says that he was at the bridge while Truscott was there. These were all people who gave evidence that they met him and described his movements on the road between 6.30 and 7.00 p.m.\nHe denied that he had met Gellatly on the highway and said that he did not remember telling the police that he had met Gellatly. At the trial Gellatly\u2019s evidence had not been challenged on cross-examination.\nHe denied that Arnold George came to his house at 8.30 p.m. on June 9 and that he had any conversation with George at any time during that evening. This was the occasion when George said that he had heard that Truscott was in the bush with Lynne and when Truscott had replied that he was on the side of the bush looking for a cow and a calf.\nHe denied that he had any conversation with George the following evening, Wednesday, June 10. This is the occasion when George said that he had agreed with Truscott to tell the police that he, George, had seen Truscott at the bridge on Tuesday evening.\nTruscott told the police that when Lynne entered the car at the highway intersection, it was facing northeast and that he could see the colour of the licence plate when he was standing on the bridge looking towards Highway No. 8. The police questioned this. Constable Tremblay, Ontario Provincial Police, stood on the bridge on Wednesday, June 10, with Truscott and his mother. From the bridge Tremblay noted that he could not see any licence plates on cars proceeding along Highway No. 8 and also, that when a car with black and white plates travelled north on the county road and reached the highway, he could no longer see the licence plates. The bridge is 1,300 feet from the highway intersection. A photograph was introduced which seemed to support the police evidence.\nOn the reference this photograph was described as being highly distorted and not representing what could be seen by the human eye standing where Truscott said he was standing. Also on the reference, evidence was given by a team of private investigators who had various colours of licence plates that identification of colour could be made from the bridge. The Crown did not introduce evidence to contradict this.\nIn the final argument, Crown counsel said he accepted the evidence such as it was. His criticism of the evidence was that on the admission of the witness who drove the car, it could only be placed in the position where it was photographed by driving east across the intersection, stopping and backing up to place the car in a northeasterly position where it would catch the late afternoon sun, and that no car travelling from west to east would get into that position in the way Truscott described to pick up a hitch-hiker standing on the southeast corner of the intersection. The evidence given on the reference proves no more than this, that if a car is placed in this position at a certain time with the sun shining on the licence plate, an investigator standing at the bridge and knowing what he was looking for could identify colours, but not entirely without error.\nThe evidence at the reference upon this topic would seem to weaken the Crown\u2019s submission to the jury as based on the evidence adduced at the trial that Truscott could not have seen from the bridge what he alleged he had seen, i.e., that Lynne Harper entered a 1959 grey Bel-Air Chevrolet with a yellow licence plate, as it would seem that if that car had been in the one position in which the vehicle used by the witness LaBrash to carry out his test had been placed, Truscott could have made such observation. The purpose of that evidence at trial, however, was to attack the credibility of Truscott on this important part of his defence. Since the evidence was given at trial, Truscott has testified on the reference. We refer herein to the parts of his testimony which simply cannot be believed. In such circumstances, the evidence given at the reference in relation to the possibility of making the observation of an automobile so placed becomes of much less importance.\nThe body of Lynne Harper was found on Thursday, June 11, 1959, at 1:45 p.m., in Lawson\u2019s bush some distance in from the tractor trail. The evidence strongly pointed to this as the place where she was raped and murdered. We have already quoted from the instruction of the trial judge to the effect that the jury could not convict unless the jury entirely rejected the evidence of Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan that they saw Truscott on the bridge with Lynne Harper on their way to the highway intersection. All the evidence, including the medical evidence, has to be related to this critical issue.\nAn outline of the problem facing the jury at the trial seems to be this. First of all, they had the time of departure from the school grounds fixed with reasonable certainty by the evidence of Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Bohonus at not later than 7:15 p.m. Then, on his own admission, Truscott met Richard Gellatly between the school yard and Lawson\u2019s bush. He did not meet Philip Burns as he should have done if he had continued on his way to the highway. He was not seen by Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George as he would have been if he had continued on to the highway and had returned alone from the intersection to the bridge. The jury\u2019s conclusion must have been that after passing Richard Gellatly and before Philip Burns, Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George had an opportunity to see him, he had disappeared with the girl into Lawson\u2019s bush.\nBefore they could come to this conclusion the jury had to reject the evidence of Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan and they must have done so with the emphatic warning of the trial judge in their minds. On Truscott\u2019s story, the girl was proposing to go to a place where there were a few ponies. This was about 500 yards east of the intersection. Yet according to him she was still at the intersection when Truscott had returned to the bridge 1,300 feet to the south, from which point he says that he saw her getting into a car, although she was only proposing to go 500 yards. If this were true, then whoever picked her up or some other person would have had to bring her back to Lawson\u2019s bush, either dead or alive, unnoticed by anyone. If dead, he would have had to place her body in the bush and create the appearance that she had been murdered at that spot.\nWe do not think that there is any doubt about the place of death. The position of the body, the scuff marks and a footprint at the foot, and the flattening of the vegetation between the legs, indicated that the act of rape took place there. There were a number of puncture wounds on her back and shoulders, some of which were caused before death and some after death. Under the wound in her left shoulder, which she suffered before death, was a pool of fluid blood lying on the vegetation. The wounds were consistent with their having been made by twigs scattered around the ground. A small quantity of blood was found on the dandelion leaves at the fork of the body. Under her left shoulder was a button from her blouse. According to the evidence of Elgin Brown, this button would be ripped from her blouse when it was torn to form the ligature with which she was strangled. Her clothing was in the area where the body lay.\nThere was evidence on the reference but not at the trial given in support of a theory that the girl had been killed elsewhere and her body subsequently brought back to the woods where it was found. This evidence was based on an observation from photographs of the body of what appeared to the witness to be a condition of blanching. This will be dealt with later.\nWe will do no more at this point with the medical evidence than attempt to summarize what was before the jury and what the issues were. The first witness was Dr. J. Ll. Penistan, who held an appointment as pathologist in the Attorney General\u2019s Department and was pathologist in charge of the laboratories at the Stratford General Hospital. He arrived at Lawson\u2019s bush at 4:45 p.m. on June 11. He described the position of the body on the ground and the state of the body and the clothing. The girl\u2019s blouse had been torn up one side and was tied tightly around the neck and secured by a knot under the jaw on the left side. There was a pool of blood under the left shoulder, enough to enable him to take a sample amounting to a dessert or tablespoonful. He described the condition of the ground below the fork of the body and took samples of dandelion leaves.\nThe body was removed to Clinton where he conducted an autopsy the same evening. He certified the cause of death as strangulation by a ligature. He removed from the stomach about one pint of a meal of mixed meat and vegetables. Very little of the meal had passed from the duodenum into the small intestine. His conclusion on the time of death is contained in the following extract from his report:\nNote on time of death: This opinion, which would place the time of death between 7.15 and 7.45 p.m. on 9th June, 1959, is based on the following observations and assumptions:\u2014\n1. The extent of decomposition, which is entirely compatible with death approximately 45 hours prior to identification, having regard to the environmental and climatic conditions.\n2. The extent of rigor mortis. This had almost passed off, a finding again compatible with death at the suggested time.\n3. The limited degree of digestion, and the large quantity of food in the stomach. I find it difficult to believe that this food could have been in the stomach for as long as two hours unless some complicating factor was present, of which I have no information. If the last meal was finished at 5.45 p.m., I would therefore conclude that death occurred prior to 7.45 p.m. The finding would be comparable (sic) with death as early as 7.15 p.m.\nThe other medical evidence given by the prosecution related to the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis. On the evening of Friday, June 12, 1959, in the presence of his father, Truscott was examined by Dr. Addison, the family physician, and Dr. Brooks, Senior Air Force Medical Officer. They found what they described as two lesions, one on each of the lateral sides of the shaft of the penis, about the size of a twenty-five cent piece, oozing serum. These lesions were immediately behind the glans. The penis appeared swollen and slightly reddened at the distal end.\nDr. Addison said it looked like a brush burn of two or three days\u2019 duration. He was of the opinion that there was nothing inconsistent with the injuries having been caused by entry into a young small virgin. The injuries could have been caused by a boy of Truscott\u2019s size and age trying to make entry into an under-developed 12 year old girl.\nFrom his examination of the penial injuries, Dr. Brooks was of the opinion that they had been incurred between 60 and 80 hours previously. In fixing the time he allowed for the fact that the injuries would not be exposed to the air.\nThe medical evidence for the defence was given by Dr. Berkely Brown. He is a specialist in internal medicine and a member of the staff of the Department of Medicine, University of Western Ontario Medical School. His opinion was that normal emptying time of the stomach after a mixed meal would be three and one-half to four hours. As to the condition of the penis, he thought that it was highly unlikely that penetration would produce the lesions described. His opinion was that it is rare that the penis is injured during rape and that if it is, the injury is usually to the frenum.\nWe do not wish to give any impression from this brief summary that the medical evidence at trial was in any way perfunctory. It was, in our opinion, careful and detailed, and it was tested by careful and detailed cross-examination. Our purpose at the present time is to show that the medical issues before the jury were well defined. These issues were the time of death and the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis as implicating him in the commission of the crime. On the reference many more witnesses were called. Some supported Dr. Penistan\u2019s opinion on the time of death, some Dr. Brown\u2019s. Some said that the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis was consistent with rape. Others supported an innocent explanation, including Truscott himself. This evidence will have to be analysed in detail. The prosecution submits that the whole of the evidence, including the medical evidence given at trial, after being weighed by the jury leads inevitably to the conclusion of guilt and that there was no room for any other rational conclusion. The Crown\u2019s further submission is that there were no new issues raised on the reference in connection with the time of death and that there was simply more evidence relating to it and that the weight of this evidence supports Dr. Penistan\u2019s opinion that death occurred within two hours of the last known meal, that is, before 7:45 p.m.\nWe next set out the following more detailed summaries of the medical evidence:\n(a) Medical evidence at the trial as to the time of death.\n(b) Medical evidence at the trial and on the reference relating to the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis.\n(c) Medical evidence on the reference taken witness by witness.\n(a) Medical evidence at the trial as to the time of death\nFrom the opening of the trial the attention of the jury was sharply focussed on the importance of the medical evidence as to the time of death. In opening the case to the jury Crown Counsel referred twice to the medical evidence as to the time of death as follows:\nOn this day, Tuesday, June 9th, you will hear witnesses tell of. Lynne\u2019s movements after she left school, playing football as some member of the school team. Some playing field on or near the locale of this, being driven home by her teacher, having her supper with her mother and father, and being seen walking away from her home after the completion of supper. I am avoiding, quite deliberately, giving you times in there of when she arrived home. When she had her supper. When she finished her last meal. When she left the house. I will simply say it was about the supper hour. These times are important, Gentlemen, and I want you to note them as you hear from her parents. They won\u2019t follow one another probably. The mother first and perhaps a little later the father, but I would ask you to note, when they are in the box, what she had to eat. Also when she finished her meal, and I will tell you why. You will later hear from a Provincial Pathologist who did a post-mortem on her body, and he will give you an opinion on the time of her death, based on his observation of her stomach and its contents. His opinion will be based, probably the time of death, to the time of finishing the last meal, so I will prefer you to hear that, because it is of such importance, from the lips of the witnesses, themselves.\n* * *\nThe body was later removed\u2014when I say later, that same afternoon, that later afternoon, to Clinton, where Doctor Penistan, who arrived on the scene at the bush did a post-mortem. He will testify as to the cause of death and also the probable time of death.\nAs witnesses were called for the defence, Counsel for the Defence was required to address the jury first. His address commenced at 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 29th, 1959, and concluded at 4.40 p.m. the same day. There was an adjournment for lunch from 12.45 p.m. to 2.15 p.m. and during the afternoon there was a short recess.\nAll that Counsel for the Defence said as to the time of death as shown by the medical evidence was as follows:\nNow then, there is the question of the time of death. The opinion of an expert is only as good as the facts on which it is based, the opinion is based. If the opinion of an expert is based on facts that are incorrect, then that opinion should carry no weight. When Doctor Penistan said to you Gentlemen: \u201cI place the time of death between seven and seven\u2011forty-five, and I place it at that time because a stomach with a normal meal should empty in from one to two hours, but this meal was poorly masticated and that would increase the time which would be taken to digest this food and I allowed an extra hour because of the poorly masticated meal, and allowing that hour I have placed the time of death at seven to seven-forty-five, because I concluded this food had not been in that stomach more than two hours\u201d. And you heard about his examination. The stomach was emptied into this quart sealer, and then he and Doctor Brooks took the sealer and turned it around like this, and looked at it. And they say they saw this and they saw that. Now, what in the world kind of examination is that on the contents of the stomach to base a time of death? To give evidence on a serious charge such as this?\nHere was a Government Pathologist making his examination by looking at the contents in a bottle with the light against him and the light behind him. There was no chemical examination of the contents of that stomach. There is no evidence of any chemical examination of the contents of that stomach. Doctor Penistan was asked if there was any examination to determine, the hydrochloric acid content of the stomach, which is a good gauge as to the time to which digestion had progressed. No such test was made.\nNow, you heard the evidence of Doctor Brown. He graduated in 1940. He spent a year in pathology and five years in the Army, doing postgraduate work for two years at London, Ontario. He took two more years in London, England. He received a degree of Member of the Royal College of Physicians. He is on the staff of the Medical school of Western University. He specializes in diseases of the stomach. He is a consultant to the Ontario Cancer Association. Consultant to the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and consultant to the Ontario Hospital, but not on mental problems, but the internal physical problems. Now, there is a man of very considerable standing and must be a man who knows his specialty or he wouldn\u2019t have attained such prominence, and his specialty is the stomach. And what did he tell you? He said that the stomach normally empties in between three and a half and four and a half hours, not one to two hours, as Doctor Penistan said.\nNow I suggest to you that a man who specializes in the problems of the stomach is in a very much superior position to help you as to the emptying time of the stomach, rather than a pathologist who does not specialize in the stomach or its problems, and I ask you to accept the evidence of Doctor Brown when he said that the normal emptying time of the stomach was three and a half to four hours. And he said further, because of this poorly masticated food, it would require a further hour and it would take four and a half to five and a half hours for the stomach of this girl to empty.\nNow, Doctor Penistan based his estimate that this food had not been in this stomach more than two hours, on the assumption that the stomach normally empties between one and two hours. I suggest to you that if the stomach emptied in one to two hours, that people would be extremely hungry before the next meal, four or five hours later. I suggest to you that it is only proper that you accept the expert opinion of Doctor Brown. If his opinion is accepted, then you must reject the estimate of the time of death by Doctor Penistan, because it is not based on proper facts. The time of death may be very important. You heard Doctor Brown also say that it was the effort to determine the time of death by the progress which had been made in the digestion of the meal of the stomach was quite unreliable and an unsatisfactory way of determining the time of death. You heard him say that a complete examination of the small bowel would be helpful in determining how much food had passed from the stomach. You heard Doctor Penistan state that the stomach was distended with one pint of food. Now, we have no information as to how much food was consumed. I asked Mrs. Harper how much meat was served to the girl and she didn\u2019t know. Her husband had served it. So none of the witnesses gave you any information as to how much food had been consumed. Surely it would take considerably longer to digest a big meal than a small meal. You heard Doctor Brown say that if a pint of food is consumed, that the stomach will produce a pint of digestive juices and you then have two pints in the stomach, and according to him the stomach wouldn\u2019t be fully distended\u2014the stomach of this girl wouldn\u2019t be fully distended unless it contained three or four pints.\nAnd then, again, Doctor Penistan may be in error in his estimate of the contents of the stomach. You saw the jar. About a half a pint. A quart sealer, about a quarter of the sealer is filled with the contents. Now, it may be said that some part of that was used up in tests, but we know of no tests. The doctor certainly didn\u2019t use any up. I suggest to you it would be dangerous to assume that the doctor removed more than that quantity of food from the stomach. And I do, with all sincerity, suggest to you twelve men, on whose shoulders rests the question of the guilt or non-guilt of this accused, that it would be highly dangerous, in view of the evidence of Doctor Brown, to accept the evidence of Doctor Penistan on that point.\nCounsel for the Crown dealt with this question of the time of death as follows:\nOn Tuesday, June 9th, Lynne Harper, age twelve, played ball after school, was driven home by her teacher, Miss Blair, and then had her supper of turkey, peas, etc., finishing at a quarter to six. You have the evidence of both her parents on that. When her body was found in the bush, Thursday, June the 11th, Doctor John Penistan, a Provincial Pathologist with a highly specialized education and training, and years of experience in determining causes of death and time of death, and all the particulars can only be arrived at by a doctor trained in a specialist field.\nHe arrived soon after the body was found and attended at the scene where it was found in Lawson\u2019s bush. He made a study of the position of the body, the surroundings, calculated the climatic conditions that applied. The marks, the terrain, made some observations on what he noticed about the flattening of vegetation between the legs. Marks, I said. This blouse about the neck. He was at a great advantage to find it there and see the body at the scene. And then he had the body removed to a Funeral Home in Clinton and performed a full post-mortem examination there. From careful study he gave the opinion that death had taken place where the body was found, in Lawson\u2019s woods. I do not believe he was cross-examined on that. That was his stated, clear opinion, that death had taken place in Lawson\u2019s woods. He gave the cause of death as strangulation by the blouse knotted around the neck. And, Gentlemen, you will have among the Exhibits you take out to the Jury room, a picture, Exhibit forty-two, that will show you how that blouse was about the neck. That picture was taken at the funeral home.\nNow, Doctor Penistan, after all these observations, gave the time of death, which is important. He gave the time of death as from seven p.m. to 7:45 p.m. on the date of Tuesday, June 9th. That is an hour and fifteen minutes, two hours after the last meal, and no one has raised, I suggest, a suggestion or doubt, serious doubt but what she finished her last meal\u2014consumed her last food at a quarter to six, as described by her parents.\nNow, on what did he base his observation? On what did he base his opinion? First he had the stomach, which he described as distended with about a pint of contents. These were put in a jar. The jar was taken to Toronto, to Mr. Brown. The evidence of Mr. Brown was he turned the jar and contents over to Mr. Funk of the laboratory. You heard my explanation, that I had run out of expert witnesses. I did not call Mr. Funk, but I made him available to the defence. You haven\u2019t heard from Mr. Funk. I only leave to you, Gentlemen, from the evidence of Doctor Penistan, what went into the jar, the amount that went into the jar, to draw your reasonable inference.\nNow, he observed the limited degree of digestion or change in these contents. The absence or near absence of anything in the intestine, the small intestine leading from the stomach. He observed the extent of decomposition, and he observed the extent of rigor mortis in the body, and from those three factors he arrived at the opinion he gave you of the time of death as being from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.\nNow, what doubt does the defence cast on that opinion of Doctor Penistan, on the time of death? Obviously the defence speaks to show you that it was later, that Doctor Penistan was wrong. And on what do they rely? I might have mentioned, incidentally, that Doctor Brooks was present during the autopsy and confirmed the observations that he and Doctor Penistan each made of the stomach contents, the extent of digestion and so on. But Doctor Brooks, probably, despite his high qualifications in the general field of medicine, did not give opinions or attempt to do so on the rigor mortis factor, because he acknowledged that to be the field of Doctor Penistan.\nNow in advancing their theory that death was later. What does the defence put before you? They called Doctor Brown who never saw the stomach, who never was in the woods, never saw the body, never saw the quantity of food in the stomach when it was opened, the nature of the food, never noted the emptiness of the intestines. No chance to know anything about rigor mortis, the state of the body, its decomposition, but just from learning, just from learning. He gives a time of three and a half, four hours, for an average meal. He doesn\u2019t know how much the girl ate. Nobody has any actual record of that. He gave this estimate of three and a half to four hours for an average meal to leave\u2014mind you, Gentlemen, to empty out of the stomach. But this stomach, as described by Doctor Penistan when he removed it and looked at it, was distended with food. It wasn\u2019t an empty stomach. It was, largely, a full stomach.\nSo I suggest, with all respect to Doctor Brown and his qualifications, that he just hasn\u2019t any basis for giving a counter estimate on the time of death at all. I don\u2019t know whether, if you followed through on his opinion, when an average meal leaves a stomach in three and a half hours, and you found a half empty stomach, whether that means the food has been there one hour and a half, or one hour and three-quarters, I don\u2019t know how he would enlarge that. But he simply based everything on an empty stomach, which wasn\u2019t here. And again, Gentlemen, he didn\u2019t have any of those other aids, rigor mortis, decomposition and the other things to go on with at all. So I say, with all respect, there is nothing, absolutely nothing for Doctor Brown to give you, or Doctor Brown did give you, to interfere with Doctor Penistan\u2019s opinion.\nNow, Doctor Brown was quoted yesterday as saying that the examination of the stomach, as a means of indicating time of death, was an unreliable test. I did not so regard his evidence. I suggest to you, Gentlemen, that what he said was acknowledging it was used, that he said it was and it has to be used with caution.\nWell, you heard Doctor Penistan during his considerable time in the box, and I suggest from your observations of Doctor Penistan, his person, manner of giving testimony and his responsible official position and years of experience, you can safely assume he would be cautious in a case like this, and everything considered, taking the three bases for his opinion, that you can take it with safety that this girl was killed, that she died from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. on Tuesday, June 9th. I don\u2019t know whether the doctor\u2014I think they made it clear, but the stomach ceases to function on death and that is the basis for this test. Nothing more gets out of the stomach once death takes place.\nNow, we come to apply that opinion of time of death and I suggest to you Gentlemen, it is awfully important when this girl died. Now, who was with her during this time? What person or persons had the opportunity to kill her from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.? I suggest that a review of the facts narrows those facts like a vice on Steven Truscott and no one else.\nThe trial judge dealt with the medical evidence as to the time of death as follows:\nDoctor Penistan said, having regard to the food that he found in her stomach, and the fact that in his opinion the stomach empties itself after a meal within two hours, that she had died within two hours after having her supper.\nThe evidence was that she had left home at a quarter to six, that she had finished her supper, I should say, at a quarter to six in the evening, so Doctor Penistan concluded that she had died before a quarter to eight.\nLater he said:\nAccording to Doctor Penistan, and to the medical evidence, she died at a time which is not altogether, in any view, inconsistent with her having finished her dinner at about a quarter to six. Doctor Brown says, and I must draw it to your attention, that it takes three and a half to four hours to empty the stomach and it is on the basis of that that the defence asks you to say that she could not have been killed before Steve returned at 8:00 p.m. You have Doctor Brown\u2019s testimony. It is unfortunate always, that medical men should disagree on what is more or less a scientific point. Doctor Brown says three and a half hours to four hours.\nNow, the stomach, of course, was not empty; Doctor Penistan said there was still a pint of food in the stomach and he removed that pint. It is true there is not a pint of food in the bottle now, and it is for you Gentlemen to accept or reject Doctor Penistan\u2019s evidence that he took a pint out, but Doctor Brooks was there and saw the pint. Don\u2019t forget that the bottle went to the Attorney-General\u2019s Laboratories, for tests and we don\u2019t know exactly what happened to it there except it was handed to some man whom we have not seen. It will be for you to say whether you accept Doctor Penistan\u2019s theory, an Attorney-General\u2019s Pathologist of many years\u2019 standing, or do you accept Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence.\nIn his objections after the conclusion of the judge\u2019s charge, counsel for the defence said:\nAnd, My Lord, it is the theory of the Defence that Doctor Penistan was in error when he said that the time required to empty the stomach after a normal meal was one to two hours. You did tell them that Doctor Brown said that this time was three and a half to four and a half hours, but it is the theory of the Defence if Doctor Penistan was incorrect and Doctor Brown was right, then that would throw out Doctor Penistan\u2019s calculations as to the time of death. With respect, My Lord, I would submit Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence was dismissed very summarily by Your Lordship. This is a man of very considerable prominence, and should carry a considerable amount of weight, My Lord. In the course of a re-charge of the jury the trial judge dealt with this as follows:\nI am asked to point out to you that the theory of the Defence is that Doctor Penistan is in error when he says it only takes an hour or two hours to empty the stomach and you can accept the evidence of Doctor Brown, or at least, Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence should raise a doubt in your mind. You can understand the point is that his theory is that food took three and a half hours from a quarter to six to leave the stomach, that she must have died at a time later than the time that Steven was at the river, that she must have died after Steven came home, and therefore, it couldn\u2019t be Steven who killed her. That is what the theory of the Defence is. I am not going to go over all the evidence again.\nDr. Penistan\u2019s evidence in chief as to the time of death as shown by the quantity and condition of the stomach contents was as follows:\nQ. Yes, that is my next question, Doctor.\nA. The stomach, under normal conditions, proceeds with the digestion of food and as it is digested the stomach empties through the duodenum into the small intestines. This process is normally completed within two hours. I have to bear in mind here that the food in the stomach, as I said, appeared to have been very poorly chewed, appeared to have been bolted, and swallowed without proper chewing, which would tend to slow down the digestion and the emptying of the stomach. I think, therefore, that while\u2014if I found a normal meal, normally chewed, well-chewed meal in the stomach, digested to the slight extent this food was digested, I would conclude that it had not been there for more than an hour. I would, however, make some allowance for the fact of the poor chewing of the food and give as my opinion that the food had not been in the stomach for more than two hours.\nQ. Could it have been for a lesser time?\nA. It could certainly, sir have been for a lesser time.\nQ. To what?\nA. I would estimate between one and two hours.\nQ. You were in the Courtroom when Mrs. Harper testified this girl finished her meal at a quarter to six?\nA. I was, sir.\nQ. On that basis, sir, you would put her time of death at\u2026\nA. As prior to a quarter to eight\u2026\nQ. As early as\u2026\nA. Probably between seven and a quarter to eight.\nAs to fixing the time of death from post-mortem changes he said in chief:\nQ. Apart from the stomach, these contents, Doctor, is there any other observations that would assist in determining the cause of death or the time of death?\nA. Yes, sir. I referred in my description of the body to the post-mortem changes which were beginning to occur in the fat underneath the skin and in the lungs and indeed, in most of the organs of the body. I refer also to the fact that rigor mortis was still, although only just, demonstrable. Having regard to the environment and the atmospheric conditions about that time, which as I recollect clearly the weather was hot and the environment was damp, conditions under which changes tend to take place rather more rapidly than usual, I felt that these\u2014the state of the body suggested that death had occurred some two days previously.\nQ. I take it, Doctor, that is supplementary to your stomach observations?\nA. That is divorced from the observations on the stomach. Should I add it was my view that the changes were entirely compatible with the time of death as shows from the stomach contents and the other evidence?\nIn cross-examination, the question of the accuracy of an estimate made from observing post-mortem changes was dealt with as follows:\nQ. Doctor, you told us about the post-mortem changes in this body?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And there were many factors that could contribute to the variation of time that it would take for those changes to occur, would it not?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And that is not a very accurate way of estimating the time of death. It would be difficult to tie it down within five or six hours of those changes, wouldn\u2019t it?\nA. Yes, sir.\nThe cross-examination of Dr. Penistan was directed to showing the unreliability of an estimate of the time of death based on an examination of the contents of the stomach. It showed:\ni) that the examination of the stomach contents was visual and by the naked eye;\nii) that there were differences between the description of the contents as given by Dr. Penistan at the trial and (a) at the preliminary hearing and (b) as recorded in his notes made at the time of the autopsy;\niii) that there are many factors which may slow down or speed up digestive processes;\niv) that unchewed peas, of which there were many, are not digested in the stomach at all because they are covered by cellulose;\nv) that the doctor made no test of the hydrochloric acid contained in the stomach contents.\nDr. Brooks described the removal and visual examination of the stomach contents. He was not asked to give an opinion as to the time of death. Dr. Brown\u2019s evidence may be summarized as follows:\nHe said, in chief, the normal emptying time of the stomach after a mixed meal containing starch, protein and fat would be three and one-half to four hours; that one hour should be added if the meal was poorly masticated; that any estimate of time of death from stomach contents must be made with caution as there are so many factors which can cause great variations; and that in cases of accidents requiring an emergency operation it is thought dangerous to operate if the patient has eaten within the past six or eight hours because he may vomit and cause suffocation.\nIn cross-examination he said that in the normal case the stomach would be empty at the end of three and one-half to four hours and counsel for the Crown stressed that the stomach of the deceased was by no means empty. Dr. Brown agreed that Dr. Penistan had a better opportunity of forming an opinion than he himself had because Dr. Penistan had actually seen the contents of the stomach. He said he had never before been called into court to testify as to the time of death of a deceased person.\n(b) Summary of medical evidence at trial and on the reference relating to the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis.\nAt the trial, evidence was given by Doctors Addison and Brooks, who medically examined Truscott on the night of June 12 at the R.C.A.F. guardhouse at Clinton. The only other evidence by an actual observer of his condition was given by Truscott himself on the reference.\nThe medical examination was conducted in the presence of Truscott\u2019s father. Dr. Addison, a medical doctor at Clinton, who had practised for 20 years, described his observations as follows:\nThe penis, on first examination, appeared swollen and slightly reddened on the distal end\u2026 By stretching the skin, pulling it upwards towards the body, there were two large raw sores\u2014they were like a brush burn. They were raw and there was serum oozing from the sores. They were located just behind the groove on the lateral side of the penis on either side. Roughly about the size of the ball of my thumb. The diameter, circumference involved would be roughly that of a quarter\u2014a twenty-five cent piece\u2014each one.\nI have never seen one as sore as that at any time\u2014of that nature. I have seen one a few months ago that had a cancer of the penis that looked an awful lot sorer. And I attended one, at one time, a cow stepped on, that was a lot sorer\u2026 It (Truscott\u2019s) was sorer than any I have ever seen other than those two I have mentioned. Dealing with the cause of these injuries he said:\nThere would have to be friction in an oval shaped orifice. An oval shaped knot hole or something like that. Something of an oval shape and sufficiently rough to cause a friction or wear of the outer surface of the skin.\nHe expressed the opinion that these abrasions could have been caused by a boy of this size and age trying to make entry into a girl of twelve. Truscott was sexually developed, the same as any man, and trying to make entry could cause the sores on his penis.\nThere was no scab on these lesions, there was a serous discharge.\nDr. Brooks was the senior medical officer at the R.C.A.F. station at Clinton. He described Truscott as a sexually well developed adult. He found on each side of the shaft of Truscott\u2019s penis, a lesion just bigger than a twenty-five cent piece. There was no bleeding. There was oozing and, by the time of the examination, the oozing was stagnant. He estimated the duration of the lesions at between 60 and 80 hours before. He stated that this was the worst lesion of this nature that he had ever seen. Since he started medical school he had done 20 years of medicine and he had never seen one as bad as this.\nIn his opinion the lesions were caused by pushing the erect organ into a very narrow orifice. They could have resulted from penetration or attempted penetration of the private parts of a young girl such as Lynne Harper. There was no injury to the glans of the penis.\nEvidence was given at the trial on behalf of the defence by Dr. Brown, of London, Ontario, who was in the Canadian Army for five years, and who subsequently did post-graduate work in internal medicine, with emphasis on diseases of the digestive system.\nThe facts stated by Doctors Addison and Brooks were recited to him. He stated he had seen very similar types of lesions. He said a lesion of the size of a twenty-five cent piece is a large size. He had seen lesions of at least a ten-cent size.\nAs to the cause of such a lesion, he said it would be highly unlikely that penetration would produce a lesion of this sort. The penis is rarely injured in rape. When injured, it is usually a tearing injury confined to the head of the penis, which has a larger circumference. When the hymen is ruptured by the head there may be a pulling that will tear the urinary opening and the fold of skin (frenum) leading from that opening to the foreskin.\nTruscott testified for the first time at the Reference. He said that the description of the lesions given by Doctors Addison and Brooks at the trial did not fit the condition that existed on the night the examination was made. The sores were a lot smaller than they had been described. There was a sore on each side, well on the way to healing. There was no oozing whatsoever. They had been in that condition for two weeks.\nWhen he first noticed anything unusual, it was about six weeks prior to his arrest. There were little blisters. They continued to worsen until the time he was \u201cpicked up\u201d. One blister would break and it just seemed that more would appear. He did not know what caused them to break.\nHe did not tell his father about them because he was embarrassed. The first persons whom he told about the condition as he first noticed it were his counsel on the Reference when they interviewed him at the penitentiary. He was then asked by Counsel what it looked like when he first noticed it.\nThe condition had never existed before. A similar condition did develop subsequently on his back and side of the neck. The condition of his penis cleared up while he was at Guelph. It just seemed to heal and went away. It did not hurt.\nOn the Reference, evidence was given relating to this point by a number of doctors.\nDr. Marcinowsky described an inflamed cyst of the dorsum of Truscott\u2019s penis, at Guelph, in May 1962.\nDr. Danby, a specialist in dermatology, practising in Kingston, gave evidence as to his treatments of Truscott for dermatitis at Kingston on different occasions in respect of his face, shoulders, upper arms and ears. Dealing with the condition described by Dr. Addison, he expressed the opinion that if there were an injury which had occurred two or three days before, there would have been bleeding visible in and around the lesions.\nHe disagreed with Dr. Addison\u2019s opinion as to the possible cause of the lesions, i.e., attempting to have intercourse with a young girl. He had never, in his experience, seen lesions of the kind described attributed to forceful intercourse. He had never seen lesions on the side of a penis attributed to force in intercourse. He was not aware of any medical literature, describing such lesions, attributing them to force in intercourse.\nIf the condition originated in a number of blisters, that condition could have resulted in lesions of the kind described, apart from intercourse. The condition could have begun as a case of herpes simplex. The area is one where sweating, contact of skin surfaces, secondary bacterial infection and irritation could combine to produce lesions.\nDr. Wrong, of Toronto, a specialist in dermatology, was questioned as to his opinion of the view expressed by Dr. Addison concerning the possible cause of the lesions. He said that such lesions are seen in many dermatological conditions, not just following injury. They are seen with many diseases in which blisters appear on the skin.\nI would say these lesions are not diagnostic of any one specific thing and I personally, if I had examined him, with the descriptions read, would not have been able to say definitely these could not have been caused by such alone.\nHe said it is extremely unlikely to have such an injury caused by intercourse or attempted intercourse, but he would not say it was impossible. He had not found anything comparable to this in the standard textbooks.\nIt would be unusual for simple herpes to affect two sides of the penis at the same time, but not impossible. Simple herpes of itself would not produce erosions. Secondary infection could do so, i.e., simple herpes plus infection, or irritation from sweating, and the skin surfaces rubbing together.\nDr. Petty, of Baltimore, is the assistant medical examiner for the State of Maryland. He had never seen lesions on either side of the shaft of the penis allegedly as a result of intercourse of any type. He had never read of penial lesions following intercourse. It was highly improbable that they could have been caused in that way.\nDr. Camps, of London, professor of forensic medicine at the University of London, when asked about the opinion of Doctors Addison and Brooks respecting the cause of the lesions, said:\nFrom a mechanical point of view and from my experience I don\u2019t think that this is the sort of injury which could occur from sexual intercourse. It is the wrong part of the organ for one thing. The commonest injury occurring in this type of forced intercourse is a tear of the prepuce, which mechanically is one place that is vulnerable and which can be pulled on, or when push and force is exerted it is pulled in that way.\nAsked regarding medical literature on the subject, he had not found anything indicating a lesion of that sort.\nHowever, so little interest is paid in textbooks to this type of injury that in many textbooks it is barely mentioned.\nDr. Simpson, of London, head of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Guy\u2019s Hospital, called by the Crown, gave the following evidence:\nQ. Finally, Dr. Simpson, I think you have read and you have heard read in this Court the evidence of a Dr. Addison and a Dr. Brooks relating to penile injuries to the accused Steven Truscott, and I think, sir, I know you were aware, in addition to that evidence, the evidence of Mr. Truscott himself relating to these injuries. Have you any comments regarding those, sir?\nA. Yes, sir, when I first read the description of these I had not seen a picture of them and, of course, I did not see them, but when I first read a description of them I found them perplexing, for I would agree with the evidence I heard, they are not the ordinary kind of injury one sees in forcible or difficult sexual intercourse. But having heard the evidence of Steven Truscott that he\u2014if I understood it correctly\u2014already had some condition of soreness on his penis, this seems to me to give a clue to the rather curious nature of these two patches.\nQ. In what way, Dr. Simpson?\nA. Well, I think that if Truscott was right and he had patches there, there are two possibilities. One is that these patches\u2014I think they were described as quarter size or thereabouts, patches on each side of the penis, and the other is that these patches were rubbed in some way which caused them to become more sore or to weep or crust, and I would regard that as being consistent with the penis being thrust into or being held, to be pushed into or being held in some way in a sexual gesture as a part of a sexual assault.\n(c) Summary of Medical Evidence given on the Reference witness by witness\nHenry John Funk is an analyst in the biological field with the Attorney General\u2019s Department. On June 12, 1959, he received the jar containing the stomach contents. On a visual examination he described it as being made up of pieces and chunks. Its general consistency reminded him of a thick stew. His examination was made between June 12 and August 31. He found pineapple, celery, pickled cucumber, cauliflower, peas, onion, potatoes, and what appeared to be two types of meat. It seemed to be consistent with ham and some type of fowl. Many of the foods that were supposed to have been eaten by Lynne Harper he found in the mixture. The total volume of the mixture was 250 cubic centimetres\u2014eight to nine ounces.\nDr. Noble Sharpe. He has been the Medical Director of the Attorney General\u2019s Department since 1951 and is now about to retire. From 1923 to 1950 he did hospital pathology. He received the jar from Funk on June 12. For his examination he removed between 50 and 60 cubic centimetres. He saw undigested food mixed with some that was partially digested. He recognized certain vegetables but remembers only peas, some of which had been swallowed without chewing and were whole. He made no further examination of the recognizable parts because Mr. Funk was going to make the detailed examination.\nThe stomach contents were strongly acid. He concluded that gastric juices had been secreted and it was not just a recently chewed and swallowed meal. His rough estimate of the time needed to develop that amount of acid was about one hour. It was quite a good amount. He saw some muscle fibres, striated muscle fibres, and knew that meat had been eaten but had no idea what kind of meat. He described the contents as resembling a thick, lumpy stew. There was little or no fluid in it. Based on the thick consistency and the fact that the acid was present, he considered that the stomach contents had not been long enough in the stomach to be suitable for passing out into the duodenum. It was not in the condition of chyme, at which stage the contents are ready to pass into the duodenum.\nIt is known that after an ordinary meal the contents are ready to leave the stomach at the end of two hours and that they go out in small amounts, about three cubic centimetres at a time, for the next two hours so that by the end of the fourth hour after the food has been taken, the stomach is usually nearly empty. In his opinion the stomach contents had been in the stomach for one to two hours after eating. He admitted that there are many conditions that cause variation\u2014likes and dislikes, preparation of the food, proper cooking, whether or not the food is fatty as fatty food takes longer to digest, the state of hunger of the person concerned, whether he had been exercising before eating or taking it easy, emotions, anatomical position of the stomach, and many others. He agreed with what he wrote some time ago in an article \u201cRate of Cooling as an Index of Time of Death\u201d. It is as follows:\nFor a long time I had felt that pathologists are placed in an awkward position by the emphasis in courts on estimation of the time of death from the rate of cooling, rigor mortis, decomposition and stomach contents. These four bases for estimation depend on variable factors. The pathologist is usually asked by the investigating officer to give them a rough starting time for investigation or the period in which particularly to focus. This may get into the report and is later mentioned in court.\nBoth prosecution and defence are prone to emphasize those points which are of benefit to their particular view of the case. The time based on one or more of these four examinations is at most an approximation, an inspired or educated guess. It is more likely only a probability or a hunch. It is of use to the investigator but of much less value to the court.\nDr. Cedrick Keith Simpson is head of the Department of Forensic Medicine, Guy\u2019s Hospital, London; Professor of Forensic Medicine, University of London; Lecturer in Forensic Medicine, University of Oxford; Home Office Consultant since 1935, and has done work with the Forensic Science Group of Scotland Yard since that date. The summary of his opinion is contained in the following extract:\nA. I would say that, my lord, it appears to me in this case most creditable that Dr. Penistan paid particular attention to this matter. In my own experience this is not always so. I would say that his conclusion, based, as I see it, on the presence in the stomach of something approaching a pint of relatively dry food, that is to say, without a measureable quantity of fluid which could be separated from it, from the fact that it was of a kind and quality which he observed and had confirmed in the laboratory, from the fact that this whole amount, with the exception of a little material which had passed on to the small bowel, still lay in the stomach. I would say that unless he took into consideration some unusual or extraordinary conditions, that he was right to conclude that it was likely that death had taken place somewhere up to two hours after eating that meal.\nThere was a fragment of food in the bronchial air passage, which is common in asphyxial deaths. The cause of death was strangulation by a ligature. There was injury to one of the voice box bones, discoloration of the face and the characteristic asphyxial hemorrhage in the lungs and thymus gland.\nOn an examination of the photographs taken at the scene where the body was found, there was nothing inconsistent with death having taken place where the girl was found and photographed. He agrees with Dr. Penistan that the twigs on the ground would cause the type of puncture wound found on the body.\nAs to lividity, looking at two photographs taken in the mortuary, he agreed that the chin and left cheek and region over and above the left eyebrow and the nose showed pallor against the general colour of the face, the colour he takes to be that described as lividity engorgement. The discoloration was consequent on strangulation. His explanation was that two other photographs taken where the body was found show the body turned on its left side and lying partly on some sheeting or covering. So long as the blood was fluid when this took place, it would be natural for the pressure to give these areas just where they appear to have developed. He was asked how long blood remains fluid in a dead body and he could not give any definite answer. Sometimes it never appears to clot; sometimes it clots in a short period and becomes dissolved again. The variations are so vast that no figure can be given. As to the absence of acid phosphatase on the twigs and dandelion leaves which were preserved for sampling and taken at the scene of the crime, he said:\nA. Well, I have seen many cases of both sexual intercourse against resistance as shown by injuries and other marks about the body, and I would say that in some of them one does see seminal fluid not only in the vagina but at the orifice and extending from it on to the thighs or down between the crotch, but by no means always, and I would certainly not regard the absence of spermatozoic fluid on the ground between the crotch area as giving any evidence that sexual intercourse of some kind did not take place where the body lay.\nAs to rigor mortis, one of the witnesses said that an arched back and the fingers indicated that this was present in the mortuary. Dr. Penistan had said that rigor mortis had almost passed away. Dr. Simpson said that he was surprised to hear the witness refer to the arched back as an indication of the degree of rigor. He said that was the natural shape of the body and that dead or alive, it would preserve its shape. He says that one sees that every day. It is a matter of common sense and personal observation.\nAs to the suggestion of rigor mortis in the fingers by Dr. Petty, he said that two of the fingers were being held by the assistant to hold the hand in a certain position for the taking of photographs. His estimate of the emptying of the stomach and the time of death as indicated by it is contained in the following extract:\nQ. Doctor, if I may turn for a moment, sir, to a general discussion of the stomach contents\u2014and again in this matter I am making the assumption and premise that you have heard read the evidence of Dr. Penistan regarding the stomach content, you have heard the evidence of Mr. John Funk and you heard the evidence of Dr. Noble Sharpe\u2014based on that premise, what do you say, doctor, as to setting of a time or approximate time of death from stomach contents?\nA. Well, sir, I would say that based upon my own experience of those cases in which the time of the last meal is known, and based upon the relatively few quotations that can be listed from the textbooks in forensic medicine\u2014I refer to Sidney Smith and Poison, in particular, and based upon the enormous\u2014I think no other word could be used to describe it\u2014enormous literature from the physiologists on the emptying process of the stomach, it would seem to me there is general consensus of view that the process of emptying is a gradual one which appears to be best described in terms of a half life, that is to say, during a period of time which seems to be within thirty minutes and an hour, around about forty-five minutes, perhaps, the stomach half empties itself, and then in a similar period half empties itself again, and again, and again. So that it is described as a half life. I would say that if these observations are correct\u2014and there is an overwhelmingly large literature in support of this\u2014that one might have expected, as Sidney Smith and Poison and my own experience, of course, one might have expected the bulk of the meal to have left the stomach inside two hours. This seems to me a generalization which experience and experiment support.\nQ. Based on what you have read from the original trial transcript and what you have heard in this Court, what conclusion and opinion would you have come to in this matter?\nA. As I say, I think\u2014certainly earlier in my evidence, sir\u2014I think that based on the amount of food in the stomach as compared with the little, the very little, I think it was described, that had started to pass into the small bowel, based on its character and the relatively little indeed which appears to be an unmeasurable quantity of food which was present, that this girl\u2019s death must, if the stomach be taken as an indication of it\u2014and I think it is the one useful indication in this case\u2014must have taken place within two hours of her taking that meal.\nQ. Doctor, are there, as has been described in this Court, variables that do in fact affect the digestion, such as emotion?\nA. Yes, sir, I think that if that view is looked at more critically, I think one has to be prepared if there is some evidence to qualify it in some way. If there is some evidence about outside conditions that\u2014such as emergency, for instance\u2014that may affect the stomach, then one must be prepared to qualify it, but in the absence of such evidence I would say that Dr. Penistan was quite right to give as an indication and estimation a period which is about usual, about normal, which would be likely, and the last thing I would say, sir, about that, is that there are of course upper and lower limits to this. Some stomachs, some stomach contents empty a little earlier and some a little later.\nQ. Doctor, I just have two further questions, one dealing, sir, with the evidence that was given in this Court relating, Dr. Simpson, to changes in the decomposition of this body, and very generally, and paraphrasing again, they were referred to as swelling, bloating and lack of venous patterning and other decomposition changes. What value, if any, sir, based on your experience, do you attach to decomposition changes such as I have just mentioned to you?\nA. I would say, sir, that those words, described as stated decomposition which is becoming well marked, and they did not appear to be present in this case, that the earliest of changes is commonly, usually, I think, a discolouration in the flanks of the body or in the veins rising up out of the trunk, and this is likely to be seen from about forty-eight hours, but it varies according to temperature.\nQ. Were you surprised to read and to hear and not to find here swelling and bloating and a venous pattern?\nA. No, sir, no, these I would not expect to be likely to become evident until about the second to third, to fourth day, or later on, that depending on the outside conditions.\nQ. There was also a reference very briefly to the lack of greenish discolouration in the flanks of the body. What is your comment, if any, sir, regarding that?\nA. Well, sir, this is the earliest of the signs. As I say, it would be likely to appear somewhere about the second day, the forty-eighth hour, but it need not be present. Indeed it need not appear at all.\nDr. Milton Helpern has been Chief Medical Examiner for the City of New York since 1954 and is visiting Professor of Pathology, Cornell University; Professor and Chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine, New York University School of Medicine. Cause of death was strangulation. The food of microscopic size in the bronchials was one incident in the process of dying by strangulation. The place of death was where the body was found. He disagreed with Dr. Petty that twigs would not cause the puncture wounds. He agreed with Dr. Simpson that apparent blanching and whitening shown in the photographs to which he referred was attributable to the body having been turned on its side and that the only valid evidence on this subject was to be found in a photograph of the body before it was disturbed or turned and which showed no blanching. He disagreed with Dr. Petty that there was any evidence of rigor mortis in the arched back or the fingers.\nHis opinion as to stomach contents is contained in the following extract:\nQ. Now, based on your experience that goes back many years, sir, based on those, the factors developed and shown by that testi- mony, what if any opinion would you have as to how long that stomach content had been in that particular stomach of this young girl?\nA. In my opinion, from the amount of food in the stomach and from the fact that this was a healthy body, the body of a healthy young girl, and from the fact that death was rapid, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the time it took this person to die was rather short, and from all these factors I would conclude that this food had been ingested no more than two hours after\u2014that is, that death had occurred, I\u2019m sorry, gentlemen\u2014that death had occurred no more than two hours after the food was ingested. I think that is the rule in these cases.\nQ. That is from your experience in these matters, sir?\nA. Yes, I have been particularly interested in recent years in the emptying time of the stomach, and we have had enough cases in which we could find a large amount of recently ingested food, that is, easily recognizable food in large amounts and in which we were able to determine the time the food was ingested, and in those cases the food was ingested less than two hours prior to death.\nI might explain, in discussing this I don\u2019t want to be\u2014to appear to be just arbitrary about this thing. There are conditions which do slow up the emptying of the stomach, and the most common condition that does this is coma. In other words, this opinion could not be common in a man who was knocked down by an automobile and then died as a result of brain injury, having lain in a coma for several days. I have seen food in the stomach in cases like that which has been in the stomach for over a week, but in a person who is healthy, who dies suddenly or rapidly, I would say that this amount of food and the condition it was in is indicative of a time of death, about two hours or within two hours of the ingestion of the food. Now, this is the rule.\nDr. Samuel Robert Gerber has been the Coroner, since 1937, of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes the City of Cleveland.\nWithout going into his evidence in detail, he agreed with Dr. Simpson and Dr. Helpern as to the cause of death, the place of death and the cause of the signs of blanching.\nHe agreed with the others and Dr. Penistan that the arched back and the fingers were no indication of rigor mortis.\nHis opinion was that the food had been in the stomach less than two hours after ingestion.\nDr. Charles Sutherland Petty is now Assistant Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland. He was Chief Resident in Pathology at various hospitals from 1952 to 1955 and a Teaching Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Pathology from 1952 to 1955; Instructor and Assistant Professor of Pathology, Louisiana State School of Medicine 1955 to 1958; Associate Professor of Forensic Pathology, University of the State of Maryland and Associate in Public Health Administration, Johns Hopkins University.\nDr. Penistan\u2019s report was put before him and he was asked for his conclusion as to the time of death. His opinion was that the time of death could only be stated within very broad limits. These broad limits are stated to be:\nA. These broad limits lie anywhere between several minutes to several hours; thirty minutes to perhaps eight hours. The missing factors here: Dr. Penistan mentioned the bolting of the food or the rapidity evidently with which the food was eaten. The fact it had not been well chewed is a factor which caused him to advance the time from one hour to perhaps two hours after eating, the interval between eating and death. But I do not see that he has taken into consideration any of the many other factors which might change the emptying time of the stomach or change the amount of food that one would see in the stomach at the time of the autopsy.\nQ. What are, in a general way\u2014Would you describe the factors which must be\u2014which cause a variation in the rate of digestion and the rate of the emptying of the stomach?\nA. Well, there are many. We do not know, for example, whether this girl was taking drugs; we do not know whether this individual, in fact was emotionally disturbed; we do not know whether there was loss of the stomach contents significantly, that is, into the duodenum or, indeed, further into the small and large intestine; and, as a matter of fact, we do not know how much, if any, of the food was lost through either opening into the stomach. There are two, the top opening from the esophagus and the bottom opening into the duodenum. We do not know even, for example, whether or not there was loss of food through the esophagus either during the act of dying or after the death occurred.\nOn a consideration of Dr. Brooks\u2019 evidence given at the trial as to the contents of the stomach, he repeated his opinion that the estimate would vary from minutes to hours.\nThe evidence of Mr. Funk, the analyst, and Dr. Noble Sharpe was then put before him and he was asked to assume the correctness of the description of the contents given by these witnesses. His answer was:\nQ. Now, again assuming the correctness of the description of the contents given by Mr. Funk and Dr. Sharpe, does that affect the opinion that you have expressed?\nA. No, sir, it does not, because we do not know what factors were present between the time the meal was eaten and the time that death occurred. Again returning to Dr. Penistan\u2019s evidence as between one and two hours, or prior to a quarter to eight, and probably between seven and a quarter to eight, his answer was:\nQ. The question I want to now ask you, what is your opinion as to whether the time of death can be put within such narrow limits, based on the stomach contents and the state to which digestion had proceeded, assuming the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to his observations is correct, and assuming the evidence of Mr. Funk and Dr. Sharpe, as to their observations, is correct?\nA. Based on the appearance of the stomach contents, the amount of the stomach contents, the degree to which the stomach contents had apparently been digested, I would find myself completely unable to pinpoint any time, a figure such as seven o\u2019clock to seven forty-five, or a quarter to seven to a quarter to eight.\nOn being questioned about Dr. Penistan\u2019s finding that very little had passed through the duodenum into the small intestine, he replied:\nQ. Just taking the information as you have it, the facts I have given to you by themselves, if you were in possession of those facts and that description, what would be the limits either way in which you would place the time of death?\nA. Again, sir, several minutes, 20, 30, 40 minutes, perhaps five days, possibly as long as eight hours.\n(NOTE: It says five days in the record. We assume that the witness must have intended to say five hours.)\nHe then went on to deal with rigor mortis and what is sometimes called post-mortem lividity or hypostasis. He found evidence of rigor mortis from the arched back and the position of the fingers and the position of the leg on the mortuary table \u201cprovided the leg has not been placed there deliberately or accidentally\u201d.\nHis conclusion was that the onset of rigor mortis is rapid in a warm environment (and the weather was very warm on June 9, June 10 and June 11). He also says that rigor mortis disappears more rapidly in a warm environment and his conclusion was that this body had been where it was found \u201cperhaps less time than has been indicated in some of the evidence I have read\u201d. His conclusion was that death occurred later than 7:45 p.m. on June 9.\nFrom the photographs and the rigor mortis alone I would be unable to say precisely when death occurred but that from this amount of rigor mortis I would be inclined to put it on the light side of two days. The light side or the short side of two days, rather than forty-eight hours. He noted the absence of bloating and venous patterning and skin slippage. He would expect to see this sort of thing in a body dead forty-eight hours in the temperatures which were given in evidence.\nThen, by way of summary:\nQ. Then, Doctor, I now, having taken you over Dr. Penistan\u2019s evidence with respect to the stomach contents and his evidence with respect to the existence of rigor, his evidence with respect to the beginnings of putrefaction and having referred you to the photographs of the\u2014Taking the total picture into consideration, the amount of fluid, the evidence of post-mortem changes as described and shown in the pictures, can you come to any opinion as to the time of death?\nA. Well, the best opinion I can come to on the time of death is this: It is my opinion that the body has been dead in the neighbourhood of thirty, thirty-six hours, possibly forty hours and I am taking my time now from the autopsy time, not from the time of sighting of the body; but I cannot narrow the limits to less, perhaps, than twelve hours. I clearly have the impression from examination of these photographs, and with particular reference to those things that I have pointed out already to this Court, that the body has been dead not an inconsiderable time short of forty-eight hours; but, I cannot pinpoint that in time, less perhaps. A range perhaps of less perhaps than eight or ten or twelve hours.\nQ. In your opinion is it possible for anyone, on the basis of the facts that have been disclosed with relation to the stomach contents, post-mortem changes, to place that period of death within the narrow limits of 7:00 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. on June the 9th?\nA. Of course not. Not unless we know precisely what happened between the time that the child was last seen and the time when death occurred; and, of course, if we knew that we would know the time of death.\nThe time of the autopsy was approximately 48 hours after the girl was last seen.\nHe next went on to deal with the place of death. Dr. Penistan\u2019s report as to what he found when he arrived at the scene was put to him in detail. First, he did not think that the puncture wounds had been caused by twigs. He referred to the puncture wound under the left shoulder, a scratch mark on the front of the left thigh extending over the left kneecap and down to the top of the left foot, and small \u201cinterruptions\u201d of the skin\u2019s surface on the buttock. He thought the scratch marks on the leg indicated a dragging of the body in a limp condition. He disagreed with any theory of the causation of the marks by twigs. He thought the twigs would be pressed down and would not penetrate. He demonstrated by the use of fountain pens scattered on the desk before him. He would have expected some spots of semen, acid phosphates to be present at the crotch or very close to it or on the leaves or twigs or whatever was immediately beneath that point of the body.\nAs to the presence of vegetable matter in the bronchi, he thought it was in a microscopic amount. He called it a remarkable finding in view of the presence of the ligature about the neck. All the other experts thought it was a normal incident of death by strangulation.\nQ. What inference did you draw or what is your conclusion from the presence of vegetable matter in the bronchi?\nA. I call this a very remarkable finding in view of the presence of a ligature about the neck. The blouse or the ligature about the neck would certainly compress the neck organs and would certainly tend to cause the esophagus, or the tube leading from the mouth down to the stomach, to be collapsed; and I would find it difficult to explain how this food material, this vegetable material found its way into the lung passages that have not a route to go out of the stomach, through the esophagus, to be aspirated and drawn into the air tubes themselves. I think it is quite remarkable in view of the ligature or restricting band about the neck.\nQ. What would that indicate to you about the time the vegetable matter got into the bronchi?\nA. Inhalation of apparently vomited stomach contents is not an unusual thing during death. I would, therefore, believe this occured during the act of dying, possibly slightly before, during the act of attack, whatever that may have been; and, therefore, I believe this related to the death, if that is an answer to your question, sir.\nQ. Are you able to form any opinion as to whether aspiration of the vegetable matter into the bronchi occurred before or after the application of the ligature?\nA. As I have already indicated, I think that this occurred before the application of the ligature.\nHe next examined the photographic exhibits at some length leading up to the conclusion that the body was on its left side shortly after death. It is expressed in the following extract:\nQ. What in your opinion caused that?\nA. I believe this body laid on its left side for a period of time after death and was moved at a later time.\nQ. And why do you reach that conclusion?\nA. Because of the pattern of the wrinkles present and the depression on the outer aspect of the left upper arm and the blanch or relatively white areas involved in the left breast and probably also the left side of the face. I believe this is the pattern of a post\u2011mortem lividity which develops shortly after death when the body was on that side so that the blood drained down into that side, that the hypostasis became, as forensic pathologists put it, fixed or partially fixed so that when the body was again placed on its back that the markings of its previous position were left and did not vanish because all of the blood had been drained out of that area into what was now the bottom and down side of the body. So, in this photograph, if taken in conjunction with the other photograph which we have seen, it is my opinion that the body was first on its left side and then was turned at a later time and put on its back in the position in which it was found.\nQ. And what would cause\u2014You say, for instance, on the left breast there is an area that is whiter?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What would create the whitening or lighter colour?\nA. This is where the breast itself was pressing against whatever the body was lying on and prevented the blood from flowing into that area.\nQ. How soon after death would the body have to lie in that position to develop this pattern?\nA. This is not subjected as rigor mortis and stomach contents to any specific or definitive answers. The blood begins to settle in the body immediately following death. The point really is at what point was the body moved after death. If the body remained on its left side for a period of time after death until some of the blood was fixed, that is, there was some clotting, perhaps, of the small blood vessels, possibly some passage of red blood cells out into the surrounding tissue, then the point at which this occurred to a significant degree, but the main majority of the blood was still fluid so that when the body was shifted again now onto its back the ordinary hypostasis pattern developed. I could not say precisely, but I would say possibly the inner limit of an hour, an hour and a half, the inner limit of several hours. I do not know, four, six hours, somewhere within this period of time.\nQ. How long would the body have to lie in that position?\nA. I would say the body would probably have to lie there for a period of certainly an hour or two, in this region.\nAs to the lesions on the penis, he said that he had never seen lesions on either side of the shaft of the penis allegedly as a result of intercourse of any type. Nor did he know of any reference to this possibility in the literature. He thought it highly improbable that these lesions would be caused by intercourse.\nDr. Frederick Albert Jaffe is presently lecturing in Pathology at the University of Toronto and is an Assistant Pathologist, Toronto Western Hospital. He has been a Regional Pathologist for the Province of Ontario since 1951. He is soon to assume the duty of Medical Director of the Forensic Section in succession to Dr. Noble Sharpe.\nHe considered that the stomach contents and the state to which digestion has proceeded after the last known meal a most unreliable guide as to the time of death. He had read the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to the stomach contents; also that of Dr. Brooks, and heard the evidence of Dr. Sharpe and Mr. Funk. On the assumption that the girl started her dinner at 5.30 p.m. and finished at 5.45 p.m., he would not place the time of death within the period 7.00 to 7.45 o\u2019clock with any reasonable degree of certainty.\nHis opinion of the time of death, as indicated by the post-mortem changes, is contained in the following extract:\nQ. Now, dealing\u2014passing from the stomach contents to the post-mortem changes which were observed, again assuming you heard read the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to the post-mortem changes he observed, that is, the very slight rigor that was present, the infestation of the body by maggots, and assuming the correctness of all Dr. Penistan\u2019s observations and also his statement that autolysis was present but the body had not yet begun to putrefy or had not reached a stage of putrefaction, do those facts enable you to form an opinion as to when death occurred?\nA. Only within very wide limits. I believe on the basis of Dr. Penistan\u2019s description and the photographs which I was able to see, that death has occurred no less than twenty-four hours before the discovery of the body.\nQ. Could you go any farther than that?\nA. To me the really outstanding feature of the body, both basing my view upon the autopsy protocol and Dr. Petty\u2019s description of the photographs, is the absence of those changes of decomposition which one would expect to find in a body which had allegedly lain two days in an environment which was certainly very hot and humid. This to me is one of the outstanding characteristics of this body. I would place the time perhaps half way between twenty-four and forty-eight hours.\nHe agreed with Dr. Petty as to the cause of the blanching.\nDr. Francis Edward Camps is a lecturer in Forensic Medicine at the London Hospital Medical College, Royal Free Hospital Medical College and the Middlesex Hospital Medical School and a professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of London.\nHis opinion of the significance of the contents of the stomach is contained in the following extracts:\nQ. First of all, Dr. Camps, what is your opinion as to whether the contents of the stomach and the state to which digestion has proceeded in relation to the last known meal consumed by the deceased, is a reliable guide to the time of death?\nA. It is so variable that this generally has been described as being of no value in assessing the time of death within a limited period. That is to say, what you can say is, first of all, that the contents indicate the nature of the last meal that the person has had. In other words, it enables you to say they have had nothing else to eat since the last meal. And, secondly, that death has occurred within a number of hours. It is possible, by taking other matters into consideration, to place perhaps within that number of hours a distance in one or other direction; but other than that, it is quite impossible.\n* * *\nQ. Assuming the correctness of the observations of Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks and Dr. Sharpe and Mr. Funk, what is your opinion as to whether on this\u2014on that basis you could, with any reasonable degree of certainty, state that the time of death of the deceased was between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:45 p.m., having regard the fact that she finished her last known meal at 5:45?\nA. I would say it is quite impossible and, in fact, I would say it could be dangerously misleading to the investigating officers.\nAs to rigor mortis, he disagrees with Dr. Penistan\u2019s finding in the following extract:\nQ. Does the evidence with respect to the existence of rigor mortis and its extent enable you to express any opinion with respect to the time when death occurred?\nA. No. I think, once again, there is so much variation in rigor mortis that, at the best of times, you cannot express an answer except within a reasonably broad limit. In this particular case I think it was a pity that the examination for rigor mortis was not done at 1:45 but waited until 7:15. But, on the basis of the appearance of the body, of the fact that the appearance is, to some extent, and I can say no more than that, present again only at the scene of the crime but also on the autopsy table, I think one must assume that rigor mortis was pretty established still, certainly a little earlier in the evening.\nOn this point he is in direct conflict with Doctors Penistan, Simpson, Helpern and Gerber. As to post-mortem changes, his opinion is expressed in the following extract:\nQ. You have also heard the evidence read of Dr. Penistan with respect to the other post mortem changes\u2014that is, the presence of autolysis, the infestation of certain parts of the body by maggots, and assuming again the correctness of those observations, does that enable you to determine the time of death?\nA. No. I would like to make it quite clear, if I may, I am in no way criticizing Dr. Penistan\u2019s observations. The only thing here is, first of all, that the autolysis I find supremely surprising for forty-eight hours, to be so little in the temperature and under these conditions.\nIn the temperatures established during the 48-hour period, he would have expected to find more post-mortem changes than were found on this body. The implication of this is contained in the following extract:\nQ. Does he not refer to autolysis in paragraph 4?\nA. Yes, that is right. Yes, I would repeat what I said, that the temperature, even putting it at its lowest, for forty-eight hours I would expect to find more post mortem changes than were found in this body. The implication of that, had I been there, would have been, having found the stomach contents in the condition which could be to indicate death at the end of one hour or up to nine or ten hours, would make me put my time of the death closer to the ten than to the one. That is the only observation I can make. I find, also, it is very remarkable from this point of view that there is no green discolouration of the abdomen on the right side, which we normally reckon to appear somewhere about forty-eight hours. So that would also tend to put it back.\nHe explained the blanching in the same way as Dr. Petty, i.e., that the body had lain on its side. He thought an hour might be reasonable. It might have been much less than that.\nHe expressed some doubt whether the puncture marks described by Dr. Penistan would have been caused by twigs. He thought they would more likely cause scratch marks, not a straight hole. He thought that some sort of sharp thing that might have caused the scratch mark down the leg might have caused the puncture marks.\nBecause of the absence of acid phosphatase, he expressed the opinion that where the body was found was not the place where the rape occurred. He thought that if it had occurred here, there would have been more injury on the back.\nAs to the injury to Truscott\u2019s penis, he did not think it was the kind of injury that could occur from sexual intercourse. The commonest injury is a tear of the prepuce. \u201cHowever, so little interest is paid in textbooks to this type of injury that in many textbooks it is barely mentioned.\u201d\nAnother body of medical evidence had to do with dermatology.\nDr. Emilian Marcinkovsky is a physician at the Ontario Reformatory at Guelph. On March 3, 1961, he treated Truscott for an infected burn of the right internal ear. He treated him with compresses and Chloromycetin. He found that Truscott was sensitive to this drug and he was kept in hospital. On June 28, 1961, there was further treatment.\nOn December 27, 1962, Truscott was suffering from dermatitis in the armpits. The doctor thought it was the result of chemicals, the detergent in the washing. He called it contact dermatitis. On May 15, 1962, he treated him for an inflamed cyst of the dorsum of the penis. On May 24, he marked the medical card \u201cCyst now not inflamed. Excision will be indicated if frequently inflamed.\u201d\nDr. Norman McKinnon Wrong. He graduated in 1927 from the University of Toronto and has been on the teaching staff since 1932. From 1954 to 1962 he was Associate Professor of Medicine in charge of Dermatology at the University of Toronto. His opinion on the cause of the lesions on the penis is:\nQ. What is your opinion as to whether the lesions\u2014the lesions as described, could be caused in that way?\nA. The lesions described, or what we call erosions of the skin, such erosions are seen in many dermatological conditions, not just following injury, superficial injury of the skin, and we see them with many diseases in which blisters appear on the skin, so that I would say these lesions are not diagnostic of any one specific thing, and I personally, if I had examined him, with the descriptions read, would not have been able to say definitely these could not have been caused by such alone.\nQ. Have you any opinion as to the likelihood of an injury such as that being able to be caused by intercourse or attempted intercourse?\nA. I would think it rather unlikely or extremely unlikely. I would not say impossible, but I would say extremely unlikely that a lesion on the side of the shaft of the penis would be caused by intercourse.\nQ. Are you familiar with any medical literature attributing lesions of that kind on the sides of the penis to trauma or injury involved in or received during forcible or violent intercourse?\nA. I have not gone over the medical literature exhaustively, but I have not found anything comparable to this in the standard textbooks.\nHe also was of the opinion that it was most unlikely that the abrasion on the right labia of the deceased about the size of a finger-nail, was caused by a penis. He thought that the condition of the penis described by Dr. Brooks and Dr. Addison indicated simple herpes.\nAs to the precise conditions observed by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks, he explained them as follows:\nA. I think simple herpes plus infection or plus irritation from sweating and the skin surfaces rubbing together. I don\u2019t think that simple herpes in itself usually produces erosion, but secondary infection could very well produce these erosions.\nHe had never seen any lesions on the shaft of the penis which had been attributable to forcible intercourse or trau- ma. He had seen injury about the meatus and around the frenum, but never traumatic lesions on the shaft of the penis as a result of intercourse.\nDr, Charles William Elliott Dauby is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Queen\u2019s University, and the Consultant in Dermatology for the three federal penitentiaries at Kingston, Collins Bay and Joyceville.\nHe treated Steven Truscott on January 30, 1964, for infected dermatitis of the left side of his face extending from the level of his eyelid down to below the mouth, with an oozing, scaling and crusty condition. His opinion was that this was secondarily infected dermatitis due to some agent that had irritated his skin. Truscott told him that it had been present for a year. The doctor saw him on five subsequent occasions, the last time being April 24. There was good improvement up to March 1st. Then, on April 15th, he had a patchy nummular type of eczema involving the back part of his shoulders, upper arms and his face and ears. On his last visit, April 24, he had improved.\nCounsel then put to him the description of Truscott\u2019s condition that was given by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks at the trial.\nQ. This was the view expressed by Dr. Addison, a brush burn of two or three days\u2019 duration, was his description. But that is part of the description. Assuming the size, the description of the raw sore, oozing, having the appearance of a brush burn of two or three days\u2019 duration; from that description would you be able to reach any conclusion as to the nature and cause of these injuries?\nA. I would think that in the area where these lesions have been described, if it were an injury that had occurred three days before, or two days before, there would have been haemorrhage or bleeding visible in and around these lesions. Now, one must remember that in this area the skin is very thin. I would think a good comparison would be the thickness of the skin of your eyelid. If we remember that the skin is made up of two parts, the epidermis and dermis. For convenience, the epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, below which there are blood vessels ready to bleed and is not thicker than six one hundredths of a millimetre. It is tissue paper thin. I would think that if this had been due to injury there would have been haemorrhage.\nQ. Would you be able to give any information as to the extent or the degree of the bleeding or haemorrhaging that would occur from injury of that kind?\nA. I have in the past, and I still do occasionally, perform an operation called dermo\u2011abrasion of the skin in which we abrade the skin in order to improve the appearance of scars. Now, we do not have to abrade it very deeply to get copious bleeding. He went on to say that he did not think that these lesions could have happened by the penetration or attempted penetration of the organ into the private parts of a young girl. He had seen six or seven cases of a tearing of the praeputium. He was not aware of any medical literature on this subject.\nNext, he dealt with the injury to the labium majus. This was testified to by Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks. He thought it very unlikely, if not impossible, that this could occur from an attempted penetration.\nHe thought that the condition described by Dr. Brooks and Dr. Addison was herpes simplex (cold sores).\nThere was, in addition, evidence given by psychiatrists called by the Crown and the Defence. We do not consider that this evidence assists us in coming to our conclusion.\nConclusions\nAfter all the evidence given on the Reference, the issues are still the same as those which faced the jury\u2014who raped and killed this girl. The evidence both as to fact and opinion has to be considered as a whole. We begin with Truscott\u2019s oral evidence on the Reference. It differs from the evidence given by all those witnesses who saw him on the road before 7 p.m. and described his movements. These movements give an impression of aimless loitering of no particular significance to him. This may account for his failure to remember whom he had met and who had seen him. On the other hand, although as a boy of 14\u00bd years, he had heard all these witnesses give evidence at the trial. The evidence had some connection with that of Jocelyne Goddette and to the jury could have indicated that he was waiting for someone and that the person for whom he was waiting was Jocelyne Goddette, who by her subsequent actions indicated that she was looking for him and did not find him.\nThe evidence of the time of departure from the school grounds is of decisive importance in this case. According to Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Bohonus, it was not later than 7.15 p.m. and Truscott had appeared about 7 p.m. On the Reference Truscott for the first time gave his time of departure as within a minute of 7.30 p.m. By 7.30 Richard Gellatly and even Philip Burns on foot were back at home. But Truscott had told the police that he did remember meeting Gellatly. Gellatly remembered meeting Truscott and he was not cross-examined. One of the certainties in this case is that this meeting did happen. We find it impossible to accept Truscott\u2019s evidence given before us that he and the girl left at 7.30 p.m. and that they did not meet Gellatly.\nFurther, Jocelyne Goddette, according to Mr. Lawson\u2019s evidence, left Lawson\u2019s barn at 7.25 p.m. If Truscott\u2019s time is taken, she would have been on the road ahead of him. So would Arnold George, for she and George were on the road near the bush at approximately the same time. Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George could not have failed to see Truscott and the girl if they had left the school grounds at 7.30 p.m. The case for the prosecution, as put to the jury, was that Truscott and Lynne were ahead of Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George and were not seen after passing Gellatly.\nOur conclusion is that Truscott\u2019s evidence on the Reference does not and cannot disturb the finding implicit in the jury\u2019s verdict, that after passing Gellatly, Truscott and Lynne went into Lawson\u2019s bush.\nIt is also implicit in the jury\u2019s verdict that the girl died where she was found in Lawson\u2019s bush and that she was not picked up at the intersection and subsequently brought back dead or alive by someone other than Truscott. We do not think that this conclusion could be disturbed by anything to be found in the evidence given at the trial or on this Reference.\nWe have described the conditions found by Dr. Penistan when he went to the scene. Dr. Petty and Dr. Camps said that they would have expected to find spermatozoic fluid at the crotch or in the blood at the crotch or on the leaves and twigs in the immediate area of the crotch if intercourse had taken place where the body was found. Dr. Simpson said that he \u201cwould certainly not regard the absence of spermatozoic fluid on the ground between the crotch area as giving any evidence that sexual intercourse of some kind did not take place where the body lay\u201d. Dr. Penistan said that the intercourse took place \u201cwhile the child was dying, when the heart had stopped or had almost stopped beating\u201d. His reason for this conclusion was that although the injuries to the parts were severe, the bleeding from them was extremely small.\nDr. Petty developed a theory based upon an examination of the photographs that the body must have lain on its left side for an hour or two following death. We have quoted at length from his evidence and that of others on this subject. He found signs of blanching on the left side of the face, the left breast and the left arm from certain photographs taken after the body had been moved both at the scene and after transportation to the mortuary. These signs are not apparent from the photograph of the body lying on its back, taken at the scene before the body was turned on its side. Dr. Simpson, Dr. Helpern and Dr. Gerber all said that if the photographs did indicate some blanching, the simple explanation was to be found in the movement of the body at the scene and afterwards. The descriptions given by Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks of the condition of the body at the autopsy were inconsistent with the existence of any blanched areas on the face capable of demonstrating hypostasis. They were the only ones who saw the body. The others were testifying from their observation of photographs.\nDr. Penistan said that the face was dusky in colour as far down as the ligature and that this dusky colour was caused by strangulation and not by post mortem changes. This colouring was absent from the rest of the body except perhaps for the arm, where some post mortem lividity had occurred. He pointed out that this was a dependent part whereas the front of the face was not. The colour of the face was due to the fact that the blood could not escape past the ligature and not due to hypostasis, that is, a condition caused by settling of blood in the dependent parts of an organ.\nOur conclusion on the evidence relating to blanching is that whatever traces suggesting this condition were observable from the photographs are to be attributed to the movement of the body in the bush, movement to the mortuary and movement in the mortuary. This evidence does not disturb our conclusion that the place of death was where the body was found.\nOn the subject of rigor mortis, we think that the man who actually saw the condition had an overwhelming ad- vantage over those who were testifying from photographs. He says that the condition had almost passed off. Yet Dr. Petty testified to rigor mortis from what others described as the natural arching of the back and a natural position of the fingers which were being held by the assistant in order that a photograph could be taken. We are of the opinion that Dr. Penistan\u2019s evidence on rigor mortis must be accepted and that defence evidence on this subject tending to put the time of death at a later hour must be rejected.\nOn the question of the contents of the stomach and the state of digestion as indicating the time of death, there was diversity of opinion. Doctors Sharpe, Simpson, Helpern and Gerber supported Dr. Penistan\u2019s opinion that death occurred prior to 7.45 p.m. Dr. Petty, Dr. Jaffe and Dr. Camps rejected any possibility of such precise definition. We have already set out their opinions in detail earlier in these reasons. There is no need of repetition. We do, however, wish to explain that with each medical expert we chose the opinion which he expressed in his own words in examination-in-chief. We think it is better done this way because we could not see that on cross-examination any expert retracted or seriously modified what he said in chief.\nWe think that the evidence indicates that this was the same meal that the girl had finished eating at 5.45 p.m. We know the time of the meal. This was a normal healthy girl of 12 years and 9 months who had eaten a normal meal. There is no evidence of any complicating factor apart from an expression of annoyance because she could not go swimming.\nDr. Petty spoke of factors which might change the emptying rate of the stomach\u2014drugs (which seems to be out of the question in this case), loss into the duodenum, loss through the esophagus during the act of dying or after death occurred. We have the definite evidence of Dr. Penistan on loss into the duodenum. He says there was very little. It is difficult to think of loss through the esophagus when one considers how this girl died. There were microscopic particles of food in the bronchii, a common occurrence in death by strangulation.\nAgain we say that this opinion evidence must be related to all the other evidence. We have the known facts of the meal, the time when she finished, that she was in the school grounds engaged in normal activity after the meal and before she started down the road. We have the time when she started down the road and it was not later than 7.15 p.m., not 7.30 as Truscott said. She was found 42 hours later in a bush off the road at 1.45 p.m. on Thursday, June 11, 1959. The jury\u2019s verdict must have rejected Dr. Brown\u2019s time of three or four hours after the meal because it contained no possibility of accuracy in relation to this case if they came to the conclusion that Truscott did not take the girl to the intersection.\nWe are faced with the same problem. No new issues were raised before us but there was a great volume of new evidence. The weight of the new evidence supports Dr. Penistan\u2019s opinion. But the decisive point in this case is still the one put to the jury by the trial judge and decided against the accused.\nThe Court heard 467 pages of new oral evidence on this Reference. According to firmly established rules, none of this would have been admissible had these proceedings been by way of appeal. But in view of the terms of the Order of Reference the Court decided to hear everything and did hear everything that the parties thought relevant.\nAnother aspect of the medical evidence related to the condition of Truscott\u2019s penis. Truscott, in his evidence before us, introduced an explanation of the condition of his penis, as described by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks following their examination on Friday evening, June 12, 1959, three days after the girl\u2019s disappearance. They saw the condition and described it in detail. Their opinion was that it was consistent with forcible intercourse with a girl of the age of Lynne Harper. Truscott\u2019s father was present when this examination was made. Truscott and his counsel were present in court when the evidence of the two doctors was given. There is no indication in any of the evidence that was before the jury that these injuries were the result of a pre-existing condition. On the reference, Truscott said that there was a pre-existing condition which started about six weeks before he was picked up. This is his evidence:\nA. It was about six weeks before I was picked up. And it started off, what appeared to be little blisters, and continued to worsen from there until it was in the state it was when I was picked up. Q. What caused it to worsen? How did its appearance change?\nA. Well, one blister would break and it just seemed that more would appear.\nQ. Do you know what caused them to break?\nA. No, I don\u2019t.\nQ. Now, when you first noticed this condition that you described did you tell your father about it?\nA. No, I didn\u2019t.\nQ. Was there any reason why you didn\u2019t.\nA. I was too embarrassed.\nQ. Do you recall the first person to whom you described this condition when you first noticed it?\nA. Yes, I do.\nQ. Who was it?\nA. It was yourself and Mr. Jolliffe.\nQ. Myself and Mr. Jolliffe. And where did you describe that to us?\nA. Collin\u2019s Bay penitentiary.\nWe find it impossible to accept Truscott\u2019s statement that he had never described the condition of his penis, as it existed prior to June 9, 1959, to anyone before he described it at the penitentiary to his counsel on the Reference. It may be that, on his first discovering the condition he was too embarrassed to tell his father about it. But when the condition existing on June 12 was discovered by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks on their medical examination of him, in the presence of his father, and when those two doctors described the condition which they found at the trial, and drew inferences from it, it is incredible that no disclosure was made by him to his father and to his then counsel as to the condition which he says had existed for six weeks before he was picked up.\nIf the condition which Truscott described did exist for some time prior to June 9, we have the evidence of Dr. Simpson that the patches could have been rubbed, causing them to be more sore, and that this is consistent with a sexual assault. Dr. Danby and Dr. Wrong, the two expert dermatologists called by the defence on the Reference, who testified on this matter, both recognized the possible impact of irritation in activating the condition described by Truscott.\nOur conclusion is that there was a pre-existing condition and that it was disclosed by him prior to his trial, although no evidence about it was given before the jury. The serious condition found and described by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks was consistent with the aggravation of a pre-existing condition resulting from a sexual assault upon Lynne Harper.\nWhen the case went to the jury, they had before them the evidence given at the trial which we have summarized above. It was all circumstantial. Their verdict read in the light of the charge of the trial judge makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that he was the guilty person. On a review of all the evidence given at the trial we are of opinion that, on the record as it then stood, the verdict could not be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. Indeed, it being implicit in their verdict that the jury completely rejected the evidence of those witnesses who said that they had seen Truscott pass over the bridge with Lynne Harper, and Truscott\u2019s statements as to having seen Lynne Harper enter a motor car, we are of opinion that the verdict was in accordance with the evidence.\nWe are also of opinion that the judgment at trial could not have been set aside on the ground of any wrong decision on a question of law or on the ground that there was a miscarriage of justice. It follows that, in our opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] dismissing the appeal made to it was right.\nOn this Reference we heard the additional evidence summarized above. It disclosed differences of opinion amongst the expert medical witnesses who testified. As has already been pointed out, none of this fresh evidence would have been allowed if the case had come before us on an appeal in the ordinary way under s. 597A of the Criminal Code. Because of the terms of the Order-in-Council referring the matter to us, we decided to receive this evidence and it becomes our duty to weigh it with a view to determining whether it causes us to doubt the correctness of the judgment at the trial. We have come to the conclusion that it does not. There were many incredibilities inherent in the evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony. The effect of the sum total of the testimony of the expert witnesses is, in our opinion, to add strength to the opinion expressed by Dr. Penistan at the trial that the murdered girl was dead by 7.45 p.m. We have dealt above with the evidence which we heard as to what observation of a car at the junction of Highway No. 8 and the county road could be made from the bridge 1,300 feet to the south.\nWe have already stated our conclusion that the verdict of the jury reached on the record at the trial ought not to be disturbed. The effect of the fresh evidence which we heard on the Reference, considered in its entirety, is to strengthen that view.\nWe turn now to certain legal objections taken by counsel for the defence on the Reference. He argued that the learned trial judge should have declared a mistrial because Crown counsel, in his opening address to the jury on September 16, said in part:\nI might say then that in sequence that on Friday night\u2014I should say the Friday a statement was taken from the accused by Inspector Graham and the other Police, one of the other Policemen, signed that night by him\u2026\nAt this point he was stopped by the trial judge.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario rejected this submission on the ground that in his opening address read as a whole Crown counsel had made it clear to the jury that the statements made by Truscott to the police which he intended to introduce were not in the nature of \u201cconfessions at all or anything like that\u201d.\nIn our opinion there is another ground on which the submission should be rejected. In the discussion had in the absence of the jury after the learned trial judge had stopped Crown counsel from making any further reference to the statement he made it plain that if the statement, when tendered, was ruled inadmissible he would be prepared to declare a mistrial. On the afternoon of September 18, the statement was ruled inadmissible but counsel for the accused did not then or at any subsequent point in the trial ask that a mistrial be declared. We think it clear that defence counsel elected to proceed with the trial and that the verdict cannot be impugned on this ground. Defence counsel also submitted that the trial judge erred in permitting Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George to be sworn. The determination of this question depends on the interpretation to be placed on s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act which was considered in this Court by Anglin C.J.C., in Sankey v. The King[3], where he said:\nNow it is quite as much the duty of the presiding judge to ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child offered as a witness does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it is to satisfy himself of the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of the duty of speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the statute to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term \u201cchild of tender years\u201d is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it be safely predicted, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the nature of an oath. Such a child may be convicted of crime. Crim. Code, section 17-18. A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on this point. But some inquiry would seem to be indispensable.\nWe are of opinion that the learned trial judge properly exercised the discretion entrusted to him and that there were reasonable grounds for his concluding that both Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George understood the moral obligation of telling the truth.\nThe reasons of our brother Hall indicate that he would have ordered a new trial on a number of grounds. Since we feel obliged to differ from the opinion he has expressed, we think it necessary to state our view on each of the grounds dealt with in his reasons.\n1. Truscott\u2019s admonition to Jocelyne Goddette to keep the appointment secret.\nThe judge\u2019s ruling on this point was favourable to Truscott. He limited the effect which the jury could give to Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s evidence on the appointment to an explanation of why she was on the road looking for Truscott.\nWe think the evidence had a wider relevancy. According to many witnesses, Truscott was moving about the road between 6.30 and 7 p.m. The suggested inference from this is that he was looking for Jocelyne Goddette. Then he turned up at the school grounds at 7 p.m. and talked to Lynne Harper. His explanation of the conversation was that she was looking for a ride to the intersection.\nIt is said that this was uncontradicted. It could not be otherwise with an unheard conversation between two persons, one of whom was dead at the time of the trial.\nThe conversation between Truscott and the girl is open to another interpretation. It took place only a few minutes after Truscott had been on the road looking for Jocelyne Goddette according to the Crown\u2019s submission. It was open to the Crown to put it to the jury that he was taking Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette failed to appear, and taking her on the same errand.\nThe admonition to Jocelyne Goddette to keep the matter secret is no more a reflection on Truscott\u2019s character than the invitation itself. It is part and parcel of the same conversation and one part cannot be separated from the other. The jury was entitled to know what the whole conversation was and the witness when testifying to such a conversation should not be compelled to stop at a certain point. This was early in the trial. The girl\u2019s credibility was involved. No one knew at this stage whether Truscott would give evidence at the trial. If she had only been permitted to tell one part of the conversation, it is impossible to tell how counsel for the defence would have used that.\nWe do not think that any of this conversation between Truscott and Jocelyne Goddette was any reflection on Truscott\u2019s character. To put it at its worst for Truscott, it means no more than this: that he had a tentative date arranged with Jocelyne Goddette. He wanted a date with a girl that night and he took Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette was not available. We have already mentioned that this has some bearing on the submission of the prosecution that his story of the ride, the sole purpose of which was to take her to the intersection, may not have been true. It does not amount to trying to prove bad character or a disposition to murder and rape.\nCounsel at the trial was satisfied with this instruction given by the trial judge. He had no reason to object and there is no ground for saying that on this point there should be a new trial. Counsel on the reference did not take this objection.\nMaxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[4] is no authority for the rejection of the evidence in question here. In that case, a person was charged with manslaughter as a result of the performance of an abortion. He gave evidence of his good character. He was cross\u2011examined about a previous trial for manslaughter involving another alleged abortion. He had been acquitted at that trial. The cross-examination was held to be bad on two grounds\u2014as not being relevant to the issue before the jury and because it did not tend to impair the credibility of the accused as a witness.\n2. The bicycle tracks.\nThis has to do with the bicycle tire marks which were found in the field north of Lawson\u2019s bush. Corporal Erskine gave evidence about these tire marks which he had photographed. Defence counsel did object to the admissibility of the evidence from the photographs. The tire marks were similar to the marks that would be made by Truscott\u2019s bicycle.\nDefence counsel emphasized that these tire marks were of little or no significance in the case. He dealt with the matter in the following extract:\nThen there was evidence about marks along the roadway at the north side of the bush, and Exhibits twelve, thirteen and fourteen were taken by Corporal Erskine and filed here. These exhibits showed the dried mud along the north edge of the bush in this little laneway or driveway. Now, these were taken, according to the note on the back, on the 13th of June. We heard the evidence of the Sergeant from the R.C.A.F. Station as to the rainfall. In June there had been a trace of rain on the 1st. No rain from then until either the 10th or the 11th, when it was .24 or .27 inches, about a quarter of an inch .24, I think he said. He said if it was .25, it would be a quarter. However, it makes no difference because it was after the 9th of June, which is the important date. But we had no rain in June prior to the 9th, except a trace, and you heard Sergeant Calvert say a few drops or a little sprinkle you would walk out in without putting a coat on.\nNow I suggest to you that it is quite clear from all these pictures that these tracks were made when the mud was soft. You can see where the mud squeezed up between the little irregularities in the tire. It must have been soft to make that mark. It couldn\u2019t possibly happen if this dirt was in the hard-packed condition that we find it in these conditions. That dirt must have been baked hard long before the 9th of June. We have the temperatures in the eighties, high temperatures, hot weather. My friend may say to you that May was a rainy month. You heard Sergeant Calvert go over the rainfall for the last sixteen days of May, and 25 or 2, so and so of rain. Very light rain. The total rain in sixteen days, something over three inches. Many of you men are farmers. You know the effect of these pictures much better than I do. You can use your own good judgment as to how long it took for that land to become parched like that, how many days before the pictures were taken the last rainfall had occurred and these tracks made there.\nImmediately afterwards he pointed out that the evidence showed that Truscott had been along the tractor trail at least three times, the last one of which was about a week before the 9th of June. He and his friend were building a tree fort in the bush. Crown counsel dealt with that in the following way:\nThe bicycle marks, Gentlemen, I am not going to linger over. Corporal Erskine\u2019s evidence that he found tire marks, combinations of the two wheels, but they are in as Exhibits. You will have them with you. That he made comparison and that he found those marks in the laneway and you will remember the distance down. I, frankly, don\u2019t. That they compare. That they are a combination. Now, it is true there could be similar tires, certainly, but where you get radically different tires\u2014you look at them and you will find them in combination, it would seem to be fairly strong evidence that that bicycle was down there.\nBut gentlemen, as I said about a circumstantial evidence case, that is the beauty\u2014there is nothing beautiful about this at all\u2014but that is one of the strong facts about it. You have a pile of facts and if there is one or two that are not conclusive you still, you still have the conclusive proof of the facts that are there.\nA defence witness was called to say that Steven and he had a tree house or fort or something, and that Steven was in with his bicycle. I wouldn\u2019t waste your time by arguing that isn\u2019t a possibility, but I just put this forward for what it may seem to be worth for you, that that is more evidence that Steven was down that lane with that bicycle. By no means conclusive it was that night he was down. The Defence went to great efforts to counteract those marks.\nThat soil\u2014or that weather expert, Calvert, Sergeant Calvert, about the dryness. Now we all know this about farms, if you get an area near a bush and there are lots of trees in that lane, and that area will stay a longer time damp. Other things might be quite dry, adjacent portions, even if you don\u2019t get any rain. There was plenty of rain in May and none in June, but there could be dampness, I suggest to you what is elementary, enough to make those marks, but that is only one of the great stack of facts that are amassing for your assistance.\nThe trial judge dealt with them as follows:\nNothing belonging to the accused boy was found in the locality, in the neighbourhood of the body, as you will recall. There was a tire mark in the field about seventeen feet north of the fence that ran along this lane, and Constable Erskine, who testified, said that the marks of the tire were similar, I think that is as high as he put it, were similar to the tires that were put in evidence of the bicycle belonging to the accused boy, and you are asked to find that those marks were made by this bicycle. That is what the Crown asks you to find. The bicycle is not a common one.\nIf the trial judge\u2019s remarks are taken in conjunction with the address of Crown counsel and the defence, there could be no doubt here that the issues were squarely before the jury, and defence counsel did not see fit to object to the charge on this point.\nWe cannot agree that it was conclusively shown that the tire marks must have been made many days preceding June 9th, nor that the learned trial judge should have directed the jury in the light of the evidence of the meteorologist Calvert to exclude from their consideration the evidence relating to the tire marks. It was for the jury to weigh the evidence of the tire marks in the light of the evidence given as to the weather conditions. We do not think that anyone took this evidence as a salient feature of the case. The salient feature of the case is Truscott\u2019s disappearance from the road after the meeting with Gellatly.\n3. The locket\nThis was worn by Lynne Harper on the evening of June 9th. It was not found on her body but hanging on the wire fence that ran along the west side of Lawson\u2019s bush. The inference is open that whoever murdered Lynne Harper removed the locket from her neck. To do so he had to unclasp it. It was found unclasped and suspended on the wire fence. Truscott had described the locket in some detail. The evidence was properly admissible and the question was one of weight for the jury.\nThe matter of the locket and its significance to the jury was raised in the address to the jury of counsel for the defence. His suggestion to the jury was that the place where the locket was found was the place where the girl was taken into the bush either alive or dead. This suggestion is contained in the following extract from his address:\nNow the evidence would indicate that if Lynne Harper were dragged in there, through that wire fence, that she was dragged in at a point on the County Road about three hundred feet south of the north edge of the bush. And the reason for saying that is this, that that is the point where Corporal Sayeau says the locket was found.\nNow, we have this locket. Do you remember a locket was put in as an Exhibit? A locket and chain, and that the chain was delivered to Mrs. Archibald by Sandra. You remember the little girl, Sandra Archibald. When Sandra gave the locket to her mother, the mother said the chain was open, and Sandra told you how she found the locket and chain suspended partly over one wire. Part of it may have been on the ground and part of it was suspended over the wire on the fence, with the chain on the outside and the locket on the inside, or vice versa. Probably you will remember that better than I do. But that appears to be where\u2014the point where this girl was brought, or her body entered that area. Now, I suggest if Truscott took Miss Harper in at that point, somebody would have seen it. The fence there was in much better condition than the fence on the north side. It is most unlikely that he would drag the bicycle in. If he had dragged it in there would be, in all likelihood, some mark on the bicycle.\nThe Crown was entitled to answer this proposition and we do not regard that answer as theorizing \u201cwithout one iota of evidence\u201d, \u201cinflammatory\u201d or a \u201cfanciful theory\u201d.\n4. Car bearing Licence No. 981-666\nWhen Truscott was asked by the police what he had seen on the road when he took Lynne Harper to the intersection as he said, he mentioned Richard Gellatly and he also said that he had seen on the road an old model Dodge or Plymouth car bearing licence No. 981-666 but that the first three digits may have been in a different order. He also said that there was a man and a woman in this car. There was such a car with licence No. 891-666 belonging to a Mr. Pigun, who was then stationed at Clinton. A number of people, including Mr. Pigun, who owned cars with licences bearing some resemblance to the number given, were called to testify and all said that they were not on the county road on the evening of June 9th. Hall J. is of opinion that the Crown was not entitled to call these witnesses because this was a collateral matter and Truscott could not be contradicted on it.\nIn our view, this was not a collateral matter. It was strictly relevant to the fact in issue\u2014whether Truscott was on the road when he said he was. In effect, he said that from leaving the school grounds with Lynne Harper and until his return, that he was never off the road and that he saw a car bearing a certain licence number. The owners of all these possible cars say that they were not on the road.\nThe inference that the jury was asked to draw in part from this evidence and from all the other evidence is that Truscott did not see and could not have seen the car that he described; that if he had actually been on the road all the time he would not have made such a statement because he would have known better and that, in consequence, he was not where he said he was at the material time. Facts relevant to this issue are not collateral facts.\n5. The Judges\u2019 Instruction\nIt will be for you to say whether you accept Doctor Penistan\u2019s theory, an Attorney-General\u2019s Pathologist of many years\u2019 standing, or do you accept Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence.\nThe criticism made is that the extract above quoted was a misdirection and that the jury should have been told that as between Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brown, if the evidence of Dr. Brown left a reasonable doubt in their minds as to the time of death, they must acquit. We disagree with this proposition. The choice was not simply between Dr. Brown and Dr. Penistan. That evidence had to be considered in relation to the whole of the evidence, and a reading of the trial judge\u2019s instructions in full to the jury makes it plain that that is what they were told to do.\nThese are the instructions that he gave to the jury, in summary, at the very end of his charge:\nNow, Gentlemen, in order to arrive at a verdict in this case\u2014before I mention that, I wish to say to you this. You will have to ask yourselves, about each branch of the evidence. Is it consistent with the boy\u2019s guilt? And is it inconsistent with any other rational conclusion? But you just can\u2019t separate one piece of evidence from the other from the rest of the evidence. You will have to ask yourselves on the whole evidence which you accept, on the whole evidence that you accept, is this evidence susceptible of any other conclusion than that this boy is the killer of Lynne Harper? But if you think any other rational conclusion possible on this evidence, you will acquit him, and if the evidence raises a doubt in your mind, you will acquit him. When I say raises a doubt in your mind, I mean a reasonable doubt. Not a foolish doubt or a doubt because you are hesitant about doing your duty, and I am sure I need not say to a Jury of the County of Huron that I know you will accept your responsibilities in this matter, come what may, and that you will bring in a verdict according to your conscience. It must not be a doubt that is raised by fear, prejudice or caprice, but an honest doubt of a Juryman endeavouring to do his duty.\nIn order to bring in a verdict you must all agree upon it. If you do not agree you cannot bring in a verdict\u2014you disagree. There is no obligation on any of you to agree. If, after you have discussed it fully, and considered it dispassionately among yourselves, you should disagree with your fellows, it is your duty to express your disagreement. Do not forget what I said about the onus of proof. The onus of proof is entirely on the Crown. It never shifts. There is no obligation whatever or any duty on the prisoner to prove his innocence. It is for the Crown to prove his guilt and the Crown must prove that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You must feel sure about it.\nNow, Gentlemen, as I see this case you may bring in a verdict of course, of not guilty. The jury is always able to do that if the Crown has not proved its case or you have even a reasonable doubt about it. You may bring in a verdict of not guilty or you may bring in a verdict of guilty as charged. There is no other verdict open to you in this case on this evidence.\n6. Dr. Brooks should not have been permitted to give his opinion that the sores on Truscott\u2019s penis and the condition of the body at the scene indicated a very inexpert attempt at penetration.\nDr. Brooks graduated in medicine in England in 1943. He was registered to practise in England in 1946. He is a member of the College of General Practitioners in Canada. He was the Senior Medical Officer at the R.C.A.F. Station at Clinton, Ontario.\nHe saw these penial lesions. He had an opinion as to their cause. He thought they were about three days old. He also had an opinion about the injuries to the girl which he had seen in the bush and in the mortuary.\nWe are of the view that a general practitioner with this experience is entitled to give his opinion to the jury as to the cause of the conditions that he found, whether it is a physical cause or any other cause. This kind of evidence is not limited to specialists. Regina v. Kuzmack[5] does not state any such rule.\nIn Regina v. Kuzmack, the accused was convicted of murder. It was alleged that he had stabbed a woman and severed her jugular vein. His defence was that the death was an accident. He said that the woman attacked him with a butcher knife and that she was killed accidentally when he was trying to take the knife away from her. The woman also had cuts on the fingers of the right hand. The doctor who testified as to the cause of death also said that when the right hand was put up to the neck, the wounds on the fingers were in the same direction as the wound on the neck. His conclusion was that the hand was on the neck when the knife was put into the neck. His conclusion was rejected by the Appellate Division as \u201ca mere guess which anyone might have made\u201d. Whether or not this was a correct ruling in the particular case is of no concern now. But the ruling is not authority for rejecting the opinion of a general practitioner as to the cause of lesions which he had personally observed and described.\n7. Admissibility of the underpants as evidence.\nThese were the garments that Truscott was wearing at the time of his arrest and were taken from him then. They were very dirty and showed traces of blood and male sperm. It was open to the jury to infer that these were the underpants that Truscott was wearing on June 9 and to decide whether the traces of blood and male sperm had any significance in the case. The trial judge cannot withdraw consideration of such evidence from the jury.\n8. Extracts from the instructions given to the jury in relation to the evidence of Philip Burns.\nIt is said that the trial judge gave contradictory instructions regarding the evidence of Philip Burns, and the following extracts are cited in support of this conclusion:\nNow the first is that Philip Burns was, of course, not sworn, and he said he didn\u2019t see Lynne and Steve on the road as he went north, and no one corroborates him in that respect, so that his evidence is worthless so far as you can use it in convicting the accused boy.\n* * *\nThen you, of course, won\u2019t forget Philip Burns\u2019 evidence that he left the river around between seven to seven-ten or thereabouts, seven-fifteen, and walked up the road and saw nothing of Steve and Lynne as he went up the road. That evidence was given, as I told you before, without Philip Burns being sworn.\nWe do not interpret the first extract, when read in context, as being a direction to the jury that Burns\u2019 evidence was worthless. The jury had been recalled as a result of objections raised by counsel to the charge, and in the first sentence of that extract the trial judge is only stating what that objection was, and not his own ruling upon it. This is made clear by the next three following sentences:\nBut you could hardly corroborate a statement that I didn\u2019t see somebody. You may corroborate that he wasn\u2019t on the road, and I expect that is what Philip meant, that Steve and Lynne weren\u2019t on the road as he passed along it. Now, of course, he met Jocelyne and he met Arnold George as he went along that road, and they were sworn, and they said that they didn\u2019t see Lynne or Steve on that highway, so in that respect their evidence is capable of corroborating Philip\u2019s.\nIn our opinion this instruction was correct.\n9. Direction regarding the evidence of Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan.\nThe learned trial judge dealt with the effect of the evidence of these two boys in the following passage from his charge:\nNow then, it is the theory of the Defence, and they brought evidence to show that, as I say, this little Douglas Oats saw them going across the bridge and then, in a few minutes, according to the boy by the name of Gordon Logan\u2014Gordon Logan also says he saw them going north on the bridge and in about five minutes he says he saw Steven return alone. Well, as regards Gordon Logan, it will be for you Gentlemen to say whether you believe his evidence, and it is very important, Gentlemen, because if you believe the Defence theory of this matter and believe Steven\u2019s statement to the Police and to other people, that the girl was driven to Number Eight Highway and entered an automobile which went east; it is my view that you must acquit the boy if you believe that story.\nIn other words, I will put it this way. In order to convict this boy, you have to completely reject that story as having no truth in it, as not being true. You have to completely reject that story.\nIn our opinion this was a clear-cut, positive direction to the jury as to the impact of the evidence of Oats and Logan, if accepted by the jury, and there is a positive direction to acquit if Truscott\u2019s story, supported as it was by that evidence, were believed. The jury is not directed that they could only acquit if they believed that story, but that, if they believed it, they must acquit. The continuing onus upon the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the absence of any obligation upon the accused to prove his innocence was clearly stated on more than one occasion, as shown in the extract from the charge previously quoted.\nWhat this particular passage does, and quite properly does, is to make clear to the jury the vital importance of the evidence of Oats and Logan, and to stress that they could not convict Truscott unless his account of what happened was completely rejected as having no truth in it. 10. Reference as to the possibility of Truscott having returned with Lynne Harper from No. 8 Highway.\nIn charging the jury the trial judge had two undisputed facts from which to start. First, that Truscott had ridden Lynne Harper on his bicycle north on the county road toward No. 8 Highway. Second, that her raped and dead body was found in Lawson\u2019s bush, and that, in consequence of that, someone had brought her there, alive or dead. The Crown\u2019s case was that Truscott had taken her there, and that he had never taken her to No. 8 Highway. The case for the defence was that Truscott had left her at that highway, and had returned alone, she having been picked up in a car at the highway, and that some unknown person had brought her back to Lawson\u2019s bush. The trial judge apparently felt obligated to discuss all possibilities and suggested the possibility of her having been brought back from No. 8 Highway by Truscott.\nIn our opinion this was unnecessary, but when he finally dealt with the matter, in answer to a request by the jury for further direction of evidence, corroborated or otherwise, of Lynne Harper and Steven Truscott having been seen together on the bridge on the night of June 9, he made it abundantly clear that there was no witness who said that he had returned to the bridge with her, and that there were two witnesses, Allan Oats and Logan, who said he was on the bridge alone.\nWe cannot agree that the effect of the judge\u2019s direction on this point withdrew from the jury the most vital issue in Truscott\u2019s case. It was quite clear from the charge that the jury could not convict Truscott if they accepted Logan\u2019s evidence.\n11. Reference to Truscott\u2019s \u201ccalmness and apathy\u201d.\nIn his charge the trial judge put the question \u201cYou will ask yourselves and you will ask yourselves the reason if this boy is guilty, why he has shown such calmness and apathy.\u201d\nCounsel for the defence had urged that Truscott\u2019s demeanour and attitude, when he returned to the school yard and was seen there by a number of children, was completely inconsistent with guilt, and in putting this question to the jury the trial judge sought to raise this issue in their minds.\nWhat he meant is clearly illustrated in his original charge, when he said \u201cIt is pointed out by the Defence, and very properly so, and it is something you must consider, and that is his demeanour when he returned, that he seemed to be natural.\u201d\nHe then cited the evidence of three children who had seen him at the school yard, who described his appearance as \u201cnormal\u201d.\nFrom time to time in the course of these reasons we have mentioned the fact that defence counsel took no objection to certain rulings made by the trial judge, certain evidence that was introduced to which objection is now taken and certain comments of the trial judge and Crown counsel made in the course of the proceedings. It should be clearly understood that it is not suggested that the failure of defence counsel to object to the admissibility of evidence or to any part of the trial judge\u2019s charge or to any comments by the judge or counsel in the course of the proceedings constitutes an answer to any valid objections now made to the conduct of the trial. The failure of defence counsel to make such objections is only mentioned in these reasons for the purpose of indicating that counsel who acted on Truscott\u2019s behalf do not appear to have attached any importance or validity to the objections in question.\nAnswer to the question submitted on the Reference\nFor all of the foregoing reasons our answer to the question submitted is that had an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A of the Criminal Code of Canada, on the existing record and the further evidence this Court would have dismissed such an appeal. [Page 381] HALL J. (dissenting):\u2014Steven Murray Truscott, then age 14\u00bd years, was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury at Goderich in September 1959 on an indictment as follows:\nThe Jurors for Our Lady The Queen present that Steven Murray Truscott on or about the 9th day of June, 1959, at the Township of Tuckersmith, in the County of Huron, did unlawfully murder Lynne Harper, contrary to The Criminal Code of Canada.\nOn the 30th day of September 1959 the jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] by Steven Murray Truscott against his conviction was dismissed on the 21st day of January 1960. By Order-in-Council P.C., 1960-87, dated the 21st day of January 1960, the sentence of death passed upon Steven Murray Truscott upon his conviction on the indictment aforesaid was commuted to a term of life imprisonment in the Kingston Penitentiary. Application for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was refused on the 24th day of February 1960.\nSection 597A of the Criminal Code was enacted in 1961, providing as follows:\n597A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a person\n(a) who has been sentenced to death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal, or\n(b) who is acquitted of an offence punishable by death and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of appeal,\nmay appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact. 1960-61, c. 44, s. 11.\nBy Order-in-Council P.C. 1966-760, dated the 26th day of April 1966, pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, His Excellency The Governor General referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration the following question:\nHad an Appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A of the Criminal Code of Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of such an Appeal on a consideration of the existing Record and such further evidence as the Court, in its discretion, may receive and consider? When the application was made in February 1960 for leave to appeal to this Court from the Court of Appeal of Ontario, s. 597A had not yet been enacted. The application so made was under s. 597(1) (6) which provided that an appeal lay by leave to the Supreme Court on a question of law alone. The application then made was restricted to the following grounds:\n1. Was there any evidence of such a character that the inference of guilt of the Appellant might, and could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom by the jury?\n2. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial according to law by the remarks made by Crown Counsel in his opening to the jury?\n3. Did the learned trial Judge err in allowing the Crown witnesses, Jocelyne Goddette, Anold George, and Tom Gillette to be sworn?\n4. Did the learned trial Judge err in failing to properly define corroboration for the jury?\n5. Did the learned trial Judge err in instructing the jury that certain unsworn witnesses were in fact corroborated?\n6. Did the learned trial Judge err in his charge to the jury in regard to the doctrine of reasonable doubt?\nOn the reference in this Court, the substantial grounds upon which the trial and conviction were challenged were materially different from the foregoing although there were included some elements of the same grounds, but essentially this is a completely new procedure and the Court must now deal with law and fact and with questions of mixed law and fact. Much new evidence was heard in these proceedings under the authority of the Order-in-Council and the accused himself testified for the first time. He maintained his innocence as he had done since his conviction in 1959.\nHaving considered the case fully, I believe that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed. I take the view that the trial was not conducted according to law. Even the guiltiest criminal must be tried according to law. That does not mean that I consider Truscott guilty or innocent. The determination of guilt or innocence was a matter for the jury and for the jury alone as its dominant function following a trial conducted according to law.\nThe case against Truscott was predominantly but not exclusively one of circumstantial evidence. I recognize fully that guilt can be brought home to an accused by circumstantial evidence; that there are cases where the circumstances can be said to point inexorably to guilt more reliably than direct evidence; that direct evidence is subject to the everyday hazards of imperfect recognition or of imperfect memory or both. The circumstantial evidence case is built piece by piece until the final evidentiary structure completely entraps the prisoner in a situation from which he cannot escape. There may be missing from that structure a piece here and there and certain imperfections may be discernible, but the entrapping mesh taken as a whole must be continuous and consistent. The law does not require that the guilt of an accused be established to a demonstration but is satisfied when the evidence presented to the jury points conclusively to the accused as the perpetrator of the crime and excludes any reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The rules of evidence apply with equal force to proof by circumstantial evidence as to proof by direct evidence. The evidence in both instances must be equally credible, admissible and relevant\nApplying the foregoing to the trial under review, I find that there were grave errors in the trial brought about principally by Crown Counsel\u2019s method in trying to establish guilt and by the learned Trial Judge\u2019s failure to appreciate that the course being followed by the Crown would necessarily involve the jury being led away from an objective appraisal of the evidence for and against the prisoner. The Crown approached the prosecution on the theory or hypothesis that young Truscott had planned to take Jocelyne Goddette into Lawson\u2019s bush to have some improper relations with her and when she failed to show he was so intent on taking some girl to Lawson\u2019s bush that evening that when Lynne Harper came to him in the school yard he seized upon this accidental meeting to persuade her to go with him and to her death. This approach is borne out (1) by Crown Counsel\u2019s statement in his opening address to the jury as follows:\nI should deal with the accused, who is in the same grade, although older than the deceased girl, and at the same school. He was, at the time, and still is, the son of a Warrant Officer who also lives in the Married Quarters on the Station. Now, in considering the movements of this accused relative to the crime, you will hear from one, who may be a very important witness in your estimation, Jocelyne Goddette. She is a girl from the same grade, and she will tell you of arrangements she made with Steven Truscott at school on the Monday and the Tuesday before, in or near this same bush where this body was found, to look for a certain purpose she will outline. You will hear that better from her lips as to their arrangement together to go to this bush, and that was at, let us say in the area of six o\u2019clock, roughly. You will hear better the times from her and certain things said by way of caution of bringing anyone or telling anyone.\n(The italics are mine.)\nand (2) by the questions put to Jocelyne Goddette which stressed the secrecy of the original arrangement with Jocelyne for the two to meet at about six o\u2019clock on the county road near the bush area. The evidence given by Jocelyne Goddette as to her arrangement to meet with Truscott was as follows:\nQ. And on Monday, June 8th, Jocelyne, did you have a conversation with Steven Truscott?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Will you tell what that conversation was, please?\nA. Well, on Sunday, I had gone to Bob Lawson\u2019s barn and I had seen a calf there. I mentioned that to Steve on Monday, and he asked me if I wanted to see two more newborn calves\u2026 And I said: \u201cYes\u201d. And he asked me if I could make it on Monday and I said: \u201cNo\u201d, because I had to go to Guides.\nMR. HAYS:\nQ. Make what?\nA. If I could go with him to see the calves and I said: \u201cNo\u201d.\nQ. Where were you to go with him?\nA. Well, he didn\u2019t tell me on Monday.\nQ. Well, go ahead?\nA. And then he asked me if I could make it on Tuesday and I said I would try. And then on Tuesday, he told me if I could go and I just told him I didn\u2019t know, and he said to meet him, if I could go, on the right-hand side of the County Road, just outside of the fence by the woods, and he kept on telling me not to tell anybody because Bob didn\u2019t like a whole bunch of kids on his property.\n(The italics are mine.)\nQ. Now, that is on Tuesday, June 9th, is it, that that conversation is, Jocelyne?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And when were you to go? A. Well, at six o\u2019clock.\nQ. On Tuesday?\nA. Yes, sir. Q. And where\u2014did you see Steven later after school?\nA. Yes, sir. He came to my house at ten before six and I didn\u2019t answer the door, my brother did, and Steven asked me if we had any homework and I said we had English for our English test on Wednesday, and when he was just getting on his bike to go away, I told him I didn\u2019t think I would be able to make it because we were just starting supper, but that I would try.\nThis evidence was admissible and relevant to establish why Jocelyne said she was looking for Truscott that evening excepting possibly the words I have put in italics, but reading as it does the phrase was rather innocuous because it gives the reason for keeping quiet, and with nothing more the learned judge could have told the jury to ignore it. Even a failure to do this would not have been serious. However, after some intervening questions and answers the subject was deliberately reopened and the following question was put to Jocelyne by Crown Counsel and an answer solicited which emphasized the secret aspect of the proposed meeting of these two teen-agers:\nQ. Was there any more conversation between you then, on Tuesday?\nA. Well, he just kept on telling me to \u201cdon\u2019t tell anybody to come with you\u201d, and that is all.\nand this was magnified by the learned judge who, following this question and answer, said:\nHis LORDSHIP:\nQ. Say that again. He just kept on telling me what?\nA. Not to tell anybody.\nThis was when the damage was done. These last two answers were wholly inadmissible. In dealing with this particular item, the majority opinion says:\nThe admonition to Jocelyne Goddette to keep the matter secret is no more a reflection on Truscott\u2019s character than the invitation itself. It is part and parcel of the same conversation and one part cannot be separated from the other. The jury is entitled to know what the whole conversation was and the witness when testifying to such a conversation should not be compelled to stop at a certain point.\nThat observation is only partly correct in that it is incomplete. It expresses the ordinary rule but that rule is subject to a number of exceptions. It is often the duty of counsel to forewarn a witness not to volunteer or blurt out as part of the narrative in an answer evidence that while part of that narrative is inadmissible as, for instance, references to confessions or admissions made by an accused or evidence of bad character and many others. It is not a case of volunteering or blurting out that is being dealt with here but a conscious and deliberate drawing from the witness evidence that was bound to be prejudicial and as an integral part of establishing the Crown\u2019s theory that Truscott was planning harm to Jocelyne Goddette.\nThe evidence had no probative value to prove Truscott murdered Lynne Harper and should have been rejected when tendered by the rule which excludes evidence of similar acts which Viscount Sankey said in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7] was \u201cone of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our Criminal Law\u201d. Having thus laid this foundation, Crown Counsel elaborated the theory and put it forward as proof of Truscott\u2019s guilt in his summation to the jury saying:\nNow, there is substantial support for Jocelyne\u2019s evidence that she went looking for Steven, and support for her evidence of these conversations. She went on to tell how she couldn\u2019t go with him on Monday night. Well then, there was a tentative date for six o\u2019clock on the Tuesday night. And that he, Steven, came to the house and called for her. He called there at ten minutes to six but she was having her supper, and I suggest to you, Gentlemen, that if they were late having their supper, it was a God\u2019s blessing to that girl.\n(The italics are mine.)\n* * *\nHere is the relevancy of that, Gentlemen. He missed his first prospect and what more logical and likely person to accept his proposal to go with him on short notice than a girl he knows is fond of him, soft on him, whatever you will, and likely to take up his invitation?\nNow, we are told\u2014again we come back to Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Bohonus. They talked and she sat on the bicycle tire and they went\u2014I suggest that they then went down to the bush. I suggest that is a reasonable inference, that Steven gave Lynne the new\u2011born calf invitation that he had previously extended to Jocelyne, and that he gave her that, either at the school or as they rode\u2014walked or rode, and if it wouldn\u2019t sound like a good proposition to an adult or to some girls, older girls, other girls, we must remember, it was coming from a boy that she liked. She was fond of. That she would want to be with. And, unfortunately, that may have removed what would otherwise be a little caution. And also, there was evidence that Lynne was interested in ponies, at least, and had gone to this house on the highway, to see ponies. I don\u2019t think, Gentlemen, I am asking you to make too much of a deduction but what she would be very likely to fall for the lure of the new-born calves coming from Steven, and that she went with him to the bush and to her doom.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThere was no evidence of the conversation between Truscott and Lynne in the school yard or as they left together excepting Truscott\u2019s statement to the police that Lynne had asked him for a ride to No. 8 Highway which from the nature of things was uncontradicted. There was no suggestion in the evidence of those who saw Truscott and Lynne together in the school yard from which it could be inferred that Truscott was trying to induce or persuade Lynne to go anywhere with him. Mrs. Bohonus said it was Lynne who appeared to her to be doing the talking.\nThe learned judge in his charge to the jury recognized the impropriety of this prejudicial and inflammatory appeal but too late to undo the harm as I shall discuss later. Notwithstanding what the learned judge said in this regard, it is significant to note that at pp. 54 and 55 of the Crown\u2019s factum on this reference is to be found:\nIt is submitted that the following inference may be properly drawn from the evidence adduced at the trial and from that evidence supplemented by the evidence on the Reference:\n(1) Truscott was bent on taking a girl into Lawson\u2019s Wood on June 9th. His expressed purpose was to look for new-born calves, but this was coloured by his desire for secrecy;\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe majority opinion also says:\nWe do not think that any of this conversation between Truscott and Jocelyne Goddette was any reflection on Truscott\u2019s character. To put it at its worst for Truscott it means no more than this: that he had a tentative date arranged with Jocelyne Goddette. He wanted a date with a girl that night and he took Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette was not available. We have already mentioned that this has some bearing on the submission of the prosecution that his story of the ride, the sole purpose of which was to take her to the intersection, may not have been true. It does not amount to trying to prove bad character or a disposition to murder and rape.\nThis appears to ignore the reality of the situation when considered in the actual setting as it was being developed at the trial by Crown Counsel and entirely repugnant to what Crown Counsel said in the extracts from his summation to the jury quoted above when he said, referring to Truscott having called for Jocelyne Goddette \u201cand I suggest to you, Gentlemen, that if they were late having their supper, it was a God\u2019s blessing to that girl\u201d, and when he followed that with his reference to Lynne Harper and said that Truscott gave Lynne the new-born calf invitation and \u201cthat she went with him to the bush and to her doom\u201d.\nThe majority opinion rightly points out that the facts in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions differ materially from those of the case at bar. It was not the factual situation that Viscount Sankey was dealing with in the extract that I have quoted. He was stating a long established principle applicable to many factual situations. Maxwell\u2019s case was an obvious if not a flagrant violation of the principle. Violations can and do occur in less obvious instances. The present case is one of those. Crown Counsel was pursuing a planned course of action that included the subtle perverting of the jury to the idea that Truscott was sex hungry that Tuesday evening and determined to have a girl in Lawson\u2019s bush to satisfy his desires, if not Jocelyne, then Lynne.\nIt was inevitable that this horrible crime would arouse the indignation of the whole community. It was inevitable too that suspicion should fall on Truscott, the last person known to have been seen with Lynne in the general vicinity of the place where her body was found. The law has formulated certain principles and safeguards to be applied in the trial of a person accused of a crime and has throughout the centuries insisted on these principles and safeguards being observed. In the great majority of cases adherence to these fundamentals is not difficult but in a case like the present one, when passions are aroused and the Court is dealing with a crime which cries out for vengeance, then comes the time of testing. It is especially at such a time that the judicial machinery must function objectively, devoid of inflammatory appeals, with the scales of justice held in balance.\nThis standard was not lived up to in the trial under review in a number of instances which one by one were damaging to Truscott and taken collectively vitiated the trial Nothing that transpired on the hearing in this Court or any evidence tendered here can be used to give validity to what was an invalid trial. A bad trial remains a bad trial. The only remedy for a bad trial is a new trial. Accordingly, the validity of the trial is, in my view, the dominant issue. With deference to contrary opinion, I see no purpose in erecting a massive and detailed structure of evidence, inference and argument confirming a verdict that has no lawful foundation upon which to rest.\nIt was the Crown\u2019s theory at the trial that Truscott took Lynne into Lawson\u2019s bush by way of the tractor trail, having carried her on the handle bar of his bicycle to a point on the tractor trail some 350 feet east of the county road and then induced her to enter the bush through the fence, concealing his bicycle nearby. It must be observed in passing that at the hearing in this Court Mr. Bowman, of Counsel for the Crown, advanced the theory that Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the county road at or near the point where the locket was later found hanging on the fence. Crown Counsel at the trial had an altogether different theory which he put forward concerning this locket\u2014but I shall revert to this later.\nAt the trial the Crown led evidence to show that Truscott entered the tractor trail with Lynne. This was evidence by Corporal Erskine, the very first witness called by the Crown, that on the 13th day of June (two days after Lynne\u2019s body was found) he observed and photographed certain bicycle tire marks which corresponded with the tread on the tires of Truscott\u2019s bicycle. Defence Counsel objected to the photograph (Exhibit 13) being received, but was overruled by the learned judge who said regarding the photograph:\nMr. Hays seems to think it has something to do with the case. I don\u2019t think I can rule it out on the grounds you put forward.\nThis Exhibit 13 shows conclusively that the tire marks photographed by Corporal Erskine must have been made many days preceding June 9th. The marks were made when the soil in which they were imprinted was wet and there had been no rain in the area, with the exception of a trace in the night of May 31st-June 1st and that throughout the period June 1st to June 9th the temperature had been in the high 80\u2019s and low 90\u2019s. Perhaps the best way to illustrate the impossibility of these tire marks having been made on June 9th is to reproduce Exhibit 13 showing the parched terrain with the wide cracks in the surface. Here is a reproduction of Exhibit 13: Notwithstanding that the evidence completely negatived the use of these tire marks as evidence implicating Truscott on June 9th, Crown Counsel argued to the jury in his summation as follows:\nThe bicycle marks, Gentlemen, I am not going to linger over. Corporal Erskine\u2019s evidence that he found tire marks, combinations of the two wheels, but they are in as Exhibits. You will have them with you. That he made comparison and that he found those marks in the laneway and you will remember the distance down. I, frankly, don\u2019t. That they compare. That they are a combination. Now it is true there could be similar tires, certainly, but where you get radically different tires\u2014you look at them and you will find them in combination, it would seem to be fairly strong evidence that that bicycle was down there.\nBut, Gentlemen, as I said about a circumstantial evidence case, that is the beauty\u2014there is nothing beautiful about this at all, but that is one of the strong facts about it. You have a pile of facts and if there is one or two that are not conclusive you still, you still have the conclusive proof of the facts that are there.\nThe learned judge should have charged the jury in the light of the evidence of the meteorologist Calvert and with Exhibit 13 before him that they must exclude from their consideration the evidence relating to these bicycle tire marks. This he failed to do, but instead, and in my opinion wrongly, left the jury to understand that they could use that evidence as part of the proof against Truscott that he had ridden Lynne along that tractor trail the night she disappeared. He said:\nNothing belonging to the accused boy was found in the locality, in the neighbourhood of the body, as you will recall. There was a tire mark in the field about seventeen feet north of the fence that ran along this lane, and Constable Erskine, who testified, said that the marks of the tire were similar, I think that is as high as he put it, were similar to the tires that were put in evidence of the bicycle belonging to the accused boy, and you are asked to find that those marks were made by this bicycle. That is what the Crown asks you to find. The bicycle is not a common one.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThat was misdirection on a salient feature of the evidence for it was part and parcel of the Crown\u2019s case at the trial that Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the tractor trail and that he had hidden his bicycle so well that it was not seen by Jocelyne Goddette when, as she says, she went along the tractor trail looking for Truscott and calling his name. This presupposes that Truscott had the foresight to anticipate that Jocelyne would come along the tractor trail looking for him and to conceal his bicycle against that eventuality; a theory that attributed to Truscott a carefully planned design to harm Lynne and escape detection. The majority opinion, in dealing with the matter of the bicycle tire marks, says: \u201cWe do not think that anyone took this evidence (the tire marks) as a salient feature of the case.\u201d I find it difficult to see how this statement can be substantiated. Who knows what the jury considered salient? This evidence was regarded as sufficiently important by Crown Counsel as to insist that it be received.\nI referred earlier to Mr. Bowman\u2019s theory that Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the county road at or near the place where Lynne\u2019s locket was found on the fence. In his argument to this Court, Mr. Bowman said:\nMy submission was, my lord, that they disappeared from the county road, and my submission was that it might be reasonably inferred that they went into the wood, and that they got into the wood through the barbed wire along the county road. It was broken down in two or three places, and the locket was found there, which could have some significance. They could have gone in any where, my lord, but I submit that there is one possible way. Whether or not that is what the jury accepted I cannot say.\nHowever, at the trial, in dealing with this locket, Crown Counsel put forward a more sinister theory which, if accepted by the jury as Crown Counsel intended it should be, made the 14\u00bd year old Truscott out to be a cunning criminal who, having taken the locket from Lynne when he strangled her, later and before he was taken into custody planted the locket where it was found to mislead the police and to lay the foundation for a defence to be used later if necessary that Lynne was murdered elsewhere and then brought to where she was found. He said to the jury:\nNow, the Defence has raised the matter of a locket. And do you recall Steven\u2019s statement to Constable Hobbs and Corporal Wheelhouse\u2014maybe it is Sergeant Wheelhouse on Thursday. He was interviewed by Hobbs and another officer, Johnson, I believe on Wednesday. And then when Hobbs went back on the Thursday, he said: \u201cHave you anything to add?\u201d \u201cYes, she was wearing a necklace like a gold chain and heart, possibly plastic.\u201d I am not sure whether one or the other officer put in the word \u201cPlastic\u201d.\n\u201cWith an Air Force Crest embedded in it.\u201d Mark you, not on it, but in it, and sure enough, it is in it, not on it, but in it.\nNow, I ask you, Gentlemen, is that not an awful lot of details for this boy to have observed about this locket, if it is Lynne\u2019s, as he would ride along the road with her. Would he be able to give such a minute description of it as that, if that is all the chance he had to observe it? Now, Gentlemen, the Defence introduced this matter of the locket on the basis that it was found on the west\u2014on a wire of the fence on the west side of the bush along the County Road. And the theory is, I take it, from what my learned friend said yesterday, that in some way she was murdered elsewhere, brought back and dragged through the fence and this pulled off and stuck on the fence.\n* * *\nI have a theory, Gentlemen, to put forward only for your consideration, and that is this: that her attacker removed that locket, undid the fastener when the girl was dead, and he couldn\u2019t have got it off any other way, it is just too small to go over her head. And he took it off and took it with him and studied the detail after that he could never have studied in the interval of time that she was on the bicycle, to have found that that crest was embedded in the locket. It is only theory, Gentlemen. Reason it out for yourselves. And then if you deduce it that way, ask yourselves the possible identity of anyone who, would take a souvenir away from a body like this. Who would want to take it away? Would it be someone rather young? Would an older man ever be bothered with it? You may have difficulty reasoning out the \u201cwhy\u201d. But ask yourselves this, if it were taken, studied out so that these details could be given, could it have been taken back and planted, so to speak, where it was found? And what is the point of that? Remember, there is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, before the accused is arrested, but the investigation is on.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe learned judge permitted Crown Counsel to so theorize to the jury without one iota of evidence to support the theory that Truscott under suspicion as he then was had the cunning to plant the locket where it was found\u2014a theory that was prejudicial and inflammatory. This was error in a material aspect.\nNow, what was the evidence regarding this locket? First, it was not actually identified as the one Lynne was wearing on June 9th. Lynne\u2019s father, F\/O L.B. Harper, refused to say the locket produced in Court was Lynne\u2019s, saying only that Lynne had one similar to it. Mrs. Harper said she did not know whether Lynne was wearing her locket or not that evening and when shown the locket she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t say certainly. It looks like it. It was very similar.\u201d The locket produced in evidence was said to have been found by a ten year old girl, Sandra Archibald. Her unsworn evidence was as follows:\nQ. Sandra, when you were out picking berries, did you find something valuable?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Where did you find it, Sandra?\nA. I found it near the woods where Lynne was found.\nQ. Could you say just where it was?\nA. I can\u2019t remember. Q. What did you find, Sandra?\nA. I found a locket, like a necklace.\nQ. Pardon?\nA. I found a heart-shaped necklace.\nQ. A heart-shaped necklace?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Could you describe it? Tell us about it a little more?\nA. It was whitish and had this Air Force thing inside, and when I found it, it was open.\nQ. What was open, Sandra?\nA. The chain that you put around your neck.\nQ. And where was it, Sandra?\nA. Well, the chain, it was hanging on the fence and it was inside, in some grass and the heart was outside.\nHer evidence as to finding the locket was not corroborated. Having found it, she said she took it home and gave it to her mother the same day. The mother, Mrs. Aida Archibald, testified as follows:\nQ. Are you the mother of Sandra Archibald, who testified here yesterday, Mrs. Archibald?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. And I produce to you a locket which is Exhibit twenty-three in this matter. Would you look at it, Mrs. Archibald. Did that come into your possession at any time?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. At what time?\nA. Around ten to five on June the 19th.\nQ. From what source?\nA. From my daughter. She picked it up.\nQ. That is Sandra, who testified?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. And what did you do with it?\nA. Well, at the time I didn\u2019t know what to do.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. And some of the kids\u2026\nQ. Never mind what anybody said. What did you do?\nA. I turned it over to two SP.\u2019s.\nQ. Who was that?\nA. Sergeant Johnson and Mr. Wheelhouse.\nQ. At the time your girl gave it to you, was the clasp open or closed?\nA. It was open, sir.\nQ. When you turned it over it was in the way you got it?\nA. I put it in a Kleenex, sir.\nTruscott had told Constable Hobbs on June 11th that Lynne was wearing a gold chain necklace with an R.C.A.F. crest in it when giving the ride to Lynne on his bicycle. It was from this evidence that Crown Counsel was permitted to dramatize the locket incident into a formal submission that it was planted where it was found by Truscott to mislead the police.\nIt was not the only fanciful theory put forward by the Crown to the jury to prejudice Truscott without any supporting evidence. Evidence was led that Truscott told police officers Wheelhouse and Hobbs on the Thursday that he had seen an old model Dodge or Plymouth car somewhere on the county road on the evening of June 9th bearing Licence No. 981,666. The Crown called a witness from the Department of Transport, one Saunders, to show that Licence No. 981,666 was registered to one Thompson of Brampton. Thompson, on being called, said he was not near Clinton at all that evening. Saunders testified that Licence No. 189,666 was registered to one Vasil of Toronto and was for a 1957 Pontiac four door; that Licence No. 198,666 was issued to one Mika of Scarborough for a 1955 Buick; No. 819,666 was in the name of McLaren of Drumbo and was for a 1957 Oldsmobile hard top. Then as to No. 918,666 registered to a Miss Wilkins of Kitchener for a 1949 Plymouth, Miss Wilkins was called and said her car was never out of the Kitchener area; finally as to No. 891,666, a Mr. Pigun then on the R.C.A.F Station at Clinton was called to establish that his car, a 1949 Chevrolet Sedan, was not on the county road on the evening of June 10th. Now all this evidence was, in my opinion, inadmissible. Truscott had not volunteered having seen a car with Licence No. 981,666 in proof of having taken Lynne to No. Eight Highway. He does not suggest that he met that car north of the tractor trail. His statement in this regard as given by Constable Hobbs is as follows:\nQ. What was the next you saw of Steven Truscott?\nA. I next saw Steven Truscott at the school at the R.C.A.F. Station, Clinton. It was the following morning, Thurdsay, June the 11th, 1959. I was accompanied by Sergeant Wheelhouse of the R.C.A.F. Police. We went into the school and inquired of Mr. Trott, the teacher, if we could have a room in which to question various children regarding the missing girl, with hopes of finding some information as to where she might be. I started off by having Steven brought into the room and I asked him if there was anything further he could add to our conversation of the date previous. He said: \u201cYes, she was wearing a gold chain necklace that had a heart with an R.C.A.F. crest in it.\u201d I asked him if he had seen anyone else while he was giving the ride to Lynne on his bicycle. He replied that he had seen Richard Gellatly. I asked him if he saw any other vehicles, motorcycles or motorcars during this ride. He replied that he had seen an old grey Plymouth or Dodge. I asked him if he could remember the occupants. He said: \u201cA man and a lady.\u201d I said: \u201cBy any chance, Steven, can you remember the licence number of the car?\u201d He said: \u2018Yes, it was 8\u2026\u201d pardon me. \u201cIt was 981 666.\u201d I asked him if he saw anyone else. He replied that on the way down he had waved to Arnold George, who was swimming in the river. I asked him again to repeat the licence of this old grey Plymouth or Dodge and he did, without hesitation. He said: \u201c981,666.\u201d I asked him what he did after watching the others swimming at the river. He replied that he cycled back up the County Road. I asked him a third time to repeat the number of this motorcar, this old grey Plymouth or Dodge, and without hesitation again, he gave me the number 981,666. Our conversation ended and I went to a telephone to get a registration check on this licence number.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe majority opinion says in connection with this item: \u201cIn our view, this was not a collateral matter. It was strictly relevant to the fact in issue\u2014whether Truscott was on the road (the County road) when he said he was.\u201d The fact is Truscott never suggested that he was not on the County road. He told police he carried Lynne northward on that road and on the Crown\u2019s theory he carried her 3,366 feet before he reached the tractor trail\u2014well over half a mile. It was at this time that he met Richard Gellatly and on being further questioned told of having seen the car with Licence No. 981666. No suggestion here that he was saying he saw that car north of the tractor trail. If there is one fact upon which Crown and Defence and all Counsel were in agreement it is that Truscott carried Lynne on his bicycle from the south end of the County road to a point at least as far north as Lawson\u2019s bush. The statement regarding this car was accordingly a collateral matter. Evidence in contradiction of it was therefore inadmissible; it was tendered as Crown Counsel said:\nNow, this is only on the question of credibility. There is nothing in the main theory of this case that bears on that car, as far as I know. But again, if a man, or a young man, is telling falsehoods, I put it forward as indicative of a guilty state of mind.\nBut even more improperly it was argued by Crown Counsel that it was additional evidence of Truscott\u2019s cunning. He put it to the jury this way:\n891,666 a 1949 grey Chevrolet registered to Mr. Pigeon. Now, we called Mr. Pigeon. He is with the R.C.A.F. Station at Clinton. We called him and he testified how on the night in question he went down from his garden on Number Four Highway, south to Brucefield going out, not by the east side\u2014not by the County Road at all, but down through what is described as the main gate. I don\u2019t say he used that expression. You will be able to figure it out from the map. He never was near where Truscott put him, and I suggest, Gentlemen, with respect, that Steven Truscott had seen that car around in the interval between the Tuesday and the Police coming to him, and he was getting some ammunition ready and he snapped out a number on the gamble that that car might have been on the County Road. He got one digit off on the number. He got a shade off on the make. It is a Chev. against a Plymouth or Dodge. He had the grey right. But it misfired because we were able to bring before you Mr. Pigeon, and he never was on the County Road that night, and he related his movements.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe learned judge admitted this evidence and this was error. The error was compounded and the real damage done when he permitted Crown Counsel to make the charge of fabricating evidence without stopping him then and there. Without this unsupported suggestion, the calling of seven witnesses on this aspect of the case alone would have been nothing more than a waste of time, but all this time was used so Crown Counsel could put to the jury the idea that Truscott had fabricated the story in preparation for his defence. One may question in this connection why the evidence was limited to a transposition of the first three ciphers only. If one of the 6\u2019s be transposed with the figure 1 the number of possibilities is greatly increased.\nThe learned judge showed that he was well aware that the case was one where the jury might be influenced by the nature of the crime for he warned them at the beginning of his charge as follows:\nThere is another matter I should like to mention to you. The circumstances of the killing of this little girl are shocking. As I said, they are revolting in the extreme, and one would think that only a monster could be guilty of such a killing. The accused is charged with this monstrous crime and he is just a lad of little more than fourteen years, fourteen and a half. Now, you must not permit the fact of his youth in any way to prevent you from bringing in a verdict in accordance with your conscience. Nor, on the other hand ought you to allow the revolting nature of the facts surrounding this case in any way influence you to bring in a verdict which is, in any way, shape or form, contrary to the evidence, or based on anything but the evidence. You must not be prejudiced in any way.\nBut that warning came too late. It was nullified in advance by the manner in which the Crown had elected to build its case and by the judge\u2019s failure to exclude the evidence with which I have dealt and by his failure to stop Crown Counsel when in his speech to the jury he advanced subtly worded inflammatory arguments which should have been repudiated on the spot. Only in respect of the reference to Jocelyne Goddette did the judge tell the jury to disregard what Mr. Hays had said and in this particular instance the warning came much too late. It was not possible in my opinion to undo the damage done by this belated direction. There are instances where a trial judge may, by directing the jury to purge from their minds evidence which should not have been heard or to completely ignore erroneous statements or arguments made to them, enable a Court of Appeal to say under s. 592(b) (iii) that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, but the present case is not one of those. The errors and inflammatory arguments were too numerous and too integrated into the whole of the case as to be capable of coming within the exception provided for by that section.\nThe evidence was as conclusive as evidence can be that Lynne was strangled and raped. It was argued on behalf of Truscott both at the trial and before this Court that Lynne was not murdered where her body was found. I do not find it necessary to go into this phase of the case in detail because, in my view, the evidence was such that the jury, if the issue had been properly left to them, could find that she was murdered at the place where her body was found. I will deal later with this aspect of the charge.\nMore important, however, in so far as Truscott is concerned is the submission that the evidence failed to establish that her death occurred prior to 7.45 p.m. on June 9th. If she was murdered later than this time, Truscott could not be the guilty person. It is as simple as that.\nThe argument that death was later than 7.45 p.m. June 9th was stressed by Defence Counsel at the trial. Both the Crown and the Defence went fully into the medical aspects of this issue before the jury.\nIn summary, at the trial Dr. Penistan the pathologist had testified that in his judgment death had occurred in the period between 5.45 and 7.45 p.m. June 9th, basing his opinion on the fact that Lynne had finished her supper at a quarter to six and that when the autopsy was performed, it was found that the stomach had not emptied as it would normally have done within two hours. Another medical man, Dr. Berkley Brown, a specialist in internal medicine on the staff of the University of Western Ontario, called on behalf of Truscott, testified that the stomach would not empty for a matter of three and a half to four hours. Here was a conflict on a decisive aspect of the case which the jury would have to resolve. The learned judge charged the jury as follows:\nAccording to Doctor Penistan, and to the medical evidence, she died at a time which is not altogether, in any view, inconsistent with her having finished her dinner at about a quarter to six. Doctor Brown says, and I must draw it to your attention, that it takes three and a half to four hours to empty the stomach and it is on the basis of that that the defence asks you to say that she could not have been killed before Steven returned at 8:00 p.m. You have Doctor Brown\u2019s testimony. It is unfortunate always, that medical men should disagree on what is more or less a scientific point. Doctor Brown says three and a half hours to four hours.\nNow, the stomach, of course, was not empty. Doctor Penistan said there was still a pint of food in the stomach and he removed that pint. It is true there is not a pint of food in the bottle now, and it is for you Gentlemen to accept or reject Doctor Penistan\u2019s evidence that he took a pint out, but Doctor Brooks was there and saw the pint. Don\u2019t forget that the bottle went to the Attorney-General\u2019s Laboratories, for tests and we don\u2019t know exactly what happened to it there except it was handed to some man whom we have not seen. It will be for you to say whether you accept Doctor Penistan\u2019s theory, an Attorney-General\u2019s Pathologist of many years\u2019 standing, or do you accept Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe last sentence was clearly a misdirection to the jury. The jury should have been told that as between Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brown, if the evidence of Dr. Brown left a reasonable doubt in their minds as to the time of death, they must acquit. No jury can be told that they have to accept the evidence of one witness or that of another. The burden is on the Crown to satisfy the jury on every material aspect of the case beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not find it necessary to go in detail into the medical evidence given on the reference in this Court. This has been done in the majority opinion and is seen to be contradictory in the extreme. This much must, however, be said that it tends strongly to increase the doubt a juryman may honestly have had as to the time of death, if properly charged.\nThe medical evidence tendered in this Court and not heard by the jury cannot be used to nullify the damage done by this misdirection. The jury should have been properly charged. This Court cannot substitute its view of the medical evidence for that of the jury.\nThere is, however, one aspect in particular of the medical evidence heard in this Court that has an important bearing on the case. It is the evidence relating to the penile lesions. At the trial the Crown, on the evidence then before the Court, argued that the sores on Truscott\u2019s penis as described by Drs. Addison and Brooks had been caused by rape or forced intercourse. That was the theory of the Crown and the case went to the jury on this hypothesis. As such, it was, I think, the most damaging piece of evidence at the trial connecting Truscott with Lynne\u2019s death. The point was stressed by Crown Counsel. He said in part:\nNow, Gentlemen, Doctor Addison is a General Practitioner in the Town of Clinton, and has been for many years. You heard his background, his qualifications, and I suggest to you, one and all, that Doctor Addison comes into this case with no axe to grind and is worthy of credence. That Doctor Addison was an impressive witness, that is for you, Gentlemen. You saw him and heard him. Now, Doctor Addison would know all about, from his years and years of general practising, know all about the shape and nature and so on, of the private parts, both of a man and of a twelve-year old girl. And Doctor Brooks would know the same thing, and both those men pledged their opinion in that box, that the injuries to the accused\u2019s private parts were such as could have been caused by penetration of a young twelve-year old girl\u2019s private parts, and they went further, that observing these wounds, they would give their opinion they were from two to three days old.\n* * *\nGentlemen, that is right in Doctor Addison\u2019s line and right in Doctor Brooks\u2019 line, and they gave that time as being two, three, four days, which would bring it right to the indecent assault on this girl, within latitudes, but you didn\u2019t get any help from Doctor Brown. To my best recollection of his evidence, he never talked about that at all. He couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t see them. If you received his evidence differently, use it. But I just submit, in short, that Doctor Brown\u2019s evidence in the abstract, we might call it, no matter how well intentioned, just can\u2019t, I respectfully suggest, throw any shadow of doubt on the opinions of Doctor Addison and Doctor Brooks as to cause and time that I have gone over.\nThe medical evidence given in this Court greatly negatived this theory although it was said that having sores of the kind described, they could be aggravated or rubbed by intercourse or by some other cause. There is a great difference in the two positions. The possibility of aggravation of an existing condition by one of two or more causes is altogether different from the assertion that the sores were initially caused by raping the girl, This becomes of greater significance when the admissibility of Dr. Brooks\u2019 evidence at the trial is considered.\nParticular stress was placed on Dr. Brooks\u2019 evidence that in his opinion the sores on Truscott\u2019s penis indicated \u201ca very inexpert attempt at penetration\u201d. Dr. Brooks\u2019 evidence on this point was inadmissible. He was testifying as an expert as to a matter that was not in his special knowledge and the evidence was prejudicial to the prisoner. The majority opinion deals generally with the admissibility of Dr. Brooks\u2019 evidence. The only part which I consider inadmissible is the phrase just quoted.\nIn Regina v. Kuzmack[8], the right of a medical witness to testify as an expert, was dealt with by Porter J.A. as follows:\nWhen the doctor gave his evidence before the jury he was called as an expert to give his opinion as to the cause of death. Such an opinion is admissible when, but only when, the subject on which the witness is testifying is one upon which competency to form an opinion can only be acquired by a course of special study or experience. It is upon such a subject and such a subject only that the testimony is admissible. In the testimony of the doctor in this case, having described the wound in the neck, he went on to discuss two small cuts on the hand of the deceased, stating that they had been caused by a sharp instrument and could have been caused by the knife.\n\u201cQ. Those cuts on the right hand, on the fingers, did they have any particular significance to you? A. The only thing I can say is to point out that when the hand was put up to the neck the wounds in the fingers were in the same direction as the wound in the neck. Q. And what is your conclusion from that? A. I would say that they could have occurred at the same time. Q. In what manner? A. I should think that the hand was at the base of the neck when the knife was put into the neck.\u201d\nThe latter conclusion was quite incompetent for the doctor to give as an expert because it was merely conjecture and not on a subject requiring any special study or experience. It was a mere guess which anyone might have made. Yet it was given to a body of laymen by a doctor with the weight that ordinarily attaches to an opinion expressed by a professional man, and a doctor in particular.\nThere were references to another piece of evidence which, in my judgment, were very prejudicial to the prisoner. They are the references to the male sperm said to have been found on the underpants Truscott was wearing on the Friday night when he was arrested. Crown Counsel invited the jury to speculate from the dirty appearance of the garment that the undershorts in question were those Truscott had been wearing when he assaulted Lynne. Here is how he put it:\nMy suggestion to you, Gentlemen, is that these are the underwear he was wearing, whether he took them off temporarily or not at the time of the indecent assault on the girl, and he did get this sperm at that time. You are just as capable as I on reasoning that out, and I would be less than fair to you if I said or left you with the impression that you had nothing to go on. I tell you what I think you can go on. You can forget the evidence of bowel movement. You can overlook that when you get the garment out, and you can look at the rest of the underwear, and you can figure, as I suggest to you, that it was worn a long time, and that is about all I can be of assistance to you, in this respect. Forget the fecal matter and just look at the other, and I think you will arrive at the conclusion\u2014I suggest you will arrive at the conclusion he had it on for a good many days, and that you may be able to make the deduction that that is what he was wearing. As I say, whether he had it off temporarily, or not, at the time of the actual attack, and that the sperm is from the attack on the girl.\nIn his charge to the jury, the learned judge said:\nIt is said that the soiled underpants are consistent with innocence. You will recall the underpants that were taken off the boy at the jail were fouled as well as soiled. You need not pay any attention to the fouling. Mr. Brown, who examined them in the laboratory, said that they showed evidence of blood inside and out. Inside and out. There were minute quantities, but particularly around the fly.\nAfter the judge had finished his charge, Crown Counsel, amongst other things, in discussing objections to the charge, said:\nAnd the other thing, My Lord, in your reference to the shorts at the jail, the Crown does attach great significance to the finding of male sperm on those shorts. Your Lordship mentioned blood. Your Lordship did not make reference\u2026\nand on recalling the jury, the learned judge said in part:\nThen, of course, the Crown relies very much on the fact that male sperm was found on the dirty underpants. That is consistent with an act of sexual intercourse, but of course, it is by no means conclusive that it is the result of sexual intercourse at all or sexual intercourse with this girl. It could be the result of other things, you know, but it is a circumstance which is not inconsistent. It is consistent with an attack on this girl.\n(The italics are mine.)\nAll this might have been unobjectionable if there had been evidence upon which the jury could have found that the underpants in question had been those actually worn by Truscott on the evening of June 9th. But there was no evidence to that effect. The point was conceded in the argument before this Court. That being so, the references by Crown Counsel and particularly what the learned judge said were prejudicial in the extreme based as they were on something that was not in evidence at all. Those underpants should never have been marked as an exhibit or shown to the jury. In any event, if reference could have been made to these underpants, then it was incumbent upon the learned judge to put to the jury the defence which had been urged by Truscott\u2019s counsel that the medical evidence established that male sperm had a very short life. That sperm ejected on the Tuesday would have been dead and not identifiable as such long before Friday night in the circumstances of the heat and filthy condition as testified to. This he did not do.\nA great deal of discussion took place regarding the evidence of the children who testified at the trial, some under oath, some not. I do not find any error in this regard. The learned judge exercised the discretion he had and in my view that discretion ought not to be interfered with. He charged the jury correctly that the unsworn testimony had to be corroborated before it could be acted upon. His charge on the subject of corroboration was correct. I must, however, refer specifically to the manner in which he dealt with the evidence of Philip Burns who had not been sworn. In instructing the jury, he referred to this witness and said correctly:\nNow the first is that Philip Burns was, of course, not sworn, and he said he didn\u2019t see Lynne and Steve on the road as he went north, and no one corroborates him in that respect, so that his evidence is worthless so far as you can use it in convicting the accused boy.\nHowever, when the jury was recalled a few minutes later for more instructions, he said concerning this same witness:\nThen you, of course, won\u2019t forget Philip Burns\u2019 evidence that he left the river around between seven to seven-ten or thereabouts, seven-fifteen, and walked up the road and saw nothing of Steve and Lynne as he went up the road. That evidence was given, as I told you before, without Philip Burns being sworn.\nHow can one evaluate the effect on the jury of this contradictory instruction?\nNor was this the only instance of contradictory and confusing instructions. The conflict between the evidence for the Crown on the one hand pointing to Truscott having taken Lynne into the bush by way of the tractor trail and the evidence for the Defence that he had continued northward across the bridge with Lynne on the handlebar of his bicycle was, as stated in the majority opinion, the most vital issue in the case and it was one entirely for the jury. The learned judge in his charge put the issue to the jury as follows:\nNow then, it is the theory of the Defence, and they brought evidence to show that, as I say, this little Douglas Oats saw them going across the bridge and then, in a few minutes, according to the boy by the name of Gordon Logan\u2014Gordon Logan also says he saw them going north on the bridge and in about five minutes he says he saw Steven return alone. Well, as regards Gordon Logan, it will be for you Gentlemen to say whether you believe his evidence, and it is very important, Gentlemen, because if you believe the Defence theory of this matter and believe Steven\u2019s statement to the Police and to other people, that the girl was driven to Number Eight Highway and entered an automobile which went east; it is my view that you must acquit the boy if you believe that story.\nIn other words, I will put it this way. In order to convict this boy, you have to completely reject that story as having no truth in it, as not being true. You have to completely reject that story.\nThe concluding sentence of the first paragraph of the above was clearly misdirection. The second paragraph was a proper charge and put the accused\u2019s case favourably to the jury, but what did it convey to the jury when he equated the error with the correction by introducing the latter with \u201cIn other words\u201d? A judge may state a proposition incorrectly and effectively correct the mistake but he does not do it by equating two divergent propositions.\nAdditionally, real and irreparable harm was done to the accused on this vital issue when the jury, having asked for a redirection as follows:\nFOREMAN OF THE JURY:\nA redirection of evidence, corroborated or otherwise, of Lynne Harper and Steven Truscott being seen together on the bridge on the night of June the 9th.\nthe learned judge, after reviewing the evidence in some detail, said:\nThat is the evidence with respect to him being on the bridge, the two of them being on the bridge together, the only evidence. They were there in the neighbourhood of seven twenty-five or seven-thirty, but as I pointed out to you, you must reject the story that he went to Number Eight and the girl got in a car there, you must reject that story to convict him. If you find that although he went to Number Eight Highway with the girl and he brought her back again\u2014and she was back, somebody brought her back\u2014you will have to find he did bring her back again\u2014then the going back and forth across the bridge is of very little importance\u2014very little importance, because the question is, did he kill her? That is the point in this case. If there is any other help I can give you, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me, Gentlemen, but that is all I can say about it now.\nand still later when the jury was recalled a fourth time:\nHis LORDSHIP:\nBring the Jury back, please.\n\u2026Jury returned.\nHis LORDSHIP:\nI dislike having to bring you back so often and interrupt your deliberations, but I do it only at the request of Counsel.\nI told you when you were last out here, that if Steve brought Lynne back across the bridge, if he brought her back across the bridge, it doesn\u2019t make much difference whether he went over the bridge or not, but there is, of course, no eye witness that says that he did. No eye witness said that Steve and Lynne came back from Number Eight Highway, across the bridge, although there is Allan Oats and Logan who say that they saw Steve on the bridge alone. Logan saying five minutes after he went north he came back alone. Somebody brought her back some time. Somebody brought her back some time.\nThis introduction of the idea or theory that Truscott may in fact have taken Lynne to Number Eight Highway and brought her back to the bush had not the slightest foundation in the evidence or in any inference which could be drawn from the evidence. It came wholly out of thin air. The Crown\u2019s case was that Truscott had not taken Lynne to Number Eight Highway at all.\nThese redirections, particularly in view of the Foreman\u2019s question as quoted above, must on any objective reading of what was said, compel acceptance of the argument that the most vital issue in Truscott\u2019s case was actually withdrawn from the jury\u2019s consideration at this late time in the trial when they were told:\nI told you when you were last out here, that if Steve brought Lynne back across the bridge, if he brought her back across the bridge, it doesn\u2019t make much difference whether he went over the bridge or not, but there is, of course, no eye witness that says that he did.\nand coming as it did after the learned judge had said in his charge:\nNow you see, if the accused boy drove or rode Lynne Harper to Number Eight Highway, then you must ask yourselves who brought her back, because somebody brought her back. Somebody brought her back. Is it possible that the accused brought her back? You will ask yourselves and you will ask yourselves the reason, if this boy is guilty, why he has shown such calmness and apathy. Is it because there is an element of truth in his story that he took her to Number Eight Highway, because somebody brought her back. Did he bring her back, if he took her?\nThe reference to \u2018apathy\u2019 in this passage by the learned judge was purely gratuitous. The word itself or a condition or conduct so describing Truscott does not appear in the evidence. It had been urged that his appearance and conduct were normal. The learned judge wrongly transposed \u2018normal\u2019 into \u2018apathy\u2019. The dictionary definition of \u2018apathy\u2019 is \u2018insensibility to suffering or feeling\u2019. \u2018Apathy\u2019 in relation to the crime in question here was a description highly damaging to the accused.\nAs previously mentioned, it was urged as a defence that Lynne had not been killed where her body was found. I have already expressed my view on this branch of the case. I think the jury was entitled on the evidence before them to find against this contention. But it was a defence open to the accused on the evidence and which had to be left to the jury. Here again, in my view, the learned judge withdrew that defence from the jury when in his charge he said:\nThe Defence theory, what the Defence asks you to believe, is that she was attacked elsewhere and brought back dead. That she was attacked elsewhere, killed some place else. That theory, of course, is contrary to the medical evidence which says she bled at the place where she was found dead. She bled there and she could not have bled there if she were dead. If she was dead there would be no bleeding.\nWhen Truscott returned to the school yard about 8:00 p.m. on June 9th, he was asked by Warren Hatherall, \u201cWhat did you do to Lynne Harper\u2014throw her to the fish\u201d to which he replied, \u201cNo I just let her off at the highway like she asked.\u201d The following morning Lynne\u2019s father came to the Truscott home at 7:30 a.m. to inquire if the Truscott boys had seen Lynne. The older boy Kenneth said \u201cNo\u201d. Then Steven said \u201cYes, I took her to the corner on my bicycle and she hitched a ride on number eight highway\u201d. Later that same morning at 9:30 a.m., Truscott was interviewed by the police and he told the police that he had picked Lynne up outside the school the evening before between seven and seven-thirty; that Lynne told him she may go to see the people in the little white house on the highway and that she had to be home at eight or eight-thirty. He also said that having left Lynne off at number eight highway he cycled back to the bridge and while there looked back and saw her getting into a late model Chevrolet, which had a lot of chrome and could have been a BelAir model. He also said it appeared to have a yellow licence plate. He was interviewed several times in the next few days and told the same story, adding some details as he was questioned more closely.\nThe Crown took the position that Truscott was lying as to his movements after he reached the Lawson bush area on the county road. Accordingly, a great volume of evidence was tendered and received to convince the jury that Truscott was lying and that he had not gone any further north on the county road than the tractor trail at the north limit of Lawson\u2019s bush. No objection can be taken to this procedure because the Crown had the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Truscott had taken Lynne into the bush and there murdered her, in other words, to translate Truscott from the situation that he had had the opportunity to commit the crime into the certainty that he was the only one who could, in the circumstances, have done so.\nIt was for the jury to weigh that evidence. In the evidence so to be weighed was the vital question whether in fact Truscott could have seen and recognized a Chevrolet BelAir car with a yellow licence plate. Truscott insisted to the police that he had. The police evidence at the trial supported by photographs was that licence plates could not be seen from the bridge where Truscott said he was when he said he saw Lynne get into the car. On the evidence which the jury then had, the jury could reasonably have believed that Truscott was lying in saying that he saw a yellow licence plate. However, in referring to this important point, the learned judge confused the statement by Truscott to the police that he had seen a yellow licence plate with the statement made in respect of the old car with Licence No. 981,666. In his charge to the jury dealing with being able to see a car on number eight highway from the bridge, he said:\nThe boy was asked by the Police, naturally, what happened, and he told the Police that he took her down to Number Eight Highway. He repeatedly told the Police that, and she got in a car. The Police took him down to the bridge and he pointed the spot where he was standing on the bridge, and the bridge is thirteen hundred feet south of Number Eight Highway, and they conducted certain experiments there to demonstrate that not only was it not possible, according to the police testimony, to see the numbers on a licence plate, but that you couldn\u2019t distinguish the licence plate at thirteen hundred feet. You heard the officers testify that that couldn\u2019t be seen.\nNow, you have to regard, of course, for the differences in ages and the possibility that a man at age forty has not as good eyesight as a boy aged fourteen. The Crown asks you to say that the story is a fabrication because you couldn\u2019t see the licence plate, much less could you read the numbers at that distance. And if he brought her back, if it was he who brought her back, it doesn\u2019t matter much. It doesn\u2019t matter much\nand later said:\nThe Crown submits the story about going away in a car is a complete falsehood because you couldn\u2019t read the licence plate from the distance that Steve says you could read it,\u2026\nWhen Defence Counsel drew the error to the learned judge\u2019s attention, he recalled the jury and said in part:\nI made an error in telling you that the number Steve gave of the car, was the car on Number Eight Highway. This was a car on the County Road, but it was not the car on Number Eight Highway.\nThat would have corrected the error effectively, but having so corrected the mistake, he continued:\nYou will recall the Police went down and took photographs of the car, took photographs of the road with a car at the end of the road, and a car at Number Eight Highway, and they ask you to find from that and from the evidence of the Police officers, themselves, that it would have been impossible to have seen the licence plate of the car from the bridge and therefore, the story told by the accused is a fabrication.\nneutralizing the correction he had made by inviting the jury to conclude from the photographs and the police evidence that no one could have seen the licence plate at that distance and in consequence Truscott\u2019s story was a fabrication.\nOn the reference in this Court it was shown that a yellow licence plate on an automobile at the intersection of number eight highway could be seen from the bridge if the car was in a certain position at the intersection. The Crown did not attempt to controvert this evidence. I am bound to say that had the evidence given on the reference regarding what could be seen from the bridge and concerning the unreliability of the photographs used by the Crown on this point been before the jury in the first instance, the jury could reasonably have taken an entirely different view of Truscott\u2019s story as put in evidence by the police and of his credibility.\nAt the trial the Defence stressed that Truscott could not have raped and murdered Lynne in the forty-five minute time interval that he was away from the school yard because if he had done so his clothes and person must necessarily have shown evidence of a struggle and he would have been blood stained and his appearance abnormal. The evidence was all one way that on his return to the school yard at about 8:00 p.m. he was normal without any blood on his clothes or on his person and that he chatted with some school mates before continuing on home to babysit as he had been asked to do by his mother. The mother too testified that there was no blood on the clothing and that the boy was normal as usual.\nThe learned judge dealt with this aspect of the defence as follows:\nAt about eight o\u2019clock the accused boy appeared back at the school. Ask yourselves, on this evidence, is there any explanation, on any construction of it, of the whereabouts of the boy between around seven-thirty and the time he appeared back at the school. John Carew saw him around eight o\u2019clock and Lyn Johnson saw him and Lorraine Wood saw him come back and he stopped and talked to his brother, Kenneth. They heard some conversation about the trading of wheels and about the shoes he was wearing. Oddly enough, the older brother, Kenneth, has not appeared in this case. It is pointed out by the Defence, and very properly so, and it is something you must consider, and that is his demeanour when he returned, that he seemed to be natural. William Wilkes, who is age fifteen, who was called by the Defence\u2014bring William Wilkes in, if he is here. He is in grade Nine at the Clinton Collegiate Institute.\nHe says that they sat on the ground for ten or fifteen minutes and he talked to Steve, who appeared perfectly normal, and there were no marks on him or anything of that kind. Lyn Johnson says that he appeared to be normal. Lorraine Woods says he appeared to be normal, but I point out, Gentlemen, there are two sides to that meeting. There was a group of boys and girls playing around in this locality. They were all acquaintances. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t say all. Lyn Johnson and Lorraine Wood were acquaintances of this boy. There was a group of children. Truscott didn\u2019t go over to them. He didn\u2019t go over to them, didn\u2019t spend any time with them. He talked to his brother and that is all, and then he went directly home. He may have been normal, but did he do what you would think a boy of that age would do, meeting his girl friends and boy friends when he came back on to the grounds. He was asked by Warren Hatherall, who had seen him go away, he was asked: \u201cWhat did you do with Harper, feed her to the fishes?\u201d Hatherall wasn\u2019t sure whether he answered or not. He didn\u2019t give an answer that Hatherall could give us, anyway.\nStewart Westey corroborates Hatherall in part in that respect, because he says that when Hatherall asked the question, Truscott said: \u201cI let her off at the highway like she asked.\u201d\nAnd William McKay, he wasn\u2019t sworn, a child age ten, said he saw Steve leave with Lynne and return alone and he asked Steve where Lynne was. Of course, his evidence unsworn testimony, age ten, is corroborated by Westey and by Hatherall. As I pointed out, Truscott didn\u2019t stop and talk to these boys, he went directly home. Miss Johnson and Lorraine Wood were not closer to him than fifteen feet. It is for you to say whether at that hour of the night they were in a good position to observe his demeanour and the looks of his clothes.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe jury who heard this direction could not but be influenced into believing that Truscott somehow kept away from anyone who might have sensed abnormality in his conduct or observed blood on his clothes or person. Any fanreading of the evidence given by those who were in the school yard when Truscott returned at 8.00 o\u2019clock must convince one that Truscott did not keep away from anyone there, but on the contrary acted very normally while staying on the school premises for some ten to fifteen minutes. The reference to \u2018that hour of the night\u2019 would imply that the evidence indicated a condition of poor visibility. It was actually about 8.00 p.m. daylight saving time nearing midJune when according to all the evidence on the point it was still broad daylight. Lyn Johnson, a witness for the Crown, who was, as the learned judge says, not closer than fifteen feet (she said about twenty-five feet) was able to describe how Truscott was dressed. She said in answer to Crown Counsel:\nQ. How was Steven dressed?\nA. He had a red pair of jeans on and a whitish shirt and brown canvas boots with thick rubber soles, and red socks.\nA trial judge has the right to express his own opinion or opinions in the course of his charge to the jury, but he has the duty to put the defence of the accused fairly to the jury. This he did not do on this branch of the case.\nFor all of these reasons, as stated at the beginning, I would quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nBecause I take the position that there should be a new trial, I have refrained from commenting on many aspects of the evidence such as the evidence of Jocelyne Goddette for the prosecution and that of Gordon Logan for the accused and that of many other witnesses and factors, the weight and value of which will be for the new jury if there is one. However, it should, I think, be said that if Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s evidence is accepted as sworn to by her it was about 6.30 p.m. and not at 7.30 p.m. that she was along the county road and the tractor trail looking for Truscott. In this connection the majority opinion says, \u201cThere is some- thing very wrong with Jocelyne Goddette\u2019s times\u201d. She could be mistaken as to the time but it must cast doubt on her testimony that Truscott came to the Goddette home at about ten minutes to six. The interval between the two events was very short. That Truscott went to the Goddette residence shortly before six was an important and integral part of the Crown case. Jocelyne Goddette was the Crowds key witness in disproof of Truscott\u2019s story that he had taken Lynne further north than the tractor trail.\nIn several places throughout the majority opinion the point is made that as to such and such evidence or ruling or absence of ruling no objection was taken at the trial by Defence Counsel\nI could cite a score of decisions of this Court which say categorically that failure of counsel to object to the admissibility of certain evidence or to a trial judge\u2019s rulings in the course of the trial or to his charge to the jury, is not an answer to the objection or objections when advanced even for the first time in this Court. There are situations when the failure to object in the first instance will preclude counsel from being allowed to change his position, instances exist where the failure to object was intentional or not exercised and held in reserve to be raised on appeal and so on. In all of these, of course, the Court frowns upon the objection being raised for the first time on appeal. No such situation exists here. The consequences of Defence Counsel\u2019s failure to object at the trial do not fall upon counsel, but upon the client, in this case a 14\u00bd year old boy on trial for his life.\nI appreciate that after nearly eight years many difficulties will be met with if a new trial is held both on the part of the Crown and on the part of the accused, but these difficulties are relatively insignificant when compared to Truscott\u2019s fundamental right to be tried according to law.\nSolicitors for S.M.

Looking down, she observed that the floor was wet and she looked further into the room and noted that there were pieces of apple on the floor which had been crushed as if stepped on. The teacher did not then enter the room but went to the principal\u2019s office and informed a secretary of what she described as the \u201cmess\u201d in the room. The secretary informed her that a caretaker would be sent to clean it up. The teacher returned to the class room and just before classes began a caretaker came into the room and asked her what was wrong. The teacher told him to \u201clook at the mess on the floor\u201d, and the caretaker, although he did nothing in the teacher\u2019s presence before leaving the room, said he would clean it up. The bell then rang and the teacher proceeded to another room.\nThe plaintiff, who was taking the first class after the lunch hour break in the room in question and who entered the class room just ahead of her students, noticed one piece of apple on the floor and put it to one side by the blackboard. She noticed nothing else unusual in the room and proceeded with her teaching duties. There was, however, a small piece of apple near one of the front desks which was observed by one of the students just before the plaintiff stepped on it and fell.\nIn an action for damages for the injuries she sustained as a result of the accident, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was dismissed by the trial judge and his judgment was affirmed, on appeal, by a majority of the Court of Appeal. A further appeal was then brought to this Court. From the evidence an inference was drawn by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that the caretaker, prior to the plaintiff\u2019s entry into the room, had returned to clean up the debris. The question raised was whether the failure of the caretaker to have removed the small morsel of apple from the floor constituted negligence giving rise to liability on the part of the defendant School Division.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The plaintiff had failed to discharge the burden of proving that at the time of the accident the class room was in an unsafe and dangerous condition and that the defendant through its officers or employees knew or ought to have known of such a condition. To place a common law duty upon the defendant of ensuring that every morsel of apple was cleaned from every floor of the class rooms used by pupils during the lunch hour was too strict an interpretation of the duty owed by an employer to its employees. Per Spence J., dissenting: The defendant, through notice of the secretary to the principal, had knowledge of the lack of safety. The caretaker attending in the class room as a result of such notice was not informed that certain specific pieces of debris lay on the floor but was told to observe the debris that was there, did so and undertook to clean up that debris as was his duty. He failed to carry out his duty and a piece of apple was left lying there so that the plaintiff slipped and fell.\n[Naismith v.

Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nH.G.H. Smith, Q.C., and Leon Mitchell, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC. Gordon Dilts and R.S. Cook, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1 (Freedman J.A. dissenting) affirming the judgment rendered at trial by Tritschler C.J.Q.B., whereby he dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim for damages arising out of an accident which occurred on January 9, 1962, when the appellant, who had been a school teacher for twelve years and was at the time employed by the defendant School Division, slipped on a small piece of apple which was on the floor of class room 21 at the Grant Park School in the City of Winnipeg.\nOn the day of the accident, Margaret McRitchie, who was a substitute teacher of only one year\u2019s experience and who appears to have been in charge of the class room in question, returned to \u201cher room\u201d after lunch and slipped as she entered the door. Her evidence in this regard reads as follows:\nI didn\u2019t fall but my foot slipped a bit, and when I looked down it was wet, and I looked further into the room and I noticed there was apple on the floor\u2014pieces of apple, and pieces that had been crushed as if they had been stepped on, and I didn\u2019t go into the room at all. I just turned right around and went into the next room, which is Mrs. Joyce Cartwright\u2019s room, and she was there and I told her I found a mess on the floor in my room, and I was going to report it to the office and she thought I had better do that.\n(The italics are my own.)\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I went to the office right away.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And I reported it to one of the secretaries there.\nQ. What did you say to the secretary as near as you can remember?\nA. Well, I told her there was a mess on the floor in my room, and she said she would send one of the caretakers down to clean it up.\nQ. What happened?\nA. I went back to my room and just before classes began the caretaker\u2014one of the caretakers came into the room and he asked me what was wrong, and I told him to look at the mess on the floor, and he said he would clean it up.\nQ. Was this before classes started in the afternoon?\nA. Yes, it was before classes started. I can\u2019t remember whether it was before the bell rang or whether it was after the bell rang, but I think it was before the bell rang.\nQ. You spoke to the caretaker and he said he would clean it up?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did he do anything in your presence?\nA. No, he didn\u2019t do a thing. He just left.\nQ. And then the bell rang and what did you do?\nA. Well, I had to go into the typing room to teach\u2026\nThe appellant, who was taking the first class after the lunch hour break in room 21 and who entered the class room just ahead of her students, noticed one piece of apple on the floor and put it to one side by the blackboard but she says: \u201cThere was nothing else that was there that I saw.\u201d It is a fair inference from the evidence, and one which was drawn by the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, that \u201cthe caretaker had returned and had attended to the mess which Mrs. McRitchie had brought to his attention\u201d. There was, however, one small piece of apple about an inch in diameter near one of the front desks which was observed by one of the students just before the appellant slipped on it and the question raised by this appeal is whether the failure of the caretaker to have removed this small morsel of apple from the floor constituted negligence giving rise to liability on the part of the respondent School Division.\nIt was the practice at the Grant Park School for certain of the class rooms to be used as lunch rooms for the students who had brought their lunch and the arrangement in this regard was that the students themselves \u201cwere not to leave crumbs or papers or anything remaining from their lunch on the desks or on the floor\u201d. They were asked to put it in the waste basket during the lunch hour and the caretaking staff was required to go into these lunch rooms after the lunch period and before class reconvened in order to empty the waste paper baskets and if there was anything in the vicinity of the waste baskets to pick it up. The rooms were swept by the caretaking staff after the close of school at night and before opening in the morning.\nThe appellant had been a teacher at Grant Park School for three years and must be taken to have been aware of the system that was followed in this regard and it is a factor to be considered, although not a conclusive one, that there was no evidence of any other accident having occurred as a result of the condition of the class rooms after the lunch period.\nIn the course of the dissenting opinion rendered by Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal, he referred to the cases of Naismith v. London Film Productions Ltd[2] and Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co. Ltd. v. English[3], as recognizing the existence of a duty resting upon employers to make the place of employment as safe as the exercise of reasonable skill and care will permit. It is pointed out that in both these cases the Courts were dealing with conditions of dangerous employment. In the Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co. case a haulage plant was put in motion in a mine underground at a time when an employee was in an exposed position where he was caught by a rake and crushed. In the Naismith case a film \u201cextra\u201d whom the employer had provided with inflammable material which covered her costume, was seriously burned. In both cases a high duty was found to rest upon the employer to ensure the safety of the employees concerned. It is to be observed that Viscount Simonds in Davie v. New Merton Board Mills Ltd.[4], at p. 620, after referring to the case of Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co. Ltd. v. English, supra, went on to say:\nMy Lords, I would begin, as did Parker L.J., with a reference to the familiar words of Lord Hershchell in Smith v. Charles Baker & Sons in which he describes the duty of a master at common law as \u2018the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk\u2019, words that are important both in prescribing the positive obligation and in negativing by implication anything higher. The content of the duty at common law, thus described by Lord Hershchell, must vary according to the circumstances of each case. Its measure remains the same: it is to take reasonable care, and the subject-matter may be such that the taking of reasonable care may fall little short of absolute obligation.\nThe case of a man working underground under conditions of potential danger and the case of an actor clothed by an employer in inflammable material are cases in which the subject\u2011matter was found to have created a duty falling little short of absolute obligation but no such conditions, in my opinion, apply in the present circumstances and I am satisfied that the duty owed by the respondent to the appellant in the present case is that which was concisely stated by Sir Lyman Duff in Regal Oil & Refining Co. Ltd. et al. v. Campbell[5], at p. 312, where he said:\nBy the common law, an employer is under an obligation arising out of the relation of master and servant to take reasonable care to see that the plant and property used in the business in which the servant is employed is safe. That is well settled and well known law. It is equally well settled that he does not warrant the safety of such plant and property.\nI do not think that the appellant in the present case has discharged the burden which she assumed by her pleadings, of proving that at the time of the accident:\n\u2026class room 21 was in an unsafe and dangerous condition in that parts of the floor thereof were strewn with slippery substances and the Defendant, through its officers and employees knew or ought to have known of the said dangerous and unsafe condition of the said floor of which the Plaintiff was ignorant.\nThere is no doubt that the appellant\u2019s unfortunate accident occurred in the course of her employment and if this case were covered by The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 297, she could no doubt recover compensation, but to place a common law duty upon the respondent School Division of ensuring that every morsel of apple was cleaned from every floor of the class rooms used by pupils during the lunch hour is, in my opinion, too strict an interpretation of the duty which an employer owes to its employees and with the greatest respect for the view expressed by Mr. Justice Freedman, I do not think that such an interpretation is justified by the decided cases.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Ritchie. I shall adopt his statement of facts although for the purpose of these reasons I shall have to extend them. I regret I am unable to concur in my learned brother\u2019s conclusion.\nAs Freedman J.A. pointed out in his dissenting reasons in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, in the absence of direct testimony as to how and when the piece of apple came upon the floor, the Court is left with the task of resolving the matter on the basis of inference, and the determination of the issue is made less complex by reason of the fact that there is substantially no contradiction of testimony. Therefore, the issue of credibility does not arise.\nFirstly, in reference to whether the general cleaning had been carried out after 1:00 p.m. on the day of the accident in accordance with the practice outlined by Ritchie J., the learned trial judge, Tritschler C.J.Q.B., found:\nI am satisfied that in the course of the system prevailing, room No. 21 had, after lunch, received the usual treatment of removal of the contents of the wastebasket, at which time the caretaker would have picked up any loose debris near the basket;\nI cannot be satisfied that this is a proper inference from the evidence. The only factual evidence on the subject was given by Harold Sly, who was the head janitor of the Grant Park School at the time in question. He, as did the principal Mr. R.W. Welwood, described the system but, in my view, he could not give any evidence as to whether that system had been complied with as to room 21 on the day of the accident. It is true that in answer to the question:\nQ. Do you know whether or not room 21 was cleaned at the noon hour on January 19th, 1962; do you know that?\nhe replied:\nA. That is a large question. Yes, it was cleaned. To my knowledge, it was cleaned. But it should be rioted that in answer to the following question:\nQ. You did not actually clean it yourself?\nSly replied:\nA. Not that I know. That is a long time ago.\nAnd in cross-examination, the witness described the procedure in answer to the question:\nQ. You don\u2019t know if one of them did not do what he was supposed to do?\nas follows:\nI don\u2019t think that was the case because we went down the halls, you know, like a gang, and I took this side and you took that side and so on, and I don\u2019t think there was anything missed.\nAnd in answer to the question:\nQ. Do you remember whether you saw room 21 or not?\nhe answered:\nA. No, I don\u2019t remember if I saw room 21.\nIn fact, in examination-in-chief, Sly had testified that he only knew the plaintiff slipped in one of the rooms two or three weeks after the accident occurred.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the head janitor\u2019s evidence was simply that the system called for he and the other janitors walking down the hall and one after the other entering the class rooms, removing the wastepaper baskets and picking up anything that happened to be lying nearby, and that he has no memory whatsoever of the date of January 21st; no memory that he was ever in room 21 and no positive knowledge that any fellow janitor was in room 21.\nIt should be pointed out that according to the report made by the principal of the school to the Superintendent of the School Division dated February 8, 1962, and produced at trial and marked as ex. 7, the principal had knowledge that the accident occurred about five minutes before the end of the first period in the afternoon of January 19th. In his evidence, Mr. Welwood testified that his assistant, Mr. Lee, was called by the plaintiff and informed of the accident and at that time Mr. Lee reported to Mr. Welwood that it was approximately five minutes before the end of the first period. Therefore, Mr. Welwood had on the very day of the accident full information of the time the accident occurred and his letter (ex. 7) describes that accident as one which occurred when the plaintiff:\nSlipped on a small piece of potato chip which had been left after someone\u2019s lunch on the floor of room 21.\nTherefore, he not only knew the exact time and date of the accident but that it had been ascribed to the result of a part of lunch left on the floor. It matters not whether that part were a potato chip or a piece of apple. He was able to investigate at once whether the wastebasket had been collected and that the floor had been cleaned in the fashion which the system required at between 1:15 and 1:30 p.m., and the defendant should have been able to adduce exact evidence upon that subject at the trial. Such evidence was not called. Therefore, were it necessary to make a finding of fact upon the evidence which I have outlined, I would have inferred that this general clean-up had skipped room 21 that day. I can see no other explanation for the general mess of apples which Mrs. McRitchie saw when she went to enter the room.\nIt is not necessary, however, to make any finding in reference to that general clean-up.\nMrs. McRitchie was a substitute teacher who had in charge room 21 as her \u201chome room\u201d, and she testified that after she left the staff room to return to room 21 \u201cto assemble classes\u201d she was just about to enter the said room 21 when her foot slipped. Looking down, she observed that the floor was wet and she looked further into the room and noted that there were pieces of apple on the floor which had been crushed as if stepped on. Mrs. McRitchie did not then enter the room but went to the principal\u2019s office and informed a secretary of what she described as the \u201cmess\u201d in the room. The secretary informed her that a caretaker would be sent down to clean it up. Mrs. McRitchie then returned to room 21 and just before the classes began, i.e., just before 1:30 p.m., a caretaker came into the room and asked her what was wrong. Mrs. McRitchie told him to \u201clook at the mess on the floor\u201d, and the janitor said he could clean it up.\nMrs. McRitchie\u2019s memory was that that was just before the bell rang. The caretaker said that he would clean up the mess but he did nothing in Mrs. McRitchie\u2019s presence\u2014\u201che just left\u201d, and then when the bell rang, Mrs. McRitchie left room 21 to cross the corridor to another room and commence her teaching duties.\nThe plaintiff was in her own home room, room 24, and her home room class was in that room. At the commencement of the first class, she left room 24 and entered room 21 followed by the members of the class who occupied her own home room to whom she was to deliver a lesson in room 21. Room 24, her home room, was a typewriting room and full of typewriters, and it was used frequently for typing classes. The plaintiff\u2019s students followed her into the room. As the plaintiff entered the room she noticed a piece of apple on the floor, and with her foot she pushed the apple over to one side close to the blackboard so that it would not be stepped on by either her or others. She saw nothing else unusual in the room and proceeded with her teaching duties until almost at the end of the class. After she had been going up and down the aisles checking the students\u2019 work she commenced to walk from the aisle closest to the window to her desk at the front of the room. She stepped on a piece of apple which was lying evidently opposite the end of the aisle closest to the window and about three feet in front of the front desk. That piece of apple had been observed by no one until just the moment the plaintiff\u2019s foot descended on it when the pupil sitting at the front desk, Susan Kathryn Read, happened to look down and see it, unfortunately too late to warn the teacher. The resulting fall caused the plaintiff the injuries for which she seeks damages in this action.\nTritschler C.J.Q.B. held that under these circumstances the plaintiff had not discharged the onus upon her which she must discharge in order to succeed against the defendant School Division. The inference he drew from the evidence which has been outlined in greater detail by my brother Ritchie and which I have very shortly summarized was that this piece of apple on which the plaintiff slipped was either deposited on the floor in the school room after the janitor, following Mrs. McRitchie\u2019s notice to him, had attended and cleaned up \u201cthe mess\u201d which was then present, or, still later, during the time when the plaintiff was carrying out her teaching duties in the room. I am of the opinion that the evidence cannot support either such inference.\nIn the first place, there is not one word of evidence to show that any pupil was present in that room from the moment when Mrs. McRitchie first went to enter it and then retired going to complain as to \u201cthe mess\u201d, and the moment when the plaintiff entered followed by her pupils. One would believe that it would be very unlikely to have carried on the examination and cross-examination of Mrs. McRitchie without making reference to the presence of pupils if pupils were present. I am of the opinion that the inference from the evidence is exactly opposite, i.e., that Mrs. McRitchie went to enter an empty room, found the debris on the floor, went to complain to the secretary in the principal\u2019s office, returned to an empty room, pointed out the debris to the janitor when he arrived, and then left that empty room at 1:30 to carry on her teaching duties. The very short lapse of time would seem to make any rowdiness in which apples could be thrown during that period impossible. Mrs. McRitchie is not sure whether the janitor arrived in answer to her complaint before or after the bell rang at 1:30 p.m. If it was before, it must have been only moments before. Mrs. McRitchie did not leave the room until the bell rang. The plaintiff entered the room to teach a class for that first period commencing at 1:30 p.m. and there must have been only a very few moments between Mrs. McRitchie\u2019s departure and the plaintiff\u2019s arrival, so that there simply was no time for the spread of this debris to occur even if there were some evidence that there were pupils who were able to do so.\nI am further of the opinion that the second or alternative inference drawn by Tritschler C.J.Q.B. also is not feasible. That inference would imply that during the time the plaintiff was teaching the class the pupils were tossing apples or an apple or a piece of apple around the class room. It should be noted that the plaintiff was the regular teacher of this class. She had been a teacher for twelve years and she had been a teacher in that school for three years. This was no raw recruit teaching the class and the class would realize full well that any such conduct when their regular teacher was in charge would result in immediate and severe disci- pline. Moreover, the girl in front of whose desk the piece of apple was lying gave evidence and no question was addressed to her in examination or cross-examination to even infer that the piece of apple could have landed in the position in which it lay at the time of the accident during the course of the class.\nI am, on the other hand, of the opinion that the only possible inference from all of the evidence is as follows: The janitor having had the debris pointed out to him by Mrs. McRitchie departed to obtain his cleaning equipment returning when Mrs. McRitchie had left the room and in the few brief moments or even seconds prior the plaintiff\u2019s entry attempted to clean up the debris in a rough and ready fashion. One could understand that he would not wish to delay the commencement of the first class but, of course, it being his duty to remove what was quite evidently a source of danger he should have done so even if it had meant the delaying of the commencement of the class for a few moments. That such a piece of apple on the floor was dangerous was demonstrated by the fact that Mrs. McRitchie slipped without injury to herself as she was about to enter the room and later the plaintiff slipped on another such piece of apple and suffered serious injury.\nIf the proper inference is the one which I have just outlined then I think the liability of the defendant is clear.\nI adopt Ritchie J.\u2019s quotation from Regal Oil Refining Co. Ltd. et al. v. Campbell[6], a decision of this Court in which the duty of the master as to the servant was set out as \u201cto take reasonable care and to see that the plant and the property used in the business in which the servant is employed is safe. That is well settled and well known law. It is equally well settled that he does not warrant the safety of such plant and property.\u201d\nWe are not here concerned with a situation where without the master\u2019s knowledge the plant became unsafe nor with the question of whether or not the master should have known of the lack of safety. Here, the master, through the notice of the secretary to the principal, had knowledge of the lack of safety. The caretaker attending Mrs. McRitchie as a result of such notice was not informed that certain specific pieces of debris lay on the floor but was told to observe the debris that was there, did so and undertook to clean up that debris as was his duty. He failed to carry out his duty and a piece of apple, not hidden but in the open part of the room, was left lying there so that the plaintiff slipped and fell. It might easily be true that that piece of apple, if it fell close to the windows, would be in more of a shadow than if it had landed closer to the front of the room, but it was the duty of the caretaker to look for pieces of debris despite the fact that they might have been in the more shaded part caused by the light from the windows.\nFreedman J.A., in his dissenting judgment for the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, dealt also with a paragraph from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, which he quoted and which I shall quote:\nFrom the time she entered the room plaintiff was the only means defendant had for learning about the condition of the room. She was the eyes of defendant School Division. What she saw she judged reasonably safe. I agree with her judgment. Even if the second piece of apple had been on the floor when the caretaker was there (and there is not evidence to support this) he was not negligent in failing, during the short time he was in the room, to see what was not apparent to plaintiff herself during her comparatively long stay in the room. I do not find fault with her failure to see it; nor would I fault the caretaker.\nI am in complete agreement with Freedman J.A. when he differs with the view there expressed. On the particular facts in this case, the eyes of the employer were the eyes of that janitor who was called in to the room, had the debris pointed out to him, and undertook to clean up the debris.\nI am of the opinion, as was indeed the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench and all the members of the Court of Appeal, that no contributory negligence can be charged against the plaintiff.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and give judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $15,000 general damages, special damages as agreed, and costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Mitchell, Green & Minuk, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Thompson, Dilts & Co., Winnipeg.\n[1] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 193.\n[2] [1939] 1 All E.R. 794.\n[3] [1937] 3 All E.R. 628.\n[4] [1959] A.C. 604.\n[5] [1936] S.C.R. 309.\n[6] [1936] S.C.R. 309.\n",

The plaintiffs noted the pleadings closed and applied for a praecipe for entry for trial for the assessment of damages. The plaintiffs\u2019 solicitor served notice of such entry personally upon the defendant. When the matter came up for trial, the defendant neither appeared nor was represented by counsel, and the Court proceeded under those circumstances to hear the action. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of $25,000 to both plaintiffs. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division and a further appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer curiam: In Alberta, upon default in defence the defendant is to be taken to have admitted the facts set out in the statement of claim. Accordingly, the plaintiffs were not required to prove publication of the alleged libel. Sulef v. Parkin and Breno (1966), 57 W.W.R. 236, followed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: Defamation of a professional man is a very serious matter and ordinarily would be visited with an award of substantial damages, including punitive or exemplary damages if the circumstances so warrant. However, in the circumstances of this particular case, the award of $25,000 to each of the plaintiffs was so inordinately large as to be a wholly erroneous estimate. It was obvious that the plaintiff was temperamentally unstable and that he was given to making unreasoned and extravagant statements about the plaintiffs. No reasonable businessman would be likely to be affected in his dealings with the plaintiffs by the defendant\u2019s statements and as reasonable businessmen constituted the most important source of potential clientele for both the plaintiffs, their exclusion from the persons likely to be affected by the alleged libels was a factor which should have been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance negating an award of punitive or exemplary damages. Per Spence J., dissenting: This Court is justified in interfering with an award if it is of the opinion that the damages are so large that it must be considered that the trial judge applied a wrong principle of law, or that the verdict is a wholly erroneous estimate. As to the only question of principle which appeared in the reasons of the trial judge, if that judge did include amounts for exemplary and punitive damages in the awards of the two plaintiffs he was entitled in law to do so and there appeared to be sound reason for awarding such damages. As to whether the verdict was a wholly erroneous estimate, under the circumstances the award was not so inordinately high that it represented an altogether erroneous estimate of the damages which the plaintiffs had suffered.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.\nR.J. Gibbs, for the defendant, appellant.\nW.A. McGillivray, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Spence that publication of the libel sued on was admitted when no defence was filed on behalf of the defendant and also that exs. 3, 4 and 7 were properly received when tendered in aggravation of damages.\nThe real question in this appeal is whether the award of $25,000 to each of the respondents was so inordinately large as to be a wholly erroneous estimate in the circumstances of this particular case. I think it was. I would not, in any way, underestimate or discount the damage that can be done to a lawyer or to an insurance executive by false allegations of misconduct and dishonesty. Defamation of a professional man is a very serious matter and ordinarily would be visited with an award of substantial damages, including punitive or exemplary damages if the circumstances so warrant.\nIn the present case it is obvious that the appellant was temperamentally unstable and that he was given to making unreasoned and extravagant statements about the respondents. The learned trial judge made it apparent that he was aware of this instability and exs. 3, 4 and 7 are themselves additional proof of it. My brother Spence has indicated his opinion \u201cthat the ordinary hard-headed businessman might be little affected by these statements from someone he knew to be of unstable character\u201d. I would be more inclined to say that no reasonable businessman would be likely to be affected in his dealings with the respondents by statements coming from the source which they did in this case, and as I feel that reasonable businessmen constitute the most important source of potential clientele for both the respondents, I think that their exclusion from the persons likely to be affected by the alleged libels is a factor which should have been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance negating an award of punitive or exemplary damages.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the trial division for an assessment of damages having regard to the foregoing. The appellant should have such costs in this Court as are taxable in a forma pauperis appeal and his costs in the Appellate Division.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which, by a judgment dated June 2, 1965, dismissed without reasons an appeal from the judgment of Milvain J. made on May 11, 1964. In the latter judgment, Milvain J. awarded damages in the amount of $25,000 to both respondents.\nThe action was one for libel alleged by the plaintiffs to have been uttered in a letter dated January 21, 1964, and in a document entitled \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d which accompanied the said letter.\nThe defendant, the present appellant, filed no statement of defence. The plaintiffs noted the pleadings closed and applied for a praecipe for entry for trial for the assessment of damages. The plaintiffs\u2019 solicitor served notice of such entry for trial personally upon the defendant. When the matter came up for trial, the defendant neither appeared nor was represented by counsel, and the Court proceeded under those circumstances to hear the action.\nCounsel for the appellant took the position in this Court that according to the practice in the Supreme Court of Alberta, such a default of defence by a defendant did not amount to an admission of the allegations of fact made in the statement of claim. However, counsel for the respondents has cited Sulef v. Parkin and Breno[1], where the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, per Smith C.J.A., at p. 239, held that in the Province of Alberta upon default in defence the defendant is to be taken to have admitted the facts set out in the statement of claim. This is a decision of the highest Court in Alberta on a point of practice in the province, and this Court will not interfere under such circumstances. Therefore, the respondents, as plaintiffs at trial, were not required to prove publication of the alleged libel. This Court does not deem it necessary to determine whether publication was admitted in other correspondence of the defendant produced at trial.\nCounsel for the appellant also objected to the admission of exs. 3, 4 and 7, and to the reception of the evidence of one Alexander Sandy Chibree. Counsel for the appellant took the position that no publication had been proved of exs. 3, 4 and 7.\nExhibit 3 was a letter addressed to the solicitors for the plaintiffs dated February 17, 1964. The statement of claim by which the action was commenced was issued on February 10, 1964. In evidence, the plaintiff David Cowper-Smith identified the signature of the defendant to such letter and also to the letter (ex. 4) which was addressed to the Honourable Premier E.C. Manning and dated February 28, 1964, and to ex. 7, another document, which was entitled \u201cTo whom it may concern as an Assembly of Christian Believers\u201d and dated May 5, 1964. These documents were produced at trial, not to prove the libel or the publication thereof, as they were all committed after the issuance of the statement of claim, but to prove the state of mind of the defendant in uttering the libel on January 21, 1964, and his motive in doing so.\nGatley on Libel and Slander, in the fifth edition, at p. 556, says:\nOther defamatory words. The plaintiff may urge in aggravation of damages that the defendant has published other defamatory words about him not set out on the record, whether such words were or were not connected with the subject-matter of the action, whether they were prior or subsequent to such publication, or writ issued, and whether they are actionable or not. The authority cited for such proposition is Pearson v. Lemaitre[2], in the Court of Common Pleas, where Tindal C.J. said at pp. 719-20:\nAnd this appears to us to be the correct rule, viz. that either party may, with a view to the damages, give evidence to prove or disprove the existence of a malicious motive in the mind of the publisher of defamatory matter; but that, if the evidence given for that purpose, establishes another cause of action, the jury should be cautioned against giving any damages in respect of it.\nI see no reason in principle why the publication of these subsequent defamatory words need be proved. In fact, they would be admissible if they were merely spoken to the plaintiff after the writ had been issued and had not been heard by any other person. They are not admissible for the purpose of proving the libel but in aggravation of damages. I am of the opinion, therefore, that these three exhibits were admissible apart from whatever evidence of publication may be obtained from the record, upon which I need not express any opinion.\nThe witness Alexander Sandy Chibree gave evidence that in the late fall of 1964, i.e., after the statement of claim had been issued, he had been invited to a meeting at which were present the defendant Hector McElroy, his brother Morton McElroy, and other persons. The witness gave it as his opinion that the meeting was called to gather evidence, if possible, that would have helped the McElroys, and particularly Hector McElroy the appellant, to regain certain farm property, such relief being claimed in an action against the plaintiffs and others. Chibree, in his evidence, said:\nI was rather astounded in that the meeting was opened up by a remark by Mr. Morton McElroy that they would make sure\u2014they would take action against the men of Melba Ranches which would cause them no longer to be able to do business in this city or make it difficult for them to live within this City and beyond that, of course, there was various discussions that followed.\nOn the evidence of Chibree, this statement by Morton McElroy took place in the appellant Hector McElroy\u2019s presence, and there was no dissent from him at all. The witness continued:\nIn fact, there was several statements followed that where the two\u2014Hector and Morton, signified that they had always worked as a team and that they would continue to do so in the future. The statement made by Morton McElroy would certainly have been admitted in evidence had it been made by Hector McElroy. Again, this evidence goes to show his motive in uttering the libels which are the subject of the evidence. Although the statements were not made by the appellant but by his brother, they were made at a meeting called for the purpose of helping the appellant in his action for recovery of possession of the farm property.\nPhipson on Evidence, in the eighth edition, at p. 240, gives the principle in these words:\nStatements made in the presence and hearing of a party, and documents in his possession, or to which he has access, are evidence against him of the truth of the matters stated, if by his answers, conduct, or silence he has acquiesced in their contents.\nAnd at p. 241, the author states:\nSo, a party\u2019s silence will render statements made in his presence (or hearing only) evidence against him of their truth, provided he is reasonably called on to reply thereto: Wiedemann v. Walpole [1891] 2 Q.B. 534 at 539, and Richards v. Gellatly, L.R. 7 C.P. 127 at 131.\nCertainly the appellant Hector McElroy was called upon to dissent from such a statement made by his brother at a meeting called for the purpose of assisting the appellant in his action for possession. If he did not agree with the statement, his failure to dissent is, therefore, in my view, admissible with the statement to which he gave his assent by silence, again to explain the motive of the appellant in uttering the alleged libel.\nCounsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge permitted counsel for the respondents to give evidence although, of course, not sworn, and cites this statement by the said counsel:\nMr. McGillivray: But, unfortunately\u2026if you had an opportunity of seeing this gentleman in the witness box your Lordship might well see that he is not so insane at all. This is just planned and deliberate and calculated to try and drive these people out of this lawsuit, which is our statement which, of course, makes this a very, very vicious thing. (The word \u201cstatement\u201d is probably a misprint for \u201csubmission\u201d.)\nI am in agreement with counsel for the respondent that that statement was not the giving of evidence by counsel but was argument and was argument particularly in view of the testimony of Chibree which was supported by the evidence adduced. One of the main contentions made by the appellant is that the learned trial judge in making his award of damages included in his award an allowance for punitive or exemplary damages and that such damages are not allowed in a libel action. Counsel cites Rookes v. Barnard[3], a decision of the House of Lords.\nBefore considering that decision, it is important to consider the actual words in which the learned trial judge expressed himself. Giving judgment at the close of the argument Milvain J., in the opening paragraph, said:\nI have no hesitation on the evidence before me in reaching the conclusion that the defamation in this instance is of the nature and proportions that justify a Court in awarding heavy damages in which there is involved an element of punitive damages.\nThen he continued:\nIn my view Courts should take a very serious view of defamation that affects the character of men in professional life and of men in walks of life where they occupy a position of trust as does a lawyer and as does the manager of an insurance company. There is nothing more valuable to members of the human race than their reputation and a vile and deliberate attack on reputation that is designed as is the case before me to reach other ends through ulterior purposes, that in my view makes the action all the worse.\nIn the first part of the second paragraph which I have quoted above, the learned trial judge was emphasizing the serious nature of the libel to the persons libelled and not dealing with the punitive element.\nIn Paffard v. Cavotti[4], the Appellate Division (as it was then known) of the Supreme Court of Ontario considered a case where the trial judge had estimated the actual damages which naturally flowed from the defendant\u2019s wrong doing, deliberate and flagrant trespass by cutting down trees and depositing sand and silt on the plaintiff\u2019s lands, at $3,500 and then, taking into account the defendant\u2019s whole course of conduct and persistence in the wrong doing, fixed the total damages under the circumstances at $4,500. Masten J. said at p. 176:\nMr. Cartwright\u2019s argument in the present case is that the trial judge was entirely unwarranted in law in his finding that $1,000 should be added to the $3,500 on account of the arrogant and improper conduct of the defendant towards this plaintiff.\nIn my opinion, every intendment is to be made in favour of this judgment. No valid objection could be made to the judgment if the Judge had simply said in his reasons that, taking all the facts into consideration, he fixed the damages at $4,500. The circumstance that the trial Judge, in giving his reasons, thought aloud and expressed in words his method of arriving at the $4,500 cannot in my opinion prejudice the validity of the resulting judgment.\nSo in this case, certainly if the trial judge had confined himself to a recital of the seriousness of the damages to the persons libelled then, in my view, the use of the one word \u201cpunitive\u201d would not have been sufficient reason to vary the quantum of the damages. The learned trial judge, however, continued with reference to \u201c\u2026a vile and deliberate attack on reputation that is designed as is the case before me to reach other ends through ulterior purposes\u2026\u201d and I am ready, therefore, to consider this a case in which the trial judge did award punitive damages.\nIf the law in effect in Alberta is that set forth in the judgment of Lord Devlin in Rookes v. Barnard, then he at p. 410 outlined the two cases where an award of punitive damages in a tort action would be justified. The first category is the oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the government. That category is not applicable in the present case. Dealing with the second class, Lord Devlin continued:\nCases in the second category are those in which the defendant\u2019s conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff. \u2026This category is not confined to moneymaking in the strict sense. It extends to cases in which the defendant is seeking to gain at the expense of the plaintiff some object,\u2014perhaps some property which he covets,\u2014which either he could not obtain at all or not obtain except at a price greater than he wants to put down.\nIn the present case, the evidence given by Chibree, as I have said, tends to show that the purpose of the appellant in uttering these libels, which are the basis of the action, was to affect the respondent\u2019s defence to the appellant\u2019s action for possession of the farm land. In short, it was a case \u201cin which the defendant is seeking to gain at the expense of the plaintiff some object\u2014some property\u2026\u201d and even if the award of punitive damages in tort actions is as limited as outlined by Lord Devlin then the present case would fall within the second class which he sets out.\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that in Canada the jurisdiction to award punitive damages in tort actions is not so limited as Lord Devlin outlined in Rookes v. Barnard. In Knott v. Telegram Printing Co.[5], this Court was considering an appeal in an action for libel. Anglin J., giving judgment for himself and the Chief Justice, said at p. 341:\nThe damages are large and were, no doubt, awarded upon a punitive or exemplary rather than on a purely compensatory basis. It was, however, within the province of the jury so to deal with this case.\nDavies J., although of the opinion that the damages were so excessive that a new trial was required, said at p. 336:\nI have not failed in reaching this conclusion to consider all the facts and circumstances in this case which would justify exemplary damages being given\u2026\nAnd Duff J., although he also would have directed a new trial, said at p. 339:\nIt is emphatically a case for the exercise of the punitive jurisdiction with which the primary tribunal is endowed in cases of defamation.\nIn Ontario, in two cases in recent years, exemplary damages for trespass have been allowed without evidence that the trespasser intended any profit for himself but only on the basis that he was acting in a high-handed fashion with open disregard for the plaintiffs\u2019 rights: Carr\u2011Harris v. Schacter and Seaton[6] and Pretu et al. v. Donald Tidey Co. Ltd.[7] In the latter case, an appeal from the decision of Brooke J. was dismissed without written reasons and an application for leave to appeal to this Court was also dismissed. It is worthy of note that the latter application was made after the decision of the House of Lords in Rookes v. Barnard had been reported.\nI am, therefore, of the view that if the trial judge did include amounts for exemplary and punitive damages in the awards in favour of the two plaintiffs then he was entitled in law to do so.\nThe problem still remains whether the damages are so excessive that this Court should direct a new trial on the question of damages. The awards were in the sum of $25,000 in favour of each plaintiff which were the exact amounts claimed in the statement of claim. It is certainly not a valid ground for interfering with an award of damages in such an action that none of the members of this Court, had they been sitting at the trial, would have al- lowed such a sum: Youssoupoff v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Ltd.[8]; Knott v. Telegram Printing Co., supra, at p. 341.\nIf, however, this Court is of the opinion that the damages are so large that it must be considered that the trial judge applied a wrong principle of law, or that the verdict is a wholly erroneous estimate, the Court is justified in interfering.\nI have dealt with the only question of principle which appeared in the reasons of the learned trial judge.\nI turn now to whether the award was so inordinately large as to be a wholly erroneous estimate.\nThe plaintiff Cowper-Smith was a solicitor practising in Calgary in a small firm. He had no partner but retained one junior solicitor. The plaintiff Woodman was the manager, in Calgary, of the Excelsior Life Insurance Company. The libels alleged and, in my view, proved were:\nMy charge, made by my lawyer\u2026is to the effect that these men have committed an act (or acts) whereby they are legally charged with conspiracy to defraud.\nIn an examination by a psychiatrist to determine why I would trust these men, I would ask my Elders if men of Gideons, namely Mr. Jespersen and Woodman, who used our pulpit and who claimed to love the same Lord and Saviour as I do, cannot be trusted\u2026\nIt was brought to my attention that at a recent meeting of the Gideons, Mr. Cowper\u2011Smith was present, and one of the Gideons rebuked a member for allowing Mr. Cowper-Smith to attend, knowing this individual\u2019s Christian testimony left much to be desired\u2026\nI have been informed by Mr. Claude Cameron, a member of the local Alliance Church, who was very disturbed by their lack of Christian ethics in their business dealings, through personal experience, that one of their speakers at their C.B.M.C. campaign in the fall of 1962, left the city prematurely because he discovered the reputation of one or two of these men. Rev. Smith, you have mentioned to me your feelings regarding the spiritual deficiency of C.B.M.C. here in Calgary.\nAs well in the document enclosed with that letter there was set out in some detail an alleged transaction between the plaintiff Cowper-Smith and the defendant in which it was said that he agreed to make certain charges for carrying out a transfer of property and then attempted to deduct more from the proceeds of the sale which he had improperly directed should be paid to himself. I am in agreement with the view expressed by the learned trial judge that these are very serious accusations to make against men who are in the position of trust of solicitor and local manager of an insurance company. It is true that the evidence reveals that the appellant was, to put it quite conservatively, of a somewhat fanatical view in matters with reference to religion and it is true that the ordinary hard-headed businessman might be little affected by these statements coming from someone he knew to be of an unstable character. The letter, however, purported to be addressed to a Rev. Herman L.G. Smith, District Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene, and copies were directed to the Rev. Harold Griffin of the North Hill Church of the Nazarene, the Rev. Charles Muxworthy, First Church of the Nazarene, and to all organizations mentioned in the letter. The latter organizations included the Pastor\u2019s Gospel Fellowship, the Gideons, C.B.M.C. (said to be Christian Business Men\u2019s Club), the Youth for Christ, and the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. Those persons and those organizations were those who knew well both the appellant and the respondents. The respondent Cowper\u2011Smith could expect people such as these as being those with whom he dealt either as clients or for clients. Those persons and the members of those organizations could well be amongst those whom the respondent Woodman would wish to solicit as policyholders in the company which he represented. There is nothing to indicate that the damages which they would suffer would be lessened by any recognition of the extreme religious beliefs of the appellant. The persons to whom he addressed the libels might well be persons with similar extreme religious beliefs.\nIn Ley v. Hamilton[9], Lord Atkin said at p. 386:\nIt is precisely because the \u201creal\u201d damage cannot be ascertained and established that the damages are at large. It is impossible to track the scandal, to know what quarters the poison may reach: it is impossible to weigh at all closely the compensation which will recompense a man or a woman for the insult offered or the pain of a false accusation\u2026\nIt is, of course, well nigh impossible to give any evidence of either special damages or evidence which will allow an exact calculation of general damages. The plaintiff Cowper\u2011Smith was very moderate in dealing with this matter in his evidence. I quote a few questions of such evidence:\nQ. Now, first of all, Mr. Cowper-Smith, can you tell his lordship whether\u2014of what effect that you are aware of as to the publication of the matters alleged in the statement of claim, what effect that has had on you if you have any knowledge?\nA. Well, I only have one or two concrete examples of business lost because of it and that has come to me sort of as a chain event. Aside from that it received such wide publication amongst the people that I associated with that it was extremely embarrassing and when you met someone you didn\u2019t sort of feel like being friendly because you didn\u2019t know what they had heard.\nQ. You did mention something about you have a couple of instances of business loss, would you give\u2014\nA. Well, these are\u2014there is one in particular small but I got the details on it just recently, this McElroy\u2014this, as I say, it is sort of a chain event, it is semi-hearsay\u2014\nQ. Well, if it was\u2014\nA. Yes, I know it has affected business but it is impossible to say how much.\nIt is interesting to note that the plaintiff Woodman actually belonged to the Alliance Church and the Gideons International, two of the organizations which received copies of the libel.\nUnder these circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot say that the award was so inordinately high that it represented an altogether erroneous estimate of the damages which the plaintiffs have suffered, even apart from the jurisdiction to award punitive damages which, as I have said, I believe the trial Court did possess.\nAs to the latter, there would seem to be sound reason for awarding punitive damages. Firstly, there is the evidence as to the purpose which the defendant had in uttering the libels, and secondly, exs. 3, 4 and 7, which demonstrated that after the action had been commenced the defendant continued to utter defamatory statements and if anything increased the venemous nature thereof.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Prothroe, Gibbs, McCruden and Hilland, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan and Fraser, Calgary.\n[1] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 236.\n[2] (1843), 5 Man. & G. 700.\n[3] [1964] 1 All E.R. 367.\n[4] (1928), 63 O.L.R. 171.\n[5] (1917), 55 S.C.R. 631, [1917] 3 W.W.R. 335.\n[6] [1956] O.R. 994.\n[7] (1966), 55 D.L.R.

To conform with the appellant\u2019s agency arrangements, the deal was put through in the name of an intermediary as vendor although the latter had no actual part or interest in the transaction. The deal was made directly with the appellant by its local truck and fleet sales manager. A finance company financed the purchase and subsequently sued the respondent on the contract and recovered judgment. In that action the respondent joined the appellant as a defendant by way of counterclaim, alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages.\nBoth the trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that the appellant had warranted that the trucks \u201cwould be satisfactory for hauling gravel\u201d. The trial judge found that although the respondent experienced difficulty with the trucks, the evidence did not establish that the trouble was due to defects in the trucks except as to one item for which he awarded the respondent damages in the sum of $1,500.\nThe Appellate Division reversed the trial judge as to two of the trucks and awarded the respondent damages in the sum of $23,177.52 being the price paid by the respondent for these two trucks. On appeal to this Court, the appellant argued that the onus was on the respondent to prove his damages as being the difference between the purchase price and the actual value of the trucks he got, there being some evidence that the two trucks in question, although unfit for the purposes for which they were purchased, had some merchantable value, and the appellant contended that it was incumbent on the respondent to establish that value in order to determine the amount of damages to which he was entitled.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the holding by the Court of Appeal that there was a complete failure of the trucks in respect of the fulfilment of the warranty that they \u201cwould be satisfactory for hauling gravel\u201d. The Court also agreed that the onus was on the appellant to establish the value, if any, remaining in the two trucks and that it had failed to do so. Massey Harris Co. Ltd. v. Skelding, [1934] S.C.R. 431, applied. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Manning J. Appeal dismissed.\nD.O. Sabey and C.D. O\u2019Brien, for the appellant.\nD.H. Bowen, Q.C., and D.J. Horne, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The facts relative to this appeal are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of Johnson J.A. for the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1. To summarize, the respondent purchased three new Ford T850 Tandem Trucks manufactured by the appellant and in storage at Edmonton for a total of $39,566.87. To conform with the appellant\u2019s agency arrangements, the deal was put through in the name of Universal Garage as vendor although Universal Garage had no actual part or interest in the transaction. The deal was made directly with the appellant company by Mervyn Charles Noltie, its truck and fleet sales manager at Edmonton. The purchase was financed through Traders Finance Corporation Limited whose finance charge was $5,568.13, making the total payable by the respondent the sum of $45,135. Traders Finance subsequently sued the respondent on this contract and recovered judgment against him for $48,944.29 on July 10, 1962. In that action the respondent joined the appellant as a defendant by way of counterclaim, alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages in the sum of $21,000 and other relief. The trucks were purchased to haul gravel on the Cold Lake Airport construction job.\nBoth the learned trial judge and Johnson J.A. in the Appellate Division found that the appellant had warranted that the trucks \u201cwould be satisfactory for hauling gravel\u201d. The learned trial judge found that although the respondent experienced difficulty with the trucks, the evidence did not establish that the trouble was due to defects in the trucks except as to one item for which he awarded the respondent damages in the sum of $1,500. The Appellate Division, after a full review of the evidence, reversed the learned trial judge as to two of the trucks and awarded the respondent damages in the sum of, $23,177.52 being the price paid by the respondent for the red and green trucks. I am satisfied that on the evidence which was not dependent on findings of credibility, the Appellate Division was fully justified in drawing inferences and arriving at conclusions differing from those arrived at by the learned trial judge.\nThere is now no dispute as to the warranty. The substantial question is as to the quantum of damages to be awarded the respondent. The Appellate Division, following the decision of this Court in Massey Harris Co. Ltd. v. Skelding[2], said:\nThe onus being on the respondent to establish the value, if any, remaining in these two trucks, and having failed to establish this, the damage that the appellant is entitled to recover is the purchase price to the appellant of the red and green trucks. These trucks no doubt earned money for the appellant; there is no evidence as to how much this was. Having regard to the amount of repairs paid by the appellant, the money lost while these trucks were laid up due to breakdowns, and the trouble and expense that the appellant was put to because of them, it is doubtful if the net earnings exceeded the amount of the losses. If the onus is on the respondent to establish any value remaining in the trucks, it should follow that the onus was also upon the respondent to show that the trucks\u2019 earnings were greater than the loss caused by the numerous breakdowns. No such evidence was adduced.\nThe appeal is allowed and the amount of the damages is increased to the amount of the price paid for the red and green trucks. The appellant is entitled to his costs on the appropriate scale both here and in the Court below.\nThe appellant contends that the Appellate Division erred in awarding the full purchase price as damages and argues that the onus was on the respondent to prove his damages as being the difference between the purchase price and the actual value of the trucks he got, there being some evidence that the two trucks in question, although unfit for the purposes for which they were purchased, had some merchantable value, and the appellant contends that it was incumbent on the respondent to establish that value in order to determine the amount of the damages to which he was entitled.\nThis same argument was made in the Massey Harris v. Skelding case relied on by the Appellate Division. Duff C.J., in delivering judgment for the Court, said:\nWe cannot accept this view. Having regard to the nature of the warranties and the complete failure of the tractor in respect of the fulfilment of the warranties, which the evidence, accepted by the learned trial judge, discloses, we think that, prima facie, the loss incurred by the respondent amounted to the full purchase price; and that it was incumbent upon the appellants to adduce evidence in support of their contention that the damages so measured should be reduced by reason of the possession of the tractor of some merchantable value.\nWe cannot agree with the interpretation by the Appellate Division of the decision in this Court in Nolan v. Emerson-Brantingham Implement Co., [1921] 2 W.W.R. 416; 60 Can. S.C.R. 662. There the trial judge held that in respect of the tractors (model \u201cL\u201d) which he found had no value for the purposes for which they were bought, and had also no merchantable value, no diminution of damages could be allowed. A critical examination of the judgments shews that a majority of this Court accepted the view that on this ground the learned trial judge was right in assessing the damages in respect of these tractors at the amounts paid for them. This was really the basis of the decision in this Court.\nWas there in the instant case the complete failure of the trucks in respect of the fulfilment of the warranty that the trucks \u201cwould be satisfactory for hauling gravel\u201d? The Appellate Division held that there was this complete failure and that the onus was on the appellant to establish the value, if any, remaining in these two trucks and that it had failed to do so.\nMr. William Alton Reid, parts and service manager at Maclin Motors, a Ford dealership in Calgary where most of the repairs were made while the respondent was using the trucks in question and who knew the trucks, testified for the appellant. He told of the trucks being repaired in May 1960 and held by Maclin Motors pending payment of the repair bill for some 15 to 17 months, and that some months later he went to Olds where he saw the trucks and at that time they \u201cwere completely run down\u201d. There was no other evidence as to the value of the trucks then or at any other time. The onus in this regard was on the appellant; Massey Harris v. Skelding, supra. It is to be noted that the counterclaim against the appellant was commenced on October 5, 1960, which was while the trucks were being held by Maclin Motors.\nThe respondent did do considerable hauling with the two trucks and as to having made some profit therefrom he says all the moneys he received were paid on the conditional sales contract as shown in the statement of claim. The amount there credited is $6,636.80. In addition it was shown by a summary of exhibits in the appellant\u2019s factum that the respondent expended $2,206.69 on repairs to the red truck and $1,540.43 on the green truck while in the same period the appellant company paid $1,851.86 for repairs to the red truck and $1,170.83 on the green truck.\nThe appellant argued that these repairs were necessitated principally by the fact that the trucks were overloaded. In this connection it is significant that when Noltie was selling the trucks to the respondent he was told by the respondent that \u201cwe were mainly interested in tandem trucks, that we, that had the capacity of hauling twelve yards of gravel or sand and that they were going off highway, dusty off highway conditions\u201d and it was following this that Noltie gave the warranty found by the learned trial judge. The conditional sales contract shows that the trucks were to be used on the Cold Lake Airport job and to work 20 hours a day.\nThe learned trial judge in his judgment said, referring to the difficulties the respondent was having with the trucks:\nSubject to the exception I will deal with below, I do not think that there is evidence that establishes that the trouble was due to defects in the trucks; more likely the trouble was due to improper use of the trucks; as, for example, setting the governor of at least one of the trucks at 2,750 revolutions per minute which was too low a speed for this motor and would cause a good deal of \u201clugging\u201d in the motor and thereby put an undue strain upon it.\nJohnson J.A. for the Appellate Division deals with this statement as follows:\nWith the exception which I will later refer to, there is no direct evidence that the two trucks, the red and the green, were abused or improperly handled by the crews who operated them. The evidence is all to the contrary. All the appellant\u2019s trucks were operated along with Bilida\u2019s under Bilida\u2019s foreman Nelson. He supervised the maintenance of these trucks as well as the ones owned by his employer and his evidence is that the Ford trucks were maintained in the same manner as were the International trucks which required only normal repairs. Several of the operators were called and gave evidence. Subject to the exception which I have already mentioned, there is nothing to indicate that these trucks were abused or improperly handled.\nThe exception to which I have referred is the evidence of a driver of the green truck who said that in the three to three and a half months that he drove this truck after the Cold Lake job had finished, the governor was set so as to permit not more than 2,750 r.p.m.\u2019s. I think it is not unfair to say that most of the evidence of the defence tending to show that these trucks were improperly operated was built upon this statement,\u2014the assumption being that not only this truck but the other trucks were operated in a similar manner. Bearing in mind the evidence of several witnesses that the vibration on these trucks was so great that the tachometer which measures the revolutions per minute was frequently out-of-order, this evidence should, I think, have been examined more carefully than it was. But when the evidence of the witness Sharp is considered, this evidence becomes incredible. Mr. Sharp, a highly trained motor expert and an employee of the respondent at the time trouble was experienced with these trucks, examined by the Court, said:\n\u201cQ. As I understand it you feel that the proper revolutions per minute, proper number of revolutions per minute at which this motor should be driven is 3,400 to 3,600?\nA. To be driven it would be 3,400 r.p.m.\nQ. When it was driven?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And if it should have been driven at around 2,750 you have doubt as to whether the motor would run at all?\nA. Not that the motor would run at all, however if the governor was set at 2,750 r.p.m. I don\u2019t believe you would have any power, in fact I know you would not have enough power to get that load moving, or any load moving.\u201d\nAssuming that there is some probative value in the statement that this motor was driven at 2,750 r.p.m.\u2019s, there is no evidence that any other motor was driven at this low rate or that this motor was driven at a similar r.p.m. at any other time. As I have said, failure of the transmission of these trucks was attributed to this cause even when, as in the case I have previously referred to, the respondent\u2019s Service Adjustment Claim showed the cause to be a faulty pump shaft.\nConsiderable evidence was led to show the effect that overloading these trucks would have on the motor and transmission. The evidence of what proper loading would be is not too satisfactory. If these trucks were overloaded, the fact remains that they were supposed to be equal to or better than the International trucks that the appellant had considered buying. Bifida operated similar International trucks alongside the appellant\u2019s trucks and carried similar loads without difficulty or trouble.\nElgin Ewing, a former mechanic of the respondent and a witness for the company at the trial, in an undated letter to the appellant but written when the Edmonton Airport work was being done, said:\n\u201cI stopped at the Nisku project and picked up duplicate figures on your load weights which were completely in accordance with good truck operation.\u201d\nAt the trial he explained that he misinterpreted the information he had received but there can be no doubt that at the time he considered the appellant was not being treated fairly by the respondent.\nThe evidence fully supports this statement.\nThe appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chambers, Saucier, Jones, Peacock, Black, Gain & Stratton, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Duncan, Bowen, Craig, Smith, Brosseau and Home, Edmonton.\n[1] (1966), 57 D.L.R.

The plaintiff had applied for the policies in Cuba and in his applications he agreed, inter alia, that the policies should take effect upon delivery. The offers in the applications were irrevocable and the plaintiff specifically agreed to accept the policies if any when they were issued. The applications were addressed to the head office of the company at Toronto and were prepared at that office, where the policies were also prepared. The policies, although written in Spanish, were in the standard Ontario form. Their cash surrender value was payable in American dollars and it was required that the request for such payment be made in writing to the head office.\nThe plaintiff later became a resident of the United States and in 1961 he applied for payment of the cash surrender value of his policies. Payment of the cash surrender value in dollars to a person resident in the United States was an offence contrary to the Foreign Exchange Contraband Law of Cuba, unless permission was given by the National Bank of Cuba. The question at issue was whether the proper law of the insurance contracts was the law of Ontario or the law of Cuba. The claim was allowed by the trial judge and an appeal by the defendant was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, one member of the Court dissenting. The defendant, with leave, further appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe contracts were made when the initial irrevocable offers contained in the plaintiff\u2019s applications were accepted by the mailing of the policies from the defendant\u2019s head office in Toronto. The fact that the parties agreed that the policies were not to become effective until certain conditions were fulfilled in Cuba did not alter the place where that agreement was made. However, the place where the contract was made was not decisive in determining the proper law of a contract. That problem was to be solved by considering the contract as a whole in light of all the circumstances which surrounded it and applying the law with which it appeared to have the closest and most substantial connection.\nWhile it was doubtful as to whether the proper law of a contract of life insurance is necessarily the country in which the head office of the insurer is situated, in the present case it was significant that the actual decision to \u201cgo on the risk\u201d was made at the head office in Toronto and could not have been made in Havana.\nThe fact that both the applications and the policies were prepared in. Ontario in a common, standard form which complied with the law of that Province, was of preponderating importance in determining the law governing the contracts. It was a reasonable inference that a person applying for insurance on a form prepared at the head office of an Ontario company would anticipate that the policies would be governed by the law of Ontario. Furthermore, the form of the policies which were issued in the present case evidenced the fact that the insurer intended to be governed by that law.\nNorth American Life Assurance Co. v.

Appeal dismissed.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and B.A. Kelsey, for the defendant, appellant.\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and G. Langille, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], (Porter C.J., dissenting) dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Stewart whereby he awarded the respondent the sum of $8,744.22, being the equivalent in Canadian currency of the cash surrender value, payable in American dollars, of two policies of insurance on the life of the respondent which were issued through the appellant\u2019s branch office in Havana, Cuba, in 1942 and 1947 at a time when the respondent was resident and domiciled in that country.\nThe sole question at issue in this appeal is whether the proper law of the contracts of life insurance is the law of Ontario or the law of Cuba. In this regard the parties are agreed that if the proper law of the contracts is found to be that of Ontario, the respondent is entitled to succeed, but that if the law of Cuba applies, unless permission has been granted by the National Bank of Cuba, the payment of the cash surrender value in dollars to a person resident in the United States, as the respondent is and was in September 1961 when he surrendered the policies, would be an offence contrary to the Foreign Exchange Contraband Law of Cuba.\nThe circumstances giving rise to this litigation have been thoroughly reviewed in the Courts below and they are not in dispute, but a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the essential facts is, in my opinion, necessary to any intelligible discussion of the law applicable thereto.\nThe two policies here in question were in identical terms and they were both written in Spanish, which is the language of Cuba, for delivery by the appellant\u2019s Cuban agent to the respondent who was then a Cuban national and who had made application for the policies in Cuba pursuant to an application form by which he agreed, inter alia:\nThat any policy granted pursuant hereto shall take effect only upon its delivery and upon payment of the first premium thereon in full, to be vouched for by the Company\u2019s printed official receipt duly countersigned and provided that upon such delivery and payment there shall have been no material change in my health or insurability since the completion of part 2 of my application.\nThe respondent\u2019s offers as contained in his applications for these policies were by their terms irrevocable and he specifically agreed to accept the policies if any when they were issued. Before delivery the policies were duly authenticated before a Notary in accordance with the law of Cuba.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant, on the basis of these facts, that the contracts were made in Cuba and are governed by the law of that country.\nOn the other hand, it is pointed out by the respondent that the applications were addressed to \u201cThe Imperial Life Assurance Company of Canada, Head Office, Toronto, Canada\u201d and were prepared at that office, where the policies were also prepared and that, although these policies were written in Spanish, they were drawn in the common, standard form as used in the Province of Ontario and in conformity with the laws of that Province. These policies stipulated that they could not be varied except by writing thereon signed at the head office of the company by two of its executive officers and that any interlineations, additions or alterations had to be attested by two of the said officers. It is also to be noted that all payments under the policies, whether to or by the company, were required to be made \u201cby bank draft drawn on New York payable in legal currency of the United States of America\u201d and although it is true that many of the premiums were paid in pesos in Cuba, I think it to be apparent that at the time when the contracts were made it was contemplated that the cash surrender value would be payable in American dollars and it is made clear in the policies themselves that the request for such payment was required to be made in writing to the head office of the company at Toronto.\nIt is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the determination of the proper law applicable to these contracts is governed by the fact that they were made in Cuba, but I am by no means satisfied that they were so made. I am, on the other hand, of opinion that the time of the making of the contracts was when the initial irrevocable offers contained in the respondent\u2019s applications were accepted by the mailing of the policies from the appellant\u2019s head office in Toronto. (See North American Life Assurance Co. v. Elson[2], per Davies J. at p. 392 and Milinkovich v. Canadian Mercantile Insurance Co.[3], per Fauteux J. at pp. 835 and 836).\nThe respondent\u2019s applications by their terms provided that they were not to be effective until fulfilment of certain conditions which I have set out above and which are almost identical with those required of all contracts of life insurance in Ontario unless the application otherwise expressly provides to the contrary. This appears from the provisions of s. 139(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 256, which reads as follows:\n139. (1) Unless the contract or the application otherwise expressly provides, the contract shall not take effect or be binding on either party until the policy is delivered to the insured, his assign, or agent, or the beneficiary named therein and payment of the first premium is made to the insurer or its duly authorized agent, no change having taken place in the insurability of the life about to be insured subsequent to the completion of the application. The policies here in question both contain the following provision:\nThis policy and the applications herefor, a copy of which is attached hereto, taken together shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.\nIt is thus apparent that although the policies did not become effective until the conditions above referred to were fulfilled, which in fact occurred in Cuba, these conditions were themselves a part of \u201cthe entire contract between the parties\u201d which in my opinion was concluded when the policies were mailed in Toronto. The fact that the parties agreed that the policies were not to become effective until conditions were fulfilled in Cuba did not alter the place where that agreement was made. It has long been recognized that when contracts are to be concluded by post the place of mailing the acceptance is to be treated as the place where the contract was made. As was said by Thesiger L.J. in Household Fire & Carriage Accident Insurance Company v. Grant[4]:\n...as soon as the letter of acceptance is delivered to the post office, the contract is made as complete and final and absolutely binding as if the acceptor had put his letter into the hands of a messenger sent by the offerer himself as his agent to deliver the offer and receive the acceptance.\nIn the course of his dissenting reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice of Ontario advanced the view that because the policies themselves contained certain restrictive provisions relating to war and air travel which were not mentioned in the applications, it followed that the contracts were not concluded by the mailing of these policies. This ground was not relied on by the appellant and with the greatest respect I do not think that under the circumstances the additions to the policies to which the learned Chief Justice refers have the effect of changing the place where the contract was made from the place of acceptance to that of delivery.\nI am, however, in agreement with Mr. Justice MacKay who observed in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal that:\nThe place where the contract was made is not by any means decisive in determining the question of what law is applicable to the contract. It now appears to have been accepted by the highest Courts in England that the problem of determining the proper law of a contract is to be solved by considering the contract as a whole in light of all the circumstances which surround it and applying the law with which it appears to have the closest and most substantial connection.\nThis test was adopted by the Privy Council in Bonython v. Commonwealth of Australia[5], where Lord Simonds said at p. 219:\n...the substance of the obligation must be determined by the proper law of the contract, i.e., the system of law by reference to which the contract was made or that with which the transaction had its closest and most real connexion.\nThis approach to the problem was restated in the House of Lords in Tomkinson v. First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Co.[6], per Lord Denning at p. 1068 and Lord Morris of Borth\u2011y-Gest at p. 1081.\nThe many factors which have been taken into consideration in various decided cases in determining the proper law to be applied, are described in the following passage from Cheshire on Private International Law, 7th ed., p. 190:\nThe court must take into account, for instance, the following matters: the domicil and even the residence of the parties; the national character of a corporation and the place where its principal place of business is situated; the place where the contract is made and the place where it is to be performed; the style in which the contract is drafted, as, for instance, whether the language is appropriate to one system of law, but inappropriate to another; the fact that a certain stipulation is valid under one law but void under another; the economic connexion of the contract with some other transaction; the nature of the subject matter or its situs; the head office of an insurance company, whose activities range over many countries; and, in short, any other fact which serves to localize the contract.\nIn referring to the location of the \u201chead office of an insurance company whose activities range over many countries\u201d as a factor to be taken into account in determining the proper law of a life insurance contract, the learned author cites as his authority the cases of Pick v. Manufacturers\u2019 Life Insurance Company[7] and Rossano v. Manufacturers\u2019 Life Insurance Company[8], both of which have been extensively reviewed in the Courts below, but he expresses doubts, which I share, as to whether they afford justification for the general proposition that the proper law of a contract of life insurance is necessarily the country in which the head office of the insurer is situated.\nIn the present case, however, in my view, the significance of the location of the head office of the appellant company is underscored by the fact that the evidence makes it quite plain that the actual decision to \u201cgo on the risk\u201d was made there and could not have been made in Havana. In this regard, in the course of his cross-examination, the appellant\u2019s general manager gave the following answers:\nQ. We are clear that when the application was made in Havana it was a head office decision whether it could go on the risk?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And that decision could not be made in Havana?\nA. No.\nWhile it is clear that all relevant circumstances surrounding the making of a contract are to be given due weight in determining the locality with which it is most closely associated, I am of opinion that in the present case the fact that both the applications and the policies were prepared in Ontario in a common, standard form which complied with the law of that Province, is to be regarded as of preponderating importance in determining the law governing the contracts.\nI think it to be a reasonable inference that a person applying for insurance on a form prepared at the head office of an Ontario company would anticipate that the policies which he was to receive would be governed by the law of that Province, and I think that the form of the policies which were issued in the present case evidences the fact that the insurer intended to be governed by that law.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those which have been so fully stated in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice MacKay, I am of opinion that the proper law of these contracts is the law of Ontario.\nIt would not be proper to leave this matter without making reference to the alternative argument advanced by Mr. Sedgwick on behalf of the respondent which was based on the case of Varas v. Crown Life Insurance Company (Superior Court of Pennsylvania, October term 1964) and which was to the effect that even if other parts of the policy were governed by Cuban law the option to take the cash surrender value of the policy was an irrevocable offer which was accepted in Ontario and that, treating this phase of the contract separately, it was to be regarded as governed by the law of that Province. It is true that the Varas case affords some authority for this proposition, but it appears to me that there is nothing in the circumstances of the present case to support the unprecedented proposition that the proper law of a continuing contract can shift from time to time. The proper law of these contracts is to be determined as of the date when they were made.\nMr. Sedgwick also advanced the argument that as the appellant has always admitted the validity of the contract and its liability thereunder and the sole question at issue is whether the law of Ontario or the law of Cuba applies, the appellant should not have appealed from the judgment of Stewart J. and he points out that no appeal was taken from the judgments at trial in the cases of Pick and Rossano, supra. In this regard, Mr. Sedgwick submitted that a judgment of the Court of Appeal or of this Court is of no more protection to the insurance company in the Republic of Cuba than the judgment of Mr. Justice Stewart and he contended that once the latter judgment was rendered, the lis, in so far as the insurance company was concerned, disappeared. This argument appears to me to disregard the realities of the situation. The finding that the law of Ontario applies might well result in steps being taken by the Cuban authorities which would be prejudicial to the appellant and I think that it had a very real interest in pursuing the matter. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the appellant clearly had a right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court.\nIn view of all the above, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Payton, Biggs & Graham, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Haines & Thomson, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 553, 54 D.L.R.

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1967: May 18; 1967: June 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContracts\u2014Construction\u2014Option agreement patently ambiguous\u2014Two time periods provided within which option could be exercised\u2014Whether acceptance within time limited in agreement.\nOn January 24, 1964, the defendant signed a document granting an option on certain property in Prince George, B.C. The document was prepared by one S on behalf of an undisclosed principal. The option read in part: \u201cThe term of the option is to be for 176 days from the date hereof expiring at the hour of 11:59 P.M. on the 24 day of July 1964\u201d\nS purported to exercise the option on July 23, 1964, by mailing an acceptance to the defendant. The following day, July 24th, a deed was presented to the defendant for signature. He refused to sign the deed. S assigned his rights to the plaintiffs who brought action for specific performance and for damages. The trial judge ordered specific performance but made no award of damages. The defendant took an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which Court, by a majority judgment, dismissed the appeal and upheld the order for specific performance. On appeal to this Court, the only ground advanced was that the option was not accepted within the time limited in the option agreement.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe reasoning of the majority in the Court of Appeal was adopted. The ambiguity in the option agreement was patent since it provided two time periods within which the option could be exercised. Taking 176 days as the term of the option the time for acceptance would have expired on July 19, 1964. But the contract fixed the exact minute, hour and day that the period of 176 days, and therefore the option, was to end. That circumstance dominated the clause and controlled its meaning. The erroneous description of the term as one of 176 days must therefore be rejected as being inconsistent with the declared intention.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Branca J. Appeal dismissed.\nJohn Laxton, for the defendant, appellant.\nG.A. Armstrong, for the plaintiffs, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014On January 24, 1964, the appellant signed a document granting an option on certain property in Prince George, British Columbia. The document was prepared by one Dudley Sawley on behalf of an undisclosed principal. Sawley purported to exercise the option on July 23, 1964, by mailing an acceptance to the appellant. The following day, July 24th, a deed was presented to the appellant for signature. He refused to sign the deed. His reasons for refusing to complete on that date were:\n(i) That the sale price was too low;\n(ii) That title deeds to the lands were in the possession of his bank;\n(iii) That he may have difficulty relocating the buildings;\n(iv) That he did not have sufficient time in which to give notice to his tenants;\n(v) That he objected to certain alterations made on the document, viz. \u201c20,000 net to the Vendor\u201d which he had refused to initial and therefore thought it would vitiate the option.\nSawley assigned his rights to the respondents who brought action for specific performance and for damages.\nThe appellant defended the action on a number of grounds, including the following:\n13. In answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim herein the Defendant says that on or about January 24th, 1964, one Dudley Sawley representing the Plaintiff, Sawley Agency Ltd., called upon the Defendant and requested him to employ the said Plaintiff as agent to list and sell the Defendant\u2019s property situate at the South East corner of the intersection of 7th Avenue and Brunswick Street in the City of Prince George, Province of British Columbia, and secured the Defendant\u2019s signature to a document which the said Dudley Sawley represented to the Defendant to be an agreement to list the said property for sale. The Defendant further says that if his signature was obtained by the Plaintiff, Sawley Agency Ltd., to any other document in relation to the said lands then it was obtained fraudulently.\n14. Alternatively and in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim herein the Defendant says if he signed the agreement in writing referred to in Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim herein, he did so upon the fraudulent misrepresentation by the said Dudley Sawley on behalf of the Defendant, Sawley Agency Ltd., that the said document was an agreement to list the property described therein with the said Sawley Agency Ltd. for sale as agent on the Defendant\u2019s behalf.\n15. Alternatively and in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim herein the Defendant says that if he signed the alleged agreement of January 24th, 1964, which is not admitted but specifically denied, the said agreement at the time of signature was not in the same condition as it now is and that additions were made to the said agreement after his signature thereto and without his knowledge or consent.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Branca in the Supreme Court of British Columbia who, in a judgment dated August 23, 1965, dealt with these defences as follows:\nIn reference to the plea of non est factum, I do not consider this allegation to be made out at all. I accept Sawley\u2019s evidence as to what occurred at the initial meeting when exhibit 1 was signed. I find Sawley to be perfectly trustworthy and that he did as stated read over the option word for word to Ginter and that there were no additions or alterations to the document after Ginter had signed, except as stated by Sawley. Wherever Sawley\u2019s evidence is in conflict with that given by Ginter, I without hesitation accept the evidence given by Sawley in preference to and reject the evidence given by Ginter.\nI consequently find that there was a complete and full understanding of the contents of exhibit 1 on the part of Ginter when he signed the same.\nI also reject the plea that Ginter thought the document exhibit 1 was a listing and, on the contrary, I find that Ginter was fully aware of the contents of exhibit 1, that he knew it was an option and that he knew of all the terms therein set forth and their true meaning and effect before he signed the document.\nI find against the allegation that the plaintiff Sawley concealed from the defendant Ginter the fact that he was acting for another person or persons and, on the contrary, I find it clear that Sawley did tell Ginter that he was acting for an undisclosed principal whom he was not at liberty to disclose and also that he, Sawley, could not disclose to Ginter what the property was wanted for.\nHe concluded by ordering specific performance but made no award of damages. The appellant took an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which Court, by a majority judgment, dismissed the appeal and upheld the order for specific performance. In the Court of Appeal Norris J.A. dissented.\nThe only ground now advanced is that the option was not accepted within the time limited in the option agreement. In this regard the option ex. 1 read:\n2. The term of the option is to be for 176 days from the date hereof expiring at the hour of 11:59 P.M. on the 24 day of July 1964. As stated, Sawley purported to exercise the option to purchase on July 23, 1964. The real difficulty is that if 176 days is taken as the term of the option the time for acceptance would have expired on July 19, 1964, and on that basis Sawley\u2019s acceptance on July 23rd was not in time. The respondents contend that the option continued in force until 11:59 P.M. July 24, 1964.\nThe ambiguity in the option agreement is patent since it provides two time periods within which the option could be exercised.\nFaced with this ambiguity, Davey C.J.B.C., with whom McFarlane J.A. concurred, said:\nIt is impossible to say from the document itself whether the term of the option was intended to be 176 days and the terminal date of July 24, 1964, was fixed by miscalculating their number, or whether it was intended to end on that date, and the number of intervening days was miscalculated. But the contract does fix the exact minute, hour, and day that the period of 176 days, and therefore the option, is to end. About that there can be no doubt. That circumstance, in my opinion, dominates the clause and controls its meaning. The erroneous description of the term as one of 176 days must therefore be rejected as being inconsistent with the declared intention. This approach leads to a result that in my opinion makes good sense, and has the advantage of construing this business document in the way that businessmen would understand it.\nIn concluding I should note the fact that no claim for rectification was advanced at the trial.\nI agree with this reasoning and with the conclusion arrived at by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Thomas R. Berger, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, respondents: K.L. Brawner, Vancouver.\n[1] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 561, 58 D.L.R. (2d) 757.\n",

Franks, [1967] S.C.R. 455\nDate: 1967-06-26\nSamuel D. Cahoon (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nArthur H. Franks (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1967: May 23; 1967: June 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nActions\u2014Motor vehicle collision\u2014Action claiming damage to property\u2014Statutory limitation period\u2014Amendments including claim for personal injuries made after limitation period\u2014Whether amendments set up new cause of action\u2014The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, 1955 R.S.A., c. 356, s. 131(1).\nAs alleged by the respondent, on January 8, 1965, he was sitting in a motor vehicle lawfully and properly parked in a parking lane when a motor vehicle owned and operated by the appellant collided with the respondent\u2019s motor vehicle. The respondent alleged that the collision was caused by the negligence of the appellant. On December 29, 1965, the respondent commenced an action against the appellant in the District Court, claiming damages in the sum of $305, being the value of his automobile destroyed beyond repair in the collision. This was the only item of damage claimed in the action.\nOn January 18, 1966, the respondent obtained an order giving him leave to amend his statement of claim to include a claim for personal injuries, and transferring the action to the Supreme Court. On February 8, 1966, an order was obtained permitting the statement of claim to be amended to allege that as a result of the appellant\u2019s negligence the respondent sustained a cervical cord lesion and cervical cord, concussion which have left him totally disabled and unable to work. The appellant appealed to the Appellate Division against the above orders and the said appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nThe amended statement of claim asked for special damages for medical and hospital expenses and for loss of wages and also for general damages. The amendments sought to be included were made after the twelvemonth period provided in s. 131(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, 1955 R.S.A., c. 356, had expired and the appellant contended that the amendments raised a new cause of action which was barred by s. 131(1). The respondent argued that there was only one cause of action for a single wrongful or negligent act and damages resulting from the single tort must be assessed in the one proceeding.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe amendments did not set up a new cause of action. Brunsden v. Humphrey (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 141, in which the Court of Appeal in England held that different rights were infringed in the two actions brought and that a tort causing both injury to the person and injury to property gave rise to two distinct causes of action, is not now good law in Canada and should not be followed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], dismissing an appeal from orders made by Haddad D.C.J. and Dechene J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.C. Cavanagh, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nDerek Spitz, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014On January 8, 1965, the respondent who alleges he was sitting in a motor vehicle lawfully and properly parked in the parking lane on the north side of Highway No. 16 in the Province of Alberta near the area known as Manly Corner when a motor vehicle owned and operated by the appellant collided with the respondent\u2019s motor vehicle. The respondent alleges that the collision was caused by the negligence of the appellant. On December 29, 1965, the respondent commenced an action against the appellant in the District Court of the District of Northern Alberta, Judicial District of Edmonton, claiming damages in the sum of $305, being the value of his automobile destroyed beyond repair in the collision. This was the only item of damage claimed in the action.\nOn January 18, 1966, the respondent obtained an order from His Honour Judge Haddad giving him leave to amend his statement of claim to include a claim for personal injuries, and the order also transferred the action to the Supreme Court. On February 8, 1966, an order was obtained from Dechene J. permitting the statement of claim to be amended to allege that as a result of the appellant\u2019s negligence as aforesaid the respondent sustained a cervical cord lesion and cervical cord concussion which have left him totally disabled and unable to work. The amended statement of claim asked for special damages of $452 for medical and hospital expenses and $3,575 for loss of wages and $150,000 for general damages. It is these orders which are in issue in this appeal.\nSection 131(1) of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, 1955 R.S.A., c. 356, provides as follows:\n131(1) No action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle, after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained. The amendments sought to be made were made after the twelve-month period provided in s. 131(1) had expired and the appellant\u2019s position is that the amendments raised a new cause of action which was barred by s. 131(1) and he cites the well-known passage in Weldon v. Neal[2], which reads:\nWe must act on the settled rule of practice, which is that amendments are not admissible when they prejudice the rights of the opposite party as existing at the date of such amendments. If an amendment were allowed setting up a cause of action, which, if the writ were issued in respect thereof at the date of the amendment, would be barred by the Statute of Limitations, it would be allowing the plaintiff to take advantage of her former writ to defeat the statute and taking away an existing right from the defendant, a proceeding which, as a general rule, would be, in my opinion, improper and unjust. Under very peculiar circumstances the Court might perhaps have power to allow such an amendment, but certainly as a general rule it will not do so.\nDid the amendments set up a new cause of action? The appellant says they did and relies on Brunsden v. Humphrey[3]. In that case the plaintiff had sued in the County Court and recovered damages caused to his cab by a collision of his cab with defendant\u2019s van. Later he commenced an action in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division for personal injuries he had suffered in the same collision. This action was held to be barred by the earlier action and was dismissed. The Court of Appeal (Brett M.R. and Bowen L.J. with Coleridge C.J. dissenting) allowed the appeal, holding that different rights were infringed in the two actions; that a tort causing both injury to the person and injury to property gave rise to two distinct causes of action.\nThe respondent says that Brunsden v. Humphrey, supra, is no longer good law; that there is only one cause of action for a single wrongful or negligent act and damages resulting from the single tort must be assessed in the one proceeding; that the distinction between the old causes of action for injury to the person and damage to goods has been swept away.\nPorter J.A. in his reasons for judgment in the Appellate Division said:\nAn examination of the record in Brunsden v. Humphrey discloses that it was first dealt with (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 712, by two judges of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, Pollock, B. and Lopes, J. They disposed of it by denying the plaintiff the right to assert a claim for personal injury caused by the very accident in which he had obtained judgment for injury to his property. Pollock, B. says at p. 714:\n\u201cThe fact that damages for the injury to the plaintiff could have been laid and recovered in the former action shews conclusively that the present action cannot be maintained.\u201d\nLopes, J. says at the same page:\n\u201cIt is quite true that in the action in the county court the plaintiff claimed and recovered nothing in respect of personal injury to himself. But the cause of action in the county court, and the matter to be determined there, was the negligence of the defendant in driving his van. The plaintiff made no claim in the county court for damages in respect of his personal injuries, but he might have done so, for the injury was caused by the same matter which was tried and determined in the county court, that is, the defendant\u2019s negligence. He is now bringing his action, not for a new wrong, but for a consequence of the same wrongful act which was the subject of the former suit.\u201d\nOn appeal, three judgments were delivered, one dissenting and agreeing with the court below. Brett, M.R. and Bowen, L.J. based their judgments on the ground that two rights of action exist: (1) injury to the person, and (2) injury to the property. In reaching the conclusion which he did, Bowen, L.J. said at p. 150:\n\u201cThis leads me to consider whether, in the case of an accident caused by negligent driving, in which both the goods and the person of the plaintiff are injured, there is one cause of action only or two causes of action which are severable and distinct. This is a very difficult question to answer, and I feel great doubt and hesitation in differing from the judgment of the Court below and from the great authority of the present Chief Justice of England.\u201d\nLord Coleridge, C.J. dissented, saying at p. 152:\n\u201cIt appears to me that whether the negligence of the servant, or the impact of the vehicle which the servant drove, be the technical cause of action, equally the cause is one and the same; that the injury done to the plaintiff is injury done to him at one and the same moment by one and the same act in respect of different rights, i.e., his person and his goods I do not in the least deny; but it seems to me a subtlety not warranted by law to hold that a man cannot bring two actions, if he is injured in his arm and in his leg, but can bring two, if besides his arm and leg being injured his trousers which contain his leg, and his coatsleeve which contains his arm, have been torn. The consequences of holding this are so serious, and may be very probably so oppressive, that I at least must respectfully dissent from a judgment which establishes it.\u201d\nIt is important to bear in mind that it was the \u201cforms of action\u201d that were abolished by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1873. To apply Brunsden v. Humphrey to the facts here would be to revive one of the very forms of action which that Act abolished. The cause of action or, to use the expression of Diplock, L.J., \u201cthe factual situation\u201d which entitles the plaintiff here to recover damages from the defendant is the tort of negligence, a breach by the defendant of the duty which he owed to the plaintiff at common law which resulted in damage to the plaintiff. The injury to the person and the injury to the goods, and perhaps the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s real property and the injury to such modern rights as the right to privacy flowing from negligence serve only as yardsticks useful in measuring the damages which the breach caused.\nOf the five judges involved in Brunsden v. Humphrey, three disagreed with the judgment we are considering and one of the two that supported it declared himself in doubt. Actually, the majority judicial opinion expressed in the case disagreed in the result and one other doubted. Such a conflict of reasoning cannot be accepted as making the principle of the decision persuasive to this Court as far as I am concerned.\nTo deny this plaintiff the opportunity to have a court adjudicate on the relief which he claims merely because it lacks ancient form would be to return to those evils of practice which led to judicial amendment and the ultimate legislative abolition of \u201cforms of action\u201d. As Lord Denning, M.R. said in Letang v. Cooper, [1965] 1 Q.B. 232 at p. 239:\n\u201cI must decline, therefore, to go back to the old forms of action in order to construe this statute. I know that in the last century Maitland said \u2018the forms of action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves\u2019 (see Maitland, Forms of Action, 1909, p. 298), but we have in this century shaken off their trammels. These forms of action have served their day. They did at one time form a guide to substantive rights; but they do so no longer. Lord Atkin, in United Australia Ltd, v. Barclays Bank Ltd. [1941] A.C. 1, 29, told us what to do about them:\n\u2018When these ghosts of the past stand in the path of justice clanking their mediaeval chains the proper course for the judge is to pass through them undeterred.\u2019\u201d\nI make reference again to the abstracts quoted by Johnson, J.A. from the judgment of Lord Denning in Letang v. Cooper at p. 240, and the judgment of Diplock, L.J. in Fowler v. Lanning [1959] 1 Q.B. 426. \u201cThe factual situation\u201d which gave the plaintiff a cause of action was the negligence of the defendant which caused the plaintiff to suffer damage. This single cause of action cannot be split to be made the subject of several causes of action.\nSince the foregoing was written, this matter has been re-argued and counsel for the respondent has brought to our attention the cases in the United States of America where this subject and Brunsden v. Humphrey have been dealt with. What Fleming in \u201cThe Law of Torts\u201d, 3rd ed., describes as the \u201cdominant American practice\u201d rejects Brunsden v. Humphrey. (See Dearden v. Hey, 24 N.E. 2d 644, and annotations therein refered to.)\nThe decision in Brunsden v. Humphrey may well have persisted in Great Britain largely because the courts were bound by it. Free as we are to apply reason unhampered by precedent, I am of the opinion that the principle of Brunsden v. Humphrey ought not to be adopted. I agree with Porter J.A. I think that Brunsden v. Humphrey is not now good law in Canada and it ought not to be followed. The amendments did not set up a new cause of action and the passage from Weldon v. Neal previously quoted has no application in the instant case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Cavanagh, Henning, Buchanan, Kerr & Witten, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Macdonald, Spitz & Lavallee, Edmonton.\n[1] (1967), 58 W.W.R. 513.\n[2] (1887), 19 Q.B.D. 394 at 395.\n[3] (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 141.\n",

Toronto Transit Commission et al., [1967] S.C.R. 460\nDate: 1967-06-26\nTed Allen Harris, an infant, by his next friends, Armand Hall and Lillian Harris (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nToronto Transit Commission and Albert Miller (Defendants) Respondents.\n1967: February 13; 1967: June 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Bus driver negligent in pulling away from curb with result that bus brushed against steel pole\u2014Passenger putting arm out of window in contravention of by-law and in disregard of notice\u2014Passenger suffering physical injury\u2014Parties at fault in equal degrees and damages apportioned accordingly.\nThe infant appellant sustained injuries when he was a passenger in a bus owned by the respondent Transit Commission and operated by its servant, the second respondent. As the bus in question pulled away from a bus stop, it brushed against a steel pole which was set in the sidewalk some 5\u00bd inches from the curb with the result that the infant appellant\u2019s arm, which he had extended through a window in order to point out some object to his companion, was crushed and broken. In an action for damages brought on behalf of the infant appellant, the trial judge found that the negligence of the bus operator was a proximate cause of the collision but that the appellant was also guilty of negligence in putting his arm out of the window of the bus, having regard to the fact that a by-law of the respondent Commission, of which the appellant was aware, prohibited passengers from doing this and was posted in the bus together with a sign below the window reading: \u201cKeep arm in\u201d. The trial judge assessed the damages at $7,500 and would have divided the fault equally between the parties. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that on the facts of the case there could be no recovery. With leave, an appeal was brought to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: There may be circumstances in which a public carrier can discharge its duty to its passengers in relation to a specific danger by passing a prohibitory by-law and otherwise giving notice of the danger, but when, as in this case, the respondent\u2019s negligence was an effective cause of the accident and its driver should have foreseen the likelihood of children passengers extending their arms through the window notwithstanding the warning, different considerations apply and it becomes a case where the damages should be apportioned in proportion to the degree of fault found against the parties respectively.\nAs indicated, the negligence of the respondent\u2019s driver was an effective cause of the accident, but the appellant was also at fault in that he did not, in his own interest, take the care of himself which was prescribed by the by-law and he contributed by this want of care to his injury. There was no reason to disturb the conclusion of the trial judge that the parties were at fault in equal degrees and that the damages should be apportioned accordingly.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: As held by the Court of Appeal, the cause, and the only cause, of this accident was that the boy deliberately put his arm out of the window. He was thirteen years of age at the time. He knew that what he was doing was both dangerous to his own safety and forbidden. He would not have been injured if he had kept his arm within the bus.\n[Hill v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. (1922), 52 O.L.R. 508, not followed; National Coal Board v. England, [1954] A.C. 403; Ginty v. Belmont Building Supplies, Ltd., [1959] 1 All E.R. 414; McMath v. Rimmer Brothers (Liverpool), Ltd., [1961] 3 All E.R. 1154, referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Parker J. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and B.A. Crane, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nT.A. King, Q.C., and J.W. Brown, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Parker and dismissing a claim made on behalf of the infant appellant for damages sustained by him when he was a passenger in a bus owned by the respondent Toronto Transit Commission and operated by its servant Albert Miller, who is the other respondent. As the bus in question pulled away from the bus stop at the corner of Bay and Dundas Streets in the City of Toronto, it brushed against a steel pole which was set in the sidewalk some 5\u00bd inches from the curb with the result that the infant appellant\u2019s arm, which he had extended through a window in order to point out some object to his companion, was crushed and broken. The collision also had the effect of breaking the right clearance light and denting the side of the bus behind the rear window.\nIn a carefully prepared opinion, Mr. Justice Parker found that the negligence of the bus operator was a proximate cause of the collision but that the infant appellant was also guilty of negligence in putting his arm out of the window of the bus, having regard to the fact that a by\u2011law of the Toronto Transit Commission, of which the appellant was aware, prohibited passengers from doing this and was posted in the bus together with a sign below the window reading: \u201cKeep arm in\u201d. The trial judge would have divided the fault equally between the parties.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal was rendered orally by Laskin J.A. at the conclusion of the argument. The learned judge did not refer to any authorities but reached his conclusion on the following grounds:\nWe are of the opinion that there was no negligence in this case attributable to the defendants which, as a matter of law, operated in favour of the infant plaintiff. On the facts, he was the author of his own misfortune. We do not think that the bus operator could reasonably be expected to foresee that the infant plaintiff would have his arm in the position in which it was outside the window when he pulled away from the curb. The evidence is clear that the infant plaintiff knew of the warning which was posted on the window ledge to keep his arm in, and it was his carelessness for his own safety and not any carelessness that may have existed in the way in which the driver pulled away from the curb that was the operative cause of the accident.\nIn the present respondent\u2019s notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal the only two grounds taken which made express reference to the negligence of the infant appellant were:\n(4) the learned judge erred in holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover notwithstanding the breach by the infant plaintiff of the statutory prohibition against putting his arm out of the window of the bus contrary to the bylaw in that behalf of the defendant company and section 167 of The Railway Act, R.S.O. 1950, Chapter 331;\n(5) the learned judge ought to have found that the injuries sustained by the infant plaintiff were solely due to his own negligence and breach of the said statutory prohibition;\u2026\nThe only finding of negligence on the part of the appellant which the Court of Appeal had before it was the trial judge\u2019s finding that the appellant \u201cknew and appreciated the danger and voluntarily accepted the risk\u201d.\nIf by using the phrase \u201che was the author of his own misfortune\u201d the Court of Appeal intended to convey the opinion that the breach of the statutory prohibition by the infant appellant disentitled him to recover against the Commission for the damage which he suffered through the negligence of the Commission\u2019s servant then, as will hereafter appear, I am in respectful disagreement with this finding. If, on the other hand, the phrase is used to indicate that the boy voluntarily accepted the risk of his injury and cannot recover on this ground, then it is perhaps well to mention the decision in Lehnert v. Stein[1], where Mr. Justice Cartwright, speaking for the majority of this Court, at p. 44, adopted the following comments on the defence of volenti non fit injuria, which were made by Mr. Glanville Williams in his work on Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1951) at p. 308:\nIt is submitted that the key to an understanding of the true scope of the volens maxim lies in drawing a distinction between what may be called physical and legal risk. Physical risk is the risk of damage in fact; legal risk is the risk of damage in fact for which there will be no redress in law.\n* * *\nTo put this in general terms, the defence of volens does not apply where as a result of a mental process the plaintiff decides to take a chance but there is nothing in his conduct to show a waiver of the right of action communicated to the other party. To constitute a defence, there must have been an express or implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence.\nI do not think that the circumstances in the present case justify the conclusion that the injured boy entered into a bargain express or implied whereby he gave up his right of action for negligence against the respondents. It will also be observed that Mr. Justice Laskin did not consider that the bus driver could reasonably be expected to foresee that the little boy\u2019s arm would have been out of the window.\nIn my opinion we are relieved from the task of speculating on whether the bus driver could reasonably have foreseen such a thing by reason of the fact that he indicates in his own evidence that he was aware of the propensity of children on his own bus to put their arms and indeed their heads out of the window, notwithstanding the warning which the Commission had posted.\nIn the course of his cross-examination, the respondent, Albert Miller, who was driving the bus, made the following answers:\nQ. Did you ever remind any passenger not to put his arm or her arm out of the window?\nA. Yes\u2014if I see them put their arm out\u2014or children with their heads\nout or anything, I always go back and tell them not to.\nQ. Do you have instructions to watch for this?\nA. Well, we are supposed to watch for anything unusual on the bus.\nAnd later:\nQ. Did you ever, except perhaps when you had a whole load of children, stop your bus and go back and request them not to have their arm out the window?\nA. Yes, when I have had children\u2014school-work and that.\nI have no difficulty in drawing the conclusion from this evidence that the bus driver knew that children had a tendency to put their arms out of the windows and that he could therefore reasonably be expected to foresee that such a thing would happen in the case of the infant plaintiff.\nThe standard of care required of common carriers is stated in the following terms by Hudson J. in Day v. Toronto Transportation Commission[2], at p. 441, where he said:\nAlthough the carrier of passengers is not an insurer, yet if an accident occurs and the passenger is injured, there is a heavy burden on the defendant carrier to establish that he had used all due, proper and reasonable care and skill to avoid or prevent injury to the passenger. The care required is of a very high degree.\nSubstantially the same proposition is stated in slightly different language in the reasons for judgment of Kerwin C.J., speaking on behalf of himself and Judson J. in Kauffman v. Toronto Transit Commission[3], at p. 255, where he said:\nWhile the obligation upon carriers of persons is to use all due, proper and reasonable care and the care required is of a very high degree, such carriers are not insurers of the safety of the persons whom they carry. The law is correctly set forth in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 4, p. 174, para. 445, that they do not warrant the soundness or sufficiency of their vehicles, but their undertaking is to take all due care and to carry safely as far as reasonable care and forethought can attain that end.\nThere can, in my opinion, be no doubt that in operating the bus in such manner as to bring it into forceful contact with the steel pole, the respondent Miller exhibited a marked departure from the standard of care which the operators of public vehicles owe to their passengers, and I agree with the learned trial judge that his conduct in this regard was an effective cause of the accident.\nThe relevant by-law of the respondent Commission, which was approved by the Ontario Municipal Board and therefore has the force of law by virtue of s. 167 of The Railway Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 331, provided as follows:\nNo person shall ride or stand on any exterior portion of any car or bus operated by the Commission nor lean out of or project any portion of his body through any window of such car or bus nor enter any such bus at other than the designated entries.\nIt was contended on behalf of the respondent that by passing this by-law and otherwise giving notice to its passengers of the danger of projecting any portion of their body through any window of the bus, the respondent Commission had fully discharged its duty of care in relation to the dangers involved in such conduct and that it owed no further duty to them in this regard. There may be circumstances in which a public carrier can discharge its duty to its passengers in relation to a specific danger by passing such a by-law and giving such notice, but when, as in this case, the respondent\u2019s negligence was an effective cause of the accident and its driver should have foreseen the likelihood of children passengers extending their arms through the window notwithstanding the warning, different considerations apply and in my opinion it becomes a case where the damages should be apportioned in proportion to the degree of fault found against the parties respectively. As was pointed out by the learned trial judge, the case of Hill v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[4] was one in which the plaintiff stepped off a moving train at her destination and was injured and it was there held that notwithstanding the jury\u2019s finding as to the negligence of the defendants and the absence of contributory negligence by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was nevertheless not entitled to recover because her action in leaving the moving train contravened a by-law of the railway company. In that case, Masten J.A. said:\n\u2026I think that the question is not one of contributory negligence at all, but rather of the contravention by the plaintiff of an absolute statutory prohibition, which precludes her from asserting a claim arising out of the risks with which her act was attended.\nIn so deciding, Masten J.A. purported to follow the reasoning of the Privy Council in Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Barnett[5], which turned in large measure upon the finding that the injured plaintiff was a trespasser to whom the railway company owed no duty.\nThese cases were decided at a time when contributory negligence on the part of a plaintiff was a complete defence and before the enactment of the statutory provisions respecting apportionment of damage between parties who are both at fault. I think the reasoning of Mr. Justice Masten is at variance with many of the cases which have been decided in England since the enactment of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, 1945 in which apportionment of the damages has been ordered notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff was in breach of a statutory duty. In this regard reference can usefully be made to the decision of the House of Lords in National Coal Board v. England[6], and to the more recent cases of Ginty v. Belmont Building Supplies, Ltd.[7], and McMath v. Rimmer Brothers (Liverpool), Ltd.[8] It is true that \u201cfault\u201d is defined in the English statute as including \u201cbreach of statutory duty\u2026which gives rise to a liability in tort or would apart from this Act give rise to the defence of contributory negligence\u201d, but I do not think that the absence of such a, definition in the Ontario Act justifies the conclusion that the word \u201cfault\u201d was there used in such a restricted sense as to exclude breach of a statutory duty. The relevant statutory provision in Ontario is contained in s. 4 of The Negligence Act, R.S.O.1960, c. 261 which reads:\n4. In any action for damages that is founded upon the fault or negligence of the defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of the plaintiff that contributed to the damages, the court shall apportion the damages in proportion to the degree of fault or negligence found against the parties respectively.\nAs I have indicated, I am satisfied that the negligence of the respondent\u2019s driver was an effective cause of the accident, but the appellant was also at fault in that he did not, in his own interest, take the care of himself which was prescribed by the by-law and he contributed by this want of care to his injury. I see no reason to disturb the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the parties were at fault in equal degrees and that the damages should be apportioned accordingly.\nIn view of all the above, I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The infant plaintiff was thirteen years of age at the date of the accident. He was riding south on Bay Street, Toronto, in a T.T.C. bus, seated at the right hand side of the back seat next to the window. This window could not be raised, but could be pushed forward horizontally some four inches, which was its position at the time. At the bottom of the window there was a warning sign reading \u201cKeep arm in\u201d. This warning sign had been placed there pursuant to a by-law of the respondent, approved by the Ontario Municipal Board pursuant to s. 167 of The Railway Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 331.\nThe bus stopped at the curb on the west side of Bay Street a short distance north of its intersection with Dundas Street, for the purpose of picking up and discharging passengers, and while so stopped the boy put his arm out beyond the elbow through the opening in the window to point out some object in a store window to a companion sitting beside him. He had ridden on similar buses on many previous occasions, had seen the warning sign on those occasions and admitted that he knew the sign was there to warn people to keep their arms in so that there would not be any chance of their being injured by any contact with things outside the bus.\nAfter discharging and taking on passengers at the stop, the bus started up and as the front pulled away from the curb its rear swung slightly to the right and the upper right rear corner grazed the top of a steel pole set in the sidewalk near the curb. A small plastic clearance light at the upper rear corner of the bus was broken, and a small window near the top of the bus was cracked.\nThere was no impact between the bus and the pole in the area of the window through which the boy put his arm, but his arm was crushed between the pole and the side of the bus. The pole was one of a series located on either side of Bay Street for the purpose of suspending the electric trolley wires. The boy was familiar with the existence of these poles close to the curb on both sides of the street, and had seen them on many previous occasions.\nOn these facts, the trial judge assessed the damages at $7,500 and found that the injury was caused or contributed to in equal degrees by the fault or negligence of both the boy and the bus driver. The Court of Appeal found that there could be no recovery on the undisputed facts of the case.\nThe Court of Appeal said that the cause, and the only cause, of this accident was that the boy deliberately put his arm out of the window. He was thirteen years of age at the time. He knew that what he was doing was both dangerous to his own safety and forbidden. He would not have been injured if he had kept his arm within the bus.\nI disagree with the reasons of Ritchie J. when he says that two possible inferences from the judgment of the Court of Appeal are:\n(a) that the Court was saying that when the boy put his arm out of the window in contravention of the regula- tions, he effectively extinguished all rights which he might otherwise have had, and\n(b) that there was a voluntary acceptance of the risk.\nI agree with the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Chappell, Walsh & Davidson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondents: J.W.H.

The defence was that an accident such as that described by the plaintiff was impossible. The trial judge maintained the action, but his decision was reversed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe bottler of carbonated beverages owes a duty to furnish containers of sufficient strength to withstand normal distribution and consumer handling. Each case turns upon whether the evidence in that particular case excludes any probable cause of injury except the permissible inference of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that the bottle was not mishandled by the defendant\u2019s employees until it was picked up by the plaintiff to be placed in the cooler. The evidence which was accepted by the trial judge created a presumption of fact under art. 1238 of the Civil Code that the explosion of the bottle was due to a defect for which the defendant was responsible and that the latter failed to rebut that presumption.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Collins J. Appeal allowed.\nJ.J. Spector, Q.C., and Abraham Cohen, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA.J. Campbell, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench1 reversing a judgment of Collins J. in the Superior Court which had condemned respondent to pay to appellant the sum of $8,600.80 with interest and costs as damages for injuries sustained on September 4, 1957, and caused by the explosion of a bottle of Coca-Cola.\nThe facts are fully reviewed in the judgments below and shortly stated they are these. In September 1957 appellant\u2014then a minor\u2014was employed by his father, one Jack Cohen, who operates a restaurant in the City of Montreal, at which Coca-Cola and other soft drinks were sold. Supplies of Coca-Cola were delivered weekly by respondent and when delivered were placed by respondent\u2019s employees in the basement of the restaurant premises. In his restaurant, Cohen had a freezer with a capacity of from four hundred to five hundred bottles. From time to time, as Coca-Cola and other soft drinks were required for the purpose of sale, they were brought up in cases from the cellar by employees of the restaurant, and then placed in the freezer.\nAs to the circumstances under which the appellant was injured the learned trial judge said:\nAs the Coca-Cola was required for the purpose of sale, the cases were brought up from the cellar for the purpose of putting the bottles into the freezer. The cellar had a cement floor and cement walls. It was heated by the landlord of the premises but there was no furnace in that part of the cellar in which Coca-Cola was kept. The plaintiff worked for his father in the restaurant. Sometime after 3.00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of September 4th, 1957, five or six such cases were brought up from the cellar by one of the employees of Jack Cohen. The plaintiff then started to put the bottles one by one out of the cases into the freezer. The first two sections of the freezer were reserved for Coca-Cola bottles, a third section for Seven-Up and Pepsi bottles and a fourth section for miscellaneous bottles. The plaintiff said that he had emptied most of the cases and had put the bottles in the freezer and there only remained about half a case so to empty. He then reached down and picked up a bottle of Coca-Cola with his right hand and was putting it into the freezer when he said the bottle exploded. The result of the explosion was that glass went into his left eye, causing to it the injuries in respect of which damages are now claimed by this action. The plaintiff said that the glass did not cut his face in any other way and the only damage was to his eye. Upon the explosion, he dropped apparently what remained of the bottle in his hand and covered his two eyes to protect himself. He then looked in the mirror and found that his eye was bleeding. He went alone in a taxicab to the Montreal General Hospital where he remained until September 20th.\nRespondent\u2019s defence was that an accident such as that described by appellant was impossible and in support of that contention it led evidence which was largely a description of the type of bottle used by it, the procedure followed in inspecting and filling bottles as well as expert evidence as to what happened when bottles filled with its product were heated, struck with a hammer or banged together.\nAs I have said, the learned trial judge maintained the action and in doing so he made certain findings. Dealing with the accident itself, he said this:\nIn considering this matter, the Court has only the evidence of the plaintiff to base itself on. There were produced no witnesses to the accident (apart from the plaintiff) which is not unusual in cases of this kind. The Court carefully watched the plaintiff in giving evidence. It has come to the conclusion after a very mature deliberation that he told the truth. His evidence seemed quite honest and it did not appear that he attempted to exaggerate the situation in any way. The only evidence before the Court is that the accident happened in the way that the plaintiff said that it did. The only evidence to the contrary is the evidence of the defendant that such an explosion could not have taken place for the reasons above mentioned. It may have been that the bottle was broken by the careless handling of the plaintiff and that fragments of glass so entered his eye. The evidence of the defendant, based on tests made by its expert was that fragments of glass coming from bottles which were broken deliberately by such expert were thrown up to a radius of 18 inches, so that it would be quite possible for the accident to have happened as suggested by the defendant. However the positive evidence was that the plaintiff was injured in the manner described by him. As the Court is not in a position to say that he was not telling the truth and the Defendant was unable to establish otherwise, it must accept as true his evidence as to the manner in which the accident happened.\nMany of the bottles containing Coca-Cola distributed by respondent were used over and over again after being returned to the respondent\u2019s plant, where they were cleaned and inspected before being refilled. Referring to the evidence led by respondent as to the method of the filling and inspection of bottles, the learned trial judge said:\nIt is obvious that the inspection of the defendant to prevent defective bottles from being filled with Coca-Cola was inefficient and it could not possibly detect all the defects. There is no other conclusion to come to but that it would be quite easy for a defective bottle to pass an inspector. The inspection took place before the bottles were filled, so that the bottles went through the subsequent process of filling and capping without inspection, an automatic process requiring the use of machines.\nAfter stating that it was reasonable to infer that it was a defective bottle which resulted in the injury of the appellant, the learned trial judge reached this conclusion:\nOn the evidence as a whole the Court finds that the defendant was negligent in not having an inspection system adequate to prevent defective bottles reaching customers. It was the fault of the defendant that the bottle exploded because the bottle provided by the defendant was not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the gas put into it by the defendant. He was also of opinion that respondent had \u201cla garde juridique\u201d of the bottle within the meaning of art. 1054 of the Civil Code.\nThe judgment at trial was reversed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Rinfret J. dissenting. The ratio of the majority decision appears to be that appellant\u2019s version of the accident required some form of corroboration and that he had failed to discharge the burden of establishing that the bottle of Coca-Cola was not damaged in some way after delivery to the restaurant. With respect I am unable to agree with those findings.\nThe bottler of carbonated beverages owes a duty to furnish containers of sufficient strength to withstand normal distribution and consumer handling. Little is to be gained by discussing the numerous decided cases involving the explosion of bottles containing such beverages. Each case turns upon whether the evidence in that particular case excludes any probable cause of injury except the permissible inference of the defendant\u2019s negligence.\nIn the present case, boxes each containing twenty-four bottles of Coca-Cola were placed in the basement of the restaurant by employees of the respondent. On the day of the accident, a case containing the bottle which exploded, along with several other cases containing Coca\u2011Cola, was brought up from the basement by a dish-washer employed in the restaurant. The bottles contained in these cases were then placed in the freezer by appellant and were handled only by him. The particular bottle which exploded was taken from the last case to be unloaded. The appellant described the manner in which he took each bottle from the wooden cases and placed it in the freezer. There is no suggestion in his evidence, either in chief or on cross-examination that they were handled in other than the ordinary way. The learned trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that the bottle which exploded was not mishandled from the time it was placed in the basement by respondent\u2019s employees until it was picked up by appellant to be placed in the freezer.\nIn my opinion evidence which was accepted by the learned trial judge created a presumption of fact under art. 1238 of the Civil Code, that the explosion of the bottle which caused injury to appellant was due to a defect for which respondent was responsible and that the latter failed to rebut that presumption. It follows that I do not find It necessary to express any opinion as to whether appellant was entitled to invoke the presumption of liability under art. 1054 of the Civil Code.\nAs to damages, the amount awarded, while perhaps generous, is not such as to warrant interference by this Court.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and below and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: A. Cohen, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Brais, Campbell, Pepper & Durand, Montreal.\n[1] [1966] Que. Q.B. 813.\n",

His appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. On his application for leave to appeal to this Court, two grounds were urged by his counsel: (1) that the magistrate should have directed that an issue be tried to determine whether the accused, because of insanity, was incapable of conducting his defence; (2) that the accused was deprived of his right to counsel and to a fair trial.\nHeld: The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.\nUnder the provisions of s. 597(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, leave to appeal to this Court may be granted on any question of law alone.

Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal from the Order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia made on November 18, 1966. By that Order the said Court dismissed an appeal by this applicant from a conviction by Magistrate D. Hume at Vancouver, on July 8, 1966, on the charge that the accused unlawfully did have in his possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and from his sentence upon such conviction.\nIn this Court, the accused was represented by counsel who urged two grounds of appeal:\nFirstly, that the Magistrate ought to have directed that an issue be tried to determine whether the accused, because of insanity, was incapable of conducting his defence. Such an issue is provided for in s. 524(1) of the Criminal Code.\nSecondly, that the accused was deprived of his right to counsel and his right to a fair trial, contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 1960, c. 44.\nAs to the first ground of the application, after consideration of the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the only question involved is whether the magistrate properly exercised his discretion to determine whether there was, in the words of the section, \u201csufficient reason to doubt that the accused is, on account of insanity, capable of conducting his defence\u201d. Under the provisions of s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, if leave is granted, an appeal to this Court may be taken on any question of law alone. I am of the opinion that there is no question of law involved in the determination of whether the magistrate had properly exercised his discretion. It would appear that the magistrate did in fact carry on an investigation to determine whether an issue should be directed. The sufficiency of that investigation, and the conclusion to which the magistrate came, are not matters involving a question of law.\nAs to the second ground, there is no evidence that the applicant was deprived of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay or was deprived of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nI would dismiss the application for leave to appeal\nApplication dismissed.\n",

Atlantic Engine Rebuilders Ltd., [1967] S.C.R. 477\nDate: 1967-05-23\nThe Minister of National Revenue Appellant;\nand\nAtlantic Engine Rebuilders Limited Respondent\n1966: December 9; 1967: May 23.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Whether unredeemed refundable deposits received from customers part of business income\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 12(1) (a), 85B.\nThe respondent company was in the business of rebuilding automobile engines for sale to car dealers. The company required the car dealers, on purchasing a rebuilt engine, to supply it with another rebuildable engine as well as paying the invoice price. A dealer who did not supply a rebuildable engine was required to pay a cash deposit, about three times the market value of the used engine. This deposit was refundable when the dealer supplied a rebuildable engine, which happened 96 per cent of the time. The unredeemed deposits held by the respondent company at the end of 1958 were added by the Minister to the respondent\u2019s declared income for that year. The Exchequer Court allowed the respondent\u2019s appeal, and the Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal by the Minister should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: In stating what its profit was for the year in question, the respondent could not truthfully have included these unredeemed deposits. It knew that it might not be able to retain any part of that sum and that the probabilities were that 96 per cent of it would be returned to the depositors in the near future. The circumstance that the company became the legal owner of the moneys deposited and that they did not constitute a trust fund in its hands was irrelevant. There was no basis, having regard to the realities of the situation, on which these deposits could properly be treated as ordinary trading receipts of the respondent which it was entitled to include in calculating its profits for the year. There was nothing in the Income Tax Act requiring these deposits to be treated as profits of the respondent.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The deposits were of an income nature arising in the ordinary course of the respondent\u2019s trading transactions. There was no liability to refund until the rebuildable engine was actually delivered. The probability that the taxpayer would be required to refund the greater portion of the deposits does not permit their deduction. They would be deductible in the year in which they were refunded. Furthermore the amount, shown as a liability, was an amount transferred or credited to a reserve within the provisions of s. 12(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act. Revenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9p\u00f4ts re\u00e7us de clients remboursables mais non rachet\u00e9s font-ils partie du revenu de l\u2019entreprise\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 12(1)(a), 85B.\nLe commerce de la compagnie intim\u00e9e consistait dans la reconstruction de moteurs d\u2019automobiles et leur vente \u00e0 des commer\u00e7ants d\u2019automobiles. La compagnie exigeait que les commer\u00e7ants fournissent, lorsqu\u2019ils achetaient un moteur reconstruit, un autre moteur apte \u00e0 \u00eatre reconstruit en plus de payer le prix de la facture. Un commer\u00e7ant qui ne pouvait pas fournir un moteur apte \u00e0 \u00eatre reconstruit \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de payer un d\u00e9p\u00f4t en argent, repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s trois fois la valeur marchande d\u2019un moteur usag\u00e9. Ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait remboursable lorsque le commer\u00e7ant fournissait un moteur apte \u00e0 \u00eatre reconstruit, ce qui se pr\u00e9sentait dans 96 pour cent des cas. Le Ministre a ajout\u00e9 au revenu de la compagnie pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1958 le montant des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts non rachet\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait en mains \u00e0 la fin de cette ann\u00e9e. La Cour de l\u2019Echiquier a maintenu l\u2019appel de la compagnie et le Ministre en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel du Ministre doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, les Juges Abbott et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Cartwright, Martland et Ritchie: En d\u00e9clarant quel \u00e9tait son profit pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en question, la compagnie intim\u00e9e ne pouvait pas v\u00e9ridiquement inclure ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts non rachet\u00e9s. Elle savait qu\u2019elle pourrait ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de retenir aucune partie de cette somme et que les probabilit\u00e9s \u00e9taient que 96 pour cent de cette somme serait remis aux d\u00e9posants. Le fait que la compagnie \u00e9tait devenue le propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gal des argents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et que ces argents ne constituaient pas un fonds en fiducie entre ses mains n\u2019avait aucune pertinence. En face de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la situation, il n\u2019y avait aucune base sur laquelle ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des re\u00e7us provenant du commerce ordinaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle avait droit d\u2019inclure dans le calcul de son profit pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Aucune disposition de la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu exige que ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts soient trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des profits entre les mains de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLes Juges Abbott et Judson, dissidents: Les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts \u00e9taient de la nature d\u2019un revenu survenant dans le cours ordinaire des transactions commerciales de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a aucune obligation de les retourner tant qu\u2019un moteur apte \u00e0 \u00eatre reconstruit ne soit actuellement d\u00e9livr\u00e9. La probabilit\u00e9 que le contribuable serait oblig\u00e9 de retourner la majeure portion de ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts ne permet pas leur d\u00e9duction. Ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9s. De plus, le montant, tel qu\u2019entr\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un passif, \u00e9tait un montant transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9serve dans le sens de dispositions de l\u2019art. 12(1) (e) de la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Thurlow de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Abbott et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents. APPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nG.W. Ainslie, for the appellant.\nGeorge B. Cooper, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment2 of Thurlow J. pronounced on August 17, 1964, allowing the appeal of the respondent from a re-assessment of income tax for the year 1958 in respect of a sum of $38,213, representing the balance of amounts known in the respondent\u2019s business as \u201ccore deposits\u201d, which the appellant in making the re\u2011assessments included in the computation of the respondent\u2019s income.\nThe relevant facts are fully set out in the reasons of Thurlow J. and are sufficiently summarized in those of my brother Judson; it is unnecessary to repeat them.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails.\nSection 4 of the Income Tax Act provides that, subject to the other provisions of Part I of the Act, income for a taxation year from a business is the profit therefrom for the year.\nIn Sun Insurance Office v. Clark[3], a case in which the question for decision was the amount of the profits arising from the appellant\u2019s business, Earl Loreburn L.C. spoke at page 454 of \u201cthe only rule of law that I know of, namely, that the true gains are to be ascertained as nearly as it can be done\u201d.\nIn Dominion Taxicab Association v. Minister of National Revenue[4], it was said in. the judgment of the majority of the Court:\nIt is well settled that in considering whether a particular transaction brings a party within the terms of the Income Tax Act its substance rather than its form is to be regarded.\nThe question of substance in this case appears to me to be whether in stating what its profit was for the year the respondent could truthfully have included the sum in question. To me there seems to be only one answer, that it could not. It knew that it might not be able to retain any part of that sum and that the probabilities were that 96 per cent of it must be returned to the depositors in the near future. The circumstance that the respondent became the legal owner of the moneys deposited with it and that they did not constitute a trust fund in its hands appears to me to be irrelevant; the same may be said of moneys deposited by a customer in a Bank which form part of the Bank\u2019s assets but not of its profits. To treat these deposits as if they were ordinary trading receipts of the respondent would be to disregard all the realities of the situation.\nThe grounds upon which Thurlow J. based his decision appear to me to be supported by the reasoning of the majority in this Court in Dominion Taxicab Association v. Minister of National Revenue, supra, at p. 85, where it is stated that as each deposit was received by the Association and became a part of its assets there arose a corresponding contingent liability equal in amount. This was one of the grounds on which it was held that the deposits formed no part of the profits of the Association. Since that decision there has been no substantial change in the wording of the sections of the Income Tax Act on which the appellant relies.\nWhat appears to me to be decisive is the fact that there is no basis, having regard to the realities of the situation, on which these deposits can properly be treated as ordinary trading receipts of the respondent which it was entitled to include in calculating its profits for the year.\nOf course it would be within the power of Parliament to enact that a receipt which could not on any principle of sound accounting be regarded as forming part of a company\u2019s profit should none the less be treated as profit for the purposes of taxation; but to bring about such a result clear and intractable words would be necessary. In my opinion, nothing in the Income Tax Act requires these deposits to be treated as profits of the respondent.\nThe result brought about by the judgment of Thurlow J. is that in the year in question the respondent will be taxed on its true profit for that year. If in the following year, as seems probable, as to a small portion of the said sum of $38,213, the respondent ceases to be under liability to return it to the depositor or depositors, such portion will form part of the profit in that year and once again the respondent will be taxed on its true profit. I do not think that such a result should be disturbed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The Minister, in assessing the respondent\u2019s income for its 1958 taxation year, included in income the sum of $38,213 shown on its balance sheet as a current liability entitled \u201cCustomers\u2019 Deposits\u201d. The Exchequer Court[5] allowed an appeal from this assessment and the Minister appeals now to this Court.\nThe company was in the business of rebuilding Ford engines. It sold these to Ford dealers, but in order to stay in business, it needed a regular supply of rebuildable engines. Therefore, when it sold an engine to a dealer, it required that dealer to supply it with another rebuildable engine of the same model. If the dealer did not supply the rebuildable engine, he had to pay a deposit to be held by the company until he did supply such an engine. When he did, he got his deposit back. It is these unredeemed deposits held by the company to the amount of $38,213 which the Minister has assessed for income. The amount of the deposit was usually about three times the market value of the old used engine. It was deliberately set at this high figure in order to ensure that an old engine would be delivered as soon as possible.\nOther details of the arrangement between the company and its customers were that the engine on a visual inspection had to be rebuildable. If parts of the engine were missing or if there were defects which were visual or apparent on inspection, the deposit was not refunded in full but was reduced. If the engine on a visual inspection was not rebuildable, the dealer only got the scrap value of the engine as a credit.\nThe company did not keep these deposits separate from other monies received by it from its sale of rebuilt engines. There is no question here of any trust attaching to the deposit monies. It was argued before the Tax Appeal Board in another case that there was such a trust. This was rejected and no appeal was ever taken from this decision. Western Engine Works Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[6], In my opinion, this case was correctly decided.\nThe learned trial judge in setting aside the assessment held that the company was entitled to a deduction in respect of its liability to refund the deposits, that this liability was not a contingent liability, and that the amount necessary to provide for their retirement was not a reserve, contingent amount, or sinking fund within the prohibition of s. 12(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act. The liability, he said, was not one that arose on delivery of the engine but existed from the time of receipt of the deposit. It became due and payable when the engine was actually delivered.\nThe evidence seems to show that in most cases only a short time elapsed between the payment of the deposit and its redemption by the delivery of a rebuildable engine. It also shows that about 96 per cent of the deposits were redeemed.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court is obviously founded upon the finding that the deposits were of an income nature arising in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s trading transactions. With this, I agree.\nIn this Court, the Crown has two points in its appeal based on ss. 12(1) (a) and 12(1) (e) of the Act,\n(1) that the amounts necessary to provide for the retirement of these liabilities which at the end of the year had \u201cnot become due or recoverable by the dealer\u201d were neither outlays or expenses made or incurred during the year (s. 12(1)(a)), and\n(2) that such amounts would be in respect of a reserve or contingent account and, as such, prohibited by S.12(1)(e).\nSections 12(1)(a) and 12(1)(e) read:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n* * *\n(e) an amount transferred or credited to a reserve, contingent account or sinking fund except as expressly permitted by this Part. The Minister\u2019s position is that unless there is an express provision in the Act, the taxpayer is prohibited by these paragraphs from making these deductions. He says there are no such other provisions.\nIt is obvious that there was no outlay or expense made until the deposit was refunded. But the judgment under appeal holds that the outlay or expense was incurred when the deposit was made because the liability to refund was immediate and not contingent. In this I think there is error. There was no liability to refund until the rebuildable engine was actually delivered. The taxpayer was not definitely committed in the year of income to make this disbursement or outlay or expense until the rebuildable engine was delivered. And even then, as I have pointed out above, there were several potential adjustments to be made depending on the state of the rebuildable engine as disclosed by a visual inspection.\nThe probability, in this case 96 per cent, that the taxpayer would be required to refund the greater portion of the deposits does not permit their deduction. They are deductible in the year in which they are made.\nI also think that the company fails under s. 12(1) (e). This amount, shown as a liability, is an amount transferred or credited to a reserve. It may be good commercial or accountancy practice to make provision for these liabilities but this is subject to the express provisions of the Act and the Act does make an express provision here.\nThe main argument of the taxpayer in this case was directed to the nature of the receipt. He argued that the consideration for the sale of a rebuilt engine is the catalogue price plus the delivery of a rebuildable engine of the same model, and that the deposit is a refundable deposit which at the time of its receipt is not the absolute property of the respondent. I cannot accept this submission. No one else had any property interest in the deposit except the taxpayer. It became part of his funds. It was not a trust. Its receipt merely gave rise to an obligation to repay when something further was done by the person who made the deposit. There was no immediate liability to repay. These deposits are chargeable against income for the year when they are refunded.\nI do not think that s. 85B requires any consideration for the determination of this appeal. Nor do I think that Dominion Taxicab Association v. Minister of National Revenue[7] governs this case. The word \u201cdeposit\u201d is one of highly variable meaning. Its mere use in a contract determines nothing without an analysis of the rights and obligations created. In the Taxicab case it was the price of membership in the Association. It was transferable and interest bearing under certain conditions., The conclusion in this Court was that it did not become the absolute property of the Association. Rand J. held that it was a contribution to the capital of the Association and not an income receipt. On both grounds the present case is distinguishable.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the assessment of the Minister for the 1958 taxation year restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, ABBOTT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A.

In 1958, the appellant was also managing under a contract the business of a company carrying on horse race meetings in Portland, Oregon, in return for a share of profits. The appellant sought to deduct from his income from this source a sum of $5,241 as his expenses in travelling from Vancouver to Portland and his living expenses at Portland during the racing season. The Minister allowed a deduction of $1,200 and disallowed the rest. The Exchequer Court maintained the Minister's assessment. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The expenses were deductible. The appellant's expenses of travelling to Portland and his expenses of living there were in the performance of his agreement and were not purely personal to him and outside the agreement. If the appellant was going to fulfil the obligations he undertook to fulfil under the agreement, it was necessary for him to travel to and from Portland. On the evidence, it was clear that the whole operation, whether at Vancouver or at Portland, was in fact one business being conducted by the appellant and the income of that business from the various geographic bases was income from the business as a whole.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: Section 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibits the deduction of these expenses because they were not incurred in the course of carrying on the Portland business but were personal or living expenses.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014G\u00e9rant d'une entreprise hors de la ville o\u00f9 il r\u00e9side\u2014D\u00e9duction des frais de subsistance et de d\u00e9placement\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 12(1)(a), (h), 139(1).\nL'appelant s'occupait de g\u00e9rer les activit\u00e9s d'un certain nombre de champs de courses de chevaux en Colombie-Britannique o\u00f9 il avait son domicile. En 1958, l'appelant avait aussi la g\u00e9rance, en vertu d'un contrat, de l'entreprise d'une compagnie qui s'occupait de concours de courses de chevaux \u00e0 Portland, Oregon, moyennant une part des profits. L'appelant a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire de son revenu lui provenant de cette source une somme de $5,241 comme \u00e9tant ses frais de d\u00e9placement entre Vancouver et Portland ainsi que ses frais de subsistance \u00e0 Portland durant la saison des courses. Le Ministre a permis la d\u00e9duction de $1,200 seulement. La Cour de l'Echiquier a maintenu la cotisation du Ministre. Le contribuable en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le Juge Judson \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Martland, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Les d\u00e9penses en question \u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles.

Pour que l'appelant puisse remplir les obligations qu'il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir par son contrat, il lui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'aller \u00e0 Portland et d'en revenir. En se basant sur la preuve, il est clair que toute l'op\u00e9ration, soit \u00e0 Vancouver ou \u00e0 Portland, \u00e9tait en fait une seule entreprise dirig\u00e9e par l'appelant et le revenu de cette entreprise provenant de diff\u00e9rents endroits g\u00e9ographiques \u00e9tait un revenu d'une entreprise prise comme un tout.\nLe Juge Judson, dissident: L'article 12(1)(a) de la Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu ne permet pas la d\u00e9duction de ces frais parce qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus dans l'exercice des affaires de l'appelant \u00e0 Portland, mais \u00e9taient des d\u00e9penses personnelles ou de subsistance.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Judson \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Sheppard, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nDavid A. Freeman, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and B. Verchere, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant and his brothers William and John for many years prior to 1957 were engaged in the business of managing horse racing activities at a number of race tracks in British Columbia at which pari-mutuel wagering was authorized. They conducted the business as managers of horse racing operations through the medium of a company incorporated in British Columbia as a private company named \u201cAscot Jockey Club Ltd.\u201d. The appellant and his brothers, while using the Ascot Company as their parent instrument, controlled a number of other companies which leased different race tracks in British Columbia. This procedure was followed to meet the requirements of British Columbia legislation limiting the racing each season to 14 days per track. In 1958 which is the year in question in this appeal, the racing season at the several tracks in which he was interested was 56 days in the Vancouver area and 14 days at Sandown on Vancouver Island. The functions of the appellant and his brothers included control of finances, selection of horses and personnel, arrangements for current and capital expenditure on plant and negotiations with horse owners. The appellant and his brothers were in full control at that level of management and they each received a salary of $12,000 for the year 1958. The appellant and his two brothers were also engaged along with two others called Geohegan in the management of a catering business, the partnership being responsible for all the catering at both Exhibition Park, Vancouver and Sandown on Van- couver Island. From this partnership the appellant earned the sum of $7,904.58 in 1958 and included this income in his 1958 return.\nIn 1957 the appellant and his brother John entered into an agreement with the Portland Turf Association, an incorporated company in the State of Oregon to manage the business affairs and transactions of the association arising out of the horse race meetings at Portland, Oregon, for a share of the profits and reasonable expenses. The agreement contained the following provisions:\n1. The Randalls covenant and agree that they will faithfully, honestly and diligently manage the business affairs and transactions of the Association arising out of the conducting and holding of horse race meetings for a term of ten (10) years from this date and will devote such time, labour, skill and attention to such employment as may be necessary.\n2. All horse race meetings shall be conducted and held in the name of the Association.\n3. All the business affairs and transactions arising out of the conducting and holding of the said horse race meetings shall be managed and taken care of by the Randalls, subject always to the control and direction of the Association so far as financial matters are concerned.\n4. The Association shall pay and bear all expenses arising out of the conducting and holding of the said horse race meetings and the Randalls shall not be required to assist in any way in the financing of the race meetings. Arrangements shall be made so that all cheques shall be signed by one of the Randalls and a person appointed by the Association.\n5. Each year, ninety (90) days prior to the opening of the racing season of the Association, the Randalls shall submit a budget to the Association and on approval thereof adequate funds shall be supplied by the Association.\n6. The Association covenants and agrees with the Randalls to conduct races on as many days as it is reasonably possible to do so and not in any event on less than forty (40) days each year.\n7. It is the intention of both the Association and the Randalls that the said race meetings shall be conducted in a similar manner to race meetings conducted by the companies in which the Randalls are associated at Hastings Park, in the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, and the Randalls shall be allowed by the Association to manage the said race meetings in such a manner.\n8. The Randalls shall be entitled to receive and be paid for their services as Managers one-half of one per cent (1\/2 of 1%) of all horse racing pools on races conducted at the race track owned or controlled by the Association, the said sum to be payable at the end of each week, and in addition thereto, the Randalls shall be allowed reasonable expenses, not to exceed Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars per year.\nThe $5,000 expense allowance provided for in para. 8 above was not dealt with as a separate item in the courts below nor was it referred to in this Court. It apparently is not relevant in these proceedings. In 1958 the appellant reported an income of $17,626.71 under this agreement and he claimed to deduct the sum of $5,241.53 as his expenses in travelling to and from Portland and his living expenses at Portland while there to manage the race track meetings and the business of the Portland Turf Association as called for in the agreement. The Minister of National Revenue allowed him $1,200 but disallowed the remainder. No details of how the $5,241.53 were made up were given nor were any details given showing how the $1,200 so allowed was computed. The appellant filed his income tax return for the year 1958 and by Notice of Re-Assessment dated August 4, 1964, the net amount of $4,011.63 of the expenses claimed by the appellant in connection with the Portland racing operation was disallowed. The appellant gave Notice of Objection to this re-assessment. The assessment was confirmed by the Minister and on September 15, 1965, his appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to the Tax Appeal Board. His appeal was heard by Mr. Cecil L. Snyder, Q.C., who dismissed the appeal An appeal was then taken to the Exchequer Court[2] and the case was heard by the Honourable F.A. Sheppard, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada at Vancouver who upheld the Tax Appeal Board. As appears from the judgment of the Tax Appeal Board, the amount of the expenses claimed as a deduction is not in dispute.\nThe appeal involves (1) whether the allowance of the expenses in question were excluded by s. 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act and (2) if not so excluded, whether the deduction of the expenses is allowable elsewhere.\nMr. Justice Sheppard found that the appellant was engaged in a business within the meaning of ss. 12(1)(a) and 12(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act. That finding was a correct one and was not disputed by counsel for the Minister in this Court. Section 12(1)(a) reads as follows:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\nand s. 12(1)(h) reads:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(h) personal or living expenses of the taxpayer except travelling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) incurred by the taxpayer while away from home in the course of carrying on his business, \u201cIncome\u201d is defined by s. 4 which reads:\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\nThe evidence was that the appellant made some 30 trips from Vancouver to Portland and back in 1958, and while at Portland lived part of the time at an hotel and part of the time in an apartment which the brothers had rented and which they occupied and used as an office when one or the other was in Portland looking after the operation there. The Portland race season in 1958 was 50 days and overlapped in part the British Columbia season.\nThe Minister contended that the appellant's expenses of travelling to Portland and his expenses of living there were not in the performance of any undertaking in the agreement but, on the contrary, were purely personal to him and outside the agreement. I am unable to accept that contention. It seems to me that if the appellant was going to fulfil the obligations he undertook to fulfil under the agreement in question, it was necessary for him to travel to and from Portland as the exigencies of the business there required him to do. The Minister relied on Bahamas General Trust Company et al v. Provincial Treasurer of Alberta[3], in which it was held that the expenses of a member of the Board of Directors of Canadian National Railways who being in Shanghai, China, on his own business and for pleasure when a meeting of the Canadian National Railways Board of Directors was called travelled from Shanghai to Montreal and back to Shanghai and claimed those expenses as deductible from his income. There is, in my view, no similarity between the two cases. The Minister also relied on Mahaffy v. The Minister of National Revenue[4], in which the question was whether a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta was entitled to his travelling and living expenses in attending a session of the Legislature under s. 5(1)(f) of the Income War Tax Act which was the same section as was dealt with in the Bahamas General Trust case, supra. Again I can see no similarity between the Mahaffy case and the present one. Rinfret C.J. in the Mahaffy case said in part: \u201cThe occupation of Members of Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies is neither a trade nor a business.\u201d On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Minister took a further objection that neither the income nor the expenses arising out of the Portland operation could be considered in arriving at the appellant's income, relying on the wording of s. 139(1)(az) which reads:\n(az) a taxpayer's income from a business, employment, property or other source of income or from sources in a particular place means the taxpayer's income computed in accordance with this Act on the assumption that he had during the taxation year no income except from that source or those sources of income and was entitled to no deductions except those related to that source or those sources;\nCounsel argued that the Portland operation had to be considered separate and apart from the British Columbia operations. I do not think that this follows because on the evidence that was before the Tax Appeal Board and before the learned Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada it becomes clear that the whole operation, whether at Vancouver or Sandown or at Portland, was in fact one business being conducted by the appellant and his brothers and that the income of that business from the various geographic bases was income from the business as a whole just as the business of a bank or any other enterprise which has branches in many areas remains one business and not many separate businesses, each to be dealt with separately.\nLocke J. in Interprovincial Pipe Line Company v. Minister of National Revenue[5] said at pp. 772-3:\nParagraphs (av) of s. 127(1) and (az) of s. 139(1) were intended, in my opinion, to prevent a taxpayer who might be engaged in two separate businesses not related to each other by reason of their nature from taking into account losses or expenses incurred in one in computing the taxable income of the other. By way of illustration, if a person engages in business as a hardware merchant in a country town and, at the same time, engages in farming or ranching, losses sustained or expenditures incurred in operations of the latter nature may not be taken into account in computing the taxable income from the hardware business, and vice-versa. The reason is that these operations are not related one to the other in the sense intended. The taxpayer's income from the hardware business is to be reckoned as if he had during the taxation year no income except from that source, according to the subsection. If, on the other hand, the merchant's business was that of the sale of produce and he should operate a truck farm for the purposes of obtaining supplies for his business, presumably these businesses would be considered to be related, within the meaning of the subsection.\nI accept this statement as the correct interpretation to be given to the subsection in question. The subsection has no application where businesses are so related even if carried on at different locations.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that the income tax assessment of the appellant for the 1958 taxation year be remitted to the Minister of National Revenue for re-assessment by allowing as a deduction from income of the appellant the sum of $4,011.63. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014Both the Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court have held that the appellant, Robert M. Randall, along with his brother, was carrying on business under the Portland agreement. Both tribunals, for identical reasons, have upheld the Minister's ruling that the travelling and hotel expenses were not deductible because they came within the prohibitions in ss. 12(1)(a) and 12(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act. These sections read:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n* * *\n(h) personal or living expenses of the taxpayer except travelling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) incurred by the taxpayer while away from home in the course of carrying on his business.\nSection 12(1)(a) prohibits the deduction of these expenses because they were not incurred in the course of carrying on the Portland business. The Chairman of the Board correctly states the principle in the following conclusion taken from his reasons:\nThere was no evidence that, when in Vancouver, the appellant did anything to benefit the Portland business nor did he carry on the business of either company while travelling between the two cities. It is not enough that expenses were incurred while the taxpayer was away from his home. They must also have been incurred in the course of carrying on his business. If a deduction could be granted the expense must have been incurred in the course of carrying on the business of horse racing at the Portland track. It cannot be found that, in travelling from Vancouver to Portland and return or in eating and sleeping at a Portland hotel or in an apartment rented in that city, the appellant was carrying on the business from which he seeks to deduct these expenses. He commenced carrying on that business when he arrived in Portland and ceased to do so when he left the city. Expenses of board and lodging are common to all taxpayers and the appellant incurred expenses \u201caway from home\u201d for these purposes only because he maintained his residence in Vancouver rather than in Portland. Section 12(1)(h) prohibits the deduction because these are personal or living expenses and do not come within the exception in s. 12(1)(h) because, for the reasons stated above, they were not incurred in the course of carrying on business. These expenses were obviously incurred while away from home. But that is not enough. To qualify for deduction, they must also have been incurred in the course of carrying on business.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Freeman, Freeman, Silvers & Koffman, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.S.

The police, in order to lay the trap, had secured the key from the owner of the house, who was willing to cooperate in this scheme. The accused had no thought of breaking and entering this house until approached by the informer. The accused was convicted of breaking and entering, and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law: Did the trial judge err in law in not charging the jury as to whether there was a consent to the breaking and entering?\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.\nOn the evidence, it was open to the jury to find that the owner of the house had placed the police officers in possession of it giving them authority to deal with it as they pleased and that they had not merely consented to the informer breaking into it with the assistance of the accused and others, but had urged him to do so. To break into a house in these circumstances is not an offence. On the assumption on which this appeal was argued, mens rea was clearly established but it was open to the jury to find that, notwithstanding the guilty intention of the appellant, the actus which was in fact committed was no crime at all.\nDroit criminel\u2014Introduction par effraction\u2014Pi\u00e8ge tendu par la police\u2014Accus\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9 par un mouchard\u2014Y a-t-il eu offense\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 292(1)(a), 597(1)(b).\nL\u2019accus\u00e9 et un autre homme ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9s par un mouchard d\u2019entreprendre de s\u2019introduire par effraction dans une r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Ottawa o\u00f9 des policiers les attendaient. Dans le but de tendre le pi\u00e8ge, les policiers avaient obtenu la clef du propri\u00e9taire de la maison, qui avait consenti \u00e0 coop\u00e9rer dans le projet. L\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas eu l\u2019intention de s\u2019introduire par effraction dans cette maison jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le mouchard le lui eut propos\u00e9. L\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de s\u2019\u00eatre introduit par effraction, et son appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel. Il a obtenu permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de droit suivante: Le Juge au proc\u00e8s a-t-il err\u00e9 en droit en n\u2019adressant pas le jury sur la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu consentement \u00e0 l\u2019introduction par effraction?\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 annul\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par un verdict d\u2019acquittement.\nSur la preuve, le jury \u00e9tait libre de trouver que le propri\u00e9taire de la maison avait mis les policiers en la possession d\u2019icelle, les autorisant d\u2019en faire ce qui leur plairait et que non seulement les policiers avaient consenti \u00e0 ce que le mouchard s\u2019y introduise par effraction avec l\u2019aide de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et d\u2019autres, mais qu\u2019ils avaient incit\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 le faire.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the accused\u2019s conviction. Appeal allowed.\nJohn F. Hamilton, for the appellant.\nC.M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014In October of 1964, the appellant, Florian Lemieux, was tried before a judge and jury on an indictment charging that he did\non the 17th day of November, A.D. 1963, at the City of Ottawa in the County of Carleton, unlawfully break and enter the dwelling house of Benjamin Achbar situated at premises numbered 905 Killeen Avenue in the said City of Ottawa, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, contrary to Section 292(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on February 24, 1965. His appeal to this Court, pursuant to leave granted under s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code is on the following question of law:\nDid the learned Trial Judge err in law in not charging the jury as to whether there was a consent to the breaking and entering?\nThe facts of the case which give rise to this suggested defence are very unusual. In November of 1963, the Ottawa Police were very anxious to arrest the members of a gang which was known as the \u201chooded gang\u201d and which was engaged in a series of break-ins in the Ottawa area. On November 16, 1963, one R.D. Bard telephoned an officer of the Ottawa Police Department to inform him that he had information about this gang. The officer immediately visited Bard at his house and Bard told him that he wanted money for his information. The officer then summoned another officer, who came to Bard\u2019s house. Then all three went to see an inspector of the Ottawa Police Department.\nBard and the first two mentioned officers next drove to the west end of the City of Ottawa to look for a house where a feigned break-in could be staged. They went to the neighbourhood of Killeen Avenue and Lenester Street where Bard pointed out a house at 905 Killeen Avenue belonging to Mr. Benjamin Achbar. Bard knew this house because some time before he had paved the laneway. The Police obtained the key to Achbar\u2019s house from Achbar himself and then staked out the premises.\nOn November 17, 1963, at 7.30 p.m., a car owned by Florian Lemieux drove past the house. There were three men in the car. Lemieux was driving under the direction of Bard. The third man was Jean Guindon. The car circled the block and was then parked near the house. Guindon and. Bard got out of the car. Lemieux remained behind the wheel. Guindon and Bard went to the side door and Guindon did the actual breaking with a screwdriver. The Police were waiting inside. Bard was arrested on the spot. Lemieux was arrested in the car. Guindon escaped and was arrested a short time later.\nBard was called at trial as a witness for the Crown. On cross-examination he did not remember what was discussed with the police on November 16, 1963; did not remember if he agreed to take part in the break-in; did not remember if the matter of a reward was discussed and did not remember that he had picked out the Achbar house for the purpose of breaking and entering.\nGuindon was also called as a Crown witness and testified that Lemieux knew nothing about the break-in and that he thought that he was driving Bard to the house for the purpose of enabling Bard to collect money owing to him. Guindon was declared a hostile witness and a previous inconsistent statement was put to him in which he had said that he had asked Lemieux to drive him to the house because he and Bard were going to break in. Guindon sought to minimize the effect of this statement by pleading lack of understanding of the contents because of language difficulties, but the two police officers who took the statement both said that Guindon had spoken to them in English that night.\nBoth Guindon and Lemieux were convicted by the jury. Their appeals to the Court of Appeal were also dismissed. Bard, the informer, pleaded guilty and received a heavy sentence. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed and he was acquitted.\nLemieux\u2019s appeal to this Court was argued on the basis that he knew that he was acting as a driver to take Bard and Guindon to a house that he had never seen and that these two were going to break in. What he did not know, however, was that he, along with Guindon, was being led into a trap. It is quite clear that he and Guindon were solicited by Bard, the informer, to undertake this break-in. The police had secured the key from the owner of the house, who was willing to co-operate in this scheme. In the present case Lemieux had no thought of breaking and entering this house until he was approached by Bard, who was acting under police instruction. The police had obtained the consent of the owner to use the premises in the hope that they would be able to arrest certain criminals.\nThe case is very different from Rex v. Chandler[1], where an accused who intended to break into a shop sought a key from the servant of the owner of the shop. This servant informed his master. The key was supplied and the police were waiting for the shop-breaker when he arrived. The key in this case was supplied by the servant only for the purpose that the criminal might be detected in the commission of the offence. The criminal was guilty of shop-breaking.\nBut in Lemieux\u2019s case, the facts are not at all similar. The police set the whole scheme in motion through Bard. He was to lead a man who at first had no intention of breaking and entering, who went to the scene of the crime at Bard\u2019s instigation and who was led into the trap by Bard.\nOn the evidence it was open to the jury to find that the owner of the house had placed the police officers in possession of it giving them authority to deal with it as they pleased and that they had not merely consented to Bard breaking into it with the assistance of others, but had urged him to do so. To break into a house in these circumstances is not an offence.\nFor Lemieux to be guilty of the offence with which he was charged, it was necessary that two elements should co-exist, (i) that he had committed the forbidden act, and (ii) that he had the wrongful intention of so doing. On the assumption on which the appeal was argued mens rea was clearly established but it was open to the jury to find that, notwithstanding the guilty intention of the appellant, the actus which was in fact committed, was no crime at all.\nIn my opinion, if the jury had been properly charged on this aspect of the matter and had taken the view of the facts which it has been pointed out above it was open to them to take, they would have acquitted the appellant.\nHad Lemieux in fact committed the offence with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act at the solicitation of an agent provocateur would have been irrelevant to the question of his guilt or innocence. The reason that this conviction cannot stand is that the jury were not properly instructed on a question vital to the issue whether any offence had been committed.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered.\nAppeal allowed and conviction quashed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John F. Hamilton, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1913] 1 K.B. 125 at 127, 8 Cr. App. Rep. 82.\n",

An application for leave to appeal was made orally by the appellants during the hearing of the application to quash.\nHeld: The application to quash should be granted and the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 151 of the Bankruptcy Act applies to this appeal, and the appeal to this Court could only be taken by leave of a judge of this Court.\nApart from the fact that no notice of an application for leave to appeal was served on the other party at least 14 days before the hearing, as required by rule 53 of the Bankruptcy Rules, the application for leave to appeal could not be granted as no \u201cspecial reasons\u201d, as required by that rule, existed.\nAppels\u2014Requ\u00eate pour rejet\u2014Permission d\u2019appeler\u2014Faillite\u2014Ordonnance permettant \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier d\u2019intenter des proc\u00e9dures en son propre nom\u2014Appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Application de l\u2019art. 151 de la Loi sur la Faillite, S.R.C. 1952, c. 14\u2014R\u00e8gle 53 des R\u00e8gles de la Faillite.\nAyant obtenu une ordonnance les autorisant \u00e0 intenter des proc\u00e9dures en leur propre nom en vertu de l\u2019art. 16 de la Loi sur la Faillite, S.R.C. 1952, c. 14, les appelants, comme cr\u00e9anciers de la faillite, ont intent\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures devant les cours civiles ordinaires pour faire d\u00e9terminer des questions de priorit\u00e9 et de garantie. \u00c9ventuellement, un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour du jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 par les demandeurs, comme appelants, sans avoir obtenu l\u2019autorisation requise par l\u2019art. 151 de la Loi sur la Faillite.

Motion to quash granted and motion for leave to appeal dismissed.\nW.C. Newman, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nR. Penner, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an application to quash the appeal, made by the respondents Arlington Management Consultants Ltd. and Prairie Foundry Ltd.\nD. Smith & Sons Ltd. were the subject of a Receiving Order in Bankruptcy on January 29, 1965. The appellants and others as creditors requested the trustee in bankruptcy to take proceedings to determine what amount, if any, was due to the Industrial Development Bank or its assignee on account of a certain property mortgage given by the bankrupt to the bank and to take proceedings to determine the force and effect, if any, of an assignment in writing by the bankrupt to Lipman Holdings Ltd. of which the respondents in this appeal are the successors. The trustee, under the direction of the inspectors, refused by reason of lack of funds in the bankrupt estate to take such proceedings. The said creditors therefore applied to the Court in Bankruptcy for an order under s. 16 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, and on March 13, 1965, Smith J., as a judge in Bankruptcy, made an order permitting the applicants to commence and prosecute proceedings in their own name and at their own expense and risk for the said purpose.\nProceedings were commenced in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the Province of Manitoba by statement of claim dated November 19, 1965. The proceedings purported to be those authorized by the said order although the statement of claim was very much broader in scope than that authorized by the order of Smith J.\nAfter consultation by counsel it was agreed that certain questions of law should be stated in the form of a special case for the opinion of the court, i.e., the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. By reasons for judgment dated October 17, 1966, Hall J. answered those questions. An appeal therefrom was taken to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[2], and by the judgment of that Court pronounced on February 21, 1967, such appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs as appellants served notice of appeal to this Court. No application for leave to take the said appeal to this Court was made by the appellants and no order was made granting such leave. Under these circumstances, the respondents applied to quash the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the same is barred by s. 151 of the Bankruptcy Act. Other grounds for the application were urged but they need not be considered in these reasons.\nIt is the position taken by the appellants that s. 151 of the Bankruptcy Act has no application to this appeal as the proceedings were carried on in the ordinary courts of the Province of Manitoba.\nSection 151 of the Bankruptcy Act provides:\n151. The decision of the Court of Appeal upon any appeal is final and conclusive unless special leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of that Court. The issues raised by the appellants in the appeal are as follows:\n1. Whether or not the title of the trustee in bankruptcy by virtue of the receiving order made on January 20, 1965 against D. Smith & Sons Ltd. takes priority over an assignment of choses in action by the bankrupt made on June 4, 1963.\n2. Whether or not the respondent Arlington Management Consultants Ltd. loses its right to claim both as a secured creditor and as an unsecured creditor against the assets and estate of D. Smith & Sons Ltd. because it requested a deferment of the valuation of one of the securities held by it and therefore is barred from dividend by the provisions of s. 92 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nIt is to be noted that these proceedings could not have been commenced by the creditors without the leave as granted by Smith J. under the provisions of s. 16 of the Bankruptcy Act. Counsel for the appellants has agreed with this proposition. It is true that the proceedings were commenced in the ordinary civil law courts after authorization given by the Judge in Bankruptcy. Counsel for the appellants therefore submits that when the trustee did not assert any claim the provision of the Bankruptcy Act had no application, and that under such circumstances the procedure in the Bankruptcy Court was not available to the plaintiffs. It is difficult to understand how that submission can be valid in view of rule 86 of the Rules in Bankruptcy which provides for \u201ca trustee or any other person\u201d applying to the court to set aside or void any settlement. The \u201ccourt\u201d in that rule is that defined in s. 2(g) as \u201cthe court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy or a judge thereof\u2026\u201d\nCounsel for the appellants, as respondents on this motion to quash, cites Princeton Tailors Ltd. ex parte the Dominion Bank[3]. In that case the bank applied for a declaration that it had at the date of the bankruptcy of the debtor a claim upon the goods of the bankrupt superior to that of the landlord\u2019s claim for rent as against the same goods. Sedgwick J. held that he was bound by the judgment of the court in Canadian Carpet and Comforter Mfg. Co., ex parte A.G. of Canada[4] and must hold that the Bankruptcy Court had no jurisdiction in the bankruptcy proceedings to hear and determine the rights of the bank and landlord as between themselves. That situation is not the one presented in this application. Here the creditors take their action as creditors of the estate of the bankrupt, and any fruits of the litigation would flow to them as such creditors. Moreover, if the said fruits of the litigation exceeded their claims and their necessary costs, by the provisions of s. 16(2) of the Bankruptcy Act such excess, if any, goes to the estate of the bankrupt. It should be noted that in Garage Causapscal Lt\u00e9e., Traders Finance Corpn. v. Levesque[5], when a trustee in bankruptcy had refused to take proceedings to void a fraudulent preference an order was made under s. 16 enabling an individual creditor to take such proceedings at its own risk. The creditor then proceeded by means of a petition to the Superior Court sitting in Bankruptcy. The decision of the Superior Court was appealed to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) in the Province of Quebec and further, upon leave granted, to this Court.\nIn view of these circumstances, I am of the opinion that s. 151 of the Bankruptcy Act applies to this appeal and that as a bankruptcy proceeding, both by virtue of the order made by Smith J. and because of the character of the issues in the appeal, an appeal to this Court may only be taken by leave of a judge of this Court. As I have said, no such leave was applied for until the hearing of this application to quash when the appellants, opposing this application to quash, in the alternative, asked leave to appeal. That application was made on May 1, 1967.\nRule 53 of the Bankruptcy Rules, as amended by P.C. 1962-371, provides:\n53. An application for special leave to appeal from a decision of a Court of Appeal and to fix the security for costs, if any, may be made to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within sixty days after the date of the decision appealed from, or within such extended time as a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada may for special reasons allow, either during or after the said period of sixty days, and notice of the application for leave to appeal or to extend the time in which to apply for such leave shall be served on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof. It is to be noted that such rule now permits the application for special leave to appeal to be made to a judge of this Court after the expiration of sixty days from the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal if such extended time is allowed for special reasons by a judge of this Court and thereby confers upon the judge of this Court the jurisdiction which Fauteux J. held in Ferland v. Desjardins et al.[6] we lacked. However, notice of such application for special leave to appeal must be served on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof. No such notice was of course served in the present case, the application was simply made orally during the argument.\nIn Re Hudson Fashion Shoppe Ltd.[7], Anglin C.J.C. found there was no power in a judge of the Court to abridge such fourteen-day period and the amendment to rule 53 does not appear to have conferred such jurisdiction.\nEven apart from such lack of notice, I am of the opinion that special leave to appeal should not be granted in this case. The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba was pronounced on February 21, 1967, and on March 20, 1967, the solicitors for the appellants were notified as follows:\nInsofar as your appeal to the Supreme Court is concerned, we respectfully suggest also that it is precluded by Section 151 of The Bankruptcy Act. In the event that leave is required we propose to oppose leave being given.\nIn view of such clear notification, it is difficult to understand how the \u201cspecial reasons\u201d required by Bankruptcy Rule 53 in order to confer jurisdiction to extend time for application for special leave could exist.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the application to quash the appeal must be granted with costs, and that the appellants\u2019 application for leave to appeal must be refused without costs.\nApplication to quash granted; application for leave to appeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Zuken & Penner, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Newman, MacLean & Associates, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1967), 59 W.W.R. 382, 62 D.L.R.

Under the terms of the lease, the respondent as lessee covenanted to pay all taxes imposed in respect of the personal property, business or income of the lessee pertaining to the demised premises, and the appellant as lessor covenanted to pay all real property taxes assessed thereon. The lease also provided that trade or tenant\u2019s fixtures installed by the lessee should remain the property of the lessee and might be removed by it at any time during its occupancy of the demised premises.\nThe appellant brought action for a declaration that the respondent was liable to pay that part of the municipal taxes levied in respect of the demised premises which was attributable to the value of the fixtures installed by the lessee in the said premises and asked for a reference to determine the amounts payable and for consequential relief. The action failed at trial, and, on appeal, the judgment of the trial judge was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe assessment on which the taxes in question were based was made on land and both by statute and the common law the buildings and the fixtures placed upon the assessed land were a part thereof. Until the lessee exercised its rights to remove the fixtures they were, even as between it and the lessor, a part of the realty rather than personalty; but the real question was not as to the type of the individual items of property making up the total assessment but as to the type of tax. It was impossible to say that these were other than \u201creal property taxes\u201d.\nBain v. Brand (1876), 1 App. Cas. 762, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Schatz J. Appeal dismissed. \\Mayer Lerner, Q.C., and B.T. Granger, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDouglas K. Laidlaw, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] affirming a judgment of Schatz J.\nThe appellant is the owner of a parcel of land in London, Ontario, on which it has constructed a shopping centre including a store built to the respondent\u2019s specifications and leased to the respondent by a lease dated December 28, 1959, and executed under seal by both parties.\nThe appellant brought action for a declaration that the respondent was liable to pay that part of the municipal taxes levied in respect of the demised premises which was attributable to the value of the fixtures installed by the lessee in the demised premises and asked for a reference to determine the amounts payable and for consequential relief.\nThe term commenced on July 1, 1960, and was for a period of 20 years, ending June 30, 1980. It provided for a minimum annual rent of $32,500 with additional rent equal to the amount, if any, by which one per cent of gross sales during each lease year exceeded the minimum rent, but not to exceed $45,000.\nThe lease contains the following terms which are relevant to the determination of this appeal:\n8. THE LESSEE COVENANTS WITH THE LESSOR:\n(c) To pay all taxes, charges, rates and licence fees assessed, rated or imposed in respect of the personal property, business or income of the Lessee pertaining to the demised premises, as and when the same become due and payable, subject to any proceedings which may be taken by the Lessee by way of appeal of or from any such taxes, charges, rates, or fees or the assessment thereof;\nIf the real property taxes, including local improvement rates, upon the demised premises shall be increased after the \u201cbase tax year\u201d, during the term of this lease, the Lessee shall pay each and every such increase of taxes that may be levied, rated, charged or assessed against the demised premises or any part thereof and if such property taxes including local improvement rates shall be increased during any renewal term of this lease, the Lessee shall pay fifty percent (50%) of each and every such increase; for the purposes of this paragraph (c) and during the original term of this lease and each renewal term thereof, the third full calendar year of the term of this lease shall be the \u201cbase tax year\u201d; the taxes payable for the base tax year shall be the \u201cbase taxes\u201d for the term of this lease and each renewal term hereof.\n* * *\nThe term \u201creal property taxes\u201d as used in this lease shall include all real estate taxes, rates, duties and assessments whatsoever, whether Municipal, Provincial or Dominion, or imposed by any other competent taxing authority; provided, however, that nothing in this lease contained shall require the Lessee to pay any franchise, corporate, estate, inheritance, succession, capital levy or transfer tax of the Lessor or any income or profits tax upon the rent payable by the Lessee under this lease or any levy or tax of a similar kind and nature whatsoever;\n10. Provided that any trade or tenants fixtures installed in or attached to the demised premises by and at the expense of the Lessee shall remain the property of the Lessee and Lessor agrees that the Lessee shall have the right at any time and from time to time during its occupancy of the demised premises to remove any and all of such fixtures but in the event the Lessee shall in such removal do damage to the demised premises it shall make good any damage which it may occasion thereto;\n11. THE LESSOR COVENANTS WITH THE LESSEE:\n(c) To pay all real property taxes, rates, levies, duties, charges, assessments and impositions whatsoever whether Municipal, Parliamentary or otherwise that may be levied, rated, charged or assessed upon the demised premises and upon all driveways, parking and loading areas and sidewalks in the Shopping Centre during the original term of this lease or any renewal thereof save and except such taxes, charges, rates and licence fees as the Lessee covenants to pay as hereinbefore provided.\nIn my view, the relevant words of the lease are free from ambiguity, either patent or latent, and the decision of the appeal must turn upon the true construction of the words which the parties have used.\nThe taxes which the appellant seeks to have apportioned between the parties are those levied by the municipality in pursuance of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23. Section 4 of that Act provides that, subject to certain exemptions with which we are not concerned, \u201call real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation\u201d. Section 1(i) (iv) defines \u201creal property\u201d as including, inter alia:\n(iv) all buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to land\u2026 Quite apart from this statutory provision it is, I think, settled law that the lessee\u2019s fixtures become part of the land although it has, of course, the right to remove them. In Bain v. Brand[3], the Lord Chancellor said at p. 770:\nThe fixture does become part of the inheritance; it does not remain a moveable quoad omnia; there does exist on the part of the tenant a right to remove that which has been thus fixed, but if he does not exercise that right it continues to be that which it became when it was first fixed, a part of the inheritance.\nThe assessment on which the taxes in question are based is made on land and both by statute and the common law the buildings and the fixtures placed upon the assessed land are a part thereof. Until the lessee exercises its right to remove the fixtures they are, even as between it and the lessor, a part of the realty rather than personalty; but the real question is not as to the type of the individual items of property making up the total assessment but as to the type of tax. I find it impossible to say that these are other than \u201creal property taxes\u201d.\nThe appellant argues that the words \u201cthe demised premises\u201d as used in this lease mean only the land and the empty building erected upon it. I am unable to adopt this construction. By paras. 1 and 2 of the lease,\nThe Lessor doth hereby demise and lease unto the lessee its successors and assigns:\n(a) All and singular that messuage and tenement, situate lying and being in the Township of London, in the County of Middlesex, and being composed of the lands and premises shown outlined in Green in Schedule \u201cB\u201d hereto annexed; (together with a right of way)\nto have and to hold the demised premises for and during the said term of 20 years\u2026\nThe lands outlined in green in Schedule \u201cB\u201d consist of a rectangular parcel of land 144 feet 9 inches by 132 feet 2 inches within which a part is outlined in red and marked \u201cSteinberg\u2019s\u201d. I can find nothing in the lease or the sketch to support the view that the words \u201cthe demised premises\u201d do not include whatever should from time to time become a part of the parcel of land demised.\nHad it been the intention of the parties that the lessee should pay a proportion of the municipal taxes in the ratio of the assessed value of its fixtures to the assessed value of the land and building excluding the fixtures it would have been a simple matter to so provide in the lease, and it would seem probable that some form of procedure would have been provided for determining what proportion of the total assessment was attributable to the value of the fixtures, for the notice of assessment would not place any separate value on fixtures.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Lerner, Lerner, Bradley & Cherniak, London.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Siskind, Taggart & Cromarty, London.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 167, 41 D.L.R.

In March 1958, a patent was issued to the inventor and was assigned to the plaintiff in January 1959. The latter, in March 1962, petitioned for a reissue of its patent, stating that it was deemed defective because of insufficient description or specification and because, in certain respects, the inventor had claimed more and, in others, less than he had the right to claim as new. On January 1963, a reissue patent was issued to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 50 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203.\nThe plaintiff sued the defendant in respect of alleged infringement of these patents and sought a declaration that, as between the parties, the original patent was valid up to the date of the reissuance and that the latter was a valid patent. The defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that both patents were invalid. The action was dismissed by the trial judge and the declaration of invalidity was granted. The trial judge held that the broom in question was the embodiment of an invention of which F.M. was the inventor, but that the inventiveness was neither disclosed nor claimed in the original surrendered patent and that s. 50 of the Patent Act did not authorize the grant of a reissue patent for an invention that had not been disclosed or claimed by the original patent. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe patent was defective by reason of insufficient description, and this resulted from mistake, i.e., a failure by the patent attorney fully to comprehend and to describe the invention for which he had been instructed to seek a patent. This was a proper case for the application of s. 50 of the Patent Act, and the Commissioner was entitled to grant a reissue patent.\nThe contention that s. 50 only permits the granting of a reissue patent to the original patentee and not to an assignee, could not be entertained. The rights provided in the reissue section of the Act are not restricted to the original patentee solely.\nThe further contention that s. 50 was not applicable because the original patent had not been surrendered within 4 years from its date as required by s. 50(1) could not be entertained. The surrender of the patent required under s. 50(1) refers to the step taken by the applicant for the reissue patent when he makes his application. It is that step which must be taken within the stipulated 4-year period, and this was done in this case.\nBrevets\u2014Contrefa\u00e7on\u2014Validit\u00e9\u2014Balai pour le jeu de curling\u2014Red\u00e9livrance de brevet\u2014Brevet original ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lant pas les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019invention\u2014Manquement peut-il \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par red\u00e9livrance d\u2019un nouveau brevet\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 50.\nEn 1955, un nomm\u00e9 F.M. a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un nouveau genre de balai pour le jeu de curling. Au mois de mars 1958, un brevet a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inventeur et a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse en janvier 1959. Cette derni\u00e8re, en mars 1962, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour obtenir la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un nouveau brevet, d\u00e9clarant que son brevet \u00e9tait jug\u00e9 \u00eatre d\u00e9fectueux \u00e0 cause d\u2019une description ou sp\u00e9cification insuffisante et parce que, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, l\u2019inventeur avait revendiqu\u00e9 plus qu\u2019il n\u2019avait droit de revendiquer \u00e0 titre d\u2019invention nouvelle et, \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9gards, il avait revendiqu\u00e9 moins. En janvier 1963, un nouveau brevet a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse en vertu de l\u2019art. 50 de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203.\nLa demanderesse a poursuivi la d\u00e9fenderesse pour violation de ces deux brevets et a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, entre les parties, le brevet original \u00e9tait valide jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de red\u00e9livrance et que le nouveau brevet \u00e9tait valide. La d\u00e9fenderesse, par contre-demande, a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les deux brevets \u00e9taient invalides. L\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le juge au proc\u00e8s et la d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a jug\u00e9 que le balai en question \u00e9tait l\u2019incarnation d\u2019une invention dont F.M. \u00e9tait l\u2019inventeur, mais que le g\u00e9nie inventif n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ni r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ni revendiqu\u00e9 dans le brevet original et que l\u2019art. 50 de la Loi sur les Brevets n\u2019autorise pas la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un nouveau brevet pour une invention qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e ou revendiqu\u00e9e dans le brevet original. La demanderesse en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu. Le brevet \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux \u00e0 cause d\u2019une description insuffisante, et ceci \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une m\u00e9prise, i.e., le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019avocat des brevets de comprendre et de d\u00e9crire l\u2019invention pour laquelle il avait re\u00e7u instruction d\u2019obtenir un brevet. Ceci est un cas appropri\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 50 de la Loi sur les Brevets, et le commissaire avait le droit d\u2019accorder un nouveau brevet.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019art. 50 permet d\u2019accorder un nouveau brevet seulement au d\u00e9tenteur original et non pas \u00e0 celui \u00e0 qui il a \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9, ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenue. Les droits accord\u00e9s dans la partie de la loi traitant de la red\u00e9livrance ne sont pas restreints seulement au d\u00e9tenteur original du brevet.\nUne autre pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019art. 50 ne s\u2019appliquait pas parce que le brevet original n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de 4 ans \u00e0 compter de la date de son \u00e9mission, tel que requis par l\u2019art. 50 (1), ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenue.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 in a matter of infringement of a patent. Appeal allowed.\nMiss Joan Clark and Malcolm E. McLeod, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nWalter C. Newman, Q.C., and Edwin A. Foster, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This case involves a patent, numbered 554,826, issued on March 25, 1958, to Fernand Marchessault, in respect of the invention of a new style of curling broom, and a reissue of the patent, numbered 656,934, issued on January 29, 1963, to the appellant company, the assignee of Fernand Marchessault, of which he is the president and principal shareholder. The appellant sued the respondent in the Exchequer Court1 in respect of alleged infringement of these patents, and seeking a declaration that, as between the parties, the former patent was valid up to the date of the reissuance and that the latter was a valid patent. The respondent counterclaimed for a declaration that both patents were invalid. The action was dismissed and the declaration sought in the counterclaim was granted. The facts, as outlined in the reasons for judgment at trial, are substantially repeated here:\nPrior to 1955, the brooms employed in Canada by participants in the game of curling were normally like ordinary kitchen brooms except that the straws were substantially longer. Such a broom consisted of a cylindrical wooden handle to one end of which was attached a bundle of straws of some suitable kind, the bundle of straws being pressed into a roughly flat broad shape and held in that shape by a number of tight bindings (three or four) near the handle. The opposite sides of these bindings were so stitched together through the straws that they held the bundle of straws in the flat broad shape. These bindings were attached by a machine process and are hereafter referred to as the factory bindings. Such brooms were employed in the game of curling to sweep the ice on which the game is played, in front of the curling stone as it travelled down the ice while in play. Among others, such brooms had the following characteristics:\n(a) As the straws were all of approximately the same length, the outside straws tended, under the influence of vigorous sweeping, to break off at the lowest factory binding.\n(b) As there was a relatively long distance between the lowest factory binding and the part of the broom that came in contact with the ice, the straws tended to spread out on coming in contact with the ice, thus diminishing the force which would otherwise be applied to the ice at the particular place that the player intended to sweep.\nAbout the end of 1953, Fernand Marchessault became interested in breaking into the business of making and selling curling brooms in Canada. In the course of attempting to do so, he developed a new type of curling broom which differs from the type of curling broom above described in that\n(a) it has a \u201cshort outer skirt\u201d of straws surrounding the straws that come in contact with the ice (referred to as the \u201csweeping straws\u201d)\u2014the outer straws, not being as long as the sweeping straws, are not subject to pressure from the ice and are not as likely to break against the factory binding; they also supply support for the sweeping straws and provide protection to the loose lower binding hereinafter referred to; and\n(b) it has a binding around the sweeping straws about half-way between the lower factory binding and the sweeping end of the broom; such binding is applied by hand and not by machine and is loose enough so that the straws can move in relation to it but it is tight enough and it has its opposite sides so stitched together that the sweeping straws are held together and cannot spread appreciably in any direction. This loose lower binding is attached by cords to the lowest factory binding so that it will not slide off the sweeping end of the broom.\nThis new style broom is narrower and thicker than the old style broom.\nIn the fall of 1955, Marchessault introduced brooms of this kind to curlers in various parts of Canada and almost immediately they became very popular. Curlers in substantial numbers preferred them to the old style broom because the short outer skirt solved, to a considerable extent, the very troublesome problem of broken straws and because the loose lower binding kept the sweeping straws together in such a way that much greater force could be applied to the ice that it was desired to sweep. In addition, the concentration of straws enabled some curlers to develop a rhythmic beat.\nCommercial success followed the introduction of this broom both for Marchessault and the appellant, and for various competitors who imitated his new style broom.\nOn March 1, 1956, Marchessault filed an application for a Canadian patent and on March 25, 1958, Patent No, 554,826 was issued to him pursuant to that application. The specification reads as follows:\nLa pr\u00e9sente invention se rapporte \u00e0 un nouveau balai destin\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement pour le jeu de curling.\nLe but principal de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai de grande \u00e9lasticit\u00e9 et de grande souplesse. Un autre but de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai dont les fibres le composant sont de grande longueur sans risque de se disloquer ni de se briser.\nEncore un but de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai qui est souple et bien mont\u00e9.\nEncore un but de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai homog\u00e8ne dont la qualit\u00e9 des fibres ne varie pas.\nEncore un but de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai qui est tr\u00e8s fort c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en rapport avec le volume de fibres qui le compose de sorte qu\u2019il peut durer longtemps, les bouts ne se fendant pas et ne produisant pas de fentes.\nEnfin, encore un but de l\u2019invention est d\u2019obtenir un balai du but et caract\u00e8re d\u00e9crits qui est de construction rationnelle et constitue une innovation tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans le monde du curling.\nDans les buts pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, l\u2019invention consiste en un faisceau plat de longues fibres v\u00e9g\u00e9tales fix\u00e9es sur un bout d\u2019un manche. Le faisceau est \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les fibres ext\u00e9rieures ne se rendent pas \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9. Comme tous les balais, \u00e0 courte distance de la fixation au manche, le faisceau de fibres comporte plusieurs ligatures transversales qui sont cach\u00e9es par une gaine de toile. Les fibres se rendant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du balai comportent en outre une ligature transversale cach\u00e9e par les fibres ext\u00e9rieures. Cette derni\u00e8re ligature est reli\u00e9e par des cordelettes aux ligatures sup\u00e9rieures afin qu\u2019elle ne puisse se d\u00e9placer.\nJ\u2019obtiens les buts pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s au moyen de l\u2019invention illustr\u00e9e dans les dessins ci-joints et dans lesquels:\nLa figure 1 est une vue en \u00e9l\u00e9vation d\u2019un balai construit selon l\u2019invention;\nLa figure 2 est une vue semblable \u00e0 celle de la figure pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, sauf qu\u2019elle est partiellement en coupe;\nLa figure 3 est une vue de c\u00f4t\u00e9; et\nLa figure 4 est une autre vue de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et illustrant l\u2019emploi de l\u2019invention.\nDans la description qui suit et les dessins qui l\u2019accompagnent les chiffres semblables renvoient \u00e0 des parties identiques dans les diverses figures.\nComme tous les balais, le balai constituant la pr\u00e9sente invention comporte un manche 1 \u00e0 un bout duquel est fix\u00e9 un faisceau de fibres v\u00e9g\u00e9tales 2. Ces fibres sont de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence des fibres simples et r\u00e9sistant \u00e0 l\u2019eau. Elles peuvent toutefois \u00eatre de tampico tir\u00e9 de feuilles d\u2019un agrave du Mexique, de coco provenant de fibres entourant la noix de coco, de paille de sorgho, ou de piassava provenant de palmiers de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Sud. L\u2019invention ne r\u00e9side cependant pas dans le choix de fibres mais plut\u00f4t dans la construction de balai. Celui-ci est reli\u00e9 au manche 1 par une forte ligature de broche 3 et le joint cach\u00e9 par une bague m\u00e9tallique tronconique 4 elle-m\u00eame fix\u00e9e par une autre ligature de fil m\u00e9tallique 5.\nA courte distance de la fixation au manche, le faisceau 2 comporte plusieurs ligatures transversales et parall\u00e8les 6 \u00e0 l\u2019aide de cordelettes. Dans les dessins, ces ligatures sont au nombre de quatre. Une cinqui\u00e8me ligature 7 est form\u00e9e un peu plus bas dans un but qui sera expliqu\u00e9 plus loin. Ces ligatures sont cach\u00e9es par une gaine de toile 8 dont la surface peut recevoir un texte publicitaire ou un \u00e9cusson d\u2019un club de curling.\nLe faisceau 2 est obtenu de fibres v\u00e9g\u00e9tales tr\u00e8s longues qui forment deux groupes d\u2019in\u00e9gales longueurs. Les fibres int\u00e9rieures 9 sont les plus longues et les autres 10 formant le tour des premi\u00e8res sont les plus courtes. Au point du vue apparence le bout du faisceau est \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages. Les fibres le plus longues 9 comportent une ligature transversale 11 sous les fibres 10 de sorte qu\u2019elle est invisible \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il. Pour que cette ligature ne puisse se d\u00e9placer elle est reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la ligature 7 ou \u00e0 toute autre partie fixe du balai par des cordelettes 12 ou tout autre lien.\nDans l\u2019emploi de l\u2019invention, particuli\u00e8rement pour le jeu de curling o\u00f9 le palet lanc\u00e9 par le joueur doit glisser sur la glace, le balayage facilitant le parcours doit s\u2019effectuer rapidement et couvrir beaucoup de surface. Le balai constituant la pr\u00e9sente invention permet un emploi rapide sans risque de briser les fibres. Ces derni\u00e8res qui sont longues conservent leur homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 tel que la figure 4 des dessins l\u2019illustre. Les fibres 9 se courbent sous la pouss\u00e9e et ne se m\u00e9langent pas avec les fibres 10. Les fibres 10 constituent un arc-boutant pour les fibres et ces derni\u00e8res conservent cette hommog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la ligature 11. En m\u00eame temps les fibres 10 prot\u00e8gent la ligature 11 int\u00e9rieure contre l\u2019usure et servent de garde aux fibres longues pour les emp\u00eacher de briser. Le balai peut donc \u00eatre ploy\u00e9 dans les deux sens sans qu\u2019il ne puisse se briser.\nQuoiqu\u2019une seule forme sp\u00e9cifique de l\u2019invention ait \u00e9t\u00e9 illustr\u00e9e et d\u00e9crite, il est bien entendu que divers changements \u00e0 la construction de l\u2019invention peuvent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s pourvu que l\u2019on ne se d\u00e9parte pas de son esprit tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans les revendications qui suivent.\nLes r\u00e9alisations de l\u2019invention au sujet desquelles un droit exclusif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de privil\u00e8ge est revendiqu\u00e9, sont d\u00e9finies comme suit:\n1. Un balai form\u00e9 d\u2019un faisceau de fibres fix\u00e9es \u00e0 un bout d\u2019un manche, lesdites fibres \u00e9tant \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les fibres sont en deux groupes d\u2019in\u00e9gales longueurs, ledit groupe de fibres plus longues que celles de l\u2019autre groupe formant le centre du faisceau tandis que ledit autre groupe l\u2019entoure.\n2. Un balai tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans la revendication 1, dans lequel lesdites fibres des deux dits groupes comportent des ligatures transversales, les ligatures dudit centre de faisceau \u00e9tant sous ledit autre groupe qui l\u2019entoure.\n3. Un balai tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans la revendication 1, dans lequel lesdites fibres des deux dits groupes comportent des ligatures transversales, les ligatures dudit centre de faisceau \u00e9tant sous ledit autre groupe qui l\u2019entoure et suspendues auxdites ligatures dudit autre groupe.\n4. Un balai tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans la revendication 1, dans lequel lesdites fibres des deux dits groupes comportent des ligatures transversales, les ligatures dudit centre de faisceau \u00e9tant sous ledit autre groupe qui l\u2019entoure et suspendues par cordelettes auxdites ligatures dudit autre groupe.\nThe drawings appear on the following page.\nOn January 28, 1959, Marchessault assigned this patent to the plaintiff.\nIn connection with the application for Patent No. 554,826, Marchessault was represented by a patent attorney whose name was Albert Fournier. Fournier, in February 1957, also made an application on behalf of Marchessault for an invention concerning curling brooms under the United States patent legislation. [Page 522]\nThe claims put forward in the original United States application were not in the same terms as the claims subsequently allowed in the Canadian patent, but they followed the same general lines. They were all rejected by the United States Patent Office on the ground that they were anticipated by prior patents. In May 1959, Fournier was replaced by Pierre Lesperance as Marchessault\u2019s attorney in connection with this United States application. After some negotiation, a United States patent issued, on May 16, 1961, containing a number of claims, of which the first, second and fifth read as follows:\n1. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of long fibres, closely spaced bindings extending around said fibers, an additional flexible binding loosely surrounding and loosely stitched through said fibers and slidable relative to said fibers and spaced from said first named bindings a distance about half way between the sweeping end of the broom and said closely spaced bindings, and flexible ties having one end connected to said additional binding and having their other end fixed with respect to said first named bindings in order to prevent slipping of said additional binding off said fibers.\n2. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of a central bunch, and an outer bunch of fibers, substantially closely spaced bindings extending around the two bunches of fibers, and an additional binding surrounding only the central bunch of fibers and covered by the fibers of the outer bunch, said additional binding being spaced from said first named bindings a distance about half way between said first named bindings and the sweeping ends of said fibers.\n* * *\n5. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of a central bunch of relatively long fibers and an outer bunch of shorter fibers forming a skirt surrounding the upper part of the central bunch, closely spaced cord bindings extending around the two bunches of fibers, and an additional cord binding surrounding only said central bunch of fibers and covered by the free end portions of the fibers of the outer bunch, said additional cord binding being spaced from said first named cord bindings a distance about half way between said first named cord bindings and the sweeping ends of said fibers.\nOn March 21, 1962, the appellant petitioned for reissue of its patent, stating that it was deemed defective because of insufficient description or specification and because, in certain respects, the appellant had claimed more and, in others, less than he had the right to claim as new.\nThe petition then went on to state:\nThat the respects in which the patent is deemed defective are as follows: In the description of the Patent there is insufficient description as to the purpose of the low binding 11 and of the ties 12. The low binding 11 actually prevents spreading apart of the long fibers during sweeping. In the description of the original Patent this is only mentioned in an inferential way on page 6, line 11, wherein it is stated \u201cet ces derni\u00e8res conservent cette homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la ligature 11\u201d. (translation, page 3, line 27, \u201cwhich keep this homogeneity thanks to binding 11\u201d.)\nFurthermore, the description of the original Patent only mentions in; an inferential way that the low binding surrounds and is loosely stitched through the fibers as follows: Page 4, lines 6, 7 and 8: \u201cCette derni\u00e8re ligature est reli\u00e9e par des cordelettes aux ligatures sup\u00e9rieures afin qu\u2019elle ne puisse se d\u00e9placer.\u201d (translation, page 1, lines 28, 29 and 30: \u201cThis last binding is attached by small strings to the top bindings in order that it cannot move.\u201d) Page 5, line 25, \u201cpour que cette ligature ne puisse se d\u00e9placer elle est reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la ligature 7 ou \u00e0 tout autre partie fixe du balai par des cordelettes 12, ou tout autre lien\u201d. (translation, page 3, lines 15, 16, 17: \u201cIn order that this binding does not move, it is attached to binding 7 or to any stationary part of the broom by small strings 12 or any other tie.\u201d)\nIn accordance with the invention it is important that said low binding 11 be stitched loosely enough in order to slide on the fibers so as to allow flexibility in the bending of the fibers during sweeping.\nClaim 1 of the Patent, which claims the broad idea of having a broom head of stepped formation with a central group of long fibers and an outer group of shorter fibers forming a skirt surrounding the central group, is probably somewhat too broad in view of U.S. Patent: Struve\u20141,115,255\u2014October 27, 1914.\nClaim 2 of the Patent which mentions the bindings surrounding the center bunch of fibers and surrounded by the outer bunch of fibers depends on claim 1 and is deemed too restricted because the Patentee\u2019s broom could very well be made without the skirt or outer bunch of shorter fibers. Such a broom is certainly operative as a curling broom and the low binding 11 would continue to exert its essential function although it will last a shorter time because of the absence of the protection afforded by the skirt of outer fibers.\nClaims 3 and 4 of the Patent are also defective for the reasons given in connection with claim 2.\nThat the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention in the following manner:\nThat the patent application which resulted in the above noted Patent was prepared by Albert Fournier in the month of February 1956 at which time Mr. Fournier was suffering from a heart condition which somewhat impaired his work efficiency; Mr. Fournier died in fact in August 1958. Therefore, he did not fully comprehend the purpose of\/and working of the low binding 11 and of the importance of ties 12 of the inventor\u2019s broom. On the other hand, the inventor himself was not fully conversant with the requirements of a patent application to wit the fact that he delegated to Mr. Fournier the task of preparing a patent application and obtaining a patent for his invention. Moreover, the Canadian Examiner only cited against the original patent application, U.S. Patent 2,043,758\u2014Lay\u2014June 9, 1936. Therefore the Patent issued without knowledge either by the Patentee, his Patent Agent, or the Canadian Office, of a prior Patent teaching that it was known to have a broom with a stepped construction which might render claim 1 of the Patent invalid.\nThat knowledge of the new facts stated in the amended disclosure and in the light of which the new claims have been framed was obtained by Your Petitioner on or about the last days of December 1958, in the following manner: At that time an official action had been received from the U.S. Examiner citing the Struve U.S. Patent mentioned above against the Patentee\u2019s corresponding U.S. patent application Serial No. 640,676 dated February 18, 1957. Copy of this Patent was ordered from the Patent Office and it was then discovered that it showed the stepped construction of Applicant\u2019s U.S. claim 1 which at that time somewhat corresponded to claim 1 of the Canadian Patent. In December 1958, the Canadian Patent was already issued. In view of the situation of the U.S. patent application at that time, it was decided to await the issue of the U.S. Patent before initiating re-issue procedure in the Canadian Patent. The eventual U.S. Patent claiming the Patentee\u2019s invention finally issued on May 16, 1961, under U.S. Patent 2,983,939.\nOn January 29, 1963, Patent No. 656,934 was issued as a \u201creissue\u201d patent pursuant to s. 50 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. The specification reads in part as follows:\nThe present invention relates to a new broom specifically adapted for the game of curling.\nIn the game of curling, brooms are used for sweeping the ice ahead of the stone sliding on the ice. This has the effect of removing dirt or ice particles and temporarily melting the sandy like frost which covers the ice surface thus making it more slippery so that the stone will travel farther.\nPrior to the present invention, brooms identical in construction to household brooms were used for curling, except that they had longer fibers than household brooms. Conventional household brooms comprise a wooden handle or staff to the lower end of which a head is attached, said head consisting of fibers usually secured to the staff and held together as a bunch by means of a wire binding and also by several cord bindings spaced from each other, surrounding the fibers and stitched through the fibers in a tight manner. Because these cord bindings are located in the upper part of the broom head and that the fibers of the broom head are long, the fibers had a tendency to spread excessively when the broom was used for sweeping the ice, and to break, especially at the lowermost cord binding, rendering the old time broom ackward (sic) to use.\nIt is the general object of the present invention to provide a curling broom which obviates the above disadvantages and which more particularly prevents spreading apart of the fibers of the conventional curling brooms when the broom head is pressed on the ice.\nOther objects of the present invention reside in the provision of a curling broom which is of light weight construction and is easy to manipulate and efficient for ice sweeping in the game of curling, and which has a long life because the fibers do not break easily.\nThe broom in accordance with the present invention is essentially characterised by the provision of low binding stitched loosely enough to slide on the fibers and spaced a substantial distance downward towards the outer ends of the fibers from the conventional cord bindings of the broom, said low cord binding preventing the fibers from spreading apart and maintaining the bunch of fibers in flat condition while at the same time allowing the individual fibers to curve freely when the broom is pressed on the ice, due to the fact that the low binding can slide along the fibers. Thus, the flexibility of the fibers is not impaired.\nIn accordance with the invention, the low binding is prevented from sliding off the outer end of the fibers by being attached by flexible ties. In accordance with another characteristic of the invention, the main bunch of fibers is surrounded by an outer bunch of shorter fibers defining a skirt and overlying the low cord binding so as to protect the same against wear as it is known that when the broom is manipulated, the low cord binding due to its very low level position strikes the ice during sweeping motions.\n(At this point there is a description of how to make an embodiment of the invention.)\u2026.\nWhile a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention has been illustrated and described, it is understood that various modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.\nTHE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION IN WHICH AN EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGE IS CLAIMED ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:\n1. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of fibers and including fiber binding means in the zone of said head attached to said staff, a low flexible binding surrounding and stitched loosely enough through said fibers to be slidable relative to said fibers, and spaced a substantial distance from said fiber binding means and flexible ties connecting said low binding to said head in order to prevent slipping of said low binding off said fibers.\n2. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of a central bunch and an outer bunch of fibers and including bindings extending around the two bunches of fibers, a low binding surrounding and loosely stitched through the central bunch of fibers only, slidable with respect to said central bunch of fibers and covered by the fibers of the outer bunch, said low binding being spaced a substantial distance from said first named bindings, and flexible ties connecting said low binding to said head in order to prevent slipping of said low binding off said fibers.\n3. A broom as claimed in claim 2, wherein said outer bunch is constituted by fibers shorter than the fibers of the central bunch, whereby said outer bunch forms a skirt surrounding the upper part of the central bunch, said low binding being disposed underneath and covered by the free end portion of the fibers of the outer bunch.\n4. A broom for use in the game of curling comprising a head and a staff to which the head is attached, said head being formed of a central bunch of long fibers and an outer bunch of shorter fibers forming a skirt surrounding the upper part of the central bunch, said head including bindings extending around the two bunches of fibers, and a low flexible binding surrounding and loosely stitched through said central bunch of fibers only and slidable relative to the fibers of said central bunch and covered by the free end portions of the fibers of the outer bunch, said low binding being spaced about half way between said first named bindings and the sweeping ends of said long fibers, and flexible ties attached to the low binding at one end and having their other end connected to said head in order to prevent slipping of said low binding off the fibers of said central bunch. The learned trial judge made findings of fact, which are supported by the evidence, as follows:\nI find as a fact that the broom that Marchessault put on the market in the fall of 1955 was the embodiment of an invention of which Marchessault was the inventor. Leaving aside the element of the short outer skirt as a protection against the breaking of the sweeping straws at the bottom factory binding and as a support for the sweeping straws, in my opinion, the loose lower cord around the sweeping straws a substantial distance down the broom from the factory bindings (which I have already described), by virtue of its effect of keeping the sweeping straws in a compact bundle without interfering with their flexibility, created a curling broom that was substantially different from the brooms previously used by curlers and definitely more satisfactory to them. It was not anticipated in my view by any of the earlier patents or by Ken Watson\u2019s personal practice of putting a loose string an inch or so below the factory binding (Ken Watson himself admitted that Marchessault deserved the credit for getting the loose string \u201cdown there\u201d although he thought that his loose string involved the same principle). The new element was relatively simple, it is true. It resulted, however, in a radically different broom that was so much more useful (judged by the assessment of those who used curling brooms) that it immediately came into great demand. There is no doubt in my mind that it was an \u201cinvention\u201d within the meaning of the Patent Act in the sense that it was \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d. It was an inventive step forward. I also find that the combination of the element of the loose lower binding and the element of the short outer skirt as a means of protecting the loose lower binding from wear also constituted an invention for the same reasons.\nSection 50 of the Patent Act, which governs the reissue of patents, provides as follows:\n50. (1) Whenever any patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason of insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim as new, but at the same time it appears that the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Commissioner may, upon the surrender of such patent within four years from its date and the payment of the further fee hereinafter provided, cause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such patentee, to be issued to him for the same invention for the then unexpired term for which the original patent was granted.\n(2) Such surrender takes effect only upon the issue of the new patent, and such new patent and the amended description and specification have the same effect in law, on the trial of any action thereafter commenced for any cause subsequently accruing, as if such amended description and specification had been originally filed in their corrected form before the issue of the original patent, but in so far as the claims of the original and reissued patents are identical such surrender does not affect any action pending at the time of reissue nor abate any cause of action then existing, and the reissued patent to the extent that its claims are identical with the original patent constitutes a continuation thereof and has effect continuously from the date of the original patent.\n(3) The Commissioner may entertain separate applications and cause patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the invention patented, upon payment of the fee for a reissue for each of such reissued patents. The learned trial judge relied upon the statement of Maclean J., as to the purpose of s. 50, in Northern Electric Company Ltd. v. Photo Sound Corporation[2]:\n\u2026the purpose of a re-issue is to amend an imperfect patent, defects of statement or drawings, and not subject-matter, so that it may disclose and protect the patentable subject-matter which it was the purpose of that patent to secure to its inventor. Therefore the re-issue patent must be confined to the invention which the patentee attempted to describe and claim in his original specification, but which owing to \u201cinadvertence, error or mistake,\u201d he failed to do perfectly; he is not to be granted a new patent but an amended patent. An intolerable situation would be created if anything else were permissible. It logically follows of course, that no patent is \u201cdefective or inoperative\u201d within the meaning of the Act, by reason of its failure to describe and claim subject-matter outside the limits of that invention, as conceived or perceived by the inventor, at the time of his invention.\nHe also referred to the reasons of Duff C.J., in the same case[3]:\nFirst of all, the invention described in the amended description or specification and protected by the new patent must be the same invention as that to which the original patent related.\nand at page 652:\nThe statute does not contemplate a case in which an inventor has failed to claim protection in respect of something he has invented but failed to describe or specify adequately because he did not know or believe that what he had done constituted invention in the sense of the patent law and, consequently, had no intention of describing or specifying or claiming it in his original patent. The tenor of the section decisively negatives any intention to make provision for relief in such a case.\nSection 50 of the Patent Act was recently considered in this Court in Farbwerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft v. The Commissioner of Patents[4]. In that case reference was made to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Mahn v. Harwood[5] which defined the purpose of the American provision as to reissue as being \u201cto provide that kind of relief which courts of equity have always given in cases of clear accident and mistake in the drawing up of written instruments\u201d.\nCommenting on this statement, this Court went on to say, at p. 614:\nUsed in this sense, the word \u201cmistake\u201d means that a written instrument does not accord with the true intention of the party who prepared it. A person relying upon a mistake under s. 50 would have to establish that the patent which was issued did not accurately express the inventor\u2019s intention with respect to the description or specification of the invention or with respect to the scope of the claims which he made. This view appears to me to coincide with that expressed by Chief Justice Duff in relation to the word \u201cinadvertence\u201d in Northern Electric Company Ltd. v. Photo Sound Corporation, (1936) S.C.R. 649 at 661, 4 D.L.R. 657, cited by the respondent in his reasons for the refusal of the appellant\u2019s petition.\nIn that case, unlike the present, the Commissioner of Patents had refused to reissue the patent. The patent in respect of which reissue was sought was subsequently held to be invalid by another decision of this Court, in respect of the product tolbutamide, because of the absence of a valid process claim as required by s. 41 of the Act. In the light of that situation it was said, at p. 615:\nSection 50 deals only with a patent which is defective or inoperative. In my opinion it contemplates the existence of a valid patent which requires reissue in order to become fully effective and operative. In the present case, in so far as the substance tolbutamide is concerned, the patent for which reissue is sought has been held by this Court to be invalid.\nThe reason for dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim and for allowing the counterclaim is stated by the learned trial judge as follows:\nIn my view, a reissue patent under section 50 of the Patent Act can replace a defective or inoperative patent with a valid patent by substituting a sufficient description or specification for an insufficient description or specification or by adding or omitting claims but it cannot be for any invention other than an invention disclosed by the original patent. The invention that is embodied in the brooms that Marchessault put on the market in 1955, prior to applying for either patent, and that is disclosed in Patent No. 656,934, the reissue patent, is not disclosed in Patent No. 554,826, and Patent No. 656,934 is therefore invalid.\nThe main question in issue on this appeal is, therefore, whether there was, in relation to Patent No. 554,826, a complete failure to disclose Marchessault\u2019s invention, so as to render that patent invalid, as failing to disclose any invention, or whether there was an imperfect description of the appellant\u2019s invention which would render the patent defective, but still capable of correction by reissue, if such imperfection resulted from error or mistake.\nThe facts in the Northern Electric Company case are not comparable to those in the present one. In that case, the inventor, Arnold, an accomplished physicist, a competent radio engineer and inventor, accustomed to framing specifications, had obtained a patent for an invention relating to receiving systems for radio communication, par- ticularly to devices for limiting the electrical power which might be transmitted to a receiving instrument in such a system. He sought a reissue patent which would have extended its scope so as to include additional claims for certain new and useful improvements in radio communication.\nAt p. 659, Duff C.J. said:\nNow, I have no hesitation in drawing the inference that Arnold fully understood the scope and effect of the application of May 22nd, 1916, and of the specification in the original Canadian patent. He understood, that is to say, that he was excluding from the invention specified and claimed by him those devices and arrangements which are described and specified and claimed in the amendments in so far as we are presently concerned with such amendments. It is also very clear on the material before us that in the proceedings before the Commissioner leading up to the grant of the reissue patent no evidence was adduced to show that the specifications, the description or the claims of the original patent were insufficient to give effect to the intention of Arnold.\nIt was held that there was no defect in the original patent, in that there was no reasonable ground for apprehending that it was defective in failing sufficiently to describe the invention in respect of which the applicant intended to claim invention.\nIn the present case, Marchessault did intend to protect the invention which he had actually made. The patent which he obtained was defective in that it failed sufficiently to describe it. He was not an engineer, and had had no prior experience in relation to patents. He was a broom manufacturer, who had made a useful invention, which he sought to protect through the services of a patent attorney.\nThe invention which the learned trial judge found that Marchessault had made contained two features. The primary feature was that\nthe loose lower cord around the sweeping straws a substantial distance down the broom from the factory bindings, by virtue of its effect of keeping the sweeping straws in a compact bundle without interfering with their flexibility, created a curling broom that was substantially different from the brooms previously used by curlers and definitely more satisfactory to them.\nThe secondary feature was the protection of the loose lower binding by the short outer skirt.\nDoes the first patent contain a description, albeit imperfect, of that which he had invented? The secondary feature, i.e., the protective short outer skirt, is adequately described. The question is as to the description of the loose lower binding, surrounding the sweeping straws. It is referred to in the description of the invention in the following terms:\nLes fibres se rendant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du balai comportent en outre une ligature transversale cach\u00e9e par les fibres ext\u00e9rieures. Cette derni\u00e8re ligature est reli\u00e9e par des cordelettes aux ligatures sup\u00e9rieures afin qu\u2019elle ne puisse se d\u00e9placer.\nThe attachment of this binding to the upper binding is thus made so that it will not get out of place, i.e., shift its position in the course of manipulating the broom.\nIt is referred to again, in the following manner:\nPour que cette ligature ne puisse se d\u00e9placer elle est reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la ligature 7 ou \u00e0 toute autre partie fixe du balai par des cordelettes 12 ou tout autre lien.\n* * *\nLes fibres 9 se courbent sous la pouss\u00e9e et ne se m\u00e9langent pas avec les fibres 10. Les fibres 10 constituent un arc-boutant pour les fibres et ces derni\u00e8res conservent cette homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la ligature 11. En m\u00eame temps les fibres 10 prot\u00e8gent la ligature 11 int\u00e9rieure contre l\u2019usure et servent de garde aux fibres longues pour les emp\u00eacher de briser.\nClaim 4 reads:\n4. Un balai tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans la revendication 1, dans lequel lesdites fibres des deux dits groupes comportent des ligatures transversales, les ligatures dudit centre de faisceau \u00e9tant sous ledit autre groupe qui l\u2019entoure et suspendues par cordelettes auxdites ligatures dudit autre groupe.\nThe use of the term \u201csuspendues\u201d is, I think, significant. It is descriptive of a binding which hangs from the upper bindings and, as indicated in the other quoted portions of the description, is attached thereto in order that it will not be displaced. The drawings which formed a part of the specification show the position of the lower binding and illustrate the fact that it is in suspension from the upper binding.\nIt is, I think, proper to consider the drawings with a view to comprehending the invention which the appellant was seeking to describe. In the case of In re Leonard[6] Cassels J., when considering the application of the section governing reissue patents, adopted the reasons of Blatchford J. in Wilson v. Coon[7], which he cites. He quoted from those reasons at p. 363:\nThe new patent must be for the same invention. This does not mean that the claim in the reissue must be the same as the claim in the original. A patentee may, in the description and claim in his original patent, erroneously set forth as his idea of his invention something far short of his real invention, yet his real invention may be fully described and shown in the drawings and model. Such a case is a proper one for a reissue. A patent may be inoperative from a defective or insufficient description, because it fails to claim as much as was really invented, and yet the claim may be a valid claim, sustainable in law, and there may be a description valid and sufficient to support such claim. In one sense such patent is operative and is not inoperative, yet it is inoperative to extend or to claim the real invention, and the description may be defective or insufficient to support a claim to the real invention, although the drawings and model show the things in respect to which the defect or insufficiency of description exists, and show enough to warrant a new claim to the real invention.\nI do not think we are precluded from considering the drawings for assistance in determining the real purpose of the invention because of the statement contained in the patent:\nQuoiqu\u2019une seule forme sp\u00e9cifique de l\u2019invention ait \u00e9t\u00e9 illustr\u00e9e et d\u00e9crite, il est bien entendu que divers changements \u00e0 la construction de l\u2019invention peuvent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s pourvu que l\u2019on ne se d\u00e9parte pas de son esprit tel que r\u00e9clam\u00e9 dans les revendications qui suivent.\nIn my view this is a case of a patent which is defective by reason of insufficient description, and this resulted from mistake; i.e., a failure by the first patent attorney fully to comprehend and to describe the invention for which he had been instructed to seek a patent. In my opinion it was a proper case for the application of s. 50, and the Commissioner was entitled to grant a reissue patent.\nThe respondent raised two matters, in addition to those which are dealt with in the reasons of the Court below. It was contended that s. 50 only permits the granting of a reissue patent to the original patentee and not to an assignee. It was also submitted that the original patent had not been surrendered within four years from its date, as required by s. 50(1), and that, in consequence, the section was inapplicable.\nThe first argument is based upon the wording of s. 50 providing that the Commissioner may \u201ccause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such patentee, to be issued to him\u2026\u201d It was pointed out that, whereas the predecessor of s. 50, s. 24 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69, had contained subs. 2 reading: \u201cIn the event of the death of the original patentee or of his having assigned the patent, a like right shall vest in his assignee or his legal representatives\u201d, this subsection disappeared when the Patent Act, 1935 (S.C. 1935, c. 32) was enacted. It does not appear in the present Act. In the Patent Act, as it appeared in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, s. 2, the definition section contained no definition of the word \u201cpatentee\u201d. In chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada, 1923, a definition of that word appears as follows: \u201c \u2018patentee\u2019 means the person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent\u201d. The subsection dealing with the rights of an assignee or legal representatives was retained.\nIn 1935, chapter 32 retained the definition of a patentee in substantially the same form: \u201c \u2018patentee\u2019 means the person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent for an invention\u201d, the same definition which appears in the present Act. However, the subsection dealing with the rights of an assignee or legal representatives was eliminated.\nThe section of the Act dealing with disclaimers contained, in the Revised Statutes of 1906, a subsection providing that: \u201cIn case of the death of the original patentee, or of his having assigned the patent, a like right shall vest in his legal representatives, any of whom may make disclaimer.\u201d\nA similar provision has been carried forward down to and including the present Act.\nThe issue is as to whether the elimination from the section dealing with reissue of patents of the subsection dealing with the rights of assignees and legal representatives indicated an intention to restrict the rights provided in the reissue section to the original patentee solely.\nIn the absence of the enactment of the definition of the word \u201cpatentee\u201d I would have thought that this would be so. That definition, however, appears to me to enable \u201cthe person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent for an invention\u201d to exercise any of the rights conferred upon a \u201cpatentee\u201d by the Act. Applying the definition in s. 50(1), it would read that:\n\u2026the Commissioner may, upon the surrender of such patent within four years from its date and the payment of the further fee hereinafter provided, cause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such person for the time being entitled to the benefit of (the patent), to be issued to him\u2026\nI cannot see any reason, in principle, why the right of an assignee under the section, which had clearly existed until 1935, should be considered as having been taken away in the light of the existence of the broad terms of the definition of the word \u201cpatentee\u201d. I do not think the use of the word \u201csuch\u201d in s. 50(1) manifests that intention. It was not introduced for the first time in 1935, but had existed for many years before that.\nSection 53 of the Act, which permits the assignment of the whole interest of a patentee by an instrument in writing, contemplates the assignment of all the rights of a patentee vested in him under the provisions of the Act.\nThe second contention is based upon subs. (2) of s. 50, which provides that the surrender of the original patent, which is a necessary requirement of an application for reissue under subs. (1), does not take effect until the issue of the new patent. Under subs. (1) the surrender is to be made within four years from the date of the original patent. In the present case the petition for reissue was dated March 21, 1962, the original patent having been issued on March 25, 1958, and the petition included a surrender of that patent. However, the reissue patent was not granted until January 29, 1963, at which date the surrender took effect. The respondent claims that, because of this, the surrender was not effected within the required four-year period.\nI am not in agreement with this argument. The surrender of the patent required under subs. (1) refers to the step taken by the applicant for the reissue patent when he makes his application. It is that step which must be taken within the stipulated four-year period. Subsection (2) refers to \u201csuch surrender\u201d, i.e., that made by the applicant, and it then provides that that surrender becomes effective when the new patent issues. Subsection (1) is clearly referring to a step to be taken by the applicant within a limited time. He cannot be charged with non-compliance with the provision because of any subsequent delays which are beyond his control.\nMy conclusion is, therefore, that patent numbered 656,934 is a valid and subsisting patent. The learned trial judge has found as a fact that the respondent did manufacture some brooms, in the period since the issue of that patent, which fall within claim 3 of that patent.\nI am not prepared to accede to the appellant\u2019s submission that claim 4 of the original patent is identical with claim 3 of the reissue patent so as to enable the appellant to take advantage of the provision in subs. (2) of s. 50 that \u201cthe reissued patent to the extent that its claims are iden- tical with the original patent constitutes a continuation thereof and has effect continuously from the date of the original patent\u201d and so that the surrender of the patent does not \u201cabate any cause of action then existing\u201d.\nIn the result, the appellant is entitled to claim in respect of infringements of the reissue patent occurring after it was issued. It was agreed at the trial that, if the appellant had made out a case for one act of infringement of either patent, there would be a reference as to what acts of infringement had been committed and a reference as to the damages flowing from such acts of infringement, or a reference for an accounting of profits depending upon what relief the Court determines that the plaintiff is entitled to.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court. The appellant is entitled to a declaration that reissue Patent No. 656,934 is a valid and subsisting patent. The appellant is also entitled to a reference to determine what acts of infringement of that patent have been committed by the respondent and also to determine, at the election of the appellant, either what damages have flowed from such acts of infringement, or for an accounting of the profits derived therefrom, and judgment for such amount.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Newman, McLean & Associates, Winnipeg.\n[1] [1966] Ex.

The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law: Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that there was no evidence of an intent to extort or gain anything if the accused believed that the thing demanded was due and owing at the time the demand was made?\nHeld: The appeal by the Crown should be allowed.\nWhen it is proved that threats have been made for the making of which there could be no justification or excuse, that the threats were made with intent to gain something and were calculated to induce the person threatened to do something, the commission of the crime defined in s. 291 is established, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether the person making the threats had a lawful right to the thing demanded or entertained an honest belief that he had such a right; that inquiry would be necessary only if the threats were such that there could be a reasonable justification or excuse for making them. In the present case, as found by the Court of Appeal, the threats which, according to the evidence were uttered, were of such a nature that it was impossible as a matter of law for there to have been any reasonable justification or excuse for making them.\nDroit criminel\u2014Extorsion\u2014Croyance que la chose demand\u00e9e \u00e9tait due\u2014Est-ce une d\u00e9fense\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 291.\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019acquittement des intim\u00e9s lors de leur proc\u00e8s pour extorsion en vertu de l\u2019art. 291 du Code Criminel. La Couronne a obtenu permission d\u2019en appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de droit suivante: La Cour d\u2019Appel a-t-elle err\u00e9 en droit en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve d\u2019une intention d\u2019extorquer ou de gagner quelque chose si l\u2019accus\u00e9 croyait que la chose demand\u00e9e \u00e9tait due lorsque la demande en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite?\nArret: L\u2019appel de la Couronne doit \u00eatre maintenu. Lorsqu\u2019il est prouv\u00e9 que des menaces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es sans justification ou excuse, que les menaces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es avec l\u2019intention de gagner quelque chose et dans le but d\u2019induire la personne menac\u00e9e \u00e0 accomplir quelque chose, le crime dont la d\u00e9finition appara\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019art. 291 a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander si la personne prof\u00e9rant les menaces avait un droit l\u00e9gal \u00e0 la chose demand\u00e9e ou croyait honn\u00eatement qu\u2019elle avait un tel droit; cette enqu\u00eate ne serait n\u00e9cessaire que si les menaces \u00e9taient telles qu\u2019il pouvait exister une justification ou excuse raisonnable de les prof\u00e9rer. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, tel que jug\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel, les menaces, qui selon la preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es, \u00e9taient telles qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible comme question de droit qu\u2019il y ait eu une justification ou excuse raisonnable de les prof\u00e9rer.\nAPPEL de la Couronne d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel de l\u2019Ontario confirmant l\u2019acquittement des intim\u00e9s. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the respondents\u2019 acquittal. Appeal allowed.\nC.M. Powell and James Crossland, for the appellant.\nF. Stewart Fisher, for the respondent P. Volpe.\nD.H. Humphrey, Q.C., for the respondents A. and E. Volpe.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on June 6, 1966, dismissing appeals by the Attorney General for Ontario from the acquittals of the above named respondents in December 1965, after trial before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury.\nThe four respondents were jointly charged; the indictment contained two counts which read as follows:\n1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Pasquale Natarelli, Paul Volpe and Albert Volpe, in the month of March in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, without reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain seventeen thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, by threats attempted to induce Richard Roy Angle to turn over to them, seventeen thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code;\n2. The said jurors further present that the said Pasquale Natarelli, Paul Volpe, Albert Volpe and Eugene Volpe, in the month of March in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, conspired one with the other and with persons unknown, to commit an indictable offence, to wit, extortion, in that they did, without reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain seventeen thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, by threats attempted to induce Richard Roy Angle to turn over to them, seventeen thousand, five hundred dollars ($17,500.00) in money, more or less, or one hundred thousand (100,000) free shares of Ganda Silver Mines Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nIt will be observed that Natarelli, Paul Volpe and Albert Volpe were charged in Count 1 and all four respondents were charged in Count 2.\nFrom these acquittals the Attorney General appealed to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, the grounds stated in each notice of appeal being as follows:\n1. The learned Trial Judge erred in law in instructing the jury that if the accused honestly believed they were entitled to the 100,000 shares or the $17,500.00 that would constitute a defence.\n2. The learned Trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury was inadequate in law in that he failed to instruct the jury that the threat to inflict grevious bodily harm upon someone can never be considered reasonable or justified.\nThe appeals were dismissed for reasons delivered orally by Aylesworth J.A. on the conclusion of the argument.\nOn October 4, 1966, the appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law:\nDid the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that there is no evidence of an intent to extort or gain anything if the accused believe that the thing demanded is due and owing at the time the demand is made?\nThe first count in the indictment follows the wording of subs. (1) of s. 291 of the Criminal Code. That Section in its entirety reads as follows:\n291. (1) Every one who, without reasonable justification or excuse and with intent to extort or gain anything, by threats, accusations, menaces or violence induces or attempts to induce any person, whether or not he is the person threatened, accused or menaced or to whom violence is shown, to do anything or to cause anything to be done, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n(2) A threat to institute civil proceedings is not a threat for the purposes of this section. After commenting on the fact that the section was recently enacted and paraphrasing subs. (1), Aylesworth J.A. continued:\nIn our view, \u201cwithout reasonable justification or excuse\u201d as well as \u201cwith intent to extort or gain anything\u201d, applies in the case at bar, to any attempt to induce by threats and the jury should have been so charged. It is not desirable that any attempt should be made and indeed judicial observations before this have been made to this effect\u2014should be made I say, to define what is or is not reasonable justification or excuse. There may be, although it is somewhat difficult to visualize such a case, facts which would afford reasonable justification or excuse in attempting to induce some person to do anything by threats. Upon the evidence in this case, however, the only evidence of threats was as to threats to the life or limb of persons and on the facts of the case, those threats, if they were made, in our view could not be made with reasonable justification or excuse and therefore the question of reasonable justification or excuse in this case should have been withdrawn from the jury.\nWe think, too, that as was the law before the enactment of present section 291 so is the law under that section with respect to extortion or intent to extort. We think the law still is that a case of extortion is not made out if that which it is attempted to secure from the person threatened, is due or owing to the person who makes the attempted inducement by threat or if the person making those threats entertains an honest belief that it is due and owing. With respect to the learned trial Judge, his charge as a whole is in our view, confusing and must have been as to certain elements of the crime, confusing to the jury. On the whole, however, it is our view that a proper charge to the jury on the elements of the crime as I have attempted to outline them and with respect to the evidence adduced would have been at least as if not more favourable to the accused persons than the charge actually made to the jury.\nI take the first paragraph of this passage to mean that the threats, which according to the evidence led by the prosecution were uttered, were of such a nature that it was impossible as a matter of law for there to have been any reasonable justification or excuse for making them and that the learned trial Judge should have explicitly so charged the jury; I agree with this conclusion.\nIn the second paragraph the learned Justice of Appeal expresses the view that an accused who by threats seeks to induce the person threatened to hand over something to him is not guilty of the offence defined in s. 291(1) if he is entitled or if he entertains an honest belief that he is entitled to the thing demanded.\nThe argument before us was directed chiefly to the question whether this is a correct statement of the law. Its solution depends on the true construction of s. 291.\nThis section has already been quoted. It was first enacted as part of the revised Criminal Code Statutes of Canada, 1953-54, 2 and 3 Eliz. II, c. 51, which came into force on April 1, 1955, and by which the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, was repealed.\nSection 291 is new in form. It is stated in the \u201cTable of Concordance Showing Source of Sections in the New Criminal Code\u201d, prepared in the Department of Justice from tables that accompanied the report of the Criminal Code Revision Commission to the Minister of Justice, that its sources are ss. 450, 451, 452, 453 and 454 of the former Code. While this Table of Concordance does not have any Parliamentary sanction, a comparison of the two Codes shows this statement to be accurate.\nThe crimes defined in ss. 450 to 454 may be briefly described as follows:\nSection 450: Compelling the execution of a document by violence or restraint of the person of another or by threat thereof: penalty imprisonment for life.\nSection 451: Uttering a letter or other writing demanding with menaces, and without any reasonable or probable cause, any valuable thing: penalty 14 years imprisonment.\nSection 452: Demanding with menaces anything capable of being stolen with intent to steal it: penalty 2 years imprisonment.\nSection 453: With intent to extort or gain anything accusing or threatening to accuse a person, whether the person accused or threatened with accusation is guilty or not, of certain listed crimes: penalty 14 years imprisonment.\nSection 454: With intent to extort or gain anything accusing or threatening to accuse a person, whether the person accused or threatened with accusation is guilty or not, of crimes other than those listed in s. 453: penalty 7 years imprisonment.\nIt will be observed that under s. 451 it was necessary that the menaces be in writing and that it was the only one of the five sections which contained the words \u201cwithout any reasonable or probable cause\u201d. Under the other four sections the threats might be either oral or written.\nIt appears to me that the wording of s. 291 of the present Code is so different from that of ss. 450 to 454 of the former Code that little is to be gained from a consideration of the cases decided under those sections.\nThe words of Lord Herschell in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[1] appear to me to be appropriate to the problem before us. They are accurately summarized in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 36, p. 406, s. 614, as follows:\nIn construing a codifying statute the proper course is, in the first instance, to examine its language and to ask what is its natural meaning; it is an inversion of the proper order of consideration to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will bear interpretation in conformity with this view. The object of a codifying statute has been said to be that on any point specifically dealt with by it the law should be ascertained by interpreting the language used, instead of roaming over a number of authorities. After the language has been examined without presumptions, resort must only be had to the previous state of the law on some special ground, for example for the construction of provisions of doubtful import, or of words which have acquired a technical meaning.\nIn the case at bar there was evidence on which it was open to the jury to find that the accused named in the first count in the indictment by threats to cause death or bodily injury to Angle or members of his family attempted to induce him to turn over to them the money or shares mentioned in the indictment. The appeal was argued on the assumption that there was some evidence in the record on which it was open to the jury to find that the accused had an honest belief that the money or shares demanded were owing to them.\nThe question of law raised on this appeal is whether assuming the threats to cause death or bodily injury were made and that the accused had the honest belief that the money or shares demanded were owing to them they were guilty of the offence defined in s. 291. The answer depends on what is the true meaning of the words of the section.\nFor the respondents it is submitted that on the assumption referred to in the preceding paragraph the accused might well be guilty of assault or of the offence of threatening as defined in s. 316(1) (a) of the present Code but that they would not be guilty of extortion as defined in s. 291, because the honest belief referred to would constitute reasonable justification or excuse for making the demand.\nIn my opinion, this argument should be rejected. To constitute a defence there must be reasonable justification or excuse not only for the demand but for the making of the threats or menaces by which the accused sought to compel compliance with the demand.\nThere are courses of action which a person might express his intention of taking which would constitute threats within the meaning of that word as used in the section but which would in some circumstances be in themselves lawful; an example is the statement of the intention to place the name of a person on a \u201cstop list\u201d in circumstances such as existed in Thorne v. Motor Trade Association[2].\nThat decision indicates that while it was lawful for the defendant to threaten to put the name of the plaintiff on a \u201cstop list\u201d it would be criminal to accompany the threat with a demand for the payment of an unreasonable sum as an alternative. It is not authority for the proposition that, because a demand is reasonable and there exists reasonable justification or excuse for the making of it, it is lawful to seek to enforce compliance with it by making threats which are unlawful and for which there is no justification or excuse.\nI have already expressed my agreement with the opinion of the Court of Appeal that in the case at bar if the jury found that the threats alleged were made it was impossible as a matter of law for them to find that there was any reasonable justification or excuse for making them.\nWhen it is proved that threats have been made for the making of which there could be no justification or excuse, that the threats were made with intent to gain something and were calculated to induce the person threatened to do something, the commission of the crime defined in s. 291 is established, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether the person making the threats had a lawful right to the thing demanded or entertained an honest belief that he had such a right; that inquiry would be necessary only if the threats were such that there could be reasonable justification or excuse for making them.\nSpeaking generally, the essential ingredients of an offence under s. 291 are, (i) that the accused has used threats, (ii) that he has done so with the intention of obtaining something by the use of threats; (whatever meaning be given to the word \u201cextort\u201d the word \u201cgain\u201d as used in the section is simply the equivalent of \u201cobtain\u201d) and, (iii) that either the use of the threats or the making of the demand for the thing sought to be obtained was without reasonable justification or excuse; (the question on this aspect of the matter is not whether one item in the accused\u2019s course of conduct, if considered in isolation, might be said to be justifiable or excusable but rather whether his course of conduct considered in its entirety was without justification or excuse).\nMy view as to the true construction of s. 291 expressed above is not altered by the circumstance that on the assumption as to the facts on which the appeal was argued the accused could have been properly convicted if they had been charged under s. 316(1) (a) of the Code as it now reads since it was amended by Statutes of Canada 1960-61, c. 43, s. 10. In this connection, however, it may be observed that from April 1, 1955, until it was so amended s. 316 applied only to threats which were in writing.\nFor the reasons given above it is my opinion that the learned trial Judge should have instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused made the alleged threats to cause death or bodily injury with intent to induce Angle to hand over to them the money or shares mentioned in the indictment they should find the accused guilty regardless of whether the accused had a right to the money or shares demanded or honestly believed they had such a right.\nIt follows that, in my opinion, the question of law on which this appeal is brought should be answered in the affirmative.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and the verdicts of acquittal and order a new trial of all the respondents.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Ontario.\nSolicitor for the respondent P. Volpe: F.S. Fisher, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondents A. and E. Volpe: D.G. Humphrey, Toronto.\n[1] [1891] A.C. 107 at 144-45, 60 L.J.Q.B. 145.\n[2] [1937] A.C. 797.\n",

Several years later he was granted a conditional licence to be at large pursuant to s. 3(1) of the Ticket of Leave Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 264. While at large, he committed an armed robbery for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. This conviction caused the forfeiture of his conditional licence by the sole operation of s. 6 of the Ticket of Leave Act. Procedures authorized for the apprehension and committal of a licensee who has lost his licence were adopted and a warrant for his committal was issued by a justice of the peace. The applicant escaped but was recaptured and returned to the prison where he was detained.\nThe applicant made an informal written application to this Court for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. He argued that the only possible authority for his present detention were his very first convictions by the first judge, and that all the other terms of imprisonment\u2014including the term imposed upon him for escape\u2014had been fully satisfied. He challenged (a) the validity of the charges and procedures before the first judge and contended that the latter had failed to issue a warrant of committal in the form prescribed by the law, and challenged also (b) the validity of the procedures leading to his recommittal after he had lost his conditional licence, especially the warrant of committal issued by the justice of the peace.\nHeld: The application should be dismissed.\nAs to grounds raised in (a). None of the points raised with respect to the charges and procedures before the first judge had any relevancy on an application for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. It has been repeatedly held that such a writ could not be converted into a writ of error or an appeal. The warrant of committal complied with the law and was valid and effective.\nAs to the grounds raised in (b). Everyone of the steps prescribed for the apprehension and committal of one who has lost his licence has been taken. There was no necessity, in this case, to formally proceed with the apprehension and recommittal of the applicant who was already validly confined. While the term of imprisonment, to which the applicant was sentenced for the offence in consequence of which his licence was forfeited, may now be said to have been satisfied, he must, according to s. 9 of the Ticket of Leave Act, further undergo a term of imprisonment equal to the portion to which he was originally sentenced and which remained unexpired at the time his licence was granted.

Requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e. APPLICATION before Fauteux J. in Chambers for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Application dismissed.\nNo one appearing for the applicant.\nD.H. Christie, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Canada.\nAndr\u00e9 Chaloux for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is one of these prisoners\u2019 informal applications for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus made, in this case, by one Adolphe Karchesky, presently detained in the penitentiary of Kingston, in the province of Ontario. The applicant did not appear nor was he represented at the hearing, the date of which had been fixed when it appeared, from the correspondence he exchanged with the Registrar of this Court, that he had exhaustively stated his grounds and arguments and also indicated his willingness to submit his application, even if contested, on the basis of his written presentation. Representatives of the Attorney General for Canada and of the Attorney General for the province of Quebec appeared at the hearing to contest this application. The material filed by the latter and the material submitted by the applicant show the following facts:\u2014(i) on March 29, 1946, at the city of Montreal, the applicant appeared and pleaded guilty, before Judge Maurice T\u00e9treau, a judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the district of Montreal, to seventeen charges of armed robbery and seventeen charges of conspiracy to commit those armed robberies, for which he was sentenced, on April 4, 1946, to life imprisonment and seven years respectively on each charge of armed robbery and conspiracy; (ii) on the same day, to wit on March 29, 1946, at the same place and before the same Judge, the applicant also pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to commit an armed robbery and two additional charges of conspiracy to commit an armed robbery, for which he was sentenced, on April 4, 1946, to seven years\u2019 imprisonment on each count; (iii) on December 13, 1948, the Commissioner of Penitentiaries issued a Removal Warrant, pursuant to s. 52 of the Penitentiary Act (1939), Statutes of Canada 1939, c. 6, for the transfer of the applicant from St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary\u2014where he had been committed by Judge T\u00e9treau to serve the above sentences\u2014to the Manitoba Penitentiary; (iv) several years later, pursuant to subs. 1 of s. 3 of the Ticket of Leave Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 264, a conditional license to be at large, effective May 1, 1957, was granted to the applicant, notice of which, dated April 11, 1957, was addressed by the Deputy Minister of Justice to the Warden of the Manitoba Penitentiary; (v) while being lawfully at large by virtue of this conditional license, the applicant committed, on November 28, 1958, at the city of Montreal, an indictable offence, to wit an armed robbery, for which he was arrested, charged and found guilty on December 1, 1958, by Judge Paul Hurteau, a judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the district of Montreal, and for which he was sentenced and committed on December 9, 1958, to five years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary of St. Vincent de Paul; (vi) consequent upon the latter conviction, applicant\u2019s conditional license to be at large was forfeited forthwith by the sole operation of s. 6 of the Ticket of Leave Act. Procedures authorized for the apprehension and committal of a licensee whose license has been forfeited or revoked were then adopted by the various authorities concerned and on February 5, 1959, pursuant to a warrant of apprehension issued on January 16, 1959, by the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as provided in subs. 1 of s. 8 of the Ticket of Leave Act, the applicant, who was then actually incarcerated in the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary, where he had been committed by Judge Hurteau, was brought before Jean-Eudes Blanchard, a Justice of the Peace for the district of Montreal The Justice of the Peace then issued a warrant of committal pursuant to subs. 3 of s. 8 of the Ticket of Leave Act; (vii) on August 12, 1959, the Commissioner of Penitentiaries, under the authority of s. 52 of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206, ordered the transfer of the applicant from St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary to the Kingston Penitentiary; (viii) on August 14, 1959, the applicant was again transferred from the Kingston Penitentiary to the Joyceville Institution from which he escaped on August 18, 1964; and upon being recaptured on August 27, 1964, the applicant was returned to the Kingston Penitentiary where he is, since then, presently detained.\nIn support of his application, the prisoner submitted, in the first place, that the only possible authority for his present detention must be the convictions registered against him on April 4, 1946, at Montreal, before Judge Maurice T\u00e9treau,\u2014cf. (i) and (ii) above,\u2014all the other terms of imprisonment,\u2014including the term imposed upon him for escape,\u2014having been fully satisfied. He then challenged (a) the validity of the charges and procedures before Judge T\u00e9treau and contended moreover that the latter had failed to issue a warrant of committal in the form prescribed by law, and he also challenged (b) the validity of the procedures leading to a recommittal after the forfeiture or revocation of a conditional license to be at large, and more specifically the warrant of committal issued by the Justice of the Peace, Jean-Eudes Blanchard.\nDealing with grounds mentioned in (a):\u2014It is unnecessary to recite and deal here with the various points raised by the applicant with respect to the charges and procedures before Judge T\u00e9treau; for assuming that, contrary to the opinion I formed after considering them, anyone of these points would have any merits, none of them has any relevancy on an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Indeed, it has been repeatedly held that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be converted into a writ of error or an appeal and that its functions do not extend beyond an enquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by which process a subject is held in custody and into the validity of the process upon its face. Bearing that in mind, it is sufficient to say that as a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace for the district of Montreal, Judge Maurice T\u00e9treau had clearly jurisdiction in the matter and that the warrant of committal he then issued is valid on its face. The contention that this warrant is not in the form prescribed by law has no foundation. The applicant has vainly attempted to support this submission on some of the provisions of the new Criminal Code, assented to on April 1, 1955, for, at all relevant time, the law governing in the matter was to be found in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. Section 799 of this Code provides that a conviction on a plea of guilty, under Part XVI, relating to the summary trial of indictable offences, may be in the form 56 or the forms appearing in Part XXV, or to the like effect; and s. 794 provides that a copy of such conviction, certified by the proper officer of the Court or proved to be a true copy shall be, in any legal proceedings, sufficient evidence of such conviction. The conviction or the warrant of committal issued by Judge T\u00e9treau, of which a true copy has been filed before me, fully complies with these provisions of the law and this warrant is today as valid and effective a warrant as it was at the time of its issuance.\nDealing with grounds raised in (b):\u2014The various steps of the procedure related to the apprehension and committal of a licensee, whose license has been forfeited or revoked, are set forth in s. 8(1), (2) and (3) of the Ticket of Leave Act and, subject to what is hereafter said with respect to the warrant of committal issued by Justice of the Peace Blanchard, I must say that a close examination of the various documents and affidavits filed on behalf of the Attorney General for Canada and of the Attorney General for the province of Quebec, has satisfied me that everyone of the steps prescribed for such an apprehension and committal has been taken in the present case.\nApplicant questioned Blanchard\u2019s authority to issue a warrant of committal, suggesting, in fact, that he may not have been a Justice of the Peace, but merely a Commissioner of Oaths. This suggestion has no foundation. Indeed a certificate, under the signature and seal of a Clerk of the Peace and of the Crown for the district of Montreal, establishes that Blanchard was sworn in, as a Justice of the Peace, on June 10, 1958, and the affidavit of Crown Attorney Andr\u00e9 Chaloux indicates that this appointment has not been revoked. Furthermore and as stated by Lord Coleridge C.J., in R. v. Morris Roberts[1]:\nIt is laid down in all the text books as a recognised principle that a person acting in the capacity of a public officer is prima facie to be taken to be so, \u2026 As to the substance of the warrant, the representative of the Attorney General for Canada pointed out that blank spaces which, in the form of such warrants, are intended to be used for the designation of the person to whom the prisoner is to be conveyed and the penitentiary to which he is to be committed, were not, in this case, completed by Blanchard after the applicant had appeared before him at the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary where, again, he was already incarcerated pursuant to the warrant of committal issued by Judge Hurteau\u2014cf. (v). The Crown, having considered that these omissions might be said to constitute a defect on the face of the warrant, secured, two days before the hearing of the present application, a new warrant from Justice of the Peace Blanchard. In this new warrant, these omissions were remedied and a direction was given to the Warden of the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary, to whom such warrant was addressed, to substitute it to the original one. Needless to say that the new, as well as the original warrant, contains a recital of the facts referred to in (i), (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above.\nAs to the law respecting the issuance of a substituted warrant of committal for a defective one, the Crown relied on the authorities collected in Tremeear\u2019s Annotated Criminal Code, 6th ed., 1964, p. 1373, and in Crankshaw\u2019s Criminal Code of Canada, 7th ed., p. 1167, and alternatively placed reliance upon s. 688 of the Criminal Code (1955) which provides that:\n688. No warrant of committal shall, on certiorari or habeas corpus, be held to be void by reason only of any defect therein where\n(a) it is alleged in the warrant that the defendant was convicted, and\n(b) there is a valid conviction to sustain the warrant.\nWhatever view might be taken as to the validity or effectiveness of the original warrant issued by Justice of the Peace Blanchard or the corrected warrant he substituted thereto, in my opinion, there was no necessity, under all the circumstances of this case, to formally proceed with the apprehension and recommittal of the applicant who, at the time he was brought before the Justice of the Peace at the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary and even before any of the procedures set forth in s. 8(1), (2) and (3) of the Ticket of Leave Act had been resorted to, was then already validly confined by force of the unimpeached and unimpeachable warrant of committal issued by Judge Hurteau, as well as by force of the following provisions of s. 6 of the Ticket of Leave Act which were set in action consequent to and upon the conviction of the applicant by Judge Hurteau.\n6. If any holder of a license under this Act is convicted of any indictable offence his license shall be forthwith forfeited. R.S., c. 150, s. 5.\nWhile the term of imprisonment, to which the applicant was sentenced for the offence in consequence of which his license was forfeited, may now be said to have been satisfied, he must, according to s. 9 of the Ticket of Leave Act, further undergo a term of imprisonment equal to the portion to which he was originally sentenced and which remained unexpired at the time his license was granted. And, as indicated above in (i) and (ii), the term of the original sentence in his case is life imprisonment\nHaving fully considered the material filed and all the points raised by the applicant, I have satisfied myself that he is lawfully detained. His application must therefore be and is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\n[1] (1878), 38 L.T.R. 690 at 691.\n",

The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 554\nDate: 1967-06-26\nGerald William Poole Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1967: June 5, 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCriminal law\u2014Habitual criminal\u2014Preventive detention\u2014Whether expedient\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, s. 660(1).\nThe appellant, who was 34 years of age, was convicted on August 10, 1965, of two offences of obtaining goods by false pretences and two offences of attempting to obtain goods by false pretences. This was done by drawing cheques on non-existent bank accounts. The amount involved in each offence was under $100. The appellant was subsequently-found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention. His record of convictions commenced at age 16 and all but one included an element of theft. On June 25, 1965, the day of the expiration of a four-year sentence for theft of an automobile, the appellant received a gift of money to take him from New Brunswick to Vancouver. On his arrival in Vancouver the same day, he at once got a job as a labourer and appeared to have been continuously so employed until his conviction on August 10 of the substantive offences. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the sentence of preventive detention. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the facts, the magistrate properly concluded that the appellant was an habitual criminal and this was rightly affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. If the decision of that Court on that issue was correct, it is not open to this Court to substitute its opinion on the question as to whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention. The judgment of this Court in The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831, is authority for the proposition that, once the finding as to the status of the accused as an habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the sentence.\nPer Cartwright and Judson JJ., dissenting: On the assumption that the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it has not been shown that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention. Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant has been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, he has been sentenced to severe punishment. There is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life. It has not been satisfactorily shown that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody.\nThe judgment of this Court in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, is distinguishable and does not bind this Court to say that it is without jurisdiction in the case at bar.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014D\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014Opportunit\u00e9\u2014Juridiction\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 660(1). L\u2019appelant, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 34 ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable le 10 ao\u00fbt 1965, de deux offenses d\u2019avoir obtenu des biens par faux pr\u00e9texte et de deux offenses d\u2019avoir tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des biens par faux pr\u00e9texte. Il s\u2019agissait de ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s sur un compte de banque qui n\u2019existait pas. Le montant en jeu dans chaque offense \u00e9tait de moins de $100. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment reconnu repris de justice et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Son dossier de condamnations commence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans et toutes les condamnations, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une, contiennent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de vol. Le 25 juin 1965, le jour de l\u2019expiration d\u2019une sentence de quatre ans pour vol d\u2019automobile, l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u un don en argent pour lui permettre de se rendre du Nouveau-Brunswick \u00e0 Vancouver. A son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver le m\u00eame jour, il a imm\u00e9diatement obtenu un emploi comme man\u0153uvre et il semble qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 continuellement employ\u00e9 de la sorte jusqu\u2019au jour de sa condamnation le 10 ao\u00fbt pour les offenses substantives. La Cour d\u2019Appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a confirm\u00e9 la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. L\u2019appelant a obtenu permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, les Juges Cartwright et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Martland et Ritchie: Sur les faits de cette cause, le magistrat a conclu correctement que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un repris de justice et la majorit\u00e9 dans la Cour d\u2019Appel a eu raison de confirmer cette conclusion. Si la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019Appel sur cette question \u00e9tait la bonne, cette Cour n\u2019a pas le droit de substituer son opinion sur la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public de condamner l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Le jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] R.C.S. 831, est une autorit\u00e9 pour la proposition que, lorsque la conclusion concernant le statut de repris de justice d\u2019un accus\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en question, cette Cour n\u2019a pas juridiction pour entendre un appel de la sentence.\nLes Juges Cartwright et Judson, dissidents: Selon l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que la conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un repris de justice ne doit pas \u00eatre chang\u00e9e, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public de condamner l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Depuis ses condamnations en 1959, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019aucun crime de violence. Pour le vol d\u2019une automobile en 1962 et pour les quatre offenses substantives en 1965, il a re\u00e7u des punitions s\u00e9v\u00e8res. Il y a une preuve \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il essaie de vivre une vie normale. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante que sa mise en libert\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de l\u2019emprisonnement auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour les offenses substantives aurait pour effet de cr\u00e9er une menace \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou que pour la protection du public il serait opportun qu\u2019il passe le reste de sa vie sous arr\u00eat.\nLe jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de The Queen v.

Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Cartwright et Judson dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nB.H. Kershaw, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming, by a majority, a sentence of preventive detention imposed on the appellant by His Worship Magistrate G.L. Levey at Vancouver on June 14, 1966. Bull J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, quashed the sentence of preventive detention and restored the sentences imposed in respect of convictions of four substantive offences in lieu of which the sentence appealed against had been imposed.\nThe appellant was born on March 3, 1932.\nThe evidence as to his past record is accurately summarized by Bull J.A. as follows:\nJust after reaching 16 years of age, the appellant was convicted of a charge of taking an automobile without consent and stealing four pairs of shoes a day or so earlier, and was fined $20.00 and given a suspended sentence, respectively. Three years later, at the age of 19 years, he was convicted of breaking and entering a drug store and was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. Upon being released from this imprisonment about 19 months later, he joined the Canadian Army and served with it in Canada and Korea for about 2 years until he was dishonourably discharged shortly after having been convicted in Montreal of two charges of robbery and sentenced to five years on each to run concurrently. On his release at expiration of sentence the appellant had odd jobs in and around his home area in New Brunswick for about five months, when he again fell foul of the law. This time he was convicted on four charges of breaking and entering business premises within the space of a few days, and was awarded various sentences to run con currently, of which the longest was three years in the penitentiary. The appellant was released from imprisonment on November 19, 1961, and worked fairly steadily with some success and employer approval at labouring work for about ten months when he was convicted of theft of a U-Drive automobile which he had rented. For this offence he was sentenced to four years in the penitentiary. On his release from this sentence in June, 1965, the somewhat unusual events occurred which led to his commission of, and convictions on, the substantive offences. On the day of release and provided with funds and an airline ticket by his mother in the Maritimes, he flew to Vancouver claiming to be filled with the admirable resolution to there start a new honest life away from the associations which he claimed had always led him into trouble. Although there were many inconsistencies in his evidence as to exactly what the appellant did for the next few weeks, it does appear quite clear and uncontradicted that promptly after arrival he did get a job with a wrecking company, which lasted about two weeks, followed by a job with a salvage company commencing on July 12, 1965. On July 9, 1965, however, he purchased $41.85, and attempted to purchase a further $91.37, worth of goods from a department store with cheques signed in his own name but drawn on a non-existent account in a local bank. The appellant said the account number used was that of an account that he had in the same bank in Fredericton, N.B., but quite properly little credence was given to this excuse. It is clear that some at least of the goods in question were working clothes and gear needed by the appellant in the new job he was just starting. On the same day, allegedly to replace one stolen from his room, the appellant attempted to buy a watch from a jeweller with a cheque for $83.99 drawn on the same non-existent account. The appellant was released on bail, went back to work and about ten days later obtained a pipe and some tobacco from a tobacconist with a cheque for $12.74 drawn on a fictitious account. The appellant was convicted of these four depredations on August 10, 1965, and given concurrent sentences aggregating 3 years. Apparently, notwithstanding these shopping sprees, the appellant did have gainful employment for substantially the whole time from his release on June 25, 1965, to his conviction on August 10, 1965. There was no evidence adduced that during this last period of freedom the appellant associated with criminals or undesirable characters.\nI do not find it necessary to choose between the conflicting views of Bull J.A. and of the majority in the Court of Appeal as to whether on the evidence the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal can safely be upheld; for the purpose of these reasons I will assume that it can. On the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, I have reached the conclusion that it has not been shewn that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nWhether or not in any particular case it is expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly not a question of law alone. But, leave to appeal to this Court having been granted, it is clear that we have jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact.\nIn Mulcahy v. The Queen[1], this Court in a unanimous judgment expressly adopted the reasons of MacQuarrie J. who had dissented from the judgment of the majority in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (in banco) and set aside the sentence of preventive detention which had been imposed upon the appellant. The dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie J. is reported in 42 C.R. at page 1.\nIn that case the record shewed that, prior to being convicted of the substantive offence, the appellant had been convicted between 1941 and 1961 on nineteen occasions of offences, for which he had been sentenced to a total of fifteen years and six months in the penitentiary and twenty-six months in prison. None of his convictions were for crimes of violence; six were for breaking and entering and the remainder for theft or having possession of stolen goods.\nMacQuarrie J. based his judgment on two distinct grounds. The first of these was that there was no evidence to support a finding that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. The second ground was expressed as follows:\nWhile I do not attempt to minimize the record of the appellant, a perusal of it (apart from the lack of evidence to justify finding him to be leading persistently a criminal life) indicates that he is not the type of person of whom it can properly be said \u201cit is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d. In my opinion the Crown has failed to prove that (even although the accused was leading persistently a criminal life) a sentence of preventive detention was expedient for the protection of the public.\nIn the case at bar no exception can be taken to the terms in which the learned Magistrate instructed himself as to the applicable principles of law. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. Charming[2], he expressed the view that in order to impose a sentence of preventive detention he must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life, that the decision of each case must depend on its own particular facts, (i) as to whether the finding that a person is an habitual criminal should be made and, (ii) as to whether that finding having been made, a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. It is, I think, implicit in the last sentence of his reasons, read in the light of his reference to Regina v. Channing, that he held it necessary that he should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the second of these points as well as on the first. The sentence to which I refer reads as follows:\nI find that the Crown has proved beyond all reasonable doubt, in my mind, that it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence you to preventive detention, and I so do.\nIn the Court of Appeal Lord J.A., with whom McFarlane J.A. expressed substantial agreement, dealt with this branch of the matter as follows:\nNor can I say that he reached the wrong opinion in finding it expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.\nBull J.A., having held that the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal could not safely be upheld, did not find it necessary to deal with this question.\nIn Regina v. Channing, supra, Sheppard J.A., with whom Norris, Lord and MacLean JJ.A. agreed and Davey J.A. agreed \u201cin general\u201d, said at page 110:\nIn the case at bar, the crown must assume the onus of proving that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the accused be sentenced beyond that imprisonment for the substantive offence: Mulcahy v. Reg., and that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt: Parkes v. Reg. and Kirkland v. Reg.\nIn the same case at page 101, Davey J.A. said:\nLikewise it is undesirable for us to lay down detailed tests of the sufficiency of evidence to prove either that an accused is a habitual criminal or that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced to preventive detention. All that is required is that the evidence be sufficient to prove both these essential matters beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the magistrate or trial judge.\nAs already indicated, I am dealing with this appeal on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed and the question to be answered is therefore whether it can properly be said \u201cthat because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d.\nThe answer to this question depends upon the application to the facts of the case of the words of s. 660(1) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n660. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nIt will be observed that the section is worded permissively. Even if both conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled the court is not bound to impose the sentence of preventive detention. The wording may be contrasted with that used by Parliament in s. 661 (3):\n(3) Where the court finds that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a sentence of preventive detention. The wording of s. 660 may also be contrasted with that of the corresponding sub-section in the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, of the United Kingdom, 11 & 12 George VI, c. 58, s. 21(2) of which reads as follows:\n(2) Where a person who is not less than thirty years of age\u2014\n(a) is convicted on indictment of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more; and\n(b) has been convicted on indictment on at least three previous occasions since he attained the age of seventeen of offences punishable on indictment with such a sentence, and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to Borstal training, imprisonment or corrective training;\nthen, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the court may pass, in lieu of any other sentence, a sentence of preventive detention for such term of not less than five or more than fourteen years as the court may determine.\nI do not consider that the use of the words \u201cThe court is of the opinion\u201d in s. 660(1)(b) of the Criminal Code prevents the Court of Appeal or this Court from substituting its opinion for that of the learned Magistrate, That course has been followed in Mulcahy v. The Queen, supra.\nIn Regina v. Channing, supra, after stating that what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question of fact in each case, Sheppard J.A. continued at page 109:\nMoreover, as the sentence for the substantive offence will have considered the protection of the public as one of the elements, it would follow that preventive detention should not be imposed unless the crown has proven that the protection of the public is not sufficiently safeguarded by sentence for the substantive offence, but does require some additional protection involved in a sentence of preventive detention: Mulcahy v. Reg., supra; Reg. v. Rose, supra, to the extent of making that sentence expedient for the protection of the public.\nand at page 110 he quoted with approval the following passage in the reasons of Currie J.A. in Harnish v. The Queen[3]:\nThe real, essential principle of the preventive detention provisions of the Criminal Code, s. 660, and of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, ch. 59, is the protection of the public. It is not enough that the accused is merely anti-social, or is a nuisance, or that it is a convenience to the police to have a person removed to a penitentiary.\nIn R. v. Churchill[4], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at page 110:\nThe object of preventive detention is to protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history that they are a menace to society while they are at large.\nand at page 112:\nAs we have already said, when such sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no longer prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a comparatively small character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves.\nIn considering the decisions in England it must always be borne in mind that the maximum sentence of preventive detention which can be imposed there is fourteen years and that, as stated by Lord Goddard on the page last referred to, in the great majority of cases which had come before that Court the sentence passed had been one of eight years. In Canada if the sentence is passed at all it must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the prisoner\u2019s life subject to the possibility of his being allowed out on licence if so determined by the parole authorities, a licence which may be revoked without the intervention of any judicial tribunal.\nSince his convictions in 1959, the appellant has been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age. While I cannot say, in the words used by Currie J.A., that he is merely a nuisance I am not satisfied that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will, to use the words of Lord Goddard, constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody. Any doubt that I feel in this case arises from the fact that I am differing from the learned Magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal. In a case in which the consequences of an adverse decision are so final and so disastrous for the man concerned I think that doubts should be resolved in his favour.\nI had written the above reasons and reached the conclusion that I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done before I had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Martland, holding, on the basis of the reasons of Ritchie J. speaking for the majority of the Court in The Queen v. MacDonald[5], that, unless we can say that the finding of the Courts below that the appellant is an habitual criminal should be set aside, we are without jurisdiction to interfere with the imposition of the sentence of preventive detention.\nWhile in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, I agreed with the conclusion of the majority that the appeal should be quashed it was for different reasons. The sole question relating to our jurisdiction which was raised for decision in that appeal was whether the Attorney-General had a right of appeal to this Court from the order of a Court of Appeal expressly affirming a finding that an accused was an habitual criminal but deciding that the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him should be set aside. The formal order of the Court of Appeal in that case read as follows:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the Appellant is an habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and pursuant to section 667 of the Criminal Code, a sentence of imprisonment in Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and the same is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L.H. Jackson entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge, such sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964. This may be contrasted with the order of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar, the operative part of which reads:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE THAT the said Appeal of the above\u2011named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed;\nIn my view the present case is distinguishable from The Queen v. MacDonald. The appeal before us is simply from the imposition of the sentence, and this is as it should be for the only right of appeal given to a person sentenced to preventive detention is that set out in section 667(1) of the Criminal Code:\n667. (1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\nNo right of appeal is given from a finding that an accused is an habitual criminal unless that finding is followed by the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. Such a finding unless followed by a sentence is brutum fulmen. It is a trite observation that an appeal is from the judgment pronounced in the court appealed from and not from its reasons. It appears to me that the existence of our jurisdiction cannot depend upon the grounds upon which we think the sentence should be upheld or set aside. Our jurisdiction to set aside the sentence in the case at bar upon the grounds set out in the reasons of Bull J.A. could not be questioned; I do not think it is destroyed because, as it appears to me, the same result should be reached by a different line of reasoning. It may be mentioned in passing that no question of our jurisdiction was raised in the course of the full and able arguments addressed to us and I would be hesitant to rule that we have no jurisdiction without giving Counsel an opportunity to present their views. I have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the majority in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, does not bind us to say that we are without jurisdiction in the case at bar.\nI would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done, that is to say, I would allow the appeal, quash the sentence of preventive detention and restore the sentences imposed on the convictions of the four substantive offences.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The facts involved in this appeal are stated by my brother Cartwright, including the evidence as to the past record of the appellant as summarized by Bull J.A. in the Court below. On the basis of that summary I think that the magistrate properly concluded that the appellant was an habitual criminal and I agree with the views expressed by the majority of the Court of Appeal on this point.\nIf the decision of the Court of Appeal on that issue was correct, it is not open to this Court, even if it wished to do so, to substitute its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal on the question as to whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention. The judgment of this Court in The Queen v. MacDonald[6] is authority for the proposition that, once the finding as to the status of the accused as an habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the sentence.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Brian H.

Taylor, Jr. (Defendants) Respondents.\n1967: May 18; 1967: June 26.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Hall And Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF FOR ONTARIO.\nOil and gas\u2014Lease\u2014Delay rental provision\u2014Failure to pay rental on time\u2014Subsequent acceptance of rental payment\u2014Application for order declaring void and vacating registration of lease dismissed\u2014Waiver of default\u2014The Gas and Oil Leases Act, 1962-63 (Ont.), c. 49.\nBy an agreement of lease dated August 5, 1955, the appellant leased certain lands to the respondent company for the purpose of carrying on operations regarding crude oil and natural gas and other related hydrocarbons. Paragraph 1 of the agreement of lease contained a provision for the termination of the lease in the event that the lessee did not exercise his privilege of either commencing operations within one year or paying delay rentals in lieu thereof on the 5th of August of each year, in which case the time within which operations could be commenced was extended for a further year. The lessee company paid the rental in lieu of drilling until the end of the rental year 1961-62.\nThe lessee assigned the lease to one T by an assignment made on May 31, 1961. No drilling took place in the rental year 1962-63 and no rental was paid in lieu of drilling until some day in October or November of 1962 when T paid to the lessor the sum of $100, the payment being made in the form of a cheque with an attached counterfoil. The lessor cashed the cheque and signed and returned the counterfoil. In the subsequent rental year, no drilling was commenced and no rental in lieu of drilling was tendered until September 23, 1963, when a cheque for $100 was forwarded to the lessor. This cheque was cashed by the lessor although he did not sign or return the rental receipt acknowledgment attached thereto.\nSubsequently, the lessor applied to a County Court Judge for an order under the provisions of The Gas and Oil Leases Act, 1962-63 (Ont.), c. 49, declaring void and vacating the registration of the oil and gas lease dated August 5, 1955. The County Court Judge dismissed the application and on appeal to the Court of Appeal his judgment was upheld. With leave, an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe County Court Judge was exercising a statutory jurisdiction only, and apart from the provisions of The Gas and Oil Leases Act he had no jurisdiction to make the declaration requested. Under the provisions of s. 2(1)(a) of the Act the lessor\u2019s right to make an application is confined to the situation where the lessee has (1) made default under the terms of an oil or gas lease in that he has failed to commence to drill a well, and (2) failed to pay rentals in lieu thereof. In the present case, the lessee, i.e., the assignee T had failed to commence to drill a well but on March 12, 1964, when the appellant applied for the order, the lessee had not failed to pay the rent in lieu of drilling. In fact, he had paid on September 23, 1963, and it had been accepted. This circumstance was sufficient to require the County Court Judge to dismiss the application declaring the lease void.\nAs held by the Court below, if a judge under s. 6 of the Act is entitled to take into account a payment made and accepted after the making of the application, a fortiori he is entitled to take into account one made before. Section 6 gives the clearest indication that a failure to pay rent in lieu of drilling is, under the statute, considered to be a default and, therefore, is one which may be relieved against even after the application has been filed.\nCanadian Superior Oil of California, Ltd. v. Kanstrup et al., [1965] S.C.R. 92; East Crest Oil Co. v. Strohschein, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 432, considered.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from an order of Beardall Co.Ct.J., whereby a lessor\u2019s application made under the provisions of The Gas and Oil Leases Act, 1962-63 (Ont.), c. 49, was dismissed. Appeal dismissed.\nC.M.V. Pensa, for the appellant.\nC.E. Woolcombe, for the respondent, R.W. Taylor, Jr.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on March 2, 1965. By that judgment the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the order of His Honour Judge W.B. Beardall made on June 19, 1964, whereby His Honour had dismissed an application made by the lessor under the provisions of The Gas and Oil Leases Act, 1962-63 (Ont.), c. 49.\nThe appellant George Modde had granted to the Dominion Glass Company Limited an interest in the lands in question by a document dated August 5, 1955, and entitled \u201cAgreement of Lease\u201d. This document is in a well-recognized form for an oil and gas lease. The habendum read, in part: TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said lands for and during the term of 20 years from the date hereof and as long thereafter as crude oil and natural gas and related hydrocarbons (all of which are hereinafter called \u201cthe said substances\u201d) or any of them are produced from the said lands or as the Lessee conducts operations on the said land or any part thereof for the recovery of the same, with the exclusive right (subject to a reasonable compensation to be paid to the Lessor as hereinafter provided) to make geological surveys and otherwise to prospect and explore and to drill for, recover, remove and\/or sell all the said substances\u2026\nClause 1 of the lease read, in part:\n1. The Lessee agrees that if operations for drilling a well for the said substances or any of them shall not be commenced on the said land within one year from the date hereof, this lease shall terminate unless within such year the Lessee shall pay or tender to the Lessor or shall pay in accordance with this lease a sum equivalent to $1.00 per acre for the said land, which shall operate as rental and which shall extend for one year the time within which such operations may be commenced. In like manner the duration of this lease may be extended from year to year by commencement of operations or by payment or tender of rentals as follows: for the third and fourth years sum equivalent to $1.00 per acre of the said land per annum, for the fifth and sixth years equivalent to $1.00 per acre of the said land per annum and thereafter sum equivalent to $1.00 per acre of the said land per annum\u2026\nThe lessee Dominion Glass Company Limited paid the rental in lieu of drilling until the end of the rental year 1961-62. The rental year commenced on the 5th of August annually.\nThe lessee assigned the lease to Ralph W. Taylor, Jr., by an assignment made on May 31, 1961. No drilling took place in the rental year 1962-63 and no rental was paid in lieu of drilling until some day in October or November of 1962 when the assignee Taylor paid to the lessor the sum of $100 being at the rate of $1 per acre, the payment being made in the form of a cheque with a counterfoil attached bearing the instructions \u201cPlease detach, sign and return to Brady, Findlay and Quillian Ltd., P.O. Box 367, Chatham, Ontario\u201d. The lessee cashed that cheque, signed the said counterfoil and returned the same.\nIn the subsequent rental year, no drilling was commenced and no rental in lieu of drilling was tendered until September 23, 1963, when the same firm on behalf of the assignee issued its cheque in favour of the lessor for $100 and forwarded it to the lessor with a similar counterfoil attached. The lessor took the cheque and cashed the same but he did not sign and return the rental receipt acknowledgment attached thereto.\nBy application verified by an affidavit sworn on March 12, 1964, the appellant applied to the County Court Judge of the County of Kent for an order under the provisions of the said statute declaring void and vacating the registration of the said oil and gas lease dated August 5, 1955.\nIt must be noted that this statute is one in special and rather unusual form and that counsel for the appellant was not able to indicate that its counterpart existed elsewhere in Canada. The learned County Court Judge was exercising a statutory jurisdiction only, and apart from the provisions of The Gas and Oil Leases Act he had no jurisdiction to make the declaration requested. The appellant would have been left to his right to proceed by action in the Supreme Court of Ontario, the jurisdiction of the County Court Judge being limited, by the provisions of The County Courts Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 76, to cases where the value of the real property does not exceed $1,000.\nThe jurisdiction of the County Court Judge to consider the application is set out in s. 2(1) of The Gas and Oil Leases Act, which provides:\n2. (1) Where the lessor of any land alleges,\n(a) that a lessee has made default under the terms of a gas or oil lease affecting the land in that he has failed to commence to drill a well for natural gas or oil and has failed to pay rentals in lieu thereof; or\n(b) that a lessee has made default under the terms of a gas or oil lease affecting the land, other than a default specified in clause (a), and\n(i) that the default has continued for a period of two years, or\n(ii) that, the default having continued for a period of less than two years, the lessor has given notice in writing to the lessee specifying the default alleged and requiring the lessee to cure the default within thirty days of the giving of the notice, and that the lessee has not cured the default within such thirty days, the lessor may apply, upon affidavit, to a judge for an order declaring the lease void and, if the lease or any assignment or transfer thereof is registered, vacating every such registration.\nTherefore, under the provisions of the said s. 2(1) (a) the lessor\u2019s right to make an application is confined to the situa- tion where the lessee has (1) made default under the terms of an oil or gas lease in that he has failed to commence to drill a well, and (2) failed to pay rentals in lieu thereof.\nIn the present case, the lessee, i.e., the assignee Taylor, had certainly failed to commence to drill a well but on March 12, 1964, when the appellant applied for the order of the County Court Judge, the lessee had not failed to pay the rent in lieu of drilling. In fact, he had paid on September 23, 1963, and it had been accepted. In my view, this circumstance was sufficient to require the County Court Judge to dismiss the application declaring the lease void. This is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.\nRoach J.A. giving the judgment for the Court of Appeal, said:\nWe are of the opinion that the learned trial judge was right in dismissing that application for the reasons stated by him, viz., that the payment, though late, having been accepted and retained by the lessor, that amounted to a consent by him to waive strict compliance with the lease as far as the delayed rental provision for that year was concerned.\nThat conclusion brings up the question dealt with in many cases in this Court, in the Courts in the western provinces, and the United States as to whether the doctrine of waiver applies in the case of these oil and gas leases. Such decisions hold that there being no duty upon the lessee to either drill or pay rental unless he elects to do so, there was no breach by the lessee of any obligation arising under the lease and therefore there was no breach which the lessor could waive by the acceptance of the rental after its due period: Canadian Superior Oil of California, Ltd. v. Kanstrup et al.[1], where, however, the default took place after the end of a fixed term while here it took place during the course of the fixed term; East Crest Oil Co. v. Strohschein,[2] adopted by this Court per Martland J. in the aforesaid Canadian Superior Oil case at p. 105.\nThe appellant submits that under such a view there was in the present case no default and therefore there could be no waiver of default, despite the fact that the failure to pay the rent in lieu of drilling occurred here during the currency of the fixed term of the lease. I repeat again, however, that the jurisdiction of the learned County Court Judge herein was solely statutory. The statute, i.e., The Gas and Oil Leases Act, specifically refers to the failure to drill or to pay rent in lieu thereof as a default and it was in respect of such an alleged default that the appellant\u2019s application was made under that Act. If it is a default then, of course, it may be waived and, in my opinion, the learned County Court Judge was correct in his view that it had been waived. I am confirmed in that view, as were both the learned County Court Judge and the Court of Appeal, by s. 6, of The Gas and Oil Leases Act which provides, in part, as follows:\n6. The judge, upon the hearing of the application, shall not take into account, [among other things]\n\u2026\n(b) any rentals or other remuneration tendered after the making of the application;\nunless [the same] is agreed to or accepted by the applicant.\nI adopt herein the words of Roach J.A., giving judgment of the Court of Appeal, when he said:\nIf a judge under that section is entitled to take into account a payment made and accepted after the making of the application, a fortiori he is entitled to take into account one made before.\nI add that certainly s. 6 gives the clearest indication that a failure to pay rent in lieu of drilling is, under the statute, considered to be a default and, therefore, is one which may be relieved against even after the application had been filed.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Giffen & Pensa, London.\nSolicitors for the respondent, R.W.

An attempt to have a plan approved and registered was rejected by both the Minister and by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board. The plaintiff later followed the alternative course and he was told what the conditions would be. These were a severance fee of $800, a strip of land to widen the road on which the property fronted, and an easement for drainage across the property.\nSubsequently, he repeated his application through his solicitor and again was advised of the conditions, which were the same as before with the exception that the township also wanted a rounded corner where the aforementioned road met a highway. The plaintiff complied with these conditions. He paid the money and registered the necessary conveyances of land. The Board then gave its consent to the severance of the plaintiff\u2019s property. The plaintiff then was able to complete the sale of a house that he had built in the centre of the land.\nAt the time when this transaction was completed By-laws 3284 and 3306 of the defendant municipality were in force. By-law 3284 provided for a severance fee of $400 per lot. By-law 3306 provided that the land it needed for the widening of a road should be deeded by the applicant to the municipality, and at the applicant\u2019s expense. These by-laws were later quashed in separate proceedings by another party. Thereafter, the plaintiff sued to recover the $800 paid to the defendant and for damages for the value of the lands allegedly illegally taken. The judgment at trial allowed the recovery of the money and ordered the reconveyance of the land. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that neither the money nor the property could be recovered. With leave, the plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.: The by-law by virtue of which the municipality demanded that the $800 be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, by its words, required the plaintiff to enter into an agreement to both make the payment and convey the lands in question. Such agreement could not be considered at all as if it were an ordinary case in which parties being in dispute as to their respective rights compromised them in agreement.\nIn so far as the sum of $800 was concerned, this was an action for the repayment of moneys paid under a mistake in law. On the basis of the exception to the general principle that money so paid cannot be recovered, outlined in Maskell v. Horner (1915), 84 L.J.K.B. 1752, the plaintiff was entitled to have returned to him the $800 paid under compulsion and in mutual mistake of law. A practical compulsion was alone necessary. Also, the defendant\u2019s Clerk-treasurer, who was under a duty toward the plaintiff and other taxpayers of the municipality, was not, in the circumstances, in pari delicto to the taxpayer who was required to make the payment.\nThe Planning Board, in its demand for the conveyance of the lands, was simply acting as the agent of the defendant corporation in whose favour as grantee the said conveyance was made. The matter of compulsion applied to the conveyance as well as to the payment. There was no jurisdiction in the Planning Board under subs. (4) of s. 28 of The Planning Act, as it then existed, and was to be found in 1960-61 (Ont.), c. 76, which would have justified the demand for such conveyance. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to have such conveyance expunged from the register.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: As held by the Court of Appeal, the matter, having been dealt with by agreement, could be regarded in the light of an application to the Planning Board submitted and disposed of by that Board as a consent application. The agreement, whether authorized or not, was entered into freely by the parties, and the plaintiff, having enjoyed the fruits of his agreement, was not now entitled to recover either the money paid or the property conveyed in fulfilment thereof.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: The plaintiff did not convey his land and pay $800 to the municipality with any intention of preserving a right to dispute the legality of the demand, but rather as the result of an agreement which he entered into voluntarily under the advice of a competent solicitor. The fact that the by-law which was thought to make this action necessary was later quashed made it clear that the plaintiff was acting under a mistake of law, but the accompanying circumstances were not such as to entitle him to relief.\n[Beaver Valley Developments Ltd. v.

Appeal allowed, Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting. Gordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and P.A. Ballachey, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDouglas K. Laidlaw, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] which allowed an appeal from the judgment of Reville Co.Ct.J., setting aside the sum ordered and directing that judgment at trial should go dismissing the action with costs.\nHis Honour Judge Reville had given judgment in favour of the plaintiff (appellant in this Court) for $800 plus interest at 5 per cent from January 28, 1963, until payment. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the order of this Court made on December 6, 1965.\nThe respondent corporation had enacted By-law 3284 on March 20, 1961. That by-law was amended by By-law 3306 dated June 12, 1961. There had been in existence for some time a general subdivision by-law, No. 2377, which provided for the approval of plans of subdivision by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board. The said By-law 3284 as amended, provided:\n1. That all severances of land within the Municipality of the Township of Brantford which require the consent of the Brantford Suburban Planning Board under by-law 2377 shall be considered premature unless the owner enters into an agreement with the Municipality to pay a severance fee as hereinafter set forth;\n2. The said agreement shall provide for the payment of a severance fee which severance fee will be used to provide for the resulting development of the municipality and to assist in defraying in part the expenses which otherwise would be met by the general funds of the municipality resulting from the development of such lands;\n3. A severance fee of $400.00 per lot shall be charged for a lot having an area of 15,000 square feet, any smaller or larger lot shall contribute on a pro-rata basis having regard to the purpose for which it was sold and to its area and frontage;\n4. The agreement shall provide that where a severance is granted on a road that requires to be widened or is planned for widening, such land as is required for widening such road shall be deeded to the municipality. The survey costs and furnishing of the deed shall be the responsibility of the owner requesting the separation. [by amending By-law 3306.] The appellant owned some 9.79 acres on the east side of a township road known as the Forced Road. These lands abutted on the south on King\u2019s Highway No. 53. When the plaintiff had purchased the lands in the year 1957 they were vacant but he subsequently erected a residence approximately in the middle of the lands. Thereafter, he decided to subdivide his lands and to this end he had a plan of subdivision prepared. This plan of subdivision showed the land upon which his house sat as being a lot with a 100-foot frontage designated as lot 6, and other lots 1 to 5 to the north of the said lot containing his home, lot 7 to the south of the lot containing his home, and lot 8 to the east of lots 1 to 7. The appellant attempted in vain to have this plan of subdivision approved by the Brant-ford and Suburban Planning Board under By-law 2377 but such approval was subject to certain conditions which the applicant considered unreasonable and with which he was therefore unwilling to comply. The plaintiff thereupon abandoned his plans to so subdivide his property and determined to effect a severance by selling the 100-foot lot on which the house was situate to one Woodcock. Again the appellant made an application, on this occasion not for subdivision but for severance, and again the appellant was refused such right by the municipality and the matter was referred to the Planning Board.\nBy letter dated March 14, 1961, the Planning Board informed the appellant:\nThe following resolution was duly moved and seconded at a regularly constituted meeting of the Planning Board held on the 7th day of March, 1961: \u201cThat the Secretary be instructed to notify Mr. Eadie that a road widening strip, along his entire frontage on Forced Road, and an easement for drainage, across the property, to the satisfaction of the Township of Brantford, will be required, and that the parcel having approximately 2.4 acres and property on the east side, be combined in one deed.\u201d\nIn addition to that condition, the appellant was informed by the Clerk-treasurer of the Township of Brantford that his application for severance would not be approved unless he paid a severance fee of $400 per lot to the corporation. The appellant objected to this additional condition imposed by the corporation as well as to the other conditions imposed by the Planning Board with the result that this application for severance was not approved. In the fall of 1962, the plaintiff became ill and was confined to hospital for some seven and a half months. During this time, the plaintiff\u2019s wife became apprehensive about living alone in such a secluded area. He came to the conclusion that in any event he must sell the residence and do so with expedition. The appellant, therefore, made an agreement for sale with one John P. Gibbons and his wife subject to the severance of the appellant\u2019s property being approved by the proper authorities. In the meantime, the said By-law 3284 having been enacted on March 20, 1961, and amended on June 12, 1961, by By-law 3306, the appellant submitted his application to the Municipality of the Township of Brantford. After some conferences between the appellant\u2019s solicitor and the Clerk-treasurer of the Township of Brantford, the appellant\u2019s solicitor, Mr. R.T.L. Innes, wrote to the corporation a letter dated December 5, 1962, in which he said:\nConfirming the writer\u2019s telephone conversation with your Mr. Biggar today, we will undertake to pay to the Corporation of the Township of Brantford the sum of $800.00 severance fee upon the completion of the sale from William Eadie to John Patrick Gibbons and Hilda May Gibbons of part of Blocks 1 and 2 in the Kerr Tract having a frontage of 100 feet on the easterly side of Forced Road.\nWe have handed to Mr. Harold Marr, the secretary of the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board, a deed of a 17 foot strip on the easterly side of the Forced Road to the Corporation of the Township of Brantford for roadway widening purposes and also the deed from Mr. Eadie to Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons for approval.\nWe would be obliged if you would request the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board to approve of these conveyances in order that we may proceed with this deal.\nYour very truly,\nREAD & INNES\nPer: \u201cR.T.L. Innes\u201d\nTo that letter, the said Clerk-treasurer replied, by his letter of December 14th, as follows:\nYour communication of December 5th re the undertaking to pay $800 severance fee for the sale from Eadie to Gibbons is acceptable to Council.\nI have advised Mr. Marr of the Planning Board of the approval of Council.\nThe Planning Director and Secretary of the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board also wrote to the solicitor, on December 19, 1962, as follows:\nThe following resolution was duly moved and seconded at a regularly constituted meeting of the Planning Board, held on the 18th day of December, 1962: \u201cThe Conveyance William Eadie to John Gibbons, being part of blocks 1 and 2, Kerr Tract, be approved for registration, provided a daylight corner at the junction of Highway #53 and Forced Road be included in the 17\u2019 strip of land being dedicated to the Township of Brantford.\u201d\nIt is to be noted that in the latter letter an additional requirement was added, i.e., that he should provide for a daylight corner at the junction of Highway 53 and Forced Road. Mr. Innes sought instructions from his client who authorized submission to even this additional condition. The Brantford and Suburban Planning Board then consented to the severance and returned the copy of the deed by which the severance was to be carried out with its consent endorsed thereon. Subsequently, the solicitor wrote to the corporation enclosing the deed from the appellant to the corporation of the 17-foot strip for road widening and the land to form the daylight corner, and also remittance of the sum of $800 demanded by the corporation.\nThe said By-law 3284 was considered in the Supreme Court of Ontario in the action of Noble v. Township of Brantford[3]. By judgment dated May 22, 1963, Donnelly J. quashed the appeal. No appeal was taken from that judgment.\nThereafter, by writ issued February 24, 1963, this appellant sued to recover the sum of $800 paid to the respondent, for damages for the value of the lands allegedly illegally taken, and for costs.\nThe learned County Court Judge said, in his reasons for judgment:\nThis raises the question of whether the severance fee of $800.00, demanded illegally as it turns out\u2026\nIn addition, this action raises the further question of whether the defendant Corporation is entitled to retain the 17-foot strip of land across the whole frontage of the plaintiff\u2019s lands for road-widening purposes, and the lands for the daylight corner which were deeded by the plaintiff to the defendant in order to comply with conditions imposed by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board.\nThe learned County Court Judge dealt first with the second question and concluded:\nIt follows, therefore, that the conveyance by the plaintiff to the defendant, dated the 29th of November, 1962, and registered as No. A-49398 (Exhibit 9) is a nullity, and an order will be made expunging the particulars of this conveyance from the abstract in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of the County of Brant dealing with Blocks 1 and 2 of the Kerr Tract in the said Township. There had been, up to the date of the trial, no physical change in the lands which are the subject of such conveyance.\nIn his statement of claim, the plaintiff claimed relief in addition to costs of only the return of the sum of $800 with interest and damages in the sum of $2,000. The learned County Court Judge, however, as I have pointed out, gave judgment expunging the conveyance of the lands in question from the plaintiff to the defendant. I find no mention in the notice of appeal of the present respondent to the Court of Appeal of any objection to such an order on the basis that it was beyond the relief claimed, nor is there any such objection in its factum to this Court.\nIt, therefore, will be my course to consider this appeal as if the learned County Court Judge had the jurisdiction to make the order which he did make.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the present respondent from the judgment of the learned County Court Judge and dismissed the action upon the basis that the matter was dealt with by agreement. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had agreed to both make the payment and convey the land aforesaid, and the defendant had agreed to accept such payment and conveyance in satisfaction of any terms or conditions which it might otherwise request the Board to impose whether those terms took their root in the by-law or not. Schroeder J.A., said:\nThe matter may therefore be regarded in the light of an application to the Planning Board submitted and disposed of by that Board as a consent application. In that view of the case it falls squarely within the principle laid down by this Court in Beaver Valley Developments Limited v. Township of North York and Dominion Ins. Corp., (1960), 23 D.L.R. (2d) 341, and affirmed by the Supreme Court in (1961), 28 D.L.R. (2d) 76.\nWith respect, that view fails to take into account the fact that the by-law by virtue of which the municipality demanded that the $800 be paid by the appellant to the respondent, by its words which I have recited above, required the appellant to enter into such an agreement. I am of the opinion that such agreement cannot be considered at all as if it were an ordinary case in which parties being in dispute as to their respective rights compromised them in an agreement. In the Beaver Valley Developments case, supra, Locke J. in this Court said at pp. 78-9:\nIf it were necessary to deal with these contentions on the merits they should, in my opinion, fail, quite apart from any consideration of the amendment to s. 26 of the Planning Act (1955 (Ont.), c. 61) made by s. 4 (3) of c. 71 of the Statutes of 1959. The Glendale sewage disposal plant had been built by the respondent township and rates imposed upon other lands in the township which enjoyed the benefit of its use in order to pay for its construction and operation. At the time the appellant applied to the township for approval of its plan the township was under no obligation to permit the use of its sewage disposal plant by the appellant, a fact recognized by the agreement of August 19, 1954, above mentioned. The sums stipulated for in the agreement between the parties were simply contributions to be made towards the cost theretofore incurred by the township for the plant. The agreement was entered into by the appellant under legal advice and voluntarily. The contention that, in these circumstances, the moneys so to be paid were in the nature of taxes, direct or indirect, is, in my opinion, untenable.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the power of the township to enter into such an agreement was undoubted. If the contrary was fairly arguable prior to the passing of the amendment of 1959, this was no longer so, in my opinion, after that was done.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge was correct in considering the plaintiff\u2019s action, in so far as the sum of $800 is concerned, was an action for the return of $800 paid upon the respondent\u2019s demand which was based on a by-law subsequently found to be illegal and a nullity. I am prepared to accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that this is an action for the repayment of moneys paid under a mistake in law. Counsel draws a distinction between the present case and the decision of this Court in George (Porky) Jacobs Enterprises Ltd. v. City of Regina[4]. There, this Court dealt with a demand for payment of licence fees. It turned out that no by-law existed by which such fees as were demanded could be exacted. It is true, therefore, that that decision is an illustration of a mutual mistake in fact. It must be pointed out, however, that the judgment of this Court therein was based upon both a mistake in fact and a payment made under the compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity. At p. 330, Hall J. gave judgment for the Court. He said:\nI am of the opinion that the payments were made under compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity and not voluntarily as claimed by the respondent. The law on this subject was aptly summarized by Lord Reading C.J. in Maskell v. Horner (1915), 84 L.J.K.B. 1752 at 1755. That decision of this Court, therefore, in so far as it dealt with the matter of payment under urgent and pressing necessity, is applicable to the present case where a by-law did exist which purported to permit the payment of such fee as was demanded by the respondent corporation but that by-law was subsequently found illegal and quashed.\nIt is, of course, a trite principle that money paid under a mutual mistake of law cannot be recovered. That principle, however, is subject to several well-established exceptions. I need not deal with the various exceptions in detail. The learned County Court Judge relied, inter alia, upon the exception that money paid to such person as a court officer under a mistake of law may be recovered. He was of the view that money was paid to the respondent corporation on the insistence of its Clerk-treasurer, whose position he equated to that of a highly-placed civil servant in a government department or an officer of the court, and it was highly inequitable, if not dishonest, for the respondent corporation to insist on the retention and that, therefore, they should be repaid. There is much to be said in support of such a view.\nI prefer to base my opinion upon the exception to the general principle outlined by Lord Reading C.J. in Maskell v. Horner[5], who said:\nIf a person with knowledge of the facts pays money which he is not in law bound to pay, and in circumstances implying that he is paying it voluntarily to close the transaction, he cannot recover it. Such a payment is in law like a gift, and the transaction cannot be re-opened. If a person pays money which he is not bound to pay, under the compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity, or of seizure, actual or threatened, of his goods, he can recover it as money had and received. The money is paid, not under duress in the strict sense of the term, as that implies duress of person, but under the pressure of seizure or detention of goods, which is analogous to that of duress. Payment under such pressure establishes that the payment is not made voluntarily to close the transaction. The payment is made for the purpose of averting a threatened evil, and is made, not with the intention of giving up a right, but under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand.\nThe Maskell case was approved by this Court in Knut-son v. Bourkes Syndicate[6]; Municipality of St. John et al. v. Fraser Brace Overseas Corpn. et al. [7]; and George (Porky) Jacobs Enterprises Ltd. v. City of Regina, supra.\nIt was submitted by counsel for the respondent that in order to justify the plaintiff demanding repayment of money paid under mutual mistake in law upon the basis that he was under compulsion to do so, the plaintiff must have been faced with a situation where there was no other alternative available to him. I am of the opinion that the bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery is not so stringent and that a practical compulsion is alone necessary. In each of the three cases in this Court approving Maskell v. Horner, which I have cited above, there were other courses available to the plaintiffs but those other courses were time consuming and impractical. Counsel for the respondent said, in the present case, the appellant could have forced a consideration by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board then appealed from their refusal to grant the severance to the Ontario Municipal Board. That Board, I am convinced, would have felt itself bound by the by-laws of the corporation and the best the appellant could have done was to have appealed to the Court of Appeal from their refusal to disallow or vary the order of the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board upon the point of law. It is true that this exact course was taken in Mary Margaret Noble v. Brantford and Suburban Planning Board, which apparently is unreported but where judgment in the Court of Appeal was delivered on. February 3, 1964. Such a course, however, would, of necessity, have been so fraught with delays that the sale to Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons would have been lost. In the meantime, the appellant was languishing in hospital. It was at that very time that he had the paramount need of selling the property and establishing his wife into other habitation more suitable to their then circumstances, not months or even years later.\nIn Knutson v. Bourkes Syndicate, supra, Kerwin J., said at p. 425:\nIn order to protect its position under the option agreement and to secure title to the lands which it was under obligation to transfer to the incorporated company, the Syndicate was under a practical compulsion to make the payments in question and is entitled to their repayment.\nThe italicizing is my own. There is also, in support of my view, the decision of the Judicial Committee in Kiriri Cotton Company Ltd. v. Dewani[8], where Lord Denning said at p. 204:\n\u2026 if there is something more in addition to a mistake of law\u2014if there is something in the defendant\u2019s conduct which shows that, of the two of them, he is the one primarily responsible for the mistake\u2014then it may be recovered back. Thus, if as between the two of them the duty of observing the law is placed on the shoulders of the one rather than the other\u2014it being imposed on him specially for the protection of the other\u2014then they are not in pari delicto and the money can be recovered back\u2026 Likewise, if the responsibility for the mistake lies more on the one than the other\u2014because he had misled the other when he ought to know better\u2014then again they are not in pari delicto and the money can be recovered back.\nIn this case, the appellant, as a taxpayer and inhabitant of the defendant corporation, was dealing with the Clerk-treasurer of the corporation and that Clerk-treasurer was under a duty toward the appellant and other taxpayers of the municipality. When that Clerk-treasurer demands payment of a sum of money on the basis of an illegal by-law despite the fact that he does not then know of its illegality, he is not in pari delicto to the taxpayer who is required to pay that sum.\nCounsel for the respondent argued that the appellant\u2019s demand for payment here could not be based upon the illegality of the by-law as subsequently found by Donnelly J., as there was nothing in the evidence to show that the appellant even knew of the existence of the by-law. I think such a position is untenable. The appellant had been, prior to the date of this transaction, himself a member of the municipal council and would have had to know that the municipal officers act only in accordance with what they believe are their rights and duties under by-laws. The appellant was in hospital at the time of the transactions and was represented by an able solicitor who had many decades of experience in that very municipality, and who conferred frequently with the Clerk-treasurer of the municipality. It is absolutely inevitable that the existence of the by-law and its terms would have been discussed between these two persons. Moreover, the demand was made in purported exact compliance with the said by-law.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appellant is entitled to have returned to him the sum of $800 paid under compulsion and in mutual mistake of law. In my view, the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board, in its demand for the conveyance of the lands which were described in that deed, was simply acting as the agent for the respondent corporation in whose favour as grantee the said conveyance was made. All that I have said as to compulsion heretofore applies to the conveyance as well as to the payment. I am in agreement with the view of the learned County Court Judge that there was no jurisdiction in the said Planning Board under subs. (4) of s. 28 of The Planning Act, as it then existed, and was to be found in the Statutes of Ontario 1960-61, c. 76, which would have justified the demand for such conveyance.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant is entitled to have such conveyance expunged from the register.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the learned County Court Judge. The appellant is also entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The plaintiff acquired the property in question on the road known as Forced Road in October of 1957. The area in which the land was located was designated as a subdivision control area and it could only be divided into different parcels either by the registration of an approved plan of subdivision or by obtaining permission from the appropriate Planning Board to sever the land under the provisions of The Planning Act. An attempt was made in the year 1958 to have a plan approved and registered. This plan was rejected both by the Minister and by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board.\nIn March of 1961, the plaintiff followed the alternative course and he was told what the conditions would be. These were a severance fee of $800, a road widening strip to bring the width of the road up to 66 feet, and an easement for drainage across the property.\nIn December of 1962, he repeated his application through his solicitor and again was advised of the conditions, which were the same as before with the exception that the township also wanted a rounded corner where the Forced Road met the highway. These conditions were imposed and communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor by the Brantford and Suburban Planning Board and by the Clerk of the Township of Brantford. The plaintiff complied with these conditions. He paid the money and executed and registered the necessary conveyances of land. The Board then gave its consent to the severance of the plaintiff\u2019s property. The plaintiff then was able to complete the sale of a house that he had built in the centre of the land.\nThe conditions imposed were not complied with under protest, nor was there any attempt made to appeal against the conditions imposed by the Planning Board.\nAt the time when this transaction was completed, By-laws 3284 and 3306 of the Township of Brantford were in force. They were passed on March 20, 1961, and June 12, 1961. By\u2011law 3284 provided for a severance fee of $400 per lot. By-law 3306 provided that the land it needed for the widening of a road should be deeded by the applicant to the municipality, and at the applicant\u2019s expense.\nThese are the by-laws that were quashed in 1963 in the case of Noble v. Township of Brantford[9]. The present action was begun in February of 1964.\nThe judgment of the County Court Judge allowed the recovery of the money and ordered the reconveyance of the land which had been given up as a condition of the consent from the Planning Board. He held that the transfers and payment were made under effective protest and that although they had been made under mistake of law, they came within certain recognized exceptions to the rule that payments made under mistake of law are not recoverable.\nI agree with the unanimous conclusion of the Court of Appeal that this money cannot be recovered nor the transfers annulled on the grounds stated by the Court of Appeal in the following passage:\nWe do not find it necessary to dispose of the present case on that basis. What the plaintiff desired here was, in effect, a subdivision of his property by severance. In the ordinary course he would have been bound to apply to the Planning Board for approval of the registration of the deed of the parcel which he sought to convey. The Planning Board on due notice to the municipality would have heard it as to any terms or conditions which, in its submission, ought to be imposed. The parties did not proceed in this way. The matter was dealt with by agreement, the plaintiff having agreed to make the payment and the transfer of land aforesaid, which the defendant agreed to accept in satisfaction of any terms or conditions which it might otherwise request the Planning Board to impose, whether those terms took their root in the by-law or not. The matter may therefore be regarded in the light of an application to the Planning Board submitted and disposed of by that Board as a consent application. In that view of the case it falls squarely within the principle laid down by this Court in Beaver Valley Developments Ltd. v. Township of North York and Dominion Ins. Corp. (1960), 23 D.L.R. (2d) 341, and affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in (1961), 28 D.L.R. (2d) 76. Whether the agreement between the parties was authorized or unauthorized, they entered into it freely as a means of securing the consent of the Planning Board to the severance of this particular parcel from the rest of the land, all of which was in an area of subdivision control. The plaintiff completed his transaction of sale and having thus enjoyed the fruits of his agreement with the defendant, he is not now entitled to recover either the money paid or the property conveyed in fulfilment thereof.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brothers Judson and Spence and I agree with the former that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThis does not appear to me to be a case to which the decision of Lord Reading in Maskell v. Horner[10] applies. Maskell v. Horner was not a case of payment under a mistake in law. In the course of his reasons for judgment Lord Reading said, at p. 118:\nAs I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff did not pay under a mistake, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether such mistake was of fact or of law. I express no opinion on the point.\nIt appears to me, therefore, that Lord Reading\u2019s decision is not to be treated as applying to a situation where a person has paid money voluntarily under a mistake of law but is rather to be confined, as Lord Reading indicates, to cases in which:\nThe payment is made for the purpose of averting a threatened evil and is made not with the intention of giving up a right but under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand.\nAs it appears to me, the appellant did not convey his land and pay $800 to the municipality with any intention of preserving a right to dispute the legality of the demand, but rather as the result of an agreement which he entered into voluntarily under the advice of a competent solicitor. The fact that the by-law which was thought to make this action necessary was later quashed in the case of Noble v. Township of Brantford[11], makes it clear that the appellant was acting under a mistake of law, but with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I do not think that the accompanying circumstances are such as to entitle him to relief.\nLike my brother Judson, I adopt the grounds stated by the Court of Appeal and as I have indicated, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment at trial restored, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Ballachey, Moore & Hart, Brantford.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Boddy, Ryerson, Houlding & Clarke, Brantford.\n[1] [1965] 2 O.R. 704, 51 D.L.R.

The respondent also added to the income of the appellant for the 1955 and 1956 taxation years, as well as for the 1954 and 1957 taxation years, the appellant\u2019s share of the profit of another syndicate known as the New Sheppard Syndicate, the profit of which also arose from the purchase and sale of certain land. The purpose in forming the Mainshep Syndicate was to acquire a parcel of land and erect thereon duplexes or other multiple dwellings, or to otherwise deal with the said land. The New Sheppard Syndicate was formed for the purpose of acquiring land in the vicinity of the Mainshep property on which to develop a shopping centre to service the proposed housing development. Zoning difficulties having been encountered, the proposed housing project was abandoned and both the Mainshep and New Sheppard properties were later sold at a profit. The appellant appealed from the assessment for each of the years 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957 to the Tax Appeal Board, claiming that the amounts added from the profit of the Mainshep Syndicate and the New Sheppard Syndicate were not income and the Tax Appeal Board allowed the appellant\u2019s appeal. An appeal by the respondent from the decision of the Tax Appeal Board was allowed by the Exchequer Court and the appellant then appealed to this Court. The appeal to this Court was limited to the issue as to whether the appellant\u2019s share of the profit of the Mainshep Syndicate in the years 1955 and 1956 was part of the appellant\u2019s income for each of the years or was a capital gain.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board.

In the early hours of the morning he had been a passenger in a car which, to his knowledge, was wrongfully out of the possession of its owner. In the car there were found three screwdrivers, a flashlight, socks, nylon stockings, a crowbar and a pair of woollen gloves with leather palms. Some ten days earlier, the police had seen the appellant and the same driver in the same car at about the same hour and had found therein similar articles with the exception of the crowbar. The appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law: (1) was there any evidence, before the magistrate, of possession by the appellant; and (2) was the Crown obliged to adduce evidence to show suspicious circumstances before the onus was cast on the accused to provide an explanation?\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was evidence on which the magistrate, acting judicially, could convict the appellant of possession.\nOnce possession of an instrument capable of being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.\nDroit criminel\u2014Possession d\u2019instruments d\u2019effraction\u2014Preuve de possession\u2014Instruments employ\u00e9s normalement pour des fins ordinaires\u2014L\u2019accus\u00e9 a le fardeau de donner une explication\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 3(4), 295(1).\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de possession d\u2019instruments d\u2019effraction sous l\u2019art 295(1) du Code Criminel. Aux petites heures du matin, il \u00e9tait passager dans une automobile qui, \u00e0 sa connaissance, \u00e9tait ill\u00e9galement hors de la possession de son propri\u00e9taire, et dans laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s trois tournevis, une lampe de poche, des bas de nylon, un levier et une paire de gants de laine dont les paumes \u00e9taient en cuir. Dix jours auparavant, la police avait vu l\u2019appelant et le m\u00eame conducteur dans la m\u00eame automobile \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure et y avait trouv\u00e9 des objets semblables, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion du levier.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nB.A. Crane, for the appellant.\nD.A. McKenzie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant Jasper Tupper was charged under s. 295(1) of the Criminal Code with possession of housebreaking instruments. Section 295(1) reads:\n295. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession any instrument for house-breaking, vault-breaking or safe-breaking is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\nOn October 5, 1965, at 1:50 a.m., the police stopped a car at James and King Streets in Hamilton. One Donald Richardson was the driver and the appellant was a passenger in the front seat. The police found in the vehicle:\n(1) a yellow-handled screwdriver in the rear seat;\n(2) a Phillips maroon-handled screwdriver on the front seat on the passenger side;\n(3) a red flashlight in the glove compartment;\n(4) two white socks in the glove compartment; (5) two nylon stockings in the glove compartment;\n(6) a seventeen-inch gooseneck crowbar under the front seat on the driver\u2019s side;\n(7) a pair of grey woollen gloves with leather palms under the front seat on the driver\u2019s side;\n(8) a screwdriver with a three and one-half inch blade which was inserted in the right-hand woollen glove under the front seat on the driver\u2019s side.\nOn September 24, 1965, at 1:45 a.m., the same car had been stopped on Birge Street in Hamilton. Richardson was the driver and the appellant Tupper was a passenger, together with one other person. The police had found on this occasion similar articles with the exception of the crowbar. The police did not lay a charge on this occasion.\nBoth Richardson, the driver, and the appellant, Tupper, were convicted. Tupper appealed to the Court of Appeal. His conviction was affirmed and his sentence increased. With leave, he appeals to this Court on two questions of law:\n1. Whether there was any evidence, before the magistrate, of possession of the instruments by the Appellant;\n2. If the instruments found are capable of and normally used for ordinary purposes, but may also be used for housebreaking, is the Crown obliged to adduce evidence to show suspicious circumstances before the onus is cast on the accused to provide an explanation?\nQuestion 1.\nOn the question of possession, my opinion is that there was evidence on which the magistrate, acting judicially, could convict.\nThis car was owned neither by Richardson nor by Tupper. It had been leased by a third person, Edward Ryckman, from Snelgrove Motors on September 23, 1965, for one day. They got it back a month later with an extra 3,000 miles on the car. The articles were not in the car when it was rented to Ryckman. Ryckman said they belonged to him and his wife.\nThe car was first stopped the day after it was leased by Ryckman, that is, on September 24, 1965, at 1:45 a.m., with Richardson as driver, Tupper as a passenger, together with a third person. It was stopped again on October 5, 1965, and it was in connection with the articles then found in the car that Richardson and Tupper were charged.\nIn my opinion, on that occasion, Richardson and Tupper were both in wrongful possession of the car. The fact that Richardson was driving in these circumstances does not give him sole possession of the car. They were both in possession of the car and both as wrongdoers, knowing that the car had been retained by Ryckman beyond the term of its lease, which was one day.\nRichardson and Tupper were not going about their ordinary business with screwdrivers, flashlights, nylon stockings and a crowbar in the middle of the day. They were abroad at a highly suspicious time. There was also evidence that one of the screwdrivers was on the seat on which Tupper was actually sitting. Screwdrivers are not left haphazardly on the seats of cars.\nOn these facts the magistrate could properly find that both Richardson and Tupper were in possession of these instruments. Section 3(4) of the Criminal Code reads:\n(4) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) a person has anything in possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly\n(i) has it in the actual possession or custody of another person,\nor\n(ii) has it in any place, whether or not that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of another person; and\n(b) where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.\nQuestion 2.\nLeave was given on this question because of a conflict in the jurisprudence between some of the provinces. On the one side there are the cases of R. v. Smith[1]; R. v. Haire[2]; R. v. McRae[3]. These cases held that if the tools, although capable of being used for housebreaking, would normally serve a lawful purpose, the Crown should prove \u201csome event, overt action, or declaration, to identify the tools with a specific unlawful purpose\u201d. In my opinion, this statement of the law is erroneous and ignores the plain wording of the section. The English version reads: \u201cany instrument for house-breaking\u201d; the French version reads: \u201cun instrument pouvant servir aux effractions de maisons\u201d. The French version makes the meaning clear. Both versions mean the same thing. An instrument for house-breaking is one capable of being used for house-breaking.\nThe principle contended for here is that there is no onus on the accused to provide an explanation until the Crown has adduced some evidence from which an inference might be drawn that the accused intended to use such instruments for the purpose of house-breaking.\nI think the law is correctly stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Gilson[4] and in the earlier judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Kernychne but unreported; R. v. Singleton[5], decided in 1956, and in R. v. Jones[6]\nOnce possession of an instrument capable of being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nHALL J.:\u2014I have read the reasons of my brother Judson and, with respect to question 1, I agree that there was evidence upon which the magistrate, acting judicially, could convict and I would dismiss the appeal.\nQuestion 2 has given me a great deal of concern. I am, with reluctance, compelled by the wording of s. 295(1) which reads:\n295. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession any instrument for house-breaking, vault-breaking or safe-breaking is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\nto agree that, as stated by my brother Judson:\nOnce possession of an instrument capable of being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for possession of the instrument at the time and place in question. Whether Parliament intended it or not, s. 295(1), as it reads, permits of no other interpretation. It puts the possessor of many necessary tools of trade, automobile accessories and tools and hundreds of similar instruments used and carried daily for routine purposes which might be capable of being used for house-breaking in the position that merely from being in possession under the most innocent circumstances, he can be brought into court and put to the proof that he has a lawful excuse for having a screwdriver, a flashlight or some other such household tool or instrument in his car, boat, tool kit or on his person at any given time or place which includes his home. It can be argued and readily accepted that this may not happen frequently, but it can and may happen if Parliament really intended what the section says when, without any qualification as to time or circumstance, it put the burden of proof on the person in whose possession any such item may be found.\nThe interpretation which the wording of the section compels should, I think, be drawn to Parliament\u2019s attention.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and he appealed to this Court on the ground that the jury was not properly instructed. Two questions were raised before this Court: Whether, in order to convict under s. 221(4), it was necessary for the tribunal of fact to be satisfied that the conduct of the accused went beyond inadvertent negligence and amounted to advertent negligence, and secondly, whether the Court of Appeal erred in the circumstances in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Code.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Judson J.: The distinction between criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving is that for the former what must be shown is advertence or subjective foresight as to the consequences of one\u2019s conduct, and that for the latter all that must be shown is inadvertence in the sense of failure to exercise the care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances. The jury\u2019s task is to determine whether the driving was in fact dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time was or might reasonably be expected to be at such place. By its very terms s. 221(4) goes beyond the minimum of civil negligence and the task of the jury is to consider the actual facts of the driving in the light of the section. Applying the section to the facts of this case, the appellant\u2019s conduct brought him within the wording of the section. There was no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the instruction to be given to a jury on a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the Code, and the Court of Appeal did not err in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.\nPer Cartwright, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: In Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R. 238, it was decided that proof of inadvertent negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction under s. 221(4) of the Code. In so deciding, the Court was expressing a legal proposition which was a necessary step to the judgment pronounced. That proposition should have been accepted by the Court of Appeal under the principle of stare decisis. Under the circumstances the instruction given by the trial judge was adequate. In any event, on consideration of all the record, this was a proper case in which to apply the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.\nDroit criminel\u2014Conduite dangereuse\u2014Est-ce au-del\u00e0 de la n\u00e9gligence inattentive\u2014Y a\u2011t-il eu erreur judiciaire\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 221(4), 592(1)(b)(iii).\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable par un jury d\u2019avoir conduit d\u2019une fa\u00e7on dangereuse pour le public, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code criminel. Le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel et il en appela devant cette Cour pour le motif que les directives au jury n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 les bonnes. Deux questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es devant cette Cour: A savoir si, en vue d\u2019obtenir un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 sous l\u2019art. 221(4), il est n\u00e9cessaire que le tribunal des faits soit satisfait que la conduite de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait au-del\u00e0 de la n\u00e9gligence inattentive et \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence intentionnelle, et deuxi\u00e8mement, \u00e0 savoir si la Cour d\u2019Appel a err\u00e9 dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en mettant en jeu les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Le Juge en Chef Taschereau et le Juge Judson: La distinction entre la n\u00e9gligence criminelle dans la mise en service d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur et la conduite dangereuse est que dans le cas de la premi\u00e8re ce qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli est une pr\u00e9m\u00e9ditation intentionnelle ou subjective quant aux cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019acte, et que dans le cas de la deuxi\u00e8me tout ce qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli est l\u2019inattention dans le sens d\u2019un d\u00e9faut d\u2019exercer le soin qu\u2019une personne raisonnable exercerait dans les circonstances. La t\u00e2che du jury est de d\u00e9terminer si la conduite \u00e9tait en fait dangereuse pour le public, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, y compris la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tat de cet endroit, l\u2019utilisation qui en est faite ainsi que l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la circulation alors constatable ou raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible \u00e0 cet endroit.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming a conviction for dangerous driving. Appeal dismissed.\nRobert J. Carter, for the appellant.\nR.G. Thomas, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Judson J. was delivered by JUDSON J.:\u2014In O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[2], this Court decided that s. 55(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, was within the provincial legislative power. This section read:\n55. (1) Every person who drives a motor vehicle or a trolley bus on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway is guilty of an offence.\nAt that time the Criminal Code dealt only with criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. What had been formerly s. 285(6) of the Criminal Code as enacted by 1938, c. 44, s. 16, was omitted when the new Criminal Code was enacted by 2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51. This dealt with dangerous driving. Dangerous driving was reintroduced into the Code by 1960-61, c. 43, s. 3, as s. 221(4). It reads:\n221. (4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nIt differs from s. 285(6) of the old Code in this respect: The old Code said \u201crecklessly or in a manner which is dangerous to the public\u201d. The new Code drops \u201crecklessly or\u201d and says only \u201cin a manner which is dangerous to the public\u201d. The new section may be referred to conveniently as the \u201cdangerous driving section\u201d.\nThis was the charge against Horst Binus, the appellant in this appeal. He was charged that he\non the 15th day of May, 1965 at the Township of East Gwillimbury, in the County of York, did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle bearing Ontario licence #385703, upon a road in a manner that is dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such road and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such road, contrary to Section 221(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nHe was convicted before a judge and jury. His conviction was affirmed on appeal[3] and he now appeals to this Court on the ground that the jury was not properly instructed. He says that the jury must be told that they cannot convict of dangerous driving unless there is something more than that minimum of negligence which may involve a driver in. liability to pay damages. The submission has been put in a variety of ways: that the conduct must be of such a nature that it can be considered a breach of duty to the public and deserving of punishment, or that there should be distinguishing marks of criminality or proof of a high degree of negligence and a moral quality carried into the act. It is argued that this type of instruction must be given because of the combined effect of O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, supra, and Mann v. The Queen[4]. In Mann v. The Queen the point involved was whether the provincial Careless Driving section, similar in effect to the one involved in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, could stand after Parliament had introduced again to the Criminal Code the offence of \u201cdangerous driving\u201d. This Court held that it could.\nAll the obiter observations in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling and Mann v. The Queen have been collected in support of this submission. If the submission is accepted it means the formalization of a judge\u2019s charge or self-instruction in these cases. First of all, he must start with civil negligence, which involves liability if a driver departs from the standard that may be expected of a reasonably competent driver. Then he must say something more than is needed for dangerous driving and something more still for criminal negligence, i.e., recklessness.\nWe are not concerned with criminal negligence in the sense of recklessness here. Dangerous driving is an offence of lower degree. The following passage is a summary of the reasons of the Court of Appeal in this case:\nTo convict of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) (enacted 1960-61, c. 43, s. 3) of the Criminal Code no proof is required of mens rea in the sense of either intention to jeopardize the lives or safety of others or recklessness as to such consequences. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not drive with the care that a prudent person would exercise in the circumstances confronting him having regard to the nature, condition, and use of the place where the accused was driving and the amount of traffic that was or might reasonably have been expected to be in such place, and that the accused in failing to exercise such care in fact endangered the lives or safety of others whether or not harm resulted. Consideration of the ingredients of the offence of dangerous driving for the purpose of determining legislative competence of a provincial Legislature as opposed to Parliament is not controlling for the purpose of the substantive criminal law. Although an examination of the penalties provided by Parliament for criminally negligent driving, which does involve mens rea in the sense of recklessness, on the one hand, and for dangerous driving, on the other, suggests that Parliament envisaged these two offences as shading into each other, it does not follow that Parliament intended that dangerous driving involved mens rea and this conclusion is supported by the language of s. 221(4) which speaks of the objective factor of driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The distinction between criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving is that for the former what must be shown is advertence or subjective foresight as to the consequences of one\u2019s conduct, and that for the latter all that must be shown is inadvertence in the sense of failure to exercise the care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances.\nI think that this is the correct approach. The fallacy in the appellant\u2019s submission is this: He wants the Court to say that unless it does as he suggests, he will be convicted of the crime of dangerous driving for conduct which may amount to no more than civil negligence, or, to put it another way, negligence which should involve only civil consequences\u2014compensation. This is not so. The section itself contains its own definition. The jury\u2019s task is to determine whether the driving was in fact dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time was or might reasonably be expected to be at such place. By its very terms the section goes beyond the minimum of civil negligence and the task of the jury is to consider the actual facts of the driving in the light of the section. If this is done, there will be no conviction for negligence involving only civil consequences. To this extent the section does involve a consideration of the state of mind of the driver towards his task. A motor car does not drive itself. It responds to the direction which it gets from the driver within the limits of space and time available to him.\nThe application of the section to the facts of this case gives no difficulty. This motorist was driving on a county road. He came out of an \u201cS\u201d curve and saw ahead of him two boys on a bicycle 150 yards away. There was no oncoming traffic. He struck the bicycle from the rear. His defence was that the boys swerved ahead of him. There was evidence given by a bystander that no such thing happened and that he drove straight into the boys and did not apply his brakes or swerve until the moment of impact. The jury was confronted with a very simple situation. What did this man do? What should he have done? Did his conduct bring him within the wording of the section? It obviously did.\nI would answer the points in issue in this appeal generally by saying that there was no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the instruction to be given to a jury on a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code and that the Court of Appeal did not err in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises and the grounds for the decision of the Court of Appeal[5] are summarized in the reasons of my brother Judson.\nThis appeal raises two questions, (i) whether in order to convict on a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code it is necessary for the tribunal of fact to be satisfied that the conduct of the accused went beyond inadvertent negligence and amounted to advertent negligence and (ii) whether the Court of Appeal, having reached the conclusion that the charge of the learned trial Judge was not adequate, erred in the circumstances of this case in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nIn stating the first question I am using the terms \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d and \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d in the sense in which they were employed by all members of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[6], adopting the phraseology used in Kenny\u2019s Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 34, and in Glanville Williams\u2019 Criminal Law, 1953, p. 82.\nIf the matter were res integra I would find the reasoning of my brother Judson and that of Laskin J.A. in the case at bar most persuasive; but it appears to me that in Mann v. The Queen[7] at least five of the seven members of this Court who heard the appeal decided that proof of inadvertent negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction under s. 221(4) and that in so deciding they were expressing a legal proposition which was a necessary step to the judgment pronounced. I find it impossible to treat what was said in this regard as obiter, and, in my respectful view, that proposition should have been accepted by the Court of Appeal under the principle of stare decisis. The binding effect of a proposition of law enunciated as a necessary step to the judgment pronounced is not lessened by the circumstance that the Court might have reached the same result for other reasons.\nI do not doubt the power of this Court to depart from a previous judgment of its own but, where the earlier decision has not been made per incuriam, and especially in cases in which Parliament or the Legislature is free to alter the law on the point decided, I think that such a departure should be made only for compelling reasons. The ancient warning, repeated by Anglin C.J.C. in Daoust, Lalonde & Cie Lt\u00e9e v. Ferland[8], ubi jus est aut vagum aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus prevalebit, should not be forgotten.\nTurning now to the second question, as to whether the Court of Appeal erred in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code, I have reached the conclusion that they did not.\nFollowing the charge of the learned trial Judge to the jury, counsel for the appellant raised certain objections and after some discussion the jury were recalled for further instructions as follows:\nTHE COURT: Gentlemen, I thought that perhaps you might require a little more assistance than I gave you on this word \u201cdangerous\u201d to be found in Section 221, subsection 4 of the Code.\nAs you recall, the section speaks of driving in a manner that is dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances including the nature and condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at that time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such place. Now, since the word is found in the Criminal Code and this is a criminal prosecution it\u2019s to be presumed that what we are talking about is criminal conduct, something that is more than mere civil negligence; that is, mere inattention from which civil liability might flow. You will in this case, determine from the evidence the manner in which the accused was driving. You will determine from the evidence the circumstances which existed at the time he was driving in this fashion. And after considering the manner in which he was driving determine whether or not that way he was driving is in your opinion dangerous to the public. Evidence which shows mere failure to exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances and perhaps resulting in civil liability is not sufficient to support a conviction for dangerous driving. All right.\nCounsel for the defence, rightly as I think, expressed his satisfaction with this and stated he had no further comments.\nLater the jury returned to ask a question. The record at this point reads as follows:\nCLERK OF THE COURT: Gentlemen of the Jury, I understand you wish to ask the Court a question. Mr. Foreman, will you please put your question to the Court?\nFOREMAN OF THE JURY: Your Honour, I have been requested to ask you to define for us \u201cdangerous\u201d. Could it be danger ous without intent? Would you define it?\nTHE COURT: Yes, if you find on the facts that the manner of driving was dangerous in your opinion you may disregard the matter of intent. Does that answer your question?\nFOREMAN OF THE JURY: Yes.\nOn the view of the meaning of s. 221(4) of the Code which I have expressed above, I incline to think that the instruction given by the learned trial Judge when the jury were re-called, and particularly the passages which I have italicized, was adequate in the circumstances of this case. Be that as it may, on consideration of all the record I agree with the conclusion of Laskin J.A. that this was a proper case in which to apply the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Robert J. Carter, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 2 O.R. 324.\n[2] [1960] S.C.R. 804, 33 C.R. 293, 33 W.W.R. 360, 120 C.C.C. 1, 25 D.L.R.

Appeal dismissed.\nJean Filion, Q.C., and Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9langer, for the defendant, appellant.\nHarry Aronovitch, Q.C., and Boris Berbrier, for the plaintiffs, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[2] dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Smith J. in the Superior Court, rendered May 11, 1965, which maintained respondents\u2019 action and declared cancelled and annulled appellant\u2019s right to redeem a sum of $798,269.97, transferred as security for the repayment of a loan of $80,000, made by respondents to appellant under a certain deed of loan executed before J. Bernard Billard, Notary, on March 6, 1962.\nThe facts, which are not in dispute, are fully set out in the judgments below. Shortly stated they are as follows.\n1. On May 5, 1961, by deed before Robert D\u00e9sy, Notary, the mise-en-cause D\u00e9veloppement Plateau LaSalle Lt\u00e9e acknowledged being indebted to appellant in the amount of $798,269.27, and obligated itself to pay the said amount on or before May 1, 1964. To secure the reimbursement of said sum, it hypothecated in favour of the appellant certain immoveable properties more fully described in the said deed.\n2. On March 6, 1962, by deed before J. Bernard Billard, Notary, respondents loaned to the appellant a sum of $80,000 payable one year later on March 6, 1963, with interest at the rate of 2 per cent per month and also an additional indemnity of $16,000. To secure the reimbursement of the said sum of $80,000, interest and accessories, the appellant transferred and conveyed to respondents the sum of $798,269.97 due by the mise-en-cause under the deed of May 5, 1961, above referred to. This transfer reads in part as follows:\nTo secure the reimbursement of the said sum of $80,000, the payment of the interest thereon, costs and accessories, \u2026the borrower has by these presents transferred and conveyed with warranty of fournir and faire valoir unto the said creditors Sidney and Edward Leibovitch\u2026 the sum of $798,269.97 due by D\u00e9veloppement Plateau LaSalle Limit\u00e9e\u2026 under the terms of a deed of obligation passed before Me Robert D\u00e9sy, notary.\nUnder the terms of said deed of March 6, 1962, appellant had the right to redeem\nwithin ten days following the maturity of the present loan, any principal balance remaining due on the said sum of $798,269.97, by paying to the creditors the amount of the present loan plus interest, costs and accessories as hereinabove stipulated plus the sum of $1.00. It was also stipulated that should the appellant fail to fulfill its obligations, the respondents would have, inter alia, the following rights:\nShould the said Transferor-Borrower fail to fulfill any of the obligations herein stipulated, should he fail to pay at maturity any instalments of interest or should he fail to pay the amount of the present loan at maturity\u2026 the Borrower-Transferor shall lose ipso facto without any notice or mise-en-demeure whatsoever, the right hereinabove stipulated to redeem the remainder of said sum of seven hundred and ninety-eight thousand two hundred and sixty-nine dollars and ninety-seven cents ($798,269.97) without any notice or mise-en-demeure whatsoever, and shall collect all interest accrued or to accrue, paid or to be paid on the said sum, and all instalments paid by the borrower on the loan hereinabove consented to him shall remain the property of the creditors as liquidated damages, without prejudice to any rights or recourse of the said creditors, in which case the said right to redeem shall become automatically, ipso facto, without any mise\u2011en\u2011demeure or notice whatsoever on the part of the said creditors-transferees, null and void.\n3. On May 1, 1962, by deed before J. Bernard Billard, Notary, respondents and one Henry Marcovitz acting in Trust loaned to the mise-en-cause D\u00e9veloppement Plateau LaSalle Lt\u00e9e a sum of $340,000. To secure the reimbursement of the said sum of $340,000, the mise\u2011en\u2011cause D\u00e9veloppement Plateau LaSalle Lt\u00e9e hypothecated, in favour of the respondents and the said Marcovitz, the immoveable properties already hypothecated in favour of appellant in virtue of the deed of May 5, 1961, above referred to. This deed of May 1, 1962, also contained a dation en paiement clause. Appellant intervened in the said deed and granted priority of hypothec in favour of the lenders over the hypothecs securing its claims under the deed of May 5, 1961.\n4. On June 19, 1963, the respondents and Marcovitz obtained before Tellier J. in the Superior Court a judgment by default declaring them to be owners of the immoveable properties hypothecated to secure the reimbursement of the said sum of $340,000.\n5. The appellant defaulted on the payment of the $80,000 due to the respondents on March 6, 1963, and, some fifteen months later, on June 4, 1964, respondents served on appellant a notice of default, giving appellant the option of paying the said sum of $80,000 (which had become due on March 6, 1963) with interest and accesso- ries, within a delay of seven days or of losing its right to redeem the sum due under the deed of loan to mise-en-cause dated March 5, 1962.\nPayment was not made by appellant and on June 17, 1964, respondents instituted the present action and in their conclusions asked\nWHEREFORE plaintiffs, under reserve of all of their rights and recourses, and praying acte of their tender to defendant of its N.S.F. Cheque, Exhibit P-2, pray that by judgment of this Honourable Court to intervene, it be ordered and declared that defendant\u2019s right to redeem the remainder of the sum of $798,269.97 is cancelled and annulled and is null and void, and that plaintiffs are the sole and absolute owners of the sum of $798,269.97, or such balance remaining under terms as set forth in a deed of obligation registered at Montreal under No. 1532489 and under the terms of a deed of transfer registered at Montreal under No. 158763, affecting the following immoveable properties, namely:\u2026 (here follows a description of the immoveable properties hypothecated).\nAppellant\u2019s principal defence was that respondents\u2019 claim of $80,000 had been extinguished by compensation. Alternatively, appellant pleaded that respondents\u2019 action was premature because it had not been given the statutory notice required under art. 1040a of the Civil Code.\nDealing first with appellant\u2019s plea of compensation. Although under the judgment of Tellier J., to which I have referred, the respondents became the undivided owners\u2014with Marcovitz\u2014of the immoveable property on which the claim of $798,269.97 was secured by hypothec, they were never personally liable for that amount. It follows that, as all the learned judges in the Courts below have held, the respondents\u2019 claim of $80,000 against the appellant was not extinguished by compensation.\nAppellant\u2019s second ground of defence was that respondents\u2019 action is premature because they did not give to appellant the sixty-day notice called for under art. 1040a of the Civil Code. That article was enacted in 1964 by the Statute 12-13, Eliz. II, c. 67. It reads as follows:\nUnder a contract to guarantee the performance of an obligation, a creditor cannot exercise the right to become the absolute owner of an immoveable or the right to dispose thereof until sixty days after he has given and registered a notice of the omission or breach by reason of which he wishes to do so.\nSuch notice must be registered with a designation of the immoveable and served on the person whose rights as holder of the immoveable as proprietor thereof are then registered; it takes effect against any other interested person to whom the creditor\u2019s rights are opposable. The notice may be served on the holder or his heirs in the same manner as a summons under the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe registrar must, by registered letter, inform each hypothecary creditor whose name appears in the register of addresses of the registration of the notice.\nIn my opinion the words \u201can immoveable\u201d and \u201cthe immoveable\u201d as used in the said article refer only to corporeal property and the article has no application to incorporeal property such as the debt transferred to the respondents under the deed of March 6, 1962, although the payment of that debt appears to have been secured by a third hypothec.\nFor the foregoing reasons as well as for those given by Smith and Rivard JJ. in the Courts below, with which I am in substantial agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Filion, Lafontaine, Laurier & B\u00e9langer, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiffs, respondents: Boris J.

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLa Cit\u00e9 De Saint-Laurent (Defendant) Respondent.\n1967: April 28; 1967: June 26.\nPresent: Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Taxation\u2014Business tax\u2014Motel\u2014Whether business tax prohibited by Quebec Licence Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 76, s. S3.\nThe plaintiff sued the municipality for the recovery of business tax it paid during the years 1959 to 1962 and which had been levied at the rate of 8 per cent on the rental value of a motel it occupied. It was contended that the tax paid by the motel was a tax contemplated by s. 33 of the Licence Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 76, which enacts that no municipality may levy any tax, impost or duty for keeping a hotel, restaurant or lodging-house. The trial judge dismissed the action and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal were right in holding that s. 33 dealt only with licence fees of the type contemplated under the Act in which it was contained and that it had no application to a business tax of general application based upon rental value which was in issue here.\nCorporations municipales\u2014Revenu\u2014Taxes d\u2019affaires\u2014Motel\u2014Est-ce que la taxe d\u2019affaires est prohib\u00e9e par la Loi des licences, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 76, art. 33.\nLe demandeur a poursuivi la municipalit\u00e9 en recouvrement de la taxe d\u2019affaires qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9e durant les ann\u00e9es 1959 \u00e0 1962 et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e au taux de 8 pour-cent sur la valeur locative d\u2019un motel qu\u2019il occupait. On a soutenu que la taxe pay\u00e9e par le motel \u00e9tait une taxe envisag\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 33 de la Loi des licences, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 76, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu\u2019aucune municipalit\u00e9 ne peut pr\u00e9lever aucune taxe, aucun imp\u00f4t ou droit pour tenir un h\u00f4tel, un restaurant ou une maison de logement.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Lamarre J. Appeal dismissed.\nPaul Trudeau, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nPierre Coutu, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014Appellant sued the respondent municipality to recover the sum of $11,447.68 alleged to have been paid in error as business tax for the years 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962. During that period, appellant operated a motel in the said municipality and the tax in question was paid as business tax levied at the rate of 8 per cent on the assessed rental value of the immoveable property occupied by the appellant. The tax was imposed under the authority of municipal By-law 158, enacted in 1934 under the authority of the Montreal Metropolitan Commission Act, 11 Geo. V, c. 140 as amended which, generally speaking, applied to all businesses in the municipality.\nIt is common ground that the motel operated by the appellant is a \u201chotel\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in s. 33 of the Quebec License Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 76. That section reads as follows:\nNotwithstanding any special act to the contrary, no municipality may, by by-law, resolution or otherwise, levy any tax, impost or duty for keeping a hotel, a restaurant or a lodging-house.\nThe License Act creates a provincially administered system of licensing certain specified types of business\u2014including hotels\u2014and provides for control and supervision of such businesses throughout the province. The possession of a license under the Act is a condition precedent to carrying on business.\nAs counsel for appellant conceded in his factum, the sole question in issue on this appeal is whether the business tax amounting to $11,447.68 paid by appellant, is a tax contemplated by s. 33 of the Quebec License Act.\nThe learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[2] held that the said s. 33 dealt only with license fees of the type contemplated under the Act in which it was contained, and had no application to a business tax of general application based upon rental value which is in issue here.\nI share that opinion and am in respectful agreement with the reasons of Casey J. in the Court below which were concurred in by Rinfret, Owen and Brossard JJ.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Pr\u00e9vost, Trudeau & Bisaillon, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Savard & Coutu, St-Laurent.\n[1] [1967] Que.

The construction company fell into financial difficulties and was unable to complete the building and the appellants, who were unpaid subcontractors on the project, filed mechanics\u2019 liens against the property. A form of waiver of lien had been signed by each of the appellants and contained, inter alia, the words \u201cwaive and renounce any lien or right of lien which we have or may have upon the\u2026 land and\u2026 building\u2026 and do waive and renounce any and all right to register or to hold a claim of lien against the said land, building or chattels.\u201d This waiver was given by the appellants at the request of the owners of the property in order that a first mortgage might be arranged and for the benefit of any subsequent purchaser and also for the benefit of any subsequent mortgagee.\nApplications having been filed to have declared invalid the appellants\u2019 liens, an order was made directing the determination of two questions: (1) Did the execution of a waiver of lien rights by any party preclude it from filing a valid lien? (2) A lien having in fact been filed by such party, could those lienholders not being parties to the said waiver of lien rights, take advantage of the provisions contained therein to exclude those parties who executed such waiver from sharing in funds paid into Court by the owners of the lands in question in satisfaction of all liens?\nIn the. judgment of the Chambers Judge both of these questions were answered in the negative. On appeal from this judgment to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta it was held that the appeal should be allowed and that the questions should be answered in the affirmative. An appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Greschuk J.

Ltd. By an agreement dated August 11, 1961, that company granted to Convair Logging Ltd. the exclusive right to cut and remove all merchantable timber on the timber berths and timber sale contracts subject to certain terms and conditions, and the right to subcontract in that regard. By an agreement made on December 12, 1963, between the Fleetwood company and Cattermole-Trethewey Contractors Ltd., the former sold and transferred to the latter \u201cfree and clear from all liens, charges and encumbrances whatsoever\u201d the two timber licences and \u201call of the right title and interest of the vendor in and to and all rights to cut timber under\u201d the four timber sale contracts. Assignments of the timber licences and the timber sale contracts to Cattermole-Trethewey were consented to by the Minister of Lands, Forests and Water Resources as was required by the terms thereof. By this process Cattermole-Trethewey became the legal owner of the timber licences and timber sale contracts.\nOn December 19, 1962, Convair had entered into an agreement with A. & D. Logging Co. Ltd. whereby A. & D. was \u201cto log the said TIMBER LICENCES for and on behalf of Convair\u201d. A. & D. obtained a judgment against Cattermole-Trethewey declaring that the former was entitled as against the latter to cut and remove the timber situated on the timber berths and timber sale contracts and for damages for being deprived of its cutting rights. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that the agreement between Convair and A. & D. did not confer on A. & D. a profit \u00e0 prendre. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment declaring the appellant to be entitled as against the respondent Cattermole-Trethewey Ltd. to cut and remove timber situated on certain lands and for damages for being deprived of its cutting rights. Appeal dismissed.\nD.M. Gordon, Q.C., and H.R.A. McMillan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nS. Martin Toy, for the defendant, respondent, The Cattermole-Trethewey Contractors Ltd.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, the following judgment was delivered:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Orally for the Court):\u2014Mr. Toy, it will not be necessary for us to call upon you. We are all in agreement with the view which Mr. Justice Tysoe expressed as follows:\nIt is my opinion that the agreement is plainly a contract of employment of the respondent as contractor to log and cut the timber for Convair. The respondent\u2019s remuneration is to be based on the sale price received by Convair on the sale of the logs produced by the respondent. The language of the agreement is quite inappropriate to the creation of an interest in the land or timber. It does not create such an interest but is a mere personal contract between the parties named therein for services by the respondent. It does not purport to give possession\u2014exclusive or otherwise\u2014of the land to the respondent. At most it purports, by necessary implication, to confer a right to go upon the land for the purpose of performing the contractual obligation to cut and log the timber thereon.\nIt follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Copeman, Henderson, Davies & McMillan, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, The Cattermole-Trethewey Contractors Ltd.: Boyd, King & Toy, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent, Convair Logging Ltd.: John C.

The proposal and the lease itself were executed at the same time and formed one contract. The defendant encountered difficulties in securing tenants and as a result of financial stringency, work on the centre ceased after completion of the building leased to the plaintiff and certain other buildings. Some two years later, the plaintiff was advised by the defendant that it was proceeding with further development of the centre and that this additional development would include another department store. The plaintiff immediately objected to the proposed lease for a \u201cWoolco Store\u201d and upon the defendant\u2019s refusing to desist, an action was brought for a permanent injunction restraining Grant Park Plaza Ltd., its two subsidiary companies and its agent, from entering into an agreement with W Co. for the construction and operation of an additional department store in the Grant Park Centre. This action was dismissed at trial. The plaintiff also claimed for damages and the defendants counterclaimed for damages. Both of these claims were dismissed.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal, the main appeal was dismissed; the appeal from the dismissal of the claim for damages by the plaintiff was discontinued and the counterclaim for damages was not pursued. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court rejected the appellant\u2019s contention that by the agreement between the parties the leasing of any space in a building within the proposed shopping centre to any department store or discount store was prohibited. The appellant had relied on para. 5 of the proposal which read \u201cWe understand that Grant Park Plaza will be constructed at your cost and under your supervision approximately as shown on the layout in the plans submitted by Waisman & Ross dated November 22, 1961.\u201d However, as held by the trial judge, there was no covenant by Grant Park Western Ltd. (the assignee of the lease) to build the shopping centre other than that building which was constructed for and leased to the appellant.\nThe section of the lease relating to competitive use had no application to the present situation: (1) It applied only outside the shopping centre and had no application to two sites within the same shopping centre. (2) The proposed construction of a building for the \u201cWoolco Store\u201d and the lease thereof was not one of the things prohibited by the section if the respondents were bound by it.\nThe submission that the proposal which the appellant made to the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd. and which was accepted by the latter contemplated a building scheme and implied a negative covenant of the respondent not to depart from that scheme failed. This was not a building scheme as dealt with in the many cases upon that subject. In such cases it was contemplated that like covenants should be taken from each of the grantees receiving their grants from the common grantor, and that was not at all the situation contemplated in the present case. The argument that to permit the respondent to lease any part of the shopping centre to a discount department store the activities of which would be competitive with the appellant\u2019s business would be in derogation of its grant was not accepted.\nThe further submission that the respondents were estopped by the conduct of Grant Park Plaza Ltd. in the premises from asserting as against the appellant the right to lease any part of the shopping centre to a discount department store also failed. That there was no covenant by the said respondent to build the shopping centre other than the one building to be leased to the appellant was in itself sufficient to dispose of the argument based upon estoppel. Moreover, it would seem that an estoppel can only be based upon representations made as to facts in existence. The representations alleged here were all representations of intentions to act in a certain way in the future.\n[Browne v. Fowler, [1911] 1 Ch. 219; Aldin v.

Locke, Q.C., and M.J. Mercury, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nClive K. Tallin, Q.C., and A.S. Dewar, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2] which dismissed an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment delivered at trial by Smith J., as he then was.\nThe learned trial judge had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from entering into an agreement with the F.W. Woolworth Company for the construction and operation of an additional department store in the Grant Park Plaza Shopping Centre in the City of Winnipeg. The plaintiff also claimed for damages and the defendants counter-claimed for damages. Both of these damage claims were dismissed. The appeal from the dismissal of the claim for damages by the plaintiff was discontinued on the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and the counterclaim for damages was not pursued. Therefore, we are left with the main appeal by Clark\u2019s-Gamble of Canada Limited only, that is, against the judgment refusing the injunction.\nThe defendant Grant Park Plaza Limited, represented by Aronovitch and Leipsic Limited, was engaged in the development and construction of a shopping centre in the City of Winnipeg. It entered into negotiations with Clark\u2019s-Gamble of Canada Limited and its founders and main shareholders Marshall Wells of Canada and MacLeod\u2019s Limited. Clark\u2019s-Gamble was represented by Mr. P.C. Fikkan and Mr. Irving Strum. Mr. Fikkan was the merchandising expert for the appellant and Mr. Strum was the real estate expert for the appellant who had negotiated its leases.\nAs pointed out by the learned trial judge, the lease in this case, which is the subject of the present action, was the result of thorough and prolonged negotiations between the officials of the parties and their solicitors. The negotiations culminated in the delivery by the appellant to the respondents Grant Park Plaza Limited of a document, ex, 25, which bears the date March 27, 1962 and which has been designated throughout the proceedings as \u201cThe Proposal\u201d. That was a proposal for the lease which was accepted by the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited. The lease itself, two copies of which had been filed, one as ex. 1 and one as ex. 55, bears the same date, March 27, 1962. The learned trial judge found, upon the evidence, that exs. 1 and 25 were executed at the same time and that ex. 25 was intended to be part of the contract holding that the two exhibits must be read together as forming one contract. That finding was accepted in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and I propose to adopt the finding in these reasons. It might be added that the same is in exact accordance with para. 7 of the Proposal, ex. 25, which reads:\n7. The Company will enter into a lease with Grant Park Plaza Limited (hereinafter called the \u201cLessor\u201d) in the form to be attached and executed by the Lessor and the Company and the said lease together with this letter when executed by us and accepted by you and the Lessor will constitute but one agreement between the parties.\nIt should be noted that the lease is on the printed form supplied by the solicitors for Grant Park Plaza Limited and, apart from schedules, it is thirteen pages in length. Many of those pages have extensions pasted to them and every page but one bears alterations, strike-outs and additions. It is quite apparent and in accordance with the evidence that the lease resulted from intense negotiations between not only the representatives of the parties but their solicitors. The counsel for the appellant, when the lease was produced at trial, upon the Court putting to him the query, \u201cDid you draft the lease?\u201d, replied, \u201cOur firm drafted it\u201d. Despite the fact the lease is on a form from Aronovitch & Leipsic Limited, under these circumstances I am of the opinion that there is no basis for the argument advanced by counsel for the appellant in this Court based upon the maxim contra proferentem. The mere fact that the document was originally first typed on a form provided by the solicitor for one of the parties in the light of the circumstances which occurred thereafter and up to its execution is not sufficient to bring the transaction within the class of cases where a contract is presented by one person for execution by another.\nGrant Park Plaza Limited encountered difficulties in obtaining leases for the various stores which were to line each side of an enclosed mall under the original concept for the shopping centre and although certain work was carried out in the construction of the shopping centre other than the building intended for occupancy by the appellant, due to financial stringency the respondent after construction of the building leased to the appellant and certain other buildings, particularly a food store and a service station, ceased work, levelled the site of the enclosed mall and its adjoining stores, and cut off at ground level the pilings which had been driven for such construction. Matters stood in this fashion until the year 1964. On April 22, 1964, Mr. Aronovitch, as President of Aronovitch & Leipsic Ltd., which is described as managing agent for the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited, wrote to the plaintiff as follows:\nWe are pleased to advise that we are now completing negotiations for further development of Grant Park Plaza Shopping Centre. This additional development will include a second food store; 53,000 square feet of closed mall, made up of approximately thirty allied stores; and a department store having an area of approximately 150,000 square feet.\nWe are quite confident that the increased number of retail stores, with their added variety of merchandise, will generate additional sales. The increased size of the centre should draw from a greater trading area. It is anticipated that these new additions will be completed before August, 1965.\nThe appellant immediately objected to the proposed lease to the F.W. Woolworth Company for a \u201cWoolco Store\u201d and upon the respondent\u2019s refusing to desist, commenced the present action. Almost at the same time, the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited transferred to its fellow respondent Grant Park Eastern Limited part of the land in the proposed shopping centre on which it proposed that the department store should be constructed for lease to the F.W. Woolworth Company.\nIn 1962, the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited had already transferred to Grant Park Western Limited a portion of the land which included that which was the subject of the lease to the appellant, and on November 21, 1962, by a document produced at trial as ex. 56, the respondent Grant Park Western Limited and the appellant had agreed as to the term of the lease of the premises in question, i.e., 25 years, and as to the amount of rental, and the appellant had acknowledged that it had received notice of the assignment of the lease to the respondent Grant Park Western Limited, and accepted the latter as its lessor.\nThe appellant contends that by the agreement between the parties the leasing of any space in a building within the proposed shopping centre to any department store or discount store is prohibited. The appellant particularly relies on para. 5 of the Proposal, ex. 25, which reads as follows:\n5. We understand that Grant Park Plaza will be constructed at your cost and under your supervision approximately as shown on the layout in the plans submitted by Waisman & Ross dated November 22, 1961.\nand submits that under that paragraph the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited was compelled to construct a shopping centre approximately in accordance with the plans referred to which shopping centre envisaged the store which was constructed for the appellant and occupied by it under the lease, adjoined on the west by a building to be occupied as a food store, on the east by an enclosed mall into which were to face a large number of smaller stores referred to throughout the evidence as \u201callied stores\u201d, and further to the east of them again another food store. I find it most significant that the lease bears as section 2.06 a typed section which has been pasted over the original printed section. That printed section as it appeared in the unaltered original document read as follows:\nWith all due diligence to commence and complete the construction of the shopping centre and the leased premises in accordance with the schedule.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nOn the other hand, the opening words of s. 2.06 as they appear on the lease as executed and with the original clause replaced by another pasted over it are \u201cwith all due diligence to commence and complete the construction of the leased premises in accordance with the schedule\u201d. I am at a loss to understand how in the light of these circumstances, that is, the careful amendment of a very broad clause requiring completion of the whole shopping centre to an exact clause requiring completion of the leased premises, there can be any argument that the respondent Grant Park Western Limited was under any duty to complete the buildings of the shopping centre other than that the subject of the lease. I am in complete agreement with the learned trial judge when he notes that para. 5 of the Proposal by its very words was only an understanding of what was intended, and what is more, by the use of such words as \u201capproximately\u201d and \u201clayout\u201d the outline of what was intended was, to put it conservatively, very tentative. It should, moreover, be noted that the plan referred to in the said para. 5 of the Proposal which was dated November 22, 1961, and produced at trial as ex. 26, places the building to be occupied by the appellant and the surrounding buildings a considerable distance further to the east than the appellant\u2019s building was actually constructed, and that this alteration is again reflected in the plan attached to the lease as schedule 2. This plan was dated April 16, 1962, some 19 days after the lease was actually executed but it is signed by the appellant and the respondent Grant Park Plaza Limited. Again, it is, in my view, most significant as it shows on the east side of the proposed shopping centre a large area upon which the words \u201cfuture expansion\u201d appear and the area of the enclosed mall with its allied stores is designated as \u201cproposed Stage 2\u201d.\nFor all of these reasons, it would seem that the learned trial judge, with respect, was justified in his holding that there was no covenant by the respondent, Grant Park Western Ltd., to build the shopping centre other than that building which was constructed for and leased to the appellant.\nIn the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, Dickson J., ad hoc, said:\nSmith J. considered paragraph 5 of the Proposal to be nothing more than an expression of the parties\u2019 intention, and not a binding obligation of Grant Park Plaza Limited. It is a general rule of construction that terms of a written instrument which import that the parties have agreed upon certain things being done have the same effect as express promises. For this reason I think that Grant Park Plaza Limited did become obligated to construct the shopping centre approximately as shown on the layout in the plans attached to the lease. But I hasten to: add this: Paragraph 5 must not be considered in isolation, and when read in the context of the lease and of the circumstances obtaining at the time the lease was entered into it is apparent that great latitude was reserved to Grant Park Plaza Limited in the development of the shopping centre.\nI am of the opinion that the learned justice in appeal failed to appreciate that the learned trial judge had found that the parties had not \u201cagreed upon certain things\u201d, i.e., the completion of the shopping centre in accordance with the plan (ex. 26), and therefore the recital of an understanding was not a recital of matters upon which the parties had agreed. Holding this view, I am not required, therefore, to consider whether the section in the lease relieving the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd. from construction in case it met financial difficulties resulted in a permanent or only temporary release.\nI also note in the lease other sections which have been referred to both by the learned trial judge and in the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, and which further emphasize the latitude granted to the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd., particularly s. 8.04:\nNOTWITHSTANDING anything hereinbefore contained, the Lessor may cause other buildings to be constructed within the boundaries of the lands or to retain on the lands any buildings presently located thereon,\nPROVIDED that the Lessor shall provide on the lands a parking area not less in extent than three (3) times the aggregate of the following areas:\nSection 8.06 reserves to the landlord the right to relocate the auto parking areas and other common areas. The covered mall, which according to the last proposed plans will run from a food store adjoining the appellant\u2019s building to the east easterly to the proposed Woolco Store and will be considerably shorter than originally planned, is certainly one of the \u201ccommon areas\u201d.\nThe appellant relies particularly on para. 1.11. Again as to this section we have an example of the alteration of the original lease. That term originally read:\nSection 1.11\u2014Competitive Use\nAND THAT during the term hereof the Lessee shall not directly or indirectly, whether as an owner, stockholder, principal, agent, employee or independent contractor or otherwise howsoever engage or participate in or be a stockholder, or holder of any other security of any nature whatsoever of or a lender to or an owner of any debt or portion of a debt of or furnish any financial aid or other support or assistance of any nature whatsoever to any business enterprise or undertaking which in any manner or degree is competitive with its use of the leased premises hereinbefore stated if such business enterprise or undertaking is situated in whole or in part conducted from premises situated within a distance of five thousand (5,000\u2019) feet from any part of the Shopping Centre unless in any instance the Lessor shall have given its prior written consent which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the Lessor.\nThat section was amended partly in type and partly in handwriting. The typed amendments were these: the insertion of the word \u201cfirstly\u201d after the words \u201cShopping Centre unless\u201d and before the words \u201cin any instance\u201d in the third line from the end of the original printed section, and by the addition at the end of the printed section of the words \u201cand secondly, in any instance where the business enterprise or undertaking occupies store premises self-contained, not exceeding in gross area 5,000 square feet\u201d. The hand printed amendment was by the insertion after the words \u201chereof the Lessee\u201d of the words \u201cor Lessor\u201d in s. 1 of the printed form, so that the section after its amendment read as follows:\nAND THAT during the term hereof the Lessee or Lessor shall not directly or indirectly, whether as an owner, stockholder, principal, agent, employee or independent contractor or otherwise howsoever engage or participate in or be a stockholder or holder of any other security of any nature whatsoever of or a lender to or an owner of any debt or portion of a debt of or furnish any financial aid or other support or assistance of any nature whatsoever to any business enterprise or undertaking which in any manner or degree is competitive with its use of the leased premises hereinbefore stated if such business enterprise or undertaking is situated in whole or in part conducted from premises situated within a distance of five thousand (5,000\u2019) feet from any part of the shopping centre unless firstly; in any instance the Lessor shall have given its prior written consent which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the Lessor, and, secondly, in any instance where the business enterprise or undertaking occupies store premises, self-contained, not exceeding in gross area, 5,000 square feet.\n(I have italicized the amendments.)\nI am in agreement with the learned trial judge and with the majority judgment in the Court of Appeal that the clause prior to its alteration was an ordinary covenant by the lessee and by no one else which prohibited the lessee going outside the shopping centre to establish or assist in any way another enterprise which would compete with its enterprise inside the shopping centre and therefore reduce the revenue accruing to the lessor from the percentage lease. Much debate both below and in this Court occurred as to the proper interpretation of the section as so amended. I am of the opinion that I need not attempt to resolve the problems of whether the amendments did work out a mutual covenant and if so the extent thereof, as I am of the opinion that the question may be solved very simply.\nIn my view, the section has no application to the present situation for two reasons: Firstly, it applies only outside the shopping centre. The words \u201c\u2026 if such business enterprise or undertaking is situated in whole or in part conducted from premises situated within a distance of 5,000 feet from any part of the shopping centre\u2026\u201d in their natural meaning could only apply outside the shopping centre and have no application to two sites within the same shopping centre, and I know of no doctrine of law which would require, in the interpretation of the section, the insertion of a revised covenant to apply both within and without the limits of the shopping centre: See Toronto Railway Company v. City of Toronto[3], per Sedgewick J. at p. 434:\nIn construing an instrument in writing, the court is to consider what the facts were in respect to which the instrument was framed, and the object as appearing from the instrument, and taking all these together it is to see what is the intention appearing from the language when used with reference to such facts and with such an object, and the function of the court is limited to construing the words employed; it is not justified in forcing into them a meaning which they cannot reasonably admit of. Its duty is to interpret, not to enact. It may be that those who are acting in the matter, or who either framed or assented to the wording of the instrument, were under the impression that its scope was wider and that it afforded protection greater than the court holds to be the case. But such considerations cannot properly influence the judgment of those who have judicially to interpret an instrument. The question is not what may be supposed to have been intended, but what has been said. More complete effect might in some cases be given to the intentions of the parties if violence were done to the language in which the instrument has taken shape; but such a course would on the whole be quite as likely to defeat as to further the object which was in view.\nSecondly, I am of the opinion that the proposed construction of a building for the Woolco Store and the lease thereof to the F.W. Woolworth Company is not one of the things prohibited by the section if the respondents are bound by it. It prohibits the person, to use the most indefinite word, as an \u201cowner, stockholder, principal, agent, employee or independent contractor or otherwise howsoever engage or participate in or be a stockholder or holder of any other security of any nature whatsoever of or a lender to or an owner of any debt or portion of a debt or to furnish any financial aid or other support or assistance of any nature whatsoever\u201d. None of those words are appropriate to the position of the respondent who would be acting as a landlord for the proposed Woolco Store. As Romer J. said in Ward v. Patterson[4], if a party had wished to provide against such a course of conduct then it was perfectly easy for it to have done so. When parties, advised by their solicitors, as in the present case, amend a printed clause by the insertion of additional words, then every effort must be made to give meaning to those words, but there is no requirement that the clause so amended be extended to import covenants which there is no indication in the material or in the circumstances, as revealed in the evidence, the parties ever contemplated.\nThe appellant also makes the submission that the Proposal which it made to the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd. and which was accepted by the latter contemplated a building scheme and implies a negative covenant of the respondent not to depart from that scheme. The cases, of course, of such building schemes and the enforcement of such so-called negative covenants are numerous and it is quite plain that the common grantor who had required the grantee to enter into restrictive covenants may be enjoined from the utilization of the balance of his lands in a fashion contrary to that envisaged by such restrictive covenants despite the fact that the grantor himself has not entered into like covenants with his grantee. It is, however, significant that in such cases it was contemplated that like covenants should be taken from each of the grantees receiving their grants from the common grantor, and in my view that was not at all the situation contemplated in the present case.\nOn the other hand, the evidence would indicate that it was intended that each of the grantees, for instance, all these proposed allied stores, would be required to enter into certain covenants as to their utilization of the premises which would vary in each case in accordance with the type of operation which such tenants intended to pursue. One would be under a covenant to sell shoes and other small leather goods such as purses, while another would be under a covenant to sell ladies\u2019 wear which might include ladies\u2019 shoes, another under a covenant to sell men\u2019s wear which might include some men\u2019s shoes, and others under covenants to sell only certain wares which would almost inevitably be amongst the stock carried by the appellant. This is not a building scheme as dealt with in the many cases upon that subject.\nThe appellant argues that to permit the respondent to lease any part of the shopping centre to a discount depart- ment store the activities of which would be competitive with the appellant\u2019s business would be in derogation of its grant.\nIn Browne v. Flower[5], at p. 227 it is said:\nIt is quite reasonable for a purchaser to assume that a vendor who sells land for a particular purpose will not do anything to prevent its being used for that purpose, but it would be utterly unreasonable to assume that the vendor was undertaking restrictive obligations which might prevent his using land retained by him for any lawful purpose whatsoever merely because his so doing might affect the amenities of the property he had sold. After all, a purchaser can always bargain for those rights which he deems indispensable to his comfort.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nAnd in Aldin v. Latimer Clark, Muirhead & Co.[6], Stirling J. said at p. 444:\nThe result of these judgments appears to me to be that where a landlord demises part of his property for carrying on a particular business he is bound to abstain from doing anything on the remaining portion which would render the demised premises unfit for carrying on such business in the way in which it is ordinarily carried on\u2026\nIn the present case, the landlord, whether it be considered to be Grant Park Plaza Ltd. or either of its subsidiary companies, does not propose to utilize any part of the balance of its land in a fashion which would result in any part of the lands leased to the appellant being rendered unfit for doing business. It proposes to erect a building more than twice the size of that leased to the appellant and lease the said building to the F.W. Woolworth Company for the carrying on of a Woolco store. It is true that one could only expect the operation of the Woolco Store to be stern competition for the appellant. But this is far from conduct which would render the premises leased to the appellant unfit for it to carry on its business. To adopt the words from Browne v. Flower, supra, \u201cafter all, a purchaser can always bargain for those rights which he deems indispensable to his comfort\u201d. Certainly the responsible officers of the appellant were well aware of the rights and interests of their employer. They had had long experience in both merchandising and leasing and would have found it a matter of no particular complication whatsoever to have drafted and insisted on a clear and exact covenant against leasing to a competing enterprise.\nThe appellant further submits that the respondents are estopped by the conduct of the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd. in the premises from asserting as against the appellant the right to lease any part of the shopping centre to a discount department store. An amendment of the statement of claim to present this argument was permitted by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The said order permitted the amendment of the statement of claim by the addition of para. 9a which read as follows:\n9(a). The Plaintiff repeats the allegations in paragraphs 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof and says that the Plaintiff altered its position, relying upon such representations made orally by the President of the Defendant Grant Park on its behalf and in writing by the said plans prepared by the said Defendant and exhibited to the Plaintiff on its behalf, and entered into the lease referred to in paragraph 11 hereof and the Plaintiff says that the said Defendants are estopped by their conduct in the premises from asserting as against the Plaintiff the right to lease any part of the said shopping centre to a discount or other department store, the activities of which are competitive with the Plaintiff in the said location.\nIt would seem that the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge affirmed by the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba have held that the appellant failed to prove the allegations made in paras. 5, 7, 8 and 9 which it repeated as the basis of its claim for estoppel. I have already indicated that there was no covenant by the respondent Grant Park Plaza Ltd. to build the shopping centre other than the one building to be leased to the appellant. This in itself would be sufficient to dispose of the argument based upon estoppel. Moreover, it would seem that an estoppel can only be based upon representations made as to facts in existence: Citizens\u2019 Bank of Louisiana v. First National Bank of New Orleans[7], per Lord Selborne L.C. at pp. 360-361, where the Lord Chancellor quoted Lord Cranworth in Jorden v. Money[8] at pp. 214-215:\nI think that that doctrine does not apply to a case where the representation is not of a fact, but a statement of something which the party intends or does not intend to do. In the former case it is a contract, in the latter it is not. In Maddison v. Alderson[9], Lord Selborne L.C. said at p. 473:\nI have always understood it to have been decided in Jorden v. Money that the doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to representations as to some state of facts alleged to be at the time actually in existence, and not to promises de futoro, which, if binding at all, must be binding as contracts\u2026\nI do not regard Marquess of Salisbury v. Gilmore[10] as being an authority for the proposition that representations of intention as distinguished from representations of existing facts can found an estoppel. In my opinion, that case turns on the interpretation of the provisions of s. 18 of the United Kingdom Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927. MacKinnon L.J., at pp. 51-2, when dealing with estoppel finds that the estoppel alleged was not one of intention although framed in those words, but was a representation of fact.\nThe representations alleged here were all representations of intentions to act in a certain way in the future which the trial court had found to be nothing more and which the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal has found to be only a very rough guide to the probable development of the centre.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Thorvaldson, Eggertson, Saunders & Mauro, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Tallin, Kristjansson, Parker, Martin & Mercury, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 27.\n[2] (1966), 57 W.W.R. 27.\n[3] (1906), 37 S.C.R. 430.\n[4] [1929] 2 Ch. 396.\n[5] [1911] 1 Ch. 219.\n[6] [1894] 2 Ch. 437.\n[7] (1873), L.R. 6 H.L. 352.\n[8] (1854), 5 H.L.

On this view of the facts the judge decided that the conduct of the business agent was illegal, that the cessation of work by the employees constituted an illegal strike and that the injunction should be continued to the trial. All of the defendants, including the defendant unions, were enjoined from taking part in the strike action and from picketing. The injunction order was affirmed, subject to a variation, by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal and an appeal, with leave, was then brought to this Court.\nOn this appeal a motion to quash the appeal was dismissed and the question to be decided was whether on the facts as found by the judge of first instance he was right in law in ordering that the defendants be enjoined from engaging in the strike action. In the Court below, Freedman J.A., who dissented in part, would have set aside this part of the injunction order on two main grounds: (i) that the evidence was insufficient to show that in refusing to work the defendants were acting in concert, (ii) that the order, which in essence told the employees that they must not strike\u2014that is to say, that they must continue to work on the project, was contrary to a well-founded policy of the courts not to direct what was in effect specific performance of a contract for personal service.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the first of the above grounds of dissent, it was held, for reasons referred to infra, that this Court should not depart from the view of the facts taken concurrently in both Courts below.\nAs to the second ground, it was true that the courts have repeatedly refused to issue an injunction if it will result in the enforcement in specie of a contract not otherwise specifically enforceable and that a contract for personal services such as an agreement for hiring and service constituting the common relation of master and servant will not be specifically enforced. But there was no principle of law that when a group of employees engage in concert in an illegal strike, forbidden alike by statute and by the terms of the collective agreement by which their employment is governed, the courts must not enjoin them from continuing the strike leaving the employer to resort to forms of redress other than an application for an injunction.\nThere was a real difference between saying to one individual that he must go on working for another individual and saying to a group bound by a collective agreement that they must not take concerted action to break this contract and to disobey the statute law of the province. The strike engaged in here was in direct violation of the terms of collective agreements binding on the striking employees and in breach of express provisions of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 132. Undoubtedly, an effect of the injunction was to require the striking employees to return to work, but that constituted no error in law; to hold otherwise would be to render illusory the protection afforded to the parties by a collective agreement and by the statute.\n[Winnipeg Builders\u2019 Exchange et al. v. Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons International Association et al. (1964), 50 W.W.R. 72, approved; Lumley v. Wagner (1852), 1 De G.M. & G. 604, referred to.] Appeals\u2014Appeal to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Motion to quash dismissed\u2014Injunction granted by lower Court now spent\u2014Whether judgment sought to be appealed within words \u201cany final or other judgment\u201d in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259.\nAt the opening of the argument of this appeal counsel for the respondents moved to quash the appeal on the grounds, (i) that the injunction was spent and the question whether or not it should have been granted had become academic and (ii) that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the judgment sought to be appealed did not come within the words \u201cany final or other judgment\u201d in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld: The motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the first ground, it was not questioned, the building having long since been completed, that the injunction was spent and without further effect. In such circumstances the well-settled practice of the Court was to refuse to entertain an appeal. However, leave to appeal had been granted because it was urged that a question of law of great and nation\u2011wide importance was involved as to which there was a difference of opinion in the Courts below and, from the nature of things, it was unlikely that unless leave were granted in this or a similar case it would ever be possible to bring that question before this Court for determination.\nIn this state of affairs, the members of the Court were of opinion that they ought not to concern themselves with the question whether the inferences of fact drawn by the judge of first instance and the majority of the Court of Appeal were warranted by the evidence. The view of the facts on which the majority in the Court of Appeal proceeded did not constitute a final finding as between the parties as to those facts; at the trial they might be found differently. The proper course for this Court was to endeavour to state and to answer the question of law which arose on the facts as found by the majority.\nAs to the second ground, the Court was of opinion that the words of s. 41(1) are wide enough to embrace any judgment of the Court therein referred to pronounced in a judicial proceeding and that the respondents\u2019 argument that the Court can grant leave to appeal only in respect of a final judgment or an \u201cother judgment akin to a final judgment\u201d should be rejected.\n[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v.

There was no cross-examination on any of the affidavits and no transcript of any viva voce evidence appears in the appeal case although the formal order of Bastin J. recites having read the viva voce evidence of Earl Larson.\nThe action was commenced on October 6, 1965.

Grouette, Gary Petrie, Alex Couvier, Gilbert Gregoire and Marcel Jubinville, who in the statement of claim were included with those designated as the \u201cLabourers\u201d, and Abe Ruben sued on his own behalf and representing all members of The Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America, Glass Workers Local Union No. 1554, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Glass Workers\u2019 Union\u201d.\nAt the time of the hearing before Bastin J. Poole Construction Limited, hereinafter called \u201cPoole\u201d was engaged as a general contractor in the construction of an eighteen-storey office building on the Royal Bank site in the City of Winnipeg. Poole was a member of the respondent Winnipeg Builders\u2019 Exchange, hereinafter called \u201cthe Exchange\u201d, and of the General Contractors\u2019 Section of the Exchange, hereinafter called \u201cthe Section\u201d. The defendant unions are all trade unions within the meaning of s. 2(1) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 132.\nCanadian Comstock Company was a subcontractor of Poole. It entered into a collective agreement on August 9, 1965, with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, hereinafter called \u201cthe Electricians\u2019 Union\u201d, whose business agent was the appellant Pullen.\nSection 5 of the agreement is as follows:\nStrikes and Lockouts:\n(a) It is agreed by the Union that there shall be no strike or slowdown either complete or partial, or other collective action which will stop or interfere with production during the life of this Agreement or while negotiations for a renewal or revision are in progress.\n(b) It is agreed by the employer that there shall be no lockout during the life of this Agreement or while negotiations for a renewal or revision are in progress.\nThe appellant Robbins was the business agent of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Carpenters\u2019 Union\u201d. This union had signed a collective agreement with the Section. Sections 1(c) and 5 of the agreement are as follows:\nBoth parties hereto agree to enforce and see that its members enforce all provisions of this Agreement and also any decision of an Arbitration Board under Section 4.\nStrikes and Lockouts\n(A) It is agreed by the Union that there shall be no strike or slowdown either complete or partial, or other action which will stop or interfere with production during the life of this Agreement or while negotiations for a renewal of this Agreement are in progress.\nThe appellant Gajdosik was the business agent of the International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Labourers\u2019 Union of America, hereinafter called \u201cthe Labourers\u2019 Union\u201d. The Labourers\u2019 Union had signed a collective agreement with the Section, on April 1, 1965. Sections 1(c) and 5 of this agreement are similar to the sections in the Carpenters\u2019 agreement above quoted.\nRuben was the business agent of the Glass Workers\u2019 Union. No collective agreement was entered into by this Union. None of its members worked on the project. The Glass Workers\u2019 Union was not the certified bargaining agent for any of the employees of Poole or its sub\u2011trades and there was no application pending for its certification. The appellant Knight was the business agent of the Plumbers\u2019 Union. There was no collective agreement between this union and any of the respondents or their sub-trades.\nOn or before September 20, 1965, Ruben found out that non-union glaziers were working on the site and he so informed Knight. These non-union workers were employed by Arthur Rempel Ltd., a subcontractor of Seal Dow Ltd., which was a subcontractor of Poole. Ruben felt that this matter should be brought to the attention of Poole.\nOn September 21, Ruben and Knight attended at Poole\u2019s office where they met one Oneschuck, its district manager. They advised Oneschuck of the situation, stating that members of trade unions normally object to working with non-union employees and that the presence of such employees could lead to difficulty on the job site.\nOn October 1, 1965, at the site, Ruben approached Arthur Rempel, the President of Arthur Rempel Ltd., and insisted that he advise his company\u2019s employees to contact Ruben at the Labour Temple at a fixed date for the purpose of joining the Glass Workers\u2019 Union. Ruben further insisted that Arthur Rempel Ltd., sign a collective agreement with his union. Rempel reported that his company would not force its employees to join the union. Ruben then informed him that if his company did not co-operate it could expect trouble.\nIn the early morning of October 5, 1965, Ruben set up a picket line at the entrance of the Royal Bank site. He was carrying a placard with the following wording:\n\u201cThere are non-union glaziers on this project.\u201d\nOne person crossed the picket line, otherwise there was a complete stoppage of work. Later Knight and Pullen were present on the site and when Pullen was reminded that the electricians were bound by a collective agreement, and was asked whether they would abide by it, he failed to give a definite answer.\nAt approximately 11.30 a.m. the picket line was withdrawn whereupon the electricians went to work.\nAt approximately 7.30 a.m. on the next day, October 6, Ruben, along with one or two others, established a picket line and all employees refused to report for work or to cross the picket line, with the result that construction was brought to a standstill. An ex parte injunction was granted by Bastin J. late the same afternoon. Notwithstanding service of a copy of this injunction upon Ruben, he again picketed the site on the next morning but by 8.30 a.m. on. October 7, 1965, the employees resumed work gradually.\nAt the time when Ruben commenced picketing at the site there was no dispute between any of the plaintiffs and the defendant unions or the individual defendants.\nIn his reasons for judgment Bastin J. after setting out the contents of a number of the affidavits filed in support of the application before him and of all the affidavits filed by the defendants reached the following conclusion as to the facts, (i) that Ruben and members of the Glass Workers\u2019 Union had brought the building project to a complete halt for the purpose of compelling Arthur Rempel Ltd. to coerce its employees into joining the Glass Workers\u2019 Union, (ii) that the employees who are the individual defendants had acted in concert in ceasing to work until the picketing ceased and had done so for the purpose of collaborating with the members of the Glass Workers\u2019 Union in their attempt to coerce the glaziers employed by Arthur Rempel Ltd. to join that union, and (iii) that this conduct on the part of the individual defendants constituted a strike as being a cessation of work in concert for the purpose of compelling their employer to agree to a condition of employment viz. that there should be no non-union workers employed on the project.\nAs to whether or not the defendant unions had authorized the conduct of the individual employees which the learned judge had found to constitute a strike he was of opinion that this issue of fact could not be determined until the trial.\nOn this view of the facts Bastin J. decided that the conduct of Ruben was illegal, that the cessation of work by the employees constituted an illegal strike and that the injunction should be continued to the trial in the following terms:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER that the defendants and each of them, their officers, servants, agents and members and any person acting under their instructions or any other person having notice of this order be and are hereby strictly enjoined and restrained until the trial or other final disposition of this action, from declaring, authorizing, counselling, aiding or engaging in or conspiring with others either direct or indirectly to bring about or continue an unlawful strike with respect to the employment of employees with the plaintiff Poole Construction Limited or its sub-contractors in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding.\n2. AND THIS COURT DOTH ORDER that the defendants and each of them, their officers, servants, agents and members and any person acting under their instructions or any other person having notice of this order be and are hereby strictly enjoined and restrained until the trial or other final disposition of this action from\n(i) watching, besetting or picketing or attempting to watch, beset or picket at or in the vicinity of The Royal Bank Building premises at the South-east corner of Fort Street and Portage Avenue, in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba;\n(ii) interfering with the servants, agents, employees or suppliers of the plaintiff Poole Construction Limited or its sub-contractors or any other persons seeking peaceful entrance to or exit from said premises by the use of forces, threats, intimidations, coercion or any other manner or means;\n(iii) ordering, aiding, abetting, counselling or encouraging in any manner whatsoever either directly or indirectly, any person to commit the acts aforesaid or any of them.\nIt will be observed that all of the defendants were enjoined. In dealing with the argument of counsel for the defendants that no case was made for enjoining the defendant unions the learned trial judge, after suggesting that the known facts might support an inference that the unions had authorized the cessation of work, continued as follows:\nSince the unions now claim to have disapproved of the work stoppage, it is no hardship for them to be included in the list of those who are enjoined since, without being named, they are forbidden by law to aid or abet those who are enjoined from committing a breach of the injunction.\nAll of the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal and in that Court there were differences of opinion. Monnin J.A., with whom Schultz J.A. agreed, held that the appeal of the Plumbers\u2019 Union should be allowed as there was no collective agreement in existence between it and any of the plaintiffs but that the appeal of Knight, its business agent, should be dismissed because of his personal participation in the matter and that as to all the other appellants the order of Bastin J. should be affirmed. Freedman J.A., dissenting in part, would have dismissed the appeal of Ruben but would have allowed the appeals of all the other appellants, including the Glass Workers\u2019 Union. There is no cross-appeal to this Court in regard to the Plumbers\u2019 Union. At the opening of the argument of the appeal in this Court counsel for the respondents moved to quash the appeal on the grounds, (i) that the injunction granted by Bastin J. is spent and the question whether or not it should have been granted has become academic and (ii) that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the judgment sought to be appealed does not come within the words \u201cany final or other judgment\u201d in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act.\nThis motion was dismissed without the Court calling upon counsel for the appellants.\nAs to the second ground we were all of opinion that the words of s. 41(1) are wide enough to embrace any judgment of the Court therein referred to pronounced in a judicial proceeding and that the respondents\u2019 argument that the Court can grant leave to appeal only in respect of a final judgment or an \u201cother judgment akin to a final judgment\u201d should be rejected.\nAs to the first ground, it is not questioned that Bastin J. correctly stated the facts existing on March 16, 1967, when in dismissing an application by the plaintiffs to dissolve the injunction he said:\nThe building, the construction of which was allegedly being impeded by defendants\u2019 actions, has long since been fully completed. There is nothing to be enjoined. By passage of time and the happening of events defendants are no longer prevented by the injunction from doing anything. The injunction is spent and without further effect.\nIn such circumstances the well-settled practice of this Court has been to refuse to entertain an appeal; it is necessary to refer only to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Jervis[3], The King ex rel. Tolfree v. Clark et al.[4] and Coca-Cola Company of Canada Ltd. v. Mathews[5]. However, these authorities and others to the same effect were stressed during the argument on the motion for leave to appeal and, as I understand it, leave was granted because it was urged that a question of law of great and nation-wide importance was involved as to which there was a difference of opinion in the Courts below and, from the nature of things, it was unlikely that unless leave were granted in this or a similar case it would ever be possible to bring that question before this Court for determination. In this state of affairs, it appears to me that we ought not to concern ourselves with the question whether the inferences of fact drawn by the learned judge of first instance and the majority of the Court of Appeal were warranted by the evidence. The view of the facts on which the majority in the Court of Appeal proceeded does not constitute a final finding as between the parties as to those facts; at the trial they may be found differently. It appears to me that our proper course is to endeavour to state and to answer the question of law which arises on the facts as found by the majority.\nThere was no difference of opinion in the Courts below as to whether Ruben was properly enjoined. He has not appealed to this Court but the Glass Workers\u2019 Union has. As that union was enjoined on the ground that in the opinion of the majority, Ruben should, for the purposes of their decision only, be assumed to have been its agent and acting for it it is necessary to consider whether the decision that he should be enjoined was right. In my opinion it was and I do not find it necessary to add anything to what has been said in the Courts below as to his conduct and the propriety of enjoining it.\nHad I been dealing with the matter at first instance, I might well have been of the same opinion as Freedman J.A. that the material filed, particularly in view of the form of the proceedings, did not warrant the drawing of. the inference that in doing the wrongful acts which he did Ruben was acting as agent of the Glass Workers\u2019 Union in the course of his agency but I do not think we should dissent from the finding of Bastin J. concurred in by the majority in the Court of Appeal that he was so acting. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal of the Glass Workers\u2019 Union.\nWe come now to the serious question of law which was ably and vigorously debated before us. The operative portions of the order of Bastin J. have already been quoted and the main question is whether on the facts as found he was right in law in ordering in para. 1 that the defendants be\nenjoined and restrained until the trial or other final disposition of this action, from declaring, authorizing, counselling, aiding or engaging in or conspiring with others either direct or indirectly to bring about or continue an unlawful strike with respect to the employment of employees with the plaintiff Poole Construction Limited or its subcontractors in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding.\nIt will be observed that this wording restrains the defendants from engaging in an unlawful strike of employees of Poole or its subcontractors. As a matter of syntax I think it clear that the concluding words of the paragraph, \u201cin combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding\u201d, qualify, inter alia, the words \u201cengaging in an unlawful strike\u201d. However this is of little importance since the existence of the element of acting in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding is necessary to constitute a strike.\nFreedman J.A. would have set aside this part of the injunction order on two main grounds. The first of these was that the evidence was insufficient to show that in refusing to work the defendants were acting in concert. As to this I have already indicated my view that we should not depart from the view of the facts taken concurrently in both Courts below.\nThe second ground on which the learned Justice of Appeal proceeded was expressed by him as follows:\nBut there is a second objection to this aspect of the injunction of even greater weight. What precisely is the effect of an injunction restraining these workmen from continuing an unlawful strike at the Royal Bank site? The order in essence tells these men that they must not strike\u2014that is to say, that they must continue to work on the Royal Bank job. Such an order is contrary to a well-founded policy of the courts not to direct what is in effect specific performance of a contract for personal service. I am far from saying that the conduct of these men may not have been wrongful or in breach of contract. If it was, other forms of redress are open to the employer and indeed are being so claimed in this action. I say only that an injunction compelling continuance on the job is not a proper remedy.\nHaving discussed the case of Winnipeg Builders\u2019 Exchange et al. v. Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons International Association et al.[6] and found it distinguishable from the case at bar, he continued:\nNor, in my view, is the covenant that the union or the men would not participate in a strike the kind of \u2018express negative covenant\u2019 the breach of which should give rise to an order of injunction as was here granted. Such a negative covenant arises, for example, where a person binds himself to serve the other party to the contract exclusively during its term. If in breach of this covenant he seeks to work for someone else, say a competitor of his employer, he can be restrained. But the effect of the injunction in such a case may be described thus: \u2018You have agreed not to work for anyone other than your employer, A, during the period of the contract. So you must not work for B.\u2019 The important thing to note is that the injunction does not say: \u2018You must continue to work for A\u2019, for that would in effect be ordering specific performance of a contract for personal service. Cases like Lumley v. Wagner (1852), 1 De G.M.&G. 604; 42 E.R. 687, and Warner Bros. Pictures Inc. v. Nelson, [1936] 3 All E.R. 160; 106 L.J.K.B. 97, illustrate the nature and scope of an injunction which is granted to restrain the breach of an express negative covenant of that character. These cases show that the injunction is limited in the manner I have indicated.\nIt would be a strange thing if it were otherwise. An injunction to restrain improper picketing is one thing. An injunction in effect to compel workmen to continue to work for a particular employer, on pain of going to jail for its breach, is quite another. Such an injunction is so far reaching in its consequences that occasions for resort to it are likely to be rare indeed.\nIn these passages the learned Justice of Appeal appears to me to enunciate as a principle of law that when a group of employees engage in concert in an illegal strike, forbidden alike by statute and by the terms of the collective agreement by which their employment is governed, the courts must not enjoin them from continuing the strike; that the employer must resort to forms of redress other than an application for an injunction.\nThe question which we are called upon to decide is whether the principle so enunciated is a correct statement of the law. In my respectful opinion it is not.\nThere is no doubt that it has been repeatedly held in cases of high authority that the courts will not issue an injunction if it will result in the enforcement in specie of a contract not otherwise specifically enforceable and that a contract for personal services such as an agreement for hiring and service constituting the common relation of master and servant will not be specifically enforced. The cases that so decide are collected and discussed in Cheshire and Fifoot on Contract, 6th ed., 1964, at pp. 533 to 535.\nIn rejecting the appellants\u2019 argument based on the cases last mentioned and referring particularly to that of Lumley v. Wagner[7], Monnin J.A. observed that \u201cthe complexity of labour\u2011management relations in a highly industrialized civilization was presumably not even thought of\u201d by the Lord Chancellor when that case was decided. In Winnipeg Builders\u2019 Exchange et al. v. Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons International Association et al., supra, the granting of an interim injunction which, inter alia, restrained the defendants from engaging in an unlawful strike was upheld in a unanimous judgment of the Court of appeal for Manitoba after a full consideration of the submission that the Court ought not to affirm an order which had the effect of compelling employees to return to work. The proposition of law which appears to me to be stated by Freedman J.A. would have been a bar to the continuation of the injunction and must therefore have been rejected by the Court of Appeal. In my opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case correctly states the law.\nOne of the main purposes of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 132, is to achieve and maintain harmonious relations between employers and employees and to avoid the loss caused to the parties directly involved and to the public at large by work stoppages caused either by strikes or lockouts. Procedure is provided for arriving at collective agreements. A collective agreement duly entered into is made binding upon the employer and upon every employee in the unit for which the bargaining agent has been certified, s. 18(1). During the term of a collective agreement the employer is forbidden to declare or cause a lockout, s.22(1)(a), and employees are forbidden to go on strike, s.22(1)(b). Attention has already been called to the fact that under the terms of the collective agreements existing in the case at bar it was expressly provided that there should be no strike during the life of the agreements.\nIn my view the purposes of the Labour Relations Act would be in large measure defeated if the Court were to say that it is powerless to restrain the continuation of a strike engaged in in direct violation of the terms of a collective agreement binding on the striking employees and in breach of the express provisions of the Act. The ratio of such decisions as Lumley v. Wagner, supra, does not, in my opinion, require us so to hold. There is a real difference between saying to one individual that he must go on working for another individual and saying to a group bound by a collective agreement that they must not take concerted action to break this contract and to disobey the statute law of the province. Undoubtedly, as Freedman J.A. points out, an effect of the order which has been upheld by the Court of Appeal in the case at bar was to require the striking employees to return to work. In my opinion that constituted no error in law; to hold otherwise would be to render illusory the protection afforded to the parties by a collective agreement and by the statute. It is true that an employer whose operations are brought to a standstill by an illegal strike or a union whose employees are rendered idle by an illegal lockout may bring an action for damages or seek to invoke the penal provisions of the Labour Relations Act but the inevitable delay in reaching a final adjudication in such procedures would have the result that any really effective remedy was denied to the injured party.\nAs I have already expressed my opinion that, for the purposes of this appeal, we should accept the view of the facts on which the Courts below have proceeded it follows that I would dismiss the appeal.\nBefore parting with the matter, I wish to stress, perhaps unnecessarily, that all that we are deciding is that on the facts as they were assumed by them to exist the Courts below did not err in law in continuing the injunction. The action has yet to go to trial and there on a fuller investigation the facts may be found to be different.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal; the appellants are entitled to the costs of the motion to quash which was dismissed at the hearing of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Tallin, Kristjansson, Parker, Martin & Mercury; Bowles, Pybus, Gallagher & Company; and Mitchell, Green & Minuk, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Thompson, Dilts & Company, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1966), 57 D.L.R.

The defendant\u2019s agent at the port of loading had not been advised of that stipulation. The ship\u2019s captain, when told that some pieces of equipment to be transported weighed in excess of the 30-ton limit, claimed that the ship\u2019s derrick would have no problem in handling those pieces of equipment. The ship\u2019s loading equipment was damaged. The trial judge maintained the action taken by the ship\u2019s owners. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe action of the master of the plaintiff\u2019s vessel appears to have been the effective cause of the damage for which the ship claimed. The master\u2019s lack of authority to alter the terms of the contract of carriage could not have the effect of transferring the responsibility for this action to the defendant. Even on the assumption that there was a breach of contract, it would not afford any ground for the recovery of the damage to the ship\u2019s loading equipment which was sought in this action.\nNavigation\u2014Transport\u2014Contrat\u2014Dommages\u2014Entente verbale que toute machine pesante serait d\u00e9mont\u00e9e de telle sorte qu\u2019aucun article exc\u00e9derait le poids de 30 tonnes\u2014Articles exc\u00e9dant ce poids offerts et accept\u00e9s par le capitaine du navire\u2014Dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appareil de levage du navire\u2014Autorit\u00e9 du capitaine de changer les termes du contrat\u2014Degr\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9 des dommages.\nPar un contrat de transport fait oralement, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune pi\u00e8ce de cargaison offerte pour \u00eatre transport\u00e9e sur le navire de la demanderesse exc\u00e9derait le poids de 30 tonnes\u2014toute pi\u00e8ce exc\u00e9dant ce poids devant \u00eatre r\u00e9duite \u00e0 la limite.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada in an action for damages to a vessel. Appeal allowed.\nL. Lalande, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nG.B. Knox, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Dumoulin of the Exchequer Court of Canada sitting as a judge in Admiralty by which he found the appellant responsible for damage to certain lifting tackle owned by the respondent and installed on the respondent\u2019s motor vessel Sir John Crosby when it was employed to lift the appellant\u2019s crane which was being loaded for shipment from Baie Verte, Newfoundland, to Montreal, Quebec, aboard the respondent\u2019s vessel on November 27, 1962.\nNo Bill of Lading covering the shipment was executed by the parties until after the vessel had returned to Montreal on December 2 and all arrangements between the parties for the carriage of these goods were made verbally in Montreal in telephone conversations between Samuel Stobo, the appellant\u2019s traffic manager, and Captain Jorgensson who was the respondent\u2019s marine superintendent.\nThe learned judge concluded that these telephone conversations constituted an agreement based \u201con the under- standing that each shovel, crane or piece of machinery would be reduced in weight by the servants, preposes or agents of the defendant (appellant) so that the heaviest piece to be lifted by the said derrick and boom on the forecastle deck of the Sir John Crosby would not weigh in excess of 30 tons\u201d. This is the allegation contained in paragraph 4 of the respondent\u2019s Statement of Claim, and the trial judge\u2019s conclusion is based on the following evidence of Stobo and Jorgensson. In the course of his examination-for-discovery Stobo gave the following evidence:\nQ. Would you still recollect\u2026what the terms of the contract were?\nA. Well, to the best of my knowledge\u2014bearing in mind that three (3) years have passed\u2026\nQ. Yes?\nA. Captain Jorgensson told me that the capacity of this Sir John Crosby, was thirty (30) long tons; and that at that time we both agreed over the telephone that this approximated thirty-three (33) short tons\u2014two-thousand-pound tons.\nQ. When you speak of the capacity, you mean\u2026\nA. The lifting capacity of the gear of the vessel.\nQ. Of the derrick or the gear?\nA. Correct.\n* * *\nA. I said that I would pass this along, which I did, to Mr. Gordon Lindsay.\nQ. To Mr. Gordon Lindsay in Montreal, your superior?\nA. The project engineer; and he in turn said that he would notify the job site to try to meet this weight.\nCaptain Jorgensson gave the following account of the conversation:\nQ. Did he (Stobo) give you this list by telephone or otherwise, by mail?\nA. By telephone; and I took a note of it and I quoted him a price of carrying it and the conditions we would carry it on, which were to load at Baie Verte. They had to bring the cargo alongside the ship; and we would load it, carry it to Montreal and discharge it at Montreal.\nAnd he was later asked:\nQ. Now, was there any other condition of the contract in relation to any particular piece of machinery which had to be loaded in Baie Verte and taken to Montreal?\nA. Yes, in the list given to us there was a crane; and it was agreed that this crane weighed over thirty (30) tons\u2014thirty (30) long tons; and it would have to be reduced to the capacity of the ship\u2019s gear which was thirty (30) long tons. It is to be noted that it was part of the agreement that the respondent would be responsible for loading the cargo at Baie Verte.\nWhen the Sir John Crosby reached Baie Verte, Axel Anderson, the Captain, found that there was a 50-ton crane to be shipped for the account of the Dominion Structural Steel and a 45\u2011ton crane to be shipped for the appellant\u2019s account. He said that there had been some conversations between himself and Captain Jorgensson before sailing from Montreal about these cranes being over the capacity of the ship\u2019s derrick and to the effect that they were to be stripped down so that no single piece should weigh more than 30 tons.\nMr. William Nye, the appellant\u2019s agent in Newfoundland, had not been notified by Mr. Gordon Lindsay that there was any necessity to reduce the weight of the crane before loading and he says that when he asked the ship\u2019s master, Captain Anderson, about the capacity of the ship\u2019s derrick he told him that there would be no problem about handling a piece of machinery weighing \u201ca minimum of 42 tons\u201d and that \u201che gave two indications of the capacity of the equipment on board the ship\u201d:\nOne was that he said his gear had been tested to sixty-five (65) tons by the builders of the ship; and the second reference to the capacity of it was that he pointed out that they had off-loaded the pressure casting for Advocate Mines and that they had weighed\u2014the casting had weighed ninety-seven thousand, five hundred (97,500) pounds. Those were the only two (2) references that he made to the capacity of the ship\u2019s gear.\nIt is apparent that the learned trial judge believed Nye\u2019s version of these conversations and rested his decision on the theory that the appellant\u2019s agent was bound by the terms of the undertaking made by telephone in Montreal not to offer cargo over 30 tons for hoisting with the ship\u2019s derrick. In this regard, the learned judge says:\nCaptain Anderson\u2019s bragging about the feats of strength accomplished by his vessel\u2019s derrick savours of silliness, admittedly; but would, in all likelihood, have remained of no avail on a prudent employee, duly instructed by his principals to carry out a formal undertaking not to offer for hoisting any cargo in excess of 30 tons. Had this been done, then the justifiable presumption flows that Nye would attach greater importance to the directives imparted by his superior, Lindsay, than to Anderson\u2019s idle talk. His duty was not to Anderson but to Lindsay, had the latter only told Nye what was expected of him. It is, therefore, my humble opinion that Lindsay\u2019s breach of contract was, essentially, the cause of this mishap, and the master\u2019s uncalled for statements a fortuitous consequence thereof.\nMr. Justice Dumoulin quotes at length from various text writers on the law of shipping to sustain the principle that \u201cif the owners have themselves made a contract for the employment of their ship, the master cannot annul the contract and substitute another for it\u201d. The only case which the learned judge cites in support of this proposition is Grant v. Norway[1] and in my respectful opinion, this case is illustrative of the type of situation to which the text writers were referring.\nIn Grant v. Norway, a Bill of Lading had been signed by the master for 12 bales of silk, none of which had ever been shipped; it was held that transferees of the Bill of Lading, who had given value for it on the faith of the representation contained in it, had no claim against the ship owners because the master had no authority to give a Bill of Lading for goods which had not been shipped. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Jervis C.J. said:\nIf, then, from the usage of trade and the general practice of shipmasters, it is generally known that the master derives no such authority from his position as master, the case must be considered as if the party taking the bill of lading had notice of express limitation of the authority, and in that case, undoubtedly, he could not claim to bind the owner by a bill of lading signed when the goods therein were never shipped.\nWhile this line of cases and the commentaries made thereon by the various text writers may support the proposition that the master is not clothed with authority to alter the terms of a contract of carriage made between the owners and the shippers, they do not, in my opinion, afford any basis for contending that the owner is relieved of responsibility for damage which it has suffered through the misuse of its own equipment by the master who was employed, amongst other things, to supervise the use of that equipment.\nIn the present case the evidence appears to me to be uncontradicted to the effect that Captain Anderson knew or ought to have known that the weight of the appellant\u2019s crane when it was brought alongside the respondent\u2019s vessel for loading was likely to be in excess of the capacity of the vessel\u2019s loading equipment. Instead of refusing to load the crane until it had been \u201creduced to the capacity of the ship\u2019s gear\u201d, Captain Anderson told the appellant\u2019s agent that \u201cthere would be no problem in handling it\u201d as his gear had been tested to 65 tons and he proceeded to supervise the attachment of the ship\u2019s tackle to the heavy crane and gave the order for the use of the ship\u2019s derrick to lift it although he knew that this would be likely to put too great a strain on that equipment. This action of the master of the respondent\u2019s vessel appears to me to have been the effective cause of the damage for which the respondent now claims, and as I have indicated, I do not think that the master\u2019s lack of authority to alter the terms of the contract of carriage can have the effect of transferring the responsibility for this action from the respondent to the appellant.\nIn my view, the conversations which took place by telephone in Montreal between Stobo and Jorgensson constituted nothing more than an agreement to the effect that the appellant\u2019s crane would be accepted for loading at Baie Verte and shipped to Montreal on the respondent\u2019s vessel which carried loading equipment with a maximum hoisting capacity of 30 tons. This was communicated to Mr. Lindsay, the branch supervisor, but he did not consider it necessary to pass on the information concerning the capacity of the ship\u2019s lifting gear to his agent, Nye, at Baie Verte. I think that Mr. Lindsay was entitled to assume that the respondent\u2019s vessel would not accept any single piece of machinery for loading which had not been stripped to a weight of less than 30 tons and it does not seem to me to be at all unreasonable that he should have contemplated that the question of trimming the cargo to the capacity of the ship\u2019s loading gear was one which would be settled between his agent and the ship\u2019s master at the dockside, and that the master would know the capacity of his own equipment and would act accordingly.\nI do not think that Mr. Lindsay\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of a basic condition of the contract, but assuming that Mr. Justice Dumoulin was correct in his finding in this regard, it nevertheless does not appear to me that such a breach would make the appellant liable for the damage to the ship\u2019s derrick which was occasioned by the fault of the master. It has never been seriously questioned since the case of Hadley v. Baxendale[2] that damages for breach of contract are limited to the ordinary consequences which would follow in the usual course of things from such breach or for the consequences of the breach which might reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract. Article 1074 of the Civil Code is to the same effect.\nThe ordinary consequences of the breach which was here alleged would have been the refusal of the vessel\u2019s master to put its lifting tackle on the appellant\u2019s crane until it was reduced in weight with the result that if the crane could not have been reduced it would either have been left at Baie Verte or put on board by the appellant\u2019s own means, as was in fact done. If the crane had been left at Baie Verte and no other cargo had been obtained to replace it, the measure of damages would have been the freight which the respondent could have earned by carrying the crane, but even on the assumption that there was a breach of contract, it would not afford any ground for the recovery of the damage to the respondent\u2019s crane which is sought in this action.\nIn view of all the above I would allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Lalande, Bri\u00e8re, Reeves & Paquette, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Beauregard, Brisset & Reycraft, Montreal.\n[1] (1851), 20 L.J.C.P. 93.\n[2] (1854), 9 Exch. 341, 156 E.R. 145.\n",

The contract between the plaintiff and the defendant contained a clause for the cancellation of the contract by the Crown for a number of causes and upon notice. The plaintiff commenced work in June 1960 and proceeded until December 1960, when work was suspended because of winter conditions. The work was to be resumed in the spring as soon as the ground was ready to be worked. During the fall of the year 1960, the plaintiff and his employees had been in almost constant state of disagreement with the departmental officers and employees. In the spring of the second year, the plaintiff failed to resume work after receiving a notice to do so. The contract was cancelled and the work was terminated by another contractor. The plaintiff filed a petition of right in which he claimed for work done under the contract and for damages. The Crown filed a cross-demand for the excess over and above the contract price paid to the second contractor to complete the work. The trial judge allowed the petition of right and dismissed the cross-demand. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-demand should be returned to the Exchequer Court to ascertain the damages to be allowed to the Crown.\nThe trial judge was in error in his finding that there had been no proper cancellation of the contract in accordance with the provisions thereof and that the purported cancellation had been a breach of the contract.\nIt was not necessary to express any opinion as to whether the purported assignment by the plaintiff of the benefit of the contract to a bank had deprived him of his right to bring action.\nCouronne\u2014Contrat\u2014Construction d\u2019un terrain d\u2019atterrissage pour a\u00e9roport\u2014Les travaux devant \u00eatre termin\u00e9s \u00e0 une certaine date\u2014Clause dans le contrat pr\u00e9voyant la r\u00e9siliation\u2014La r\u00e9siliation \u00e9tait-elle justifi\u00e9e.\nLe demandeur, un entrepreneur, a obtenu le contrat pour la construction d\u2019un terrain d\u2019atterrissage pour un a\u00e9roport dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le contrat entre le demandeur et la d\u00e9fenderesse contenait une clause pr\u00e9voyant la r\u00e9siliation du contrat par la Couronne pour de nombreuses causes et apr\u00e8s avis. Le demandeur a commenc\u00e9 les travaux en juin 1960 et les a continu\u00e9s jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 1960, alors que les conditions d\u2019hiver en ont forc\u00e9 la suspension. Les travaux devaient \u00eatre recommenc\u00e9s au printemps aussit\u00f4t que la terre serait en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00eatre travaill\u00e9e. Durant l\u2019automne de 1960, le demandeur et ses employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9saccord presque continuellement avec les officiers et les employ\u00e9s de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Au printemps de la seconde ann\u00e9e, le demandeur n\u2019a pas recommenc\u00e9 les travaux apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un avis de le faire. Le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 et les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9s par un autre entrepreneur. Le demandeur a produit une p\u00e9tition de droit dans laquelle il r\u00e9clamait pour les travaux faits en vertu du contrat et pour des dommages. La Couronne a produit une demande reconventionnelle pour le montant qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9 au second entrepreneur en exc\u00e9dent du montant pr\u00e9vu au contrat. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a maintenu la p\u00e9tition de droit et a rejet\u00e9 la demande reconventionnelle.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on a petition of right. Appeal allowed.\nLouis M. Bloomfield, Q.C., P.M. Ollivier, Q.C. and D. Miller, for the defendant, appellant.\nAlexander Stalker, Q.C., and Robert J. Stocks, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by No\u00ebl J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada1 on November 2, 1965. By that judgment the learned Exchequer Court Judge allowed the petition of right filed by the suppliant awarding damages of $33,094.10 and allowed the petitioner his costs including the sum of $5,000 to cover the value of engineering and accounting work done prior to the trial. The learned Exchequer Court Judge dismissed the cross-demand filed by Her Majesty the Queen with costs, providing, however, that only one counsel fee at trial should be taxed.\nThe Crown appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Exchequer Court by notice of appeal which reads as follows:\nNOTICE OF APPEAL\nTAKE NOTICE that Her Majesty the Queen intends to appeal and does hereby appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from a part of the Judgment of Mr. Justice No\u00ebl of the Exchequer Court of Canada dated the second day of November 1965;\nAND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that Her Majesty the Queen intends to limit Her appeal, and does hereby limit Her appeal to that part of the judgment of Mr. Justice No\u00ebl\n(a) finding that the assignment executed by the Respondent in favour of the Royal Bank of Canada on March 19th, 1962 was ineffective in law so as to deprive the Respondent of the whole or of a part of the relief sought by its Petition of Right and\n(b) finding that in taking the contract work out of the Respondent\u2019s hands, Appellant failed to bring Herself within the terms of clause 18 of the contract, thereby committing a breach going to the root of the contract.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing, the members of this Court expressed grave doubt as to the propriety and effectiveness of this form of notice of appeal. It will be noted that there is no reference therein to the dismissal by the learned Exchequer Court Judge of the Crown\u2019s cross-demand and counsel for the respondent in this Court took the position that that dismissal should have been the subject of a specific notice of appeal. It would appear that the notice of appeal filed was one which purports to appeal from the reasons and not from the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nAfter some consideration of the matter, this Court determined to construe the document as if it were an appeal from the whole judgment of the Exchequer Court except in so far as that judgment fixed the damages of the suppliant at $33,094.10, and that the lettered paragraphs in the said notice of appeal were in fact merely reasons for the appeal. The first of those lettered paragraphs dealing with the effect of the purported assignment by the respondent-suppliant to the Royal Bank of Canada is dealt with hereafter in these reasons.\nThe respondent-suppliant had been the successful bidder for the construction of a landing strip for an airport at Three Rivers in the Province of Quebec. The respondent\u2019s tender was for $469,983.50 and was almost exactly $100,000 lower than the second lowest tender.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge noted that the departmental officers were of the opinion that the respondent had made an error in his calculations and conferred with the respondent even going so far as to suggest that he should withdraw his tender and review all the prices and then return to submit a revised tender. The respondent, however, insisted on leaving the tender as filed and the respondent was awarded the contract. This contract was produced at trial and marked as Exhibit S-1. It is a document dated August 5, 1960, and is in very considerable detail occupying in the printed record some 17 pages of close printing.\nThe respondent, commenced work in June 1960 and proceeded until December 1960, when work was suspended because of winter conditions to be resumed in the spring as soon as the ground was ready to be worked. During late fall of the year 1960, the respondent and his employees had been in a well-nigh constant state of disagreement with the departmental officers and employees, both those in Ottawa and those on the site. It would appear that one of the main causes of the contentions between the parties was the desire of the respondent to reduce his costs by utilizing as granular material to be laid over the sub-base to the depth of 22\u2033 a mixture composed of 65 per cent of material coming from the site and 35 per cent from material obtained at a gravel pit known as the Paquette pit, some distance away from the scene.\nOn November 21, 1960, the resident engineer, Mr. Corish, informed the respondent in writing that the material from this gravel pit had been tested and that in his opinion the contractor\u2019s proposed method of blending of a part thereof with the material from the site would not satisfy the contract requirements. This decision by the resident engineer was the subject of bitter complaint by the respondent and conferences followed. At such conferences, a compromise was reached whereby the respondent would be permitted to lay a 6\u2033 layer of the granular material over the sub-grade and then this 6\u2033 layer would be tested to determine to what extent, if any, it could be blended with the material taken from the airport site.\nThe 6\u2033 layer of granular material was laid by the respondent early in December 1960. At that time the ground was frozen. The sub-base had not yet been fully compacted to the extent required by specifications and it was agreed that this sub-base would be compacted in the spring by using a 50-ton roller right over the six inches of granular material which covered it.\nDuring the time when work was suspended after winter had set in, complaints, particularly as to the attitude and conduct of the resident engineer of the appellant, the said Mr. Corish, continued to be urged by the respondent and his employee Mr. Leonard. In order to resolve the difficulties, a meeting was held on April 14, 1961, attended by the respondent and his representatives and by officials of the department. The decisions made at such conference are not relevant to this appeal except that the respondent alleges that the officers of the appellant had agreed to give to the respondent a schedule of work prior to the recommencement of the performance of his contract in the spring of 1961.\nIn the opinion of the officers of the appellant, the ground was ready to work in early May of 1961. Several attempts were made to get in touch with the respondent in order to determine when he would start work. Such attempts were not successful and answers which the said officers received when they spoke to the persons in the employment of the respondent were, to put it conservatively, evasive. Finally, on June 1, 1961, Mr. H.J. Connolly forwarded to the respondent the following notice:\nPursuant to clause 18 of the contract in writing between HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA, represented by the Minister of Transport, and E.J. PERSONS, doing business under the firm name and style of E.J. PERSONS CONSTRUCTION of Sweets-burg, in the Province of Quebec, dated August 5, 1960, bearing No. 64840 in the records of the Department of Transport, being in respect of the construction of a Runway 6,000\u2032 x 150\u2032, a Parking area 300\u2032 x 300\u2032, a connecting Taxiway and Access Road at Three Rivers Airport, Three Rivers, Province of Quebec, I hereby give you notice that I require you to put an end to your default and delay in diligently executing the works to be performed under the said contract.\nAnd I have to advise you that in the event of failure on your part to comply with this notice on or before June 12, 1961, the works will be taken out of your hands and will be completed by the Department as may seem fit, and, in this connection, your attention is called to Clause 18 under which you will have no claim for any further payment, but you will be chargeable with and shall remain liable for all loss and damage suffered by Her Majesty and to clauses 48 and 50 under which the security deposit made by you will be forfeited.\n(sgd.) H. J. Connolly,\nDirector, Construction Branch,\nDepartment of Transport.\nThe respondent replied to this notice by his solicitor\u2019s letter dated June 7 which read as follows:\nH.J. Connolly, Esq.,\nDirector of Construction Branch,\nDepartment of Transport,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nRE: THREE RIVERS AIRPORT\u2014E.J. PERSONS, CONTRACTOR: YOUR FILE NO. 2R-93\nDear Sir:\nOn behalf of our client, Mr. E.J. Persons, we wish to acknowledge your notice of June 1st 1961 concerning the commencement of work in respect of the above noted Contract, by June 12th, 1961.\nAs you are undoubtedly aware, due to weather conditions and soil conditions, it was impossible up until a few days ago, for our client to commence work and be certain that it would be done to the proper standards. We wish to advise you that our client intends to commence work on or before the 12th June 1961.\nIt is our understanding that it was agreed at our last meeting, between yourself and members of your Department, with our client and ourselves, that when Mr. Persons recommenced work in respect of the above contract, you would send a new engineer on the job and so would our client. When our client commences work he will have a new engineer on the job and we presume that your Department will also present a new engineer. If this is not so, we would appreciate hearing from you in this regard on or before the 12th June 1961.\nYours truly,\nHJS:LHP\n\u201cH.S. McD.\u201d\nThe Fidelity Insurance Company of Canada which had received a copy of Mr. Connolly\u2019s, communication of June 1, replied thereto by letter of the same date, June 7, which included a statement \u201cand we have been assured he will be on the site to resume work on Monday, June 12th\u201d, The respondent himself telegraphed to Mr. R.L. Davies, Regional Construction Engineer, of the Department of Transport at Montreal on June 8 in the following words:\nRe Three Rivers Airport please be advised that our engineer Mr. Mike Skinners is now at Airport stie (sic) will be ready to resume work monday June twelfth\nOn June 14, 1961, Mr. Connolly, Director of the Construction Branch of the appellant in Ottawa, prepared a notice in the following terms:\nReference is made to my notice of June 1, 1961, addressed to E.J. Persons Construction giving notice pursuant to clause 18 of the above mentioned contract to put an end to the default and delay in diligently executing the works to be performed under the said contract.\nIn view of the fact that the work covered by Contract No. 64840 has not been proceeded with pursuant to my notice, aforesaid, of June 1, 1961, I have to advise E.J. Persons Construction that the Department is taking the work out of the said contractor\u2019s hands and has entered into a contract with another contractor, namely, H.J. O\u2019Connell Limited, to complete the work covered by the said contract.\nHe signed this notice and took it with him leaving it in the Montreal office of the Department with instructions that it should be held to be dealt with in accordance with orders which he would communicate to the office by telephone. He proceeded from that office to the site with officials of the department. His purpose was to determine whether the respondent was complying with the notice of June 1 which I have recited above. Arriving at the site, he found a Mr. Shinners, a young man who was the representative of the respondent on the job and who was evidently the \u201cMr. Skinners\u201d referred to in the telegram from the respondent which I have recited above. Mr. Connolly testified that Mr. Shinners told him he had no instructions at all and further that there was only one machine operating pushing stumps off the runway and someone was working on an old building off to one side. A little Wobbly wheel roller was present but there was no sign of any 50-ton roller. Mr. Connolly telephoned to the Montreal office and his notice dated June 14, 1961, which I have recited above was dispatched. H.J. O\u2019Connell Limited came on the job and completed the work covered by the contract.\nThe respondent filed his petition of right in which as suppliant he claimed an amount of $492,397.59 of which $180,397.59 was for work allegedly completed prior to December 31, 1960, and $312,000 was for damages allegedly sustained as the result of the appellant cancelling the contract. The respondent later produced an incidental demand claiming additional damages in the amount of $152,800.\nThe appellant filed a cross-demand claiming from the respondent the sum of $131,495.45 made up as follows:\nNet amount paid to Cross-Defendant (Suppliant) is $167,600 less hold back of $16,700........................................................................................\n$150,840.00\nTotal amount paid or payable to H.J. O\u2019Connell for completion of the project\n440,209.31\nTotal....................................................................................\n$591,049.31\nIf Cross-Defendant had proceeded with the project to completion, total cost according to Cross-Defendant\u2019s unit price...................................\n$459,553.86\n$131,495.45\nNo\u00ebl J., in elaborate and very carefully worked out reasons held for the respondent granting judgment as I have set out above. He came to this conclusion for the following reasons, apart from the assignment to the Royal Bank of Canada with which I shall deal hereafter:\n(1) That the notice threatening cancellation of the contract given by the appellant on June 1 was not sufficiently detailed and explicit.\n(2) The respondent was justified in not complying with that notice and getting on with the work by June 12, 1961, as he was awaiting a schedule of work from the appellant and he was entitled to await such schedule of work.\n(3) That the schedule of work when it was given to the respondent\u2019s representative on the site on June 12 superseded the notice of June 1, 1961.\n(4) That the cancellation of the contract by the notice of June 14, 1961, was premature in view of the terms of the notice of June 1, 1961.\n(5) That the contract was not cancelled by the Minister as required by the provisions thereof.\nI shall deal with these reasons seriatim. Firstly, as to the sufficiency of the notice dated June 1, 1961, Article 18 of the Contract between the parties (Ex. S-1) provides, in part:\nIn case the Contractor shall make default or delay in commencing or in diligently executing, any of the works or portions thereof to be performed, or that may be ordered under this Contract, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer may give a general notice to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, and should such default or delay continue for six days after such notice shall have been given by the Engineer to the Contractor, or should the contractor make default in the completion of the works, or any portion thereof, within the time limited with respect thereto in or under this contract, or should the Contractor become insolvent, or abandon the work, or make an assignment of this contract without the consent required, or otherwise fail to observe and perform any of the provisions of this contract then, and in any such case, the Minister for and on behalf of Her Majesty, and without any further authorization, may take all the work out of the contractor\u2019s hands and may employ such means as he, on Her Majesty\u2019s behalf, may see fit to complete the works\u2026\nIt would seem apparent, therefore, that the contract requiring only a general notice, there could be no validity to the submission that the letter of June 1, 1961, was not sufficiently detailed. In addition to that ground in law, the respondent himself took no such position on receipt of the notice dated June 1 either personally or through his solicitor. On the other hand, I have quoted his telegram and his solicitor\u2019s letter, and in both documents the respondent simply undertook to comply with the notice.\nI am in agreement with the submission made by counsel for the appellant that the respondent at all times was himself the best judge of what he was and was not doing. As the learned Exchequer Court Judge found on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial he would have been prepared to hold that the appellant\u2019s engineers were entitled to assume, from the inactivity of the respondent on the site of the work in the spring of 1961, that he was not diligently prosecuting the work and that there was great doubt that he would have completed the job on time, it would appear that the respondent\u2019s default has been established.\nSecondly, as counsel for the appellant points out, the respondent was the only person who testified that there was any agreement that the respondent should be supplied with a schedule of work before he commenced the carrying out of the contract in the spring of 1961, although Mr. Davies for the appellant recalled that the matter of written instructions had been discussed.\nSection 5 of the contract between the parties provided, in part:\nThe work shall be. commenced, carried on and prosecuted to completion by the Contractor in all its several parts in such manner and at such points and places as the Engineer shall, from time to time, direct, and to his satisfaction, but always according to the provisions of this contract, and if no direction is given by the Engineer, then in a careful, prompt and workmanlike manner.\nIt would appear, therefore, that there was no right in the respondent to require a schedule of work and that failing the receipt of one he was under a duty to carry out the contract in a fashion which the learned Exchequer Court Judge found he had failed to do. The conference at which it was alleged this agreement to supply the respondent with a schedule of work was reached took place on April 14, 1961. On April 24, 1961, Mr. Connolly reported to the Assistant Deputy Minister for Air upon the Three Rivers Airport construction contract. In para. 4 thereof he recited that a meeting had been held and in para. 5 reported:\n5. We were not able to obtain from the Contractor a schedule of operations for the coming year that he would follow to complete the work by the completion date of the contract which is the end of October, 1961. At first his reluctance to provide this information was said to be due to his inability to plan until he was assured of payment of his claim for additional quantities of excavation, etc. Needless to say we could not agree to this with so much in dispute.\nOn May 18, 1961, Mr. Connolly wrote a letter to the E.J. Persons Construction Company, the last paragraph of, which reads as follows:\nOur Regional Construction Engineer will be communicating with you in the next few days requesting a schedule of your operations for this coming construction season showing the dates for completion of the various phases of the work, but it must be kept in mind that there will be no extension in time for the completion of the contract.\nTherefore, quite plainly, two weeks before the respondent received the notice of June 1, he had had notice in writing that it was not the appellant\u2019s officers\u2019 duty to produce the schedule of work which he alleges he was promised on April 24 but that it was his own duty. That letter of May 18 apparently went unanswered. With respect, therefore, I cannot agree with the learned Exchequer Court Judge in his comments that the respondent was justified in not getting on with the work by June 12 as demanded in the letter of June 1 because he was entitled to wait for a schedule of work. The so-called schedule of work in writing was delivered by Mr. Corish to Mr. Shinners on June 12. Mr. Corish, in his evidence, recounts the circumstances surrounding its delivery. When he was asked whether he prepared the documents at the request of Mr. Shinners, he replied:\nA. No, I did on my own initiative and for the record, because at the time I had been able to contact the RCE (Regional Construction Engineer), he was up here and he said he had been instructed and I was awaiting instructions other than what he told.\nHe continued:\nA. Mr. Shinners had appeared on the 8th, and as I said, I was acquainted with the boy and I told him, well, if you want any information, or note\u2014that is why my reference is as is\u2014that he did not even read the specifications. The man himself he was only a graduate engineer of that spring; he had been on the site the previous summer as a student engineer and an employee of Mr. Persons, but mainly, for the record, as far as resident engineer was concerned, there were no other body available. He was the representative of the contractor and this is dated four days after I met him. But, you must understand, I had no office help and it was typed by myself with just one or two fingers and consequently, for me to produce a letter which I wanted for the record, I would draft it and redraft it and study it, because I was afraid what is happening now would happen. I wanted a record for my own personal benefit.\nMr. Corish testified that he did not believe he was aware at that time that Mr. Connolly had given the respondent the notice of June 1 although he was aware of it subsequently. It is difficult, therefore, to understand how the supplying of this document by Corish to Shinners on June 12 could be taken to have superseded Mr. Connolly\u2019s notice of June 1. Mr. Connolly\u2019s notice was delivered by virtue of the powers set out in art. 18 which I have quoted above, in part. Such a notice was to be given by the engineer, and Mr. Corish, being merely the appellant\u2019s superintendent on the job, was certainly not the engineer. \u201cEngineer\u201d was defined exactly in art. 1 of the contract and Mr. Connolly was the officer so defined. No superintendent on the job could effectively countermand a notice delivered by such engineer acting under a specific power granted to him on the contract. Moreover, it will be seen that the contents of the document presented by Mr. Corish to Mr. Shinners, produced at trial and marked Exhibit S-8, chiefly consists of requests by Mr. Corish for information as to details which should be supplied by the respondent and in the second request is set out in para. 2(b) thereof as follows:\nask your principal to disclose to me his complete schedule of work, sources and samples of all materials he has contracted to supply to this project.\nTherefore, on considering all the circumstances and the actual terms of the document (Ex. S\u20118), I am unable to concur in the view that it would have any effect of superseding the exact terms of the notice dated June 1. Therefore, with respect, I must disagree with the learned Exchequer Court Judge.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge in his reasons for judgment said:\nClause 18 provides that if default or delay continues for six days after notice has been given, then the Minister can take all of the work out of the contractor\u2019s hands. In the present case, however, the Department\u2019s engineer having chosen to specify a date or a deadline for the commencement of the work and having granted a specific delay for compliance with the notice dated June 1, 1961 (Ex. S-9) namely that work was to be commenced on or before June 12, 1961, and not having simply required the contractor to get on with the work, in which case the six days\u2019 delay would have commenced when the notice was given, i.e., June 5, 1961, the delay here would have started running only on June 12, 1961, and the six days continuance of such default could not, therefore, have been completed until the end of June 17, 1961. Thus until June 17, 1961, as urged by counsel for the Suppliant, the Minister had no power under the contract to take the work out of the contractor\u2019s hands, and, therefore, the steps taken by the Department of Transport on or around June 14, 1961, were premature, not in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the work was illegally and improperly taken out of the Suppliant\u2019s hands.\nThis Court, on the hearing, was unanimously of the view that art. 18 of the contract and the terms of the notice dated June 1 could not support such an interpretation. By art. 18 of the contract all the engineer for the Department had to do was to give six days\u2019 notice requiring curing of the default. If he chose to allow twelve days then there cannot be any justification for adding the six days required by the contract to the twelve days granted by the engineer. It is quite plain that in the notice which I have recited earlier in these reasons the respondent was required to comply with the notice on June 12, 1961, and not six days thereafter.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge held that the notice of cancellation delivered on June 14, 1961, and signed by H.J. Connolly, Director of the Construction Branch, was not a valid cancellation of the contract under the provisions of art. 18 thereof which I have cited earlier in these reasons and which read, in part,\n\u2026the Minister for and on behalf of Her Majesty and without any further authorization may take all the work out of the contractor\u2019s hands and may employ such means as he, on Her Majesty\u2019s behalf, may see fit to complete the works\u2026\nIn view of the definition of the word \u201cMinister\u201d in art. 1 of the contract, as follows:\n\u201cMinister\u201d shall mean the person holding the position, or acting in the capacity, of the Minister of Transport, for the time being, and shall include the person holding the position, or acting in the capacity, of the Deputy Minister of Transport, for the time being.\nand the fact that at the relevant times the Honourable Mr. Balcer was the Minister and Mr. John Baldwin was the Deputy Minister, he held that a notice of cancellation signed by Mr. Connolly was without any validity.\nIt must be noted that under the provisions of art. 18, the Minister was empowered not to deliver a notice but to take all work out of the contractor\u2019s hands, and so long as the decision was made by a person within the definition of \u201cMinister\u201d in the contract, i.e., by either the Minister or the Deputy Minister, then it would be of no importance who wrote the actual formal document notifying the respondent of the decision of such Minister or Deputy Minister.\nThe evidence shows quite clearly that the Minister was fully cognizant of the problems which had arisen in the completion of this contract. Marked as Exhibit R-8 at the trial was a memorandum from the Director of the Construction Branch to the Assistant Deputy Minister (Air). The penultimate paragraph of that memorandum reads as follows:\n8. On receipt of his recommendation it is the intention to advise the Contractor of the amount of money due to him for work done to date and instruct him to proceed and complete his contract. If he refuses the settlement it will be necessary to have our Legal Branch prepare an order to the Contractor instructing him to commence work within the specified time, failing which the Bond Company will be asked to take over.\nProduced as part of the same exhibit was a memorandum from the Deputy Minister, J.R. Baldwin, to the Director of the Construction Branch, dated April 27, 1961, which reads as follows:\nThe Minister is generally satisfied with your report hereunder but would like to be kept informed when you send specific instructions in writing to the contractor.\nI have perused the evidence of the Minister who was called by the suppliant as a witness at the trial of the action and I think the inference is proper that Mr. Connolly had the Minister\u2019s authority to go to Three Rivers and to determine for himself what progress had been made and if the progress was not in accordance with that demanded then to take the action set out in the said para. 8 of the memorandum which I have quoted above.\nTherefore, I am of the opinion that when Mr. Connolly delivered the notice dated June 14 to the respondent he was only notifying the respondent of an action taken by the Minister and which the Minister was entitled to take under the provisions of art. 18 of the contract. I am also in agreement with the alternative submission of counsel for the appellant that the Minister, when he wrote to the respondent\u2019s solicitors on July 17, 1961, was certainly aware of the action which had been taken and confirmed it giving thereby any ratification required. Such ratification would be effective as of the date of the action taken, i.e., June 14, 1961.\nFor these reasons, I have come to the conclusion, with respect, that the learned Exchequer Court Judge was in error in his finding that there had been no proper cancellation of the contract in accordance with the provisions thereof, and therefore that the purported cancellation was a breach of the contract.\nAs I have said, the Crown filed a cross-demand to the suppliant\u2019s petition in which the Crown claimed the sum of $131,495.45. That cross-demand was disposed of by the learned Exchequer Court Judge in these words:\nThe suppliant was unsuccessful in his incidental demand and it will be rejected with costs; the Respondent was unsuccessful in Her cross-demand and it also will be rejected with costs. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant stated that if the appellant were to succeed in this Court then the action should be referred back to the Exchequer Court for the determination of the quantum of the cross-demand and that the parties had so agreed. Counsel for the respondent, after some discussion with the Court, agreed that there was no defence to the cross-demand if the termination of the contract had been valid and effective, subject, however, to proper assessment of the amount thereof. I am of the opinion that this Court, therefore, should direct that the petition be returned to the Exchequer Court for ascertainment of the proper damages to be allowed to the appellant on the cross-demand.\nIn view of the conclusion to which I have arrived as to the validity of the termination of the contract, I do not find it necessary to express any opinion as to whether the purported assignment of the benefit of the contract to the Royal Bank of Canada was effective so as to deprive the respondent of any cause of action which he could assert in this petition.\nThe appellant is entitled to Her costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: E.A. Driedger, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Howard, Stalker, McDougall, Graham & Stocks, Montreal.\n[1] [1966] Ex. C.R. 538.\n",

The conflict concerned three claims identified as C4, C5 and C6 relating to a synthetic rubber known as cold rubber. The Commissioner of Patents ruled that the respondent Dominion Rubber Co. was entitled to claims C5 and C6. The Exchequer Court held that none of the parties was entitled to claim C4 and that Dominion Rubber Co. was entitled to claims C5 and C6. There is no appeal from the decision in respect to claim C4. Phillips Petroleum Co. took no part in the hearing in this Court. The appellant contends that there was a lack of patentability having regard to the state of art and what Doctor Howland for Dominion Rubber Co. did, when he conceived and disclosed the idea in December 1947, was an obvious user of a process then well known in the art. It is conceded that Phillips Petroleum Co. could not have made any invention prior to January 19, 1948, and General Tire & Rubber Co. prior to April 14, 1949.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe inventor, Howland, applied a known method, not previously used for that purpose to a known substance with a new compound at the time in the process of making cold rubber which resulted in a finished product being available to the market. The trial judge was right in finding that this was an invention and the evidence supports his finding.\nBrevets\u2014Conflit de demandes\u2014Droit de trois demandeurs de brevets pour la m\u00eame invention\u2014Y a-t-il invention\u2014Qui fut le premier\u2014Loi sur les brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 45(8).\nCes actions r\u00e9sultent d\u2019un conflit sous l\u2019article 45 de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, entre les demandeurs de brevets des trois compagnies dans ces appels. Le conflit se rapporte \u00e0 trois revendications, C4, C5 et C6, concernant un caoutchouc synth\u00e9tique connu sous le nom de \u00abcold rubber\u00bb. Le Commissaire des Brevets a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Dominion Rubber Co. avait droit aux revendications C5 et C6. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune des compagnies avait droit \u00e0 la revendication C4 et que Dominion Rubber Co. avait droit aux revendications C5 et C6. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision concernant la revendication C4. La compagnie Phillips Petroleum Co. n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 l\u2019audition devant cette Cour. L\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019il y avait un manque d\u2019invention vu l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019art et que ce que le Docteur Howland, pour Dominion Rubber Co., a fait, lorsqu\u2019il a con\u00e7u et d\u00e9voil\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1947, \u00e9tait un usage manifeste d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 bien connu dans l\u2019art.

Kokonis, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and David Watson, for the defendant, respondent, Dominion Rubber Co.\nRoss G. Gray, Q.C., for Phillips Petroleum Co.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The events leading up to this litigation and their chronological sequence are set out at length in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge1, Gibson J. In summary these are appeals arising out of two actions in the Exchequer Court, Numbers A-169 and A-1178 which were tried together and in which Gibson J. gave common reasons, but in respect of which there were separate formal judgments. The actions arose out of a conflict in the Patent Office under s. 45 of the Patent Act between patent applications of the three parties to these appeals, the appellant being hereafter referred to as General and the two respondents respectively as Dominion and Phillips. The patent applications in question were:\n(a) Canadian Patent Application 611,684 by The General Tire & Rubber Company, filed February 14, 1951;\n(b) Canadian Patent Application 626,519 by Phillips Petroleum Company, filed February 5, 1952;\n(c) Canadian Patent Application 636,139 by Dominion Rubber Company Limited, filed September 10, 1952.\nThe conflict concerned three claims identified as C4, C5 and C6. The Commissioner of Patents decided that Dominion was entitled as against the other two parties to claims C5 and C6. General then instituted in July 1961 the first of the two actions (A-169) naming Dominion as defendant. In March 1963 Phillips instituted the other action (A-1178) naming Dominion and General as defendants. Ultimately the pleadings in both actions were amended by consent so that they corresponded in substance and raised the same issues, and the actions were tried together.\nThe position of General was that none of the parties was entitled to any of the conflicting claims C4, C5 and C6. The position of Phillips was that it was entitled as against the other parties to all three of the claims, though at the trial it withdrew its assertion of entitlement to claims C5 and C6. The position of Dominion was that both actions should be dismissed, with the result that it would remain, under the Commissioner\u2019s decision, entitled to all three of the claims. The judgments were that none of the parties was entitled to claim C4 and that Dominion was entitled as against General and. Phillips to claims C5 and C6. There is no appeal from the judgments in respect of, claim C4. Phillips took no part in the hearing in this Court.\nAction No. A-169 in which General was plaintiff was dismissed. It was adjudged that: Dominion was entitled as against General and Phillips to the issue of a patent including claims C5 and C6 on its Canadian application 636,139 and it was further adjudged that none of the parties was entitled to a patent containing claim C4. Action No. A-1178 in which Phillips was plaintiff was also dismissed. It was adjudged that Dominion was entitled as against General and Phillips to the issue of a patent including claims C5 and C6 on its Canadian application 636,139, that none of the parties was entitled to the issue of a patent containing claim C4, that the counterclaim of General was otherwise dismissed and that claim C9 submitted by General in the preliminary proceedings to the trial was unpatentable. An application to vary the minutes by deleting the reference to claim C9 was dismissed.\nClaims C5 and C6 which were awarded to Dominion relate to the inclusion of oil in cold high Mooney rubber by the latex blending of oil and rubber. The trial judge considered that claims C5 and C6 related to an invention but that claims C4 and C9 differed from C5 merely by referring to specific amounts of oil and precise Mooney measurements. He reached the conclusion that there was nothing inventive in the selection of these precise amounts of oil or Mooney measurements and that C4 and C9 were therefore not inventively distinguishable from claim C5 and were therefore unpatentable.\nThe said claims C4, C5, C6 and C9 read as follows:\nC4. The method of making a mass of polymeric material vulcanizable to a rubber-like state comprising forming an emulsion of monomeric material comprising at least one conjugated diolefin; polymerizing said monomeric material in said emulsion at a temperature below 15\u00b0C.; the resulting polymer having a raw Mooney value (ML-4) of at least 90; adding to a latex of said polymer a hydrocarbon softener as a dispersion in water, said softener being added in an amount of between 15 and 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber; and recovering resulting softened polymer.\nC5. The process of making a mixture comprising a synthetic rubber and a processing oil which comprises coagulating and drying the coagulum of an aqueous mixture containing dispersed particles of a rubber processing oil and a synthetic rubber latex which has been emulsion polymerized at a temperature between \u201440\u00b0F. and \u201460\u00b0F. and the rubber content of which has an ML-4 Mooney viscosity in the range of 75 to 200.\nC6. A mixture of a low temperature, viz., \u201440\u00b0F. to \u201460\u00b0F. aqueous emulsion polymerized synthetic rubber having an ML-4 Mooney viscosity in the range of 75 to 200, and a rubber processing oil, said processing oil having been co-coagulated with the synthetic rubber from a mixture comprising an aqueous dispersion of particles of the processing oil and synthetic rubber latex.\nC9. The method of making a mass of polymeric material vulcanizable to a rubber-like state comprising forming an emulsion of monomeric material comprising at least one conjugated diolefin; polymerizing said monomeric material in said emulsion at a temperature below 15\u00b0C.; the resulting polymer having a raw Mooney value (ML-4) of at least 90; adding to a latex of said polymer a hydrocarbon mineral oil softener as a dispersion in water, said softener being added in an amount of between 20 and 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber; and recovering resulting softened polymer.\nIt will be seen that claims C4 and C9 are very similar, differing only in the words underlined in C9 above.\nWe are here concerned with whether the addition of the oil softener by a particular method, namely, by latex masterbatching, also known as co-coagulation, was an invention within the meaning of the Patent Act. The respondent says that it was and Gibson J. so held. The appellant contends that there was a lack of patentability having regard to the state of the art and what Dr. Howland (Dominion\u2019s alleged inventor) did was an obvious user of a process then well known in the art.\nIt is beyond doubt that Gibson J. was right in his finding that the process known as latex masterbatching was a well-known process at all times material to this litigation However, it is equally clear that this particular process had not been used in respect of high Mooney cold rubber. It had been used experimently with what is known as GRS rubber by which is meant Government Rubber Styrene, a synthetic product produced by a hot process and the method was not adopted by the trade because of certain economic disadvantages not present in the methods then being used, namely, by milling or in the Banbury machine or by solution incorporation.\nHigh Mooney cold rubber is a synthetic product which was not generally available in late 1947 and certainly not in the latter part of 1946 or early 1947 as found by Gibson J.\nDr. Howland conceived and disclosed as of December 12, 1947, the idea of combining high Mooney cold rubber, carbon black and oil through the method of latex master-batching (co\u2011coagulation). In a report he prepared and sent to Rubber Reserve on that date he said in part:\n3. A 3-component masterbatch (polymer, black and softener) has been made with suitable cure rate for the first time, using X-384 latex. The high Mooney of this material may be responsible for the improved cure over similar trials with normal Mooney latex.\n* * * MASTERBATCHES\nA successful 3-component masterbatch has been made with X-384 latex (high Mooney redox polymer made at Institute).

Latex master-batching had been used to combine other ingredients. Oil had been widely used to soften GRS and to soften high. Mooney cold rubber but by milling or in the Banbury machine or by solution incorporation. Was what Dr. Howland did a patentable invention?\nGibson J. dealt with the problem as follows:\nIn my opinion, the concept of using high amounts of softener and incorporating the same in high Mooney cold rubber, was not inventive. Instead, as stated, what was inventive was the idea at the material time to combine the softener with the high Mooney cold rubber in a particular way, namely, by latex masterbatching.\nIn this, clearly on the evidence, Dominion, through Howland, was first.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe essence of Howland\u2019s invention, if it was an invention, was the use of a known process, masterbatching, to combine an oil softener with high Mooney polymer and carbon black in the making of synthetic rubber at a stage in the process before the solution was separated and became a solid mass. The product which emerged from the process was high Mooney cold rubber with the oil softener as an integral element of the final product as it came from the manufacturer. This result was a very beneficial one economically as it was no longer necessary to put the synthetic rubber through the milling process or the Banbury machine or in any other way prior to being able to use it in the manufacture of tires and other products.\nGibson J. found that what Howland did was not obvious to persons skilled in the art. He deals with this point as follows:\nPhillips, in the period 13 October to 17 November, 1947, in Tire Test 123 which was the last practical tire test made prior to the alleged invention of Dominion, employed all the elements set out in all the conflict claims, and the specific amounts of the alleged important elements of conflict claim C-4 (namely, high Mooney cold rubber mixed with amounts of oil softener in excess of 15 parts per 100 parts of rubber) and incorporated the same in a Banbury, but not by latex masterbatching. It probably did this, it may be inferred from the evidence, because incorporating softener into GRS rubber up to that material time had proved to have disadvantages. It is therefore a reasonable inference from this evidence alone that those skilled in the art employed by Phillips, which personnel had very considerable capacity, did not consider it obvious to incorporate the oil into this new rubber namely, cold rubber, by way of latex masterbatching. Many cases were cited by counsel dealing with the question of inventiveness through the use of a known process with known materials to produce a hitherto unknown or unexpected result. I do not think it is necessary to go beyond the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba Limited[2]. Martland J. in Ciba, speaking for the Court, had to deal with such a situation on an appeal from the Exchequer Court[3] which reversed the Commissioner of Patents who had refused to grant a patent because the process defined in the process claims was not new. After considering the authorities and in particular the judgment of Jenkins J. in In re May and Baker Limited and Ciba Limited[4], Martland J. said:\n\u2026To constitute an invention within the definition in our Act the process must be new and useful. There is no question as to the process here being useful, as it produces compounds which have been admitted to be both new and useful.\nIs it a new process? Is the element of novelty precluded because it consists of a standard, classical reaction used to react known compounds? In my opinion the process in question here is novel because the conception of reacting those particular compounds to achieve a useful product was new. A process implies the application of a method to a material or materials. The method may be known and the materials may be known, but the idea of making the application of the one to the other to produce a new and useful compound may be new, and in this case I think it was.\nIn the present case Howland applied the known method of masterbatching to a known substance, an oil softener, with a new compound, high Mooney cold rubber, at a time in the process of making high Mooney cold rubber which resulted in the finished product being available to the market and immediately ready for processing into tires. Hitherto the tire manufacturer had had to soften his synthetic rubber whether GRS or the new high Mooney cold rubber in the Banbury machine or by one of the other two methods previously described.\nIn my opinion Gibson J. was right in finding that this was an invention and the evidence supports his finding.\nThere is one other aspect of the appeal to be dealt with. The appellant has asked that the judgments be varied by deleting therefrom the paragraph which reads:\nTHIS COURT DOTH FURTHER DECLARE THAT claim C9 submitted by General in the preliminary proceedings to this trial is unpatentable. In his reasons for judgment Gibson J. dealt with this matter as follows:\nI am therefore of opinion that claim C-4 is not inventively distinguishable from claim C-5 and therefore it contains \u201csubstantially the same invention\u201d and is \u201cso nearly identical\u201d with claim C-5 within the meaning respectively of section 45(1)(a) and section 45(3) of the Patent Act.\nClaim C-4 is unpatentable therefore, in my opinion.\nI am also of the opinion that the proposed substitute claim C-9 submitted by General in the preliminary proceedings to this trial is also unpatentable, because it also is not inventively distinguishable from claim C-5.\nOne has but to compare claims C4 and C5 with C9 to see that Gibson J. was right in holding that C9 was not \u201cinventively distinguishable\u201d from C5. The contention that General should, after this prolonged litigation in which C9 was necessarily in issue, be free to start conflict proceedings all over again because the pleadings do not specifically refer to C9 by that number is wholly untenable.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Dominion Rubber Co.: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1966] Ex.

The change from the Common Law rule that it was improper to allow counsel fees in respect of services rendered by salaried officers representing the Crown on the taxation of costs awarded in favour of the Crown, brought about by s. 105 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, applies as much to the Crown in the right of a Province as to the Crown in the right of Canada. Consequently, the Registrar of this Court, in taxing the costs of a provincial Attorney General to whom costs of an appeal have been awarded by this Court, should allow proper counsel fee and proper fee for the preparation of factum, although the Attorney General was represented on the appeal by lawyers on salary in the Department of the Attorney General.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney General for Ontario from a decision of the Registrar of this Court on the taxation of the costs of the appeal[1] in this case. Appeal allowed.\nA.E. Charlton, for the Attorney General for Ontario.\nBrian Crane, for Nickel Rim Mines Ltd.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (in Chambers):\u2014This is an application by way of appeal from the decision of the Registrar who, by his Allocatur dated May 3, 1967, taxed the costs of the respondent, the Attorney General for Ontario, at the sum of $442.50. The Registrar, in his written reasons, disallowed items claimed by the respondent, the Attorney General for Ontario, of $650 for counsel fee and $150 for costs of preparation of factum. The Registrar expressed the view that the Attorney General for Ontario could not claim profit costs for services performed by lawyers on salary in the Department of the Attorney General for Ontario.\nThe common law rule as to costs payable to the Crown under the Order of this Court was settled in Hamburg-American Packet Co. v. The King[2], where Maclennan J., in Chambers, disallowed such a claim relying on Jarvis v. The Great Western Railway Co.[3] and The Charlevoix Election case: Valin v. Langlois, Cassels Digest (2nd ed.), 677.\nThe problem is whether the provisions of s. 105 of the Supreme Court Act have wrought an alteration in the law as set out in the said decision. Section 105 of the Supreme Court Act reads as follows:\n105. In any proceeding to which Her Majesty is a party, either as represented by the Attorney General of Canada or otherwise, costs adjudged to Her Majesty shall not be disallowed or reduced upon taxation merely because the solicitor or the counsel who earned such costs, or in respect of whose services the costs are charged, was a salaried officer of the Crown performing such services in the discharge of his duty and remunerated therefor by his salary, or for that or any other reason not entitled to recover any costs from the Crown in respect of the services so rendered, and the costs recovered by or on behalf of Her Majesty in any such case shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\nThis section was enacted in 1917. The provisions which now appear as ss. 104 and 106 had been enacted in the year 1887.\nThe learned Registrar in his reasons relied on the wording of s. 104 of the statute to indicate that the provisions of s. 105 of the statute were restricted to the cases of the Crown in the right of Canada and particularly the reference to the Minister of Finance and to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada in s. 104 and in s. 106(2). It must be observed, however, that the words which appear in s. 105 are not \u201cThe Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada\u201d but merely \u201cThe Consolidated Revenue Fund\u201d. Neither the Supreme Court Act nor the Interpretation Act bear any definition of the words \u201cThe Consolidated Revenue Fund\u201d but the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 116, in s. 2(e) provides:\n2. In this Act,\n* * *\n(e) \u201cConsolidated Revenue Fund\u201d means the aggregate of all public moneys that are on deposit at the credit of the Receiver General;\nTherefore, plainly, of course, in that statute but not elsewhere the words \u201cThe Consolidated Revenue Fund\u201d even without the addition of the words \u201cof Canada\u201d refer to the federal Crown. As I shall indicate hereafter, I am of the opinion that the point is not material.\nThere is only one Crown although there are two separate statutory purses: In re Silver Brothers[4]. In determining whether s. 105 applies in favour of the Crown in the right of the province as well as the Crown in the right of Canada, one should have in mind the provisions of s. 15 of the Inter-pretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, which are as follows:\n15. Every Act and every provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing that Parliament deems to be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing that it deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nIn A.G. for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Railway Co. & A.G. of Canada[5], the Judicial Committee considered section 189 of the Railway Act of 1919 which, in subs. (1) provided:\n(1) No company shall take possession of, use or occupy any lands vested in the \u2018Crown without the consent of the Governor in Council.\nand, in subs. (2), provided that any railway company might, with such consent, take for the use of its railway so much of the lands of the Crown lying in a certain area.\nThe Judicial Committee held that the section of the said federal statute authorized the railway company to take with the consent of the Governor in Council lands held by the Crown in the right of the Province of Quebec. Viscount Cave, L.C., said at pp. 720-721:\nTheir Lordships do not feel any doubt that s. 189 of the Railway Act applies, according to its true construction, to lands belonging to the Crown in right of a Province. The section applies in terms to all \u201clands of the Crown lying on the route of the railway\u201d, no distinction being made between Dominion and Provincial Crown lands. It is true that the only consent required by the section is that of the Governor in Council; but if any executive consent was to be required to the taking of Crown lands for the purposes of a Dominion railway, it was to be expected that the consent required would be that of the Dominion Government, for otherwise the construction of the railway would be dependent upon the consent of the Government of each Province through which it was intended to pass. It is true also that subs. 4 of the section appears to proceed on the assumption that all compensation money for Crown lands taken will be payable to the Governor in Council, and it is suggested that this would not be the natural destination of compensation paid in respect of lands in which the beneficial interest belongs to a Province; but this sub-section is machinery only, and there is no reason why the Governor in Council should not direct any compensation moneys received in respect of Provincial Crown lands to be handed over to the Government of the Province concerned.\nThe construction so put upon s. 189 of the Act of 1919 is strongly supported by a reference to the history of the Railway Acts, which were carefully analysed in the judgment delivered by Newcombe J. on behalf of the Supreme Court in this case. The pre-Union Railway Act of the Province of Canada (22 Vict. c. 66) authorized the taking of any \u201cwild lands of the Crown\u201d situate on the route of the railway; and this expression was repeated in the Railway Act passed immediately after confederation (the Railway Act, 1868) at a time when all such \u201cwild lands\u201d were necessarily Provincial Crown lands. It reappeared in the Railway Acts of 1879 and 1886, the word \u201cwild\u201d being omitted in the Act of 1888 and in all subsequent consolidating Acts down to and including the Act of 1919; and it is hardly conceivable that an expression which in the earlier of these statutes plainly included Provincial Crown lands was intended to have a less extended meaning in the later statutes. It is noteworthy too that the Act of 1919 was passed after it had been decided in the British Columbia case (to be hereafter referred to) that the section extended to Provincial Crown property, and without any alteration of language.\nAgain, in A.G. of Alberta v. The Royal Trust Co.[6], this Court dealt with the then s. 70 of the Supreme Court Act which now appears as s. 69 of the Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259. This Court held that the section which exempted the Crown from the provisions of the Act requiring the deposit of security for costs applied as well to the Crown in the right of Canada. The Court therefore refused to quash the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that it had not been properly instituted when no proper security had been given under the said s. 70.\nI am of the opinion that the situation to which s. 105 was addressed is one equally applicable to the Provincial Crown as to the federal Crown. As directed by s. 15 of the Interpretation Act, I consider the provisions of s. 105 of the Supreme Court Act as being remedial in the case of the provincial Crown as well as the Dominion Crown. I adopt here the words of Tweedie J. in Re Cardston U.F.A. Co-Op. Association Ltd., ex parte The King[7]:\nIt is quite true that the section is not in express words made applicable to the Crown in the right of the Province, but, if the intention of the Act as a whole is to place the Crown in regard to priorities in the same position as private creditors, then the expression \u201cCrown\u201d must be construed so as to include both the right of the Dominion and that of the Province.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the proper interpretation to be given to s. 105 of the Supreme Court Act is to apply it in favour of the Crown in the right of the Province of Ontario as well as the Crown in right of Canada and that the Registrar, therefore, should have allowed proper counsel fee and proper fee for preparation of factum. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs which by agreement of the parties are allowed at the sum of $100 and the Allocatur is referred back to the learned Registrar for amendment in accordance with these reasons. I express no view as to the quantum of the costs to be allowed for either item.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General for Ontario: F.W.

The doctor represented to a female patient that his friend was a medical intern in need of further experience and in this way obtained the patient\u2019s consent to the friend\u2019s presence in the examining room during the course of an examination of the patient\u2019s intimate parts. During the examination, the friend stood by and observed but at no time did he touch the patient. Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellants were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a verdict of acquittal entered for both appellants.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The appellants were not guilty of an indecent assault within the meaning of s. 141 of the Criminal Code. The conduct of the doctor was unethical and reprehensible in the extreme. However, the consent of the patient was not obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act to be performed by the doctor. The fraud was as to the friend being a medical intern. His presence as distinct from some overt act by him was not an assault. The friend was acting as a \u201cpeeping tom\u201d, and such conduct is not an offence.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: Under s. 230 of the Criminal Code, the application of force, however slight, is an assault when it is \u201cwithout the consent of another person or with consent when it is obtained by fraud\u201d. In this case, the patient consented to be touched by the doctor in the presence of a doctor and not a mere layman. The indecent assault upon her was not the act to which she consented and therefore the two appellants were guilty under the provisions of s. 141(1) of the Code when considered with ss. 21 and 230 of the Code without recourse to the provisions of s. 141(2).\nDroit criminel\u2014Attentat \u00e0 la pudeur\u2014Docteur examinant une patiente en la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un ami non du m\u00e9tier\u2014Ami d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un interne\u2014Le consentement a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour l\u2019examen\u2014Le consentement a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu par fraude\u2014Nature et caract\u00e8re de l\u2019acte\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 21, 141, 230.\nLes deux appelants, l\u2019un un m\u00e9decin et l\u2019autre un ami non du m\u00e9tier, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s coupables d\u2019attentat \u00e0 la pudeur, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 141 du Code criminel.

APPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1], confirmant un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 pour attentat \u00e0 la pudeur. Appel maintenu, le Juge Spence \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia1, affirming the appellants\u2019 conviction for indecent assault. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.\nNeil M. Fleishman, for the appellant Bird.\nThomas R. Braidwood, for the appellant Bolduc.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The facts and circumstances relative to this appeal are fully set out in the judgment of my brother Spence. The question for decision is whether on those facts and in the circumstances so described the appellants Bolduc and Bird were guilty of an indecent assault upon the person of the complainant contrary to s. 141 of the Criminal Code which reads:\n141. (1) Every one who indecently assaults a female person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years and to be whipped.\n(2) An accused who is charged with an offence under subsection (1) may be convicted if the evidence establishes that the accused did anything to the female person with her consent that, but for her consent, would have been an indecent assault, if her consent was obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act.\nWith respect, I do not agree that an indecent assault was committed within the meaning of this section. What Bolduc did was unethical and reprehensible in the extreme and was something no reputable medical practitioner would have countenanced. However, Bolduc\u2019s unethical conduct and the fraud practised upon the complainant do not of themselves necessarily imply an infraction of s. 141, supra. It is common ground that the examination and treatment, including the insertion of the speculum were consented to by the complainant. The question is: \u2018Was her consent obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act?\u2019 Bolduc did exactly what the complainant understood he would do and intended that he should do, namely, to examine the vaginal tract and to cauterize the affected parts. Inserting the speculum was necessary for these purposes. There was no fraud on his part as to what he was supposed to do and in what he actually did. The complainant knew that Bird was present and consented to his presence. The fraud that was practised on her was not as to the nature and quality of what was to be done but was as to Bird\u2019s identity as a medical intern. His presence as distinct from some overt act by him was not an assault. However, any overt act either alone or in common with Bolduc would have transposed the situation into an unlawful assault, but Bird did not touch the complainant; he merely looked on and listened to Bolduc\u2019s comments on what was being done because of the condition then apparent in the vaginal tract. Bird was in a sense a \u201cpeeping tom\u201d. Conduct popularly described as that of a \u201cpeeping tom\u201d was not an offence under the Criminal Code nor was it an offence at common law: Frey v. Fedoruk et al[2]. Since the decision in Frey v. Fedoruk, supra, the Code was amended by the inclusion of s. 162 which first appeared in the 1955 Code. That section reads:\n162. Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, loiters or prowls at night upon the property of another person near a dwelling house situated on that property is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nThe act of \u2018peeping\u2019 is not of itself made an offence, but it is the loitering or prowling at night near a dwelling house without lawful excuse that is made unlawful.\nThis case differs from Rex v. Harms[3] where the accused was charged with rape following carnal knowledge of an Indian girl, her consent to the intercourse having been obtained by false and fraudulent misrepresentations as to the nature and quality of the act. In that case Harms falsely represented himself to be a medical doctor, and although the complainant in that case knew that he was proposing sexual intercourse, she consented thereto because of his representations that the intercourse was in the nature of a medical treatment necessitated by a condition which he said he had diagnosed. Harms was not a medical man at all. He had no medical qualifications. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction by the jury that the Indian girl\u2019s consent had been obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act.\nThe question of fraud vitiating a woman\u2019s consent in the case of rape or indecent assault was fully canvassed by Stephen J. in The Queen v. Clarence[4] and by the High Court of Australia in Papadimitropoulos v. The Queen[5] where the Court, in concluding a full review of the relevant law and cases decided up to that time, including the Harms case, supra, said:\nTo return to the central point; rape is carnal knowledge of a woman without her consent: carnal knowledge is the physical fact of penetration; it is the consent to that which is in question; such a consent demands a perception as to what is about to take place, as to the identity of the man and the character of what he is doing. But once the consent is comprehending and actual the inducing causes cannot destroy its reality\u2026\nThe complainant here knew what Bolduc was proposing to do to her, for this was one in a series of such treatments. Her consent to the examination and treatment was real and comprehending and it cannot, therefore, be said that her consent was obtained by false or fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act to be done, for that was not the fraud practised on her. The fraud was as to Bird being a medical intern and it was not represented that he would do anything but observe. It was intended that the examination and treatment would be done by Bolduc and this he did without assistance or participation by Bird.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered for both appellants.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014These are appeals by each accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[6] pronounced on February 6, 1967 whereby that Court dismissed the appeals of the accused from their convictions by His Honour Judge Ladner on November 24, 1966, of charges of indecent assault contrary to the provisions of s. 141 of the Criminal Code. The appeals were argued together. The circumstances are as follows. Bolduc was a physician and surgeon licensed to practice in the Province of British Columbia. In the course of such practice he was treating the complainant Diana Elizabeth Osborne for an erosion of the cervic uteri. During the course of treatment, after necessary examinations, he had on several occasions cauterized the affected parts. On a Saturday morning in the month of October or November 1965, Mrs. Osborne attended Dr. Bolduc\u2019s office for another examination and treatment, if the latter were required.\nThe accused Bird was a professional musician in a night club. He had been for some time a personal friend of the accused Bolduc. He had obtained an honours degree in chemistry from the university and he swore that \u201cI was very seriously considering returning to university to go to medical school\u201d.\nOn Mrs. Osborne\u2019s attendance at the office, the receptionist prepared her for the examination and\/or treatment and then attended the accused Bolduc in his office to inform him that his patient was ready. Present in the office with Bolduc was the accused Bird and upon noticing that Bolduc was not alone the receptionist simply informed Bolduc that his patient had been prepared and requested him to notify her when he was ready to proceed. In a few moments the receptionist was recalled into the office and Bolduc instructed her to get a white lab coat, such as commonly worn by doctors, so that Bird might use the same stating to her that Bird was an intelligent young man and that he intended to pass Bird off as a doctor or medical intern, adding \u201cthis was a good way to learn the facts of life\u201d. The receptionist protested at what she considered such unethical conduct and declined to bring the lab coat. Bolduc himself obtained the coat for Bird and requested that the receptionist give her stethoscope to Bird. The receptionist simply dropped the instrument in the office and returned to the examining room.\nBolduc and Bird then entered the room together. Bird was wearing the white lab coat and had in his possession a stethoscope. Bolduc introduced Bird to Mrs. Osborne as \u201cDr. Bird\u201d, told Mrs. Osborne that Bird was a medical intern who had not obtained practical experience of this type of thing during his internship and asked if she would mind if Dr. Bird were present during the examina- tion. Mrs. Osborne replied in the negative because he was an intern, that she didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201cthis is fine\u201d.\nI have above summarized the evidence of the receptionist which was accepted by the learned trial judge.\nThe examination proceeded with Bolduc, the physician, sitting on a stool at the end of the examining table. He then proceeded to examine carefully and to touch Mrs. Osborne\u2019s private parts, and during the course of the treatment he inserted a speculum in the vaginal canal. Throughout this, the accused Bird stood to one side of Bolduc about a foot or eighteen inches away from him and Bolduc made comments as to the patient\u2019s treatment, progress, her condition, and also on the prevalence of such condition amongst female patients. Bird simply answered by nods and did not touch the patient at all. It is, of course, the question for decision whether or not the conduct of Bolduc in the circumstances constituted the offence of indecent assault.\nBefore the Court of Appeal and in this Court, it was immediately admitted, and it could not be otherwise, that if Bolduc\u2019s conduct did amount to indecent assault Bird was also guilty under the provisions of s. 21 of the Criminal Code despite the fact that he did not touch the patient at any time. Section 141(1) of the Criminal Code provides:\n141. (1) Every one who indecently assaults a female person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years and to be whipped.\nSection 230 of the Criminal Code provides:\n230. A person commits an assault when, without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is obtained by fraud,\n(a) he applies force intentionally to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or\nIt is, of course, trite law that the force applied may be of very slight degree, in fact, may be mere touching.\nThe courts below were concerned with the provisions of s. 141(2) of the Criminal Code which provides:\n(2) An accused who is charged with an offence under subsection (1) may be convicted if the evidence establishes that the accused did anything to the female person with her consent that, but for her consent, would have been an indecent assault, if her consent was obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act.\nMuch argument was directed in this Court to whether the admittedly fraudulent and false representation made to Mrs. Osborne was as to \u201cthe nature and character of the act\u201d so that the consent would be vitiated by the provisions of the said subsection.\nI am of the opinion that this Court need not be concerned directly with the provisions of s. 141(2). Under s. 230 the application of force, however slight, is an assault when it is \u201cwithout the consent of another person or with consent when it is obtained by fraud\u201d. Let us examine for a moment what was the consent obtained from Mrs. Osborne. Surely upon the evidence to which I have referred above, it was a consent to the examination by Bolduc of her private parts and the touching of them in the course of treatment in the presence of a doctor, and not a mere medical student or a mere layman who was in some vague fashion considering becoming a medical student.\nThere was no evidence whatsoever that Mrs. Osborne knew the accused Bird at all. The name Bird meant nothing to her. She only gave this consent to such a serious invasion of her privacy on the basis that Bird was a doctor intending to commence practice and who desired practical experience in such matters as Bolduc was proposing to engage in. That was the consent which Mrs. Osborne granted. The indecent assault upon her was not the act to which she consented and therefore I am of the opinion that the two accused were guilty under the provisions of s. 141(1) when considered with s. 230 and s. 21 of the Criminal Code without recourse to the provisions of s. 141(2). This makes it unnecessary, in my view, to consider the many authorities cited in the most able argument of counsel for the accused and which dealt with the problem of the nature and character of the act under the provisions of the latter subsection.\nI would dismiss both appeals.\nAppeal allowed and verdict of acquittal ordered, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant Bird: N.M. Fleishman, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the appellant Bolduc: T.R. Braidwood, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for British Columbia.\n[1] [1967] 2 C.C.C. 272, 59 W.W.R. 103, 61 D.L.R.

By erecting certain culverts in the stream, the defendant caused the flooding of the works being executed by the plaintiff, thereby causing damages to the works and also the immobilization for some days of the heavy equipment being used by the plaintiff. The trial judge found for the plaintiff and awarded damages in the sum of $52,000. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, reduced the damages to the sum of $31,916. The plaintiff appealed to this Court and the defendant cross-appealed. The question of liability was not in issue in this Court, where only two questions were raised: (1) the quantum of damages and (2) whether the right of action belonged to a company known as Miron Co. Ltd. and not to the plaintiff. This second submission was rejected unanimously in the Courts below and, at the hearing, this Court expressed the opinion that it had rightly been rejected.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe amount of damages awarded by the trial judge and upheld by the reasons of the minority in the Court of Appeal was supported by the evidence and should not have been disturbed.\nDommages\u2014Construction d\u2019un \u00e9gout\u2014Deux entrepreneurs ayant contract\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment avec la cit\u00e9\u2014Travaux d\u2019un des entrepreneurs inond\u00e9s par les installations faites par l\u2019autre\u2014Responsabilit\u00e9\u2014Quantum des dommages\u2014Code Civil, arts. 1053, 1054.\nLes deux parties dans cet appel \u00e9taient \u00e0 construire pour la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al un \u00e9gout collecteur souterrain le long d\u2019une petite rivi\u00e8re. Certaines installations faites par la d\u00e9fenderesse ont eu pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019inonder les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par la demanderesse, causant ainsi des dommages \u00e0 ces travaux et en plus l\u2019immobilisation pendant quelques jours de l\u2019\u00e9quipement lourd employ\u00e9 par la demanderesse. Le juge au proc\u00e8s se pronon\u00e7a en faveur de la demanderesse et lui accorda des dommages au montant de $52,000. La Cour d\u2019Appel, par un jugement majoritaire a r\u00e9duit les dommages \u00e0 la somme de $31,916. La demanderesse en appela devant cette Cour et la d\u00e9fenderesse a produit un contre\u2011appel. La question de responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en jeu devant cette Cour, o\u00f9 deux questions seulement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es: (1) le quantum des dommages et (2) la question de savoir si le droit d\u2019action appartenait \u00e0 une compagnie connue sous le nom de Miron Co.

Cette seconde pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e unanimement par les Cours inf\u00e9rieures et, lors de l\u2019audition, cette Cour s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e d\u2019accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui l\u2019avait rejet\u00e9e.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le contre-appel rejet\u00e9.\nLe montant des dommages accord\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s et confirm\u00e9 par les juges formant la minorit\u00e9 dans la Cour d\u2019Appel \u00e9tait support\u00e9 par la preuve et n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre chang\u00e9.\nAPPEL et CONTRE-APPEL d\u2019un jugement majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], r\u00e9duisant les dommages accord\u00e9s par le Juge Batshaw. Appel maintenu et contre-appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, reducing the amount of damages awarded by Batshaw J. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nJacques Leduc, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nWalter C. Leggat, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side)1 which, by a majority, allowed an appeal from a judgment of Batshaw J. to the extent of reducing the amount of damages awarded to the appellant from $52,000 to $31,916. Choquette and Badeaux JJ. dissenting would have dismissed the appeal.\nIn this Court, the appellant asks that the judgment at trial be restored; the respondent asks that the appeal be dismissed and by way of cross-appeal asks that the action be dismissed with costs or, alternatively, that a new trial be ordered to assess the damages, if any, to which the appellant is entitled.\nThe action arose from the fact that while the parties were engaged in performing contracts with the City of Montreal to build an underground covered collector sewer running parallel to a stream known as the \u201cLittle Rivi\u00e8re St. Pierre\u201d the respondent, by the erection of certain culverts in the stream, caused the flooding of the works being executed by the appellant damaging the works and causing the immobilization for some days of the heavy equipment being used by the appellant.\nAt the trial the respondent denied liability, but in this Court only two points were raised, first, the quantum of damages and, second, the submission made by the respondent that if damages had been caused for which the respondent was responsible the right of action for those damages was that of a company known as Miron Company Limited and not of the appellant. This second submission was rejected unanimously in the Courts below and at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant in this Court, counsel for the respondent was informed that we were all of opinion that it was rightly rejected for the reasons given by Batshaw J. and that he need not deal with it.\nThe claim for damages was itemized in the Declaration and totalled $110,600. This was slightly amended at the trial and, as amended was as follows:\n(1) Travaux d\u2019ass\u00e8chement, de pompage et de protection de l\u2019\u00e9quipement et de la machinerie se trouvant sur les chantiers\n$30,254.00\n(2) Installation et enl\u00e8vement de barrages temporaries\n4,104.00\n(3) Construction d\u2019un talus \u00e9tanche et nettoyage et ass\u00e8chement des tranch\u00e9es d\u2019excavation\n6,208.00\n(4) Pour immobilisation d\u2019\u00e9quipement et retards dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux\n52,634.00\n(5) D\u00e9bours\u00e9s divers pour travaux sp\u00e9ciaux requis\n5,676.00\n(6) Augmentation de frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et perte de benefices\n11,800.00\n$110,676.00\nAfter setting out the itemized claim as above the learned trial judge continued:\nThe interruption of the Plaintiff\u2019s work caused by the flood lasted for a period which it was difficult to determine precisely since resumption of the operations could only be effected on a gradual basis. The estimates varied from 7 to 15 days; R.F. Bird, the Executive Vice-President for Sterling, who was its principal witness as to the damages, affirmed that it lasted for about 8 days. To be conservative however, the Plaintiff based its claim on a period of 5.2 days which seems to the Court not to be unwarranted.\nThis finding was not challenged. The learned trial judge disallowed item 6 and in this Court no argument was advanced against his having done so.\nThe learned trial judge then pointed out that of the remaining amount of $98,876 a sum of $84,812 represented the daily rental value of the equipment claimed on the basis of the calculation explained by the appellant\u2019s witness Bird, and the balance of $14,064 represented the total of items 1, 2, 3 and 5 excluding therefrom the portions of those items made up of rental value of equipment. That this is so appears clearly from Exhibit P-14. The amount of damages to be assessed for the claims totalling this $14,064 was fixed by the learned trial judge at $12,000 and no ground has been shewn from disturbing this figure.\nThere remains the item of $84,812 for which the learned trial judge allowed $40,000. As to this item the evidence of the witness Bird supported the claim of $84,812 while that of the respondent\u2019s witness Rousseau was to the effect that the amount should be $19,916. The learned trial judge did not accept either of these figures and gave reasons for his refusal to do so. His reasons for not accepting Rousseau\u2019s figure were concurred in by Badeaux J. with whom, as already mentioned, Choquette J. agreed.\nWith respect, I am unable to discern any sufficient reason for reversing the conclusion of the learned trial judge that he should not accept Rousseau\u2019s evidence in toto, nor am I able to say from a perusal of the record that his estimate of $40,000 for this item was erroneous. While always hesitant to differ from the judgment of a majority in the Court of Appeal in fixing damages the amount of which is not susceptible of precise arithmetical calculation, it does appear that in the reasons of the majority there was a misapprehension of the basis on which the learned trial judge had proceeded.\nAs already pointed out, the award of the learned trial judge was made up of two items: (i) $12,000 allowed in respect of a claim of $14,064 (being the total of items 1, 2, 3 and 5 excluding the sum of $32,178 charged in those items for the rental value of equipment) and (ii) $40,000 allowed in respect of a claim of $84,812 (being the total of item 4 and the above sum of $32,178). That this is so is made clear in the reasons of the learned trial judge when, after dealing with the claim for $84,812 and giving his reasons for allowing $40,000 in respect thereof, he says:\nHaving dealt with the $84,812.00, part of Plaintiff\u2019s claim of $98,876.00 referred to above, there remains the difference of $14,064.00 which represents miscellaneous items of damages other than for rental value of equipment contained in paragraph 29 sub-paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the declaration. It was conceded that this figure could not be ascertained with mathematical accuracy and represented a rough estimate of the damages involved. In the opinion of the Court this part of the claim could reasonably be assessed at $12,000.00.\nCasey J., however, says at the opening of his reasons:\nThis claim was for $110,600.00 divided into six items. The trial judge disallowed No. 6 ($11,800.00) and allowed $40,000.00 for No. 4 ($56,400.00 claimed) and $12,000.00 for nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 ($42,400 claimed).\nNo doubt Rousseau\u2019s figure of $19,916 was intended by that witness to represent the amount which in his opinion should have been allowed in respect of the total of $84,812 claimed for rental value of equipment; but I think it probable that Casey J. might not have adopted that figure if he had realized that the appellant\u2019s claim in regard to this item, supported as it was by Bird\u2019s evidence, was not for $56,400 but for the much larger sum of $84,812. Be that as it may, I have reached the conclusion that the figure arrived at by the learned trial judge and upheld by the reasons of the minority in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was supported by the evidence and should not have been disturbed.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Birtz & Leduc, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Foster, Watt, Leggat & Colby, Montreal.\n[1] [1966] Que.

The deed of sale to the respondent contained restrictive conditions and created certain servitudes. The right to expropriate was not contested. The Public Service Board valued the land at 55\u00a2 per square foot and fixed the indemnity at $5,065.50. That decision was homologated by the Superior Court. The Court of Appeal fixed the commercial value of the land taken at $1.25 per square foot and awarded an indemnity of $20,512.50. The expropriators appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe finding of the Court of Appeal that the commercial value of the land taken was $1.25 per square foot should not be disturbed. However, the 20-foot strip along St. Joseph Boulevard which the respondent was obligated, under this deed of acquisition, to cede free of charge to the city, if required to do so, had no commercial value to the respondent and therefore, contrary to what the Court of Appeal decided, the respondent was not entitled to compensation for that portion of the land taken. As to the servitude of non-access, the Court of Appeal erred in awarding compensation. That servitude caused no appreciable inconvenience to the owner of the property and the respondent, therefore, was not entitled to compensation under this head. In the result, the respondent was entitled to a compensation of $11,512.50.\nExpropriation\u2014Indemnit\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie des services publics\u2014Augmentation accord\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019Appel\u2014Valeur de certaines servitudes\u2014Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, arts. 1066a et seq.\nPar un avis d\u2019expropriation dat\u00e9 du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1961, les appelants ont expropri\u00e9 un immeuble appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, situ\u00e9 dans la cit\u00e9 de Drummondville, P.Q., et formant partie d\u2019un terrain achet\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en 1945 au prix de $2,200.

Appeal allowed.\nLaurent E. B\u00e9langer, Q.C., and Marcel Nichols, for the appellants.\nGaston Ringuet, Q.C., and Jules Saint-Pierre, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the Province of Quebec1 rendered on September 23, 1965, allowing an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court rendered on August 2, 1963, which homologated a decision of the Public Service Board of the Province of Quebec fixing the compensation to be paid to respondent for property expropriated by the appellants. The right to expropriate was not contested, and following proceedings under arts. 1066a et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Public Service Board, as arbitrator, fixed at $5,065.50 the compensation allowed to respondent for the property expropriated by appellants.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that amount was increased to $20,512.50. In this Court the appellants ask that the award of the Public Service Board be restored.\nThe relevant facts are set out in detail in the reasons of Rinfret J., in the court below, and in the Order of the Public Service Board. They are not now seriously in issue and for the purposes of the present appeal can be shortly stated.\nThe property in question is situated at the corner of St. Pierre St. and St. Joseph Boulevard West in the City of Drummondville. It forms part of an emplacement purchased by respondent on September 11, 1945, from Southern Canada Power Company Ltd. for the price of $2,200. The deed of sale from the power company contained restrictive conditions and created certain servitudes in the following terms:\nRESERVATIONS AND SERVITUDES\nThe Vendor reserved as perpetual servitudes on the property above sold and described in favour and for the benefit of the Vendor on the residue of said lot No. 151, and in favour of part of lot 152, of the South-Ward and of lots Nos. 3 and 4 of the West-Ward of Drummondville being properties of the Vendor, the following rights and restrictions, all undertaken and agreed to by the Purchaser.\n1. To run or place overhead or underground electric transmission and telephone line or lines which may already be constructed or which may be constructed in future on or across said sold property, including the right to place or construct thereon poles and anchors towers supports, structures guy wires, etc.\n2. To run a duct line or lines and pipes over and under said property.\n3. No structure of any sort shall be erected and no tree or trees shall be planted in near or within falling distance of the said transmission lines. The Vendor shall have the right to trim and cut any trees thereon and to do other such acts as may be necessary for the full operation of said transmission and telephone lines and duct or pipe lines and their maintenance in good order, including the right of ingress and egress for employees and employees\u2019 vehicles at all time on said property sold for the construction, operation and maintenance of said lines, the whole without any compensation therefor. 4. No structure shall be erected and no trees shall be planted on or along a strip of the hereby sold property, twenty-five feet wide adjacent to the present north-east limit of the third range (St. Joseph Boulevard) and parallel to it.\n5. Should the City of Drummondville require land along the said third range road, to increase the width of said road by a maximum of twenty feet, the Purchaser agrees to cede to the said City of Drummondville, free of charge, a strip of land along the hereby sold property, wide enough for such purpose.\nNotice of expropriation was given on August 10, 1961, and a technical description of the property, prepared on behalf of appellants, is dated October 5, 1961. The property and rights expropriated are concisely described by Rinfret J., as follows:\nLa description technique du 5 octobre 1961\u2014\n(1) d\u00e9crit le terrain \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir comme contenant une superficie de 14,810 pieds carr\u00e9s, soit 97 pieds dans la ligne nord, le long du chemin St-Georges (rue St-Pierre), dans la ligne est 41.5 pieds, dans la ligne nord-est 26 plus 202 pieds; dans la ligne sud-est 52 pieds et dans sa ligne sud, 294 pieds.\nEn somme l\u2019expropriation couvrait une lisi\u00e8re de 52 pieds sur toute la largeur du lot, longeant le boulevard St-Joseph.\n(2) elle pr\u00e9voit une servitude de non-acc\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9tendant sur une distance de 26 pieds sur la rue St-Pierre ainsi que sur le boulevard St-Joseph et sur une distance de 41.5 pieds dans la ligne courbe contournant l\u2019encoignure;\n(3) elle \u00e9tablit une servitude d\u2019une largeur de 10 pieds pour le passage d\u2019une ligne de transmission de la Southern Canada Power, le long du boulevard;\n(4) elle d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et le maintien d\u2019une zone libre de construction sur une distance additionnelle de 8 pieds, soit en tout de 18 pieds, parall\u00e8le au boulevard.\nComme r\u00e9sultat net de cette description technique, l\u2019appelant perdait une lisi\u00e8re de terrain de 52 pieds et se voyait priv\u00e9 de construire sur une lisi\u00e8re additionnelle de 18 pieds une tranche de 70 pieds sur la profondeur de 114 pieds que contenait son immeuble.\nAs above stated, the superficial area of the land expropriated was 14,810 square feet of which 5,600 square feet represented the area comprised in the 20-foot strip, which, under his deed of acquisition, respondent was obligated to convey to the City of Drummondville for the widening of St. Joseph Boulevard.\nThe Public Service Board held that by reason of the stipulations contained in his deed of acquisition, which I have just referred to, the respondent was not entitled to compensation for the taking of a 20-foot strip along St. Joseph Boulevard. It valued the land expropriated at 0.55 cts. per square foot and applying that figure to the remainder of the area expropriated, namely 9,210 square feet, it fixed the indemnity payable at $5,065.50.\nHaving held that by reason of the servitudes and restrictions imposed on the property by the power company in 1945, the land taken had very little commercial value the Board added that in fixing the value at 0.55 cts. per square foot, \u201cce prix tient \u00e9galement compte de la possibilit\u00e9 pour l\u2019expropri\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir de la Southern Canada Power la lib\u00e9ration \u00e9ventuelle des servitudes qui l\u2019affectaient\u201d. The Board also found that the respondent was not entitled to any compensation for the servitude of non-access or for injurious affection to the remainder of his property.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held that the Board had erred in considering that the limitation of its servitude by the power company was a mere possibility. After discussing the evidence on this point, Rinfret J. said:\nDe ces t\u00e9moignages il faut, je crois, d\u00e9gager que la disparition des servitudes de la Southern Canada Power, sur le terrain de M. H\u00e9bert, \u00e9tait plus qu\u2019une possibilit\u00e9; plus qu\u2019une probabilit\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait une certitude sujette \u00e0 une condition suspensive: la fixation par le gouvernement de la location exacte du boulevard St-Joseph.\nOn avait assur\u00e9 M. H\u00e9bert que main-lev\u00e9e serait donn\u00e9e sur le r\u00e9sidu de son terrain aussit\u00f4t que le gouvernement indiquerait l\u2019emplacement du boulevard.\nI am in respectful agreement with that finding. In fact by a letter dated March 29, 1962, addressed to respondent, the power company did agree to limit its servitude to a strip along the new line of St. Joseph Boulevard and this was confirmed by a notarial deed executed May 24, 1962. Both these documents were filed with the Board before it made its award.\nHaving carefully reviewed the evidence, Rinfret J. (with whom Taschereau, Owen and Rivard JJ. concurred) fixed the commercial value of the land taken at $1.25 per square foot, and that finding should not be disturbed. He also held that the respondent was entitled to compensation for all the land taken\u2014including the 20-foot strip above referred to\u2014and fixed the indemnity at $18,512.50, together with a sum of $2,000 as indemnity for the servitude of non-access making a total of $20,512.50. In all other respects the findings of the Board were confirmed. Montgomery J., while of opinion that the Board may have been right in taking into account the undertaking to transfer the 20-foot strip to the City free of charge, considered that the value of remainder of the property expropriated justified the proposed award of $20,512.50.\nAs I have said, under his deed of acquisition from the power company, respondent was obligated if required to do so, to cede a 20-foot strip free of charge to the City of Drummondville for the widening of St. Joseph Boulevard. Moreover, under clause 4 of the said deed, no structure could be erected or trees planted on the said strip. It is true that expropriation proceedings were initiated by the Provincial Government and the cost of the expropriation borne by it. The expropriation however, was for the joint benefit of the Province and the City, and under the provisions of the Roads Act, now 1964 R.S.Q., c. 133, s. 98, the land when taken vested in the City and became part of St. Joseph Boulevard West. With great respect, in my opinion the Board was justified in finding as it did that the land comprised in the said strip had no commercial value to respondent and that he was not entitled to compensation for that portion of the land taken. It follows therefore that the amount of $18,512.50 established by the court below should be reduced to $11,512.50.\nIn awarding an amount of $2,000 as compensation for the servitude of non-access, the Court below seems to have proceeded on the assumption that this servitude covered all the remaining frontage on St. Pierre St. of the property purchased by respondent from the power company. In fact this is not the case. As counsel for appellants pointed out in the argument before us, from a plan produced by respondent, dated October 2, 1961, and bearing the number 85 3-D, it appears that the property had a frontage on St. Pierre St. of approximately 148 feet. Of that frontage 97 feet were expropriated and a servitude of non-access imposed with respect to an additional 26 feet making a total of 123 feet. This left a frontage of approximately 25 feet on St. Pierre St., over which access to the property was unrestricted. So far as St. Joseph Boulevard is concerned, after the expropriation, access remained unrestricted along a frontage of 202 feet. With respect to this servitude of non-access, the Public Service Board said:\nCONSID\u00c9RANT QUE les r\u00e9gisseurs ont visit\u00e9 le terrain en question \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, aussi bien avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT QUE le r\u00e9sidu de la partie expropri\u00e9e du lot 151 a une superficie de 10,800 pieds carr\u00e9s, soit une superficie suffisante pour y \u00e9riger une station de service, selon les normes usuelles et suivant les pr\u00e9tentions des experts de l\u2019expropri\u00e9, pourvu que la forme de cette superficie s\u2019y pr\u00eate;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT QUE la servitude de non-acc\u00e8s plac\u00e9e au coin du boulevard St-Joseph et du chemin St-Georges, sur une longueur globale de 138\u00bd pieds \u00e9galement r\u00e9partie entre les deux rues, n\u2019a pas pour effet de rendre l\u2019exploitation du r\u00e9sidu impossible, car m\u00eame si la servitude n\u2019existait pas, la disposition des rues d\u2019o\u00f9 provient la client\u00e8le l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de faire usage du secteur cl\u00f4tur\u00e9, du moins dans une tr\u00e8s large mesure;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT QUE les clients \u00e9ventuels peuvent entrer sur le terrain et en sortir sans inconv\u00e9nients appr\u00e9ciables.\nIt held that the respondent was not entitled to compensation for the creation of such servitude.\nAs pointed out in the Court below, the servitude of non-access extends over 93.5 feet not 138.5 feet as stated by the Board, but obviously this error does not affect its findings that such servitude caused no appreciable inconvenience to the owner of the property and that consequently he was not entitled to compensation under this head. I am in agreement with these findings.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal, modify the judgment in the court below and substitute the sum of $11,512.50 for the sum of $20,512.50 therein mentioned. The appellants are entitled to their costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellants: Nichols & Pinard, Drummondville.\nAttorneys for the respondent: Ringuet & Saint-Pierre, Drummondville.\n[1] [1956] Que.

Act\u2014Labour Relations. Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A, ss. 20, 50 [now R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, ss. 11, 132]\u2014Professional Syndicates Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162 [now R.S.Q. 1964, c. 146]\u2014B.N.A. Act, 1867, s. 96.\nPursuant to s. 50 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A, the appellant associations, some of which had been incorporated under the Professional Syndicates Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162, were brought before the Labour Relations Board where it was asked that they be dissolved on the ground that they had become dominated by the employer contrary to the provisions of s. 20 of the Labour Relations Act. The appellants obtained from the Superior Court the issue of a writ of prohibition asking that s. 50 be declared ultra vires because it purported to confer upon the Board powers which are exercisable only by a Court, the members of which are appointed pursuant to s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act. The Board filed a total inscription in law which was maintained in the Superior Court and by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The appellant associations were granted leave to appeal to this Court. The Attorney General for Canada intervened to support the arguments of the appellants, and the Attorneys General for Quebec and Ontario intervened to support those of the Board.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 50 of the Labour Relations Act, which empowers the Board to dissolve employees\u2019 associations dominated by an employer, including a professional syndicate incorporated under the Professional Syndicates Act, is not ultra vires the Quebec legislature. Section 50 does not confer upon the Board judicial powers that can be exercised only by a Superior, District or County Court within the meaning of s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act. The power given to the Board is a limited and discretionary power. It is purely incidental to the accomplishment of the Board\u2019s primary purposes, namely the maintenance of industrial peace. There can be no valid analogy between that power and the general power to dissolve corporations conferred upon the Superior Court by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nTravail\u2014Droit constitutionnel\u2014Validit\u00e9 d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation provinciale\u2014Commission des Relations de Travail\u2014Pouvoir de prononcer la dissolution des associations de salari\u00e9s domin\u00e9es par un employeur\u2014La loi est-elle ultra vires vu les dispositions de l\u2019art. 96 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique\u2014Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162A, arts. 20, 50 [maintenant S.R.Q. 1964, c. 141, arts. 11, 132]\u2014Loi des Syndicats professionnels, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162 [maintenant S.R.Q. 1964, c. 146]\u2014Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867, art. 96 .\nConform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 50 de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 162A, les associations appelantes, dont plusieurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9es sous la Loi des syndicats professionnels,.

Callaghan, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench1, dated May 14, 1965, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which had maintained respondent\u2019s inscription-in-law and dismissed appellants\u2019 petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent the Respondent Board from exercising jurisdiction accorded it under s. 50 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A.\nIn March 1962, the mis-en-cause applied to the Labour Relations Board (hereinafter called the Board), under the said s. 50, asking that the appellant associations be dissolved on the ground that they had become dominated by employers contrary to the provisions of s. 20 of the Labour Relations Act. It appears that some of the said associations had been incorporated or had applied for incorporation under the Professional Syndicates Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162. Others appear to be unincorporated groups of the class contemplated by s. 2(d) of the said Act. On February 19, 1964, shortly before the hearing by the Board on the said application, the appellants applied for, without prior notice, and obtained from the Superior Court, the issue of a writ of prohibition asking that s. 50 of the Labour Relations Act be declared ultra vires the Quebee Legislature because it purports to confer upon the Board powers which are exercisable only by a court, the members of which are appointed pursuant to s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nOn February 25, 1964, the Board filed a total inscription-in-law which was maintained in the Superior Court and by the judgment in the Court below.\nVarious procedural questions appear to have been argued in the Courts below, in addition to the constitutional one. Before this Court, however, the sole question in issue is whether s. 50 is invalid because it confers upon the Board judicial powers that can be exercised only by a superior, district or county court within the meaning of s. 96 of the British North America Act. The Attorney General for Canada intervened to support the arguments for appellants, and the Attorneys General for Quebec and Ontario to support those for the Board.\nSections 20 and 50 of the Labour Relations Act to which I have referred read as follows:\n20. No employer, nor person acting for an employer or an association of employers, shall in any manner seek to dominate or hinder the formation or the activities of any association of employees.\nNo association of employees, nor person acting on behalf of any such association, shall belong to an association of employers or seek to dominate or hinder the formation or the activities of any such association.\n50. If it be proved to the Board that an association has participated in an offence against section 20, the Board may, without prejudice to any other penalty, decree the dissolution of such association after giving it an opportunity to be heard and to produce any evidence tending to exculpate it.\nIn the case of a professional syndicate, an authentic copy of the decision shall be transmitted to the Provincial Secretary who shall give notice thereof in the Quebec Official Gazette.\nThese two sections have been replaced by ss. 11 and 132 of the new Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, which came into force on September 1, 1964. The texts are substantially the same.\nThe Labour Relations Act and the Professional Syndicates Act are included in a group of statutes enacted by the Quebec Legislature which, generally speaking, have a common purpose. That purpose is to ensure industrial peace and to establish and protect the right of employers and employees to associate and to bargain collectively.\nThese are matters which clearly are within the legislative competence of the Province. To administer and enforce the provisions of these labour laws, the Legislature has created a special tribunal\u2014the Labour Relations Board. Similar boards have been set up in other jurisdictions and since the decision of the Judicial Committee in Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works[2], it is well established that such tribunals may exercise judicial functions as well as purely administrative ones.\nAs I have said, the narrow question in issue here is whether the Board, in ordering the dissolution of an association which has been given corporate status under the Professional Syndicates Act, is exercising a jurisdiction which belongs exclusively to a s. 96 Court.\nThe Professional Syndicates Act authorizes groups of employers and employees to form an association or professional syndicate and s. 6 states that such groups shall have as their object \u201cthe study, defence and promotion of the economic, social and moral interests of their members\u201d. The Provincial Secretary is empowered, at his discretion, upon compliance with the requirements of the statute, to grant corporate status to such bodies. Their powers, however, are limited and they are subject to the control and supervision of the Provincial Secretary. The status and related privileges are conferred, primarily, for the purpose of promoting employer and employee agreements by the process of collective bargaining.\nCollective bargaining becomes meaningless if either of the parties to that process is dominated by the other. For that reason, the Legislature saw fit (1) to enact the prohibition contained in s. 20 and (2) to provide in s. 50 that, in the case of a breach of s. 20, in addition to any other penalty, the Board may order the dissolution of the offending association.\nThe power given to the Board under s. 50 is a limited and discretionary power. It is purely incidental to the accomplishment of one of the primary purposes for which the association was granted corporate status, namely the maintenance of industrial peace. In my view, there can be no valid analogy between that power and the general power to dissolve corporations conferred upon the Superior Court under arts. 978 et seq. and 1007 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. These articles\u2014which are substantially the same as those contained in the first Code of Civil Procedure adopted in 1867\u2014operate in the broad area of termination of corporate status, at the instance of the Attorney General, on grounds of usurpation of corporate rights, or fraud and mistake in obtaining letters patent. They do not contemplate any such matter as a violation of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act.\nIt follows that in my opinion s. 50 of the Labour Relations Act does not confer upon the Board judicial powers that can be exercised only by a superior, district or county Court within the meaning of s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiffs, appellants: M.

He was found guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $400 and in default to be imprisoned for a term of 60 days. He applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order of certiorari to quash the conviction on the ground that the magistrate acted without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction in dealing with the case in that manner rather than pursuant to the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160. The writ was issued and the conviction quashed. This decision was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The Attorney General for British Columbia was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Leave to intervene was granted to the Attorney General for Canada, who supports the validity of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and to the Attorneys General for Ontario and Quebec, who challenge it.\nOne of the questions in issue in this appeal was as to whether the Juvenile Delinquents Act was intra vires as criminal legislation or ultra vires as legislation in relation to the welfare of children and as infringing, by ss. 2(1)(h), 3(1) and 4, the right of the provinces to punish breaches of provincial laws; the other question was as to whether s. 4 of the Act, assuming its validity, operates to prevent a juvenile from being prosecuted under the Summary Convictions Act for an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act or any other offences validly created in the province.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Juvenile Delinquents Act was intra vires the Parliament of Canada and the respondent should have been tried under the provisions of that Act. In its true nature and character, the Juvenile Delinquents Act, far from being legislation adopted under the guise of criminal law to encroach on subjects reserved to the provinces, is genuine legislation in relation to criminal law in its comprehensive sense.\nIt matters not that there be a lack of uniformity in the application or operation of the Juvenile Delinquents Act either (i) ratione loci, or (ii) ratione materiae, or (iii) ratione personae. Furthermore, the contention that, in pith and substance, the Juvenile Delinquents Act is legislation in relation to the welfare and protection of children within the purview of the Adoption Act case, [1938] S.C.R. 398, could not be accepted.\nSection 39 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act has no application in this case because the Motor Vehicle Act is not a statute of the class of statutes to which s. 39 is directed, namely, statutes intended for the protection or benefit of children. The Juvenile Delinquents Act and the Motor Vehicle Act cannot operate side by side, for their provisions clash at the level of law enforcement and to this extent, the latter statute is inoperative according to the rule that a legislation of Parliament which strictly relates to subjects of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act is of paramount authority, even though it trenches upon matters assigned to the provincial legislature by s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Loi sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants\u2014Est-ce une l\u00e9gislation criminelle\u2014Est\u2011ce que la loi empi\u00e8te sur le domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux provinces\u2014Loi sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160\u2014Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253\u2014Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the quashing of the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., and M.H. Smith, for the appellant.\nF.S. Perry, for the respondent.\nD.H. Christie, Q.C., and C.D. MacKinnon, for the Attorney General for Canada.\nF.W. Callaghan, Q.C., and Collin McNairn, for the Attorney General for Ontario.\nLaurent E. B\u00e9langer, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014While a child, within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, respondent was, in July 1964, at the city of Prince George, B.C., tried, as though he were an adult, by magistrate G.O. Stewart, in the ordinary courts and pursuant to the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 373, for an offence under the Motor-Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, to wit, driving a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding the prescribed limits. In fact, before proceeding with the case, the magistrate was fully aware that respondent was a child; considering, however, the latter\u2019s prior convictions for similar offences, he deemed it to be in his best interest to deal with the case in the ordinary way rather than under the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act and considered that such an alternative course was authorized under s. 39 thereof. Having then found respondent guilty, he disposed of the case, again as if the accused were an adult, by sentencing him to pay a fine of $400 and in default to be imprisoned for a term of 60 days. Respondent then applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order of certiorari to quash the conviction on the ground that the magistrate acted without jurisdiction or exceeded his jurisdiction in dealing with the case in the manner aforesaid rather than pursuant to the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. The application was heard by Brown J. who ordered the writ to issue and quashed the conviction. His decision was subsequently affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2], then constituted of Davey, Norris, Lord, Sullivan and Bull JJ.A. The latter three members of the Court, forming the majority, rejected the contention of the Attorney General of the province that the Juvenile Delinquents Act was ultra vires in whole or in part and that even if intra vires, the Act could not operate to prevent a child from being prosecuted in the ordinary courts, pursuant to the Summary Convictions Act, supra, for an offence against the Motor-Vehicle Act, supra. Dissenting, and accepting as well-founded the submissions of the Attorney General, Davey and Norris JJ.A. would have allowed the appeal and restored the conviction.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was then sought and obtained by the Attorney General of the province and leave to intervene was granted to the Attorney General of Canada, who supports the validity of the Act, and to the Attorneys General of Ontario and Quebec, who challenge it.\nThe constitutional problem arising in this case stems from the provisions of ss. 2(1)(h), 3(1) and 4 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act:\n2.(1)(h). \u2018juvenile delinquent\u2019 means any child who violates any provision of the Criminal Code or of any Dominion or provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality, or who is guilty of sexual immorality or any similar form of vice, or who is liable by reason of any other act to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory under the provisions of any Dominion or provincial statute;\n3(1). The commission by a child of any of the acts enumerated in paragraph (h) of subsection (1) of section 2, constitutes an offence to be known as a delinquency, and shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided.\n(2)\u2026\n4. Save as provided in section 9, the Juvenile Court has exclusive jurisdiction in cases of delinquency including cases where, after the committing of the delinquency, the child has passed the age limit mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 2. 1929, c. 46, s. 4. Section 9, referred to in s. 4, provides for an exceptional procedure when the act complained of is an indictable offence and, as will appear hereafter, has here no relevancy.\nCollectively, ss. 2(1)(h), 3(1) and 4 operate to prescribe, inter alia, that a juvenile who violates any provision, not only of a Dominion statute, but also of a provincial statute or of any by-law or ordinance of a municipality, be, if and when his act is complained of, dealt with in accordance with the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\nThe questions in issue, in this appeal, may then be concisely and fairly stated as follows:\n(i) Whether the Juvenile Delinquents Act is intra vires of Parliament, as being legislation under head 27 of s. 91, B.N.A. Act, to wit, legislation in relation to The Criminal Law\u2026including the Procedure in Criminal Matters or ultra vires, either on the ground that it is legislation related to the Welfare of children within the purview of the Adoption Act case (1938) S.C.R. 398, or on the ground that collectively sections 2(1)(h), 3(1) and 4 infringe the right of a provincial legislature, under head 15, s. 92, B.N.A. Act to impose punishment for enforcing any law made in the province in relation to any matter within the scope of its legislative competency;\n(ii) Whether or not, even if the Act is intra vires in its entirety as being legislation under head 27, s. 91, B.N.A. Act, s. 4 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act operates to prevent a juvenile from being prosecuted under the provisions of the Summary Convictions Act (supra) for an offence under the Motor-Vehicle Act (supra) or any other offences validly created in the province.\nDealing with the first question:\u2014The principles governing as to the extent and limitation of the power of Parliament to legislate in relation to The Criminal Law\u2026including Procedure in Criminal Matters have been stated at length in the various reasons for judgment, in the court of appeal, and need not be repeated here. Sufficient it is to point out concisely the following which, in my view, have a particular relevancy in this case, namely:\u2014that, properly interpreted, the words criminal law in head 27 of s. 91, B.N.A. Act, mean criminal law in its widest sense: A.-G. of Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway[3]; that the power assigned to Parliament in the matter includes the power to make new crimes: Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A.-G. of Canada[4], as well as the power to enact legislation designed for the prevention of crime: Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Canada et al. v. The Queen[5]; that it is the function of Parliament and not of the courts to decide what legislation is necessary for the efficient exercise of this plenary jurisdiction over the criminal law: Regina v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Canada et al.[6]; and that, though such legislation may incidentally affect the provincial legislative jurisdiction, it is not ultra vires of Parliament if its subject matter, purpose or object is, in its true nature and character, legislation genuinely enacted in relation to criminal law and not legislation adopted under the guise of criminal law and which, in truth and in substance, encroaches on any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92: A.-G. for British Columbia v. A.-G. for Canada et al.[7]\nThe primary legal effect of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,\u2014hereafter also referred to as the Act,\u2014is the effective substitution, in the case of juveniles, of the provisions of the Act to the enforcement provisions of the Criminal Code or of any other Dominion statute, or of a provincial statute validly adopted, under head 15 of s. 92, by a legislature for the enforcement of any law made in the exercise of its regulatory power with respect to any matters within its legislative competency which, in this case, is the control of highway traffic in the province. However, as it has often been held to be the case in the consideration of the validity of other Acts, the true nature and character of an Act cannot always be conclusively determined by the mere consideration of its primary legal effect. Indeed, a reference to the preamble, appended to the Act when originally adopted in 1908, 7-8 Edward VII, c. 40, as well as to the interpretation section and the main operative provisions of the Act, will show that this substitution of the provisions of the Act to the enforcement provisions of other laws, federally or provincially enacted, is a means adopted by Parliament, in the proper exercise of its plenary power in criminal matters, for the attainment of an end, a purpose or object which, in its true nature and character, identifies this Act as being genuine legislation in relation to criminal law. The preamble:\nWHEREAS it is inexpedient that youthful offenders should be classed or dealt with as ordinary criminals, the welfare of the community demanding that they should on the contrary be guarded against association with crime and criminals, and should be subjected to such wise care, treatment and control as will tend to check their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better instincts: Therefore His Majesty\u2026\nThe interpretation section:\n38. This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be carried out, namely, that the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents, and that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.\nThe main operative provisions:\nIn addition to those quoted above, others provide for: the strict and complete separation of juvenile from adults, at any stage of the enforcement process; the prohibition, particularly, to confine any child, pending the hearing of his case, at any county or other gaols in which adults are or may be imprisoned; the conduct of the trials, without publicity, privately and, if possible, in the private office of the judge or in a private room; the abstention from formalities, in any proceedings under the Act, including the trial and the disposition of the case, as circumstances may permit consistently with the due administration of justice; the manner in which a child adjudged to have committed a delinquency shall be dealt with, namely: not as an offender but as one in a condition of delinquency and therefore requiring help, guidance and proper supervision; a variety of exceptional courses of action,\u2014primarily meant to assist, help, encourage, supervise and reform the delinquent rather than to punish him,\u2014which, upon the child being adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent, may be taken by the judge in the light of the opinion he forms as to both the child\u2019s own good and the community\u2019s best interest; the prohibition, unless special leave is granted by the court, of publication of a report disclosing or likely to disclose the identity of a juvenile concerned under the Act; the protection of juveniles against persons contributing to their delinquency; the promotion of reformation of juveniles by the establishment, inter alia, of Juvenile Court Committees, the appointment of probation officers and definition of the latter\u2019s duties, namely: to assist the court, represent the interest of the child when the case is heard and, as the court may direct or require, make investigations, furnish assistance to the child and take charge of him before and after trial.\nConsistent with the declared purpose of the Act and obviously designed for its attainment, these operative provisions are still more illustrative of the true nature and character of this legislation. They are directed to juveniles who violate the law or indulge in sexual immorality or any other similar form of vice or who, by reason of any other act, are liable to be committed to an industrial school or a juvenile reformatory. They are meant,\u2014in the words of Parliament itself,\u2014to check their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better instincts. They are primarily prospective in nature. And in essence, they are intended to prevent these juveniles to become prospective criminals and to assist them to be law-abiding citizens. Such objectives are clearly within the judicially defined field of criminal law. For the effective pursuit of these objectives, Parliament found it expedient to protect these juveniles from the ill-effects of publicity, from the dangerous influences that promiscuity with criminals or association with crime engender, and deemed it necessary to create the offence of delinquency, an offence embracing, inter alia, all punishable breaches of the public law, whether defined by Parliament or the Legislatures, and to adopt, for the prosecution of this offence, an enforcement process specially adapted to the age and impressibility of juveniles and fundamentally different, in pattern and purpose, from the one governing in the case of adults. Beyond the point of law enforcement, the Act does not affect the legislation which may be enacted by Parliament or Provincial Legislatures in the exercise of their regulatory power. Briefly, and in scope, the Act deals with juvenile delinquency in its relation to crime and crime prevention, a human, social and living problem of public interest, in the constituent elements, alleviation and solution of which jurisdictional distinctions of constitutional order are obviously and genuinely deemed by Parliament, to be of no moment.\nIt matters not, in my respectful view, contrary to what was contended, on behalf of the Provincial Attorneys General, that there be a lack of uniformity in the application or operation of the Act, either:\u2014(i) ratione loci, in that ss. 42 and 43 substantially provide that the Act may be put into force, by proclamation, only in these territorial jurisdictions where the facilities for the due carrying out of its provisions are provided for, or (ii) ratione materiae, in that the proscribed conduct,\u2014the holding of which constitutes, under the Act, the offence of delinquency,\u2014may vary, throughout Canada, consequential to the lack of uniformity in provincial laws, by-laws and municipal ordinances, or (iii) ratione personae, in that the definition of a child, under s. 2(1)(a) may, as provided for by s. 2(2), be altered, from time to time, in any province, by proclamation of the Governor in Council. Desirable as uniformity may be in criminal law, it is not, per se, a dependable test of constitutionality as, indeed, is shown in the case of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 123, cf. ss. 3, 7 and 15, the Canada Temperance Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 196, cf. Part I, both judicially held intra vires, notwithstanding lack of uniformity. Lack of uniformity also appears in the Criminal Code of Canada, with respect to substantive law as well as to procedural matters, e.g., ss. 6, 7, 534, 541 and 552. In City of Fredericton v. The Queen[8], where the constitutionality of the Canada Temperance Act (1868) was in issue, Ritchie C.J., had this to say on the point, at p. 530:\nIt has likewise been urged that this Act affects only particular districts, that it is not general legislation, and therefore is ultra vires. I am entirely unable to appreciate this objection. If the subject matter dealt with comes within the classes of subjects assigned to the Parliament of Canada, I can find in the Act no restriction which prevents the Dominion Parliament from passing a law affecting one part of the Dominion and not another, if Parliament, in its wisdom, thinks the legislation applicable to and desirable in one part and not in the other. But this is a general law applicable to the whole Dominion, though it may not be brought into active operation throughout the whole Dominion.\nIn Gold Seal Limited and Dominion Express Company and A.-G. for the Province of Alberta[9], again, it was held, inter alia, that the Dominion Parliament can enact laws which may become operative only in certain provinces and also laws which may aid provincial legislation. Finally, in any respect in which it may be said that the Act lacks uniformity, I can find no indication suggesting that the above view, as to the true nature and character of the Act, should be varied. Nor am I able to accept, as being well-founded, the contention that, in pith and substance, the Act is legislation in relation to welfare and protection of children within the purview of the Adoption Act case supra. The true objects and purposes of the statutes considered in the latter case are quite different from the true object and purpose of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. They are, as pointed out by Bull J.A., directed to the control or alleviation of social conditions, the proper education and training of children, and the care and protection of people in distress including neglected children. Obviously, one can say that the Act gives a special kind of protection to misguided children and that it should incidentally operate to ultimately enhance their welfare. A similar view may also be taken of the following provisions of s. 157 of the Criminal Code of Canada; yet, no one has ever questioned that they were enactments in relation to criminal law.\n157. (1) Every one who, in the home of a child, participates in adultery or sexual immorality or indulges in habitual drunkenness or any other form of vice, and thereby endangers the morals of the child or renders the home an unfit place for the child to be in, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n(2) No proceedings for an offence under this section shall be commenced more than one year after the time when the offence was committed.\n(3) For the purpose of this section, child means a person who is or appears to be under the age of eighteen years.\n(4) No proceedings shall be commenced under subsection (1) without the consent of the Attorney General, unless they are instituted by or at the instance of a recognized society for the protection of children or by an officer of a juvenile court.\nA very wide discretion is given to the judge, under the Act, and it is significant that, in the exercise of such discretion, the interest of the child is not the sole question to consider. On the contrary, the matters which, in principle, must receive the attention of the judge and which he must try to conciliate are the child\u2019s interest or own good, the community\u2019s best interest and the proper administration of justice. This, I think, qualifies the nature of the protection which the Act is meant to give to juveniles alleged or found to be delinquents and supports the proposition that the Act is not legislation in relation to protection and welfare of children within the meaning envisaged in the Adoption Act case, supra. With deference to those who entertain a contrary view, I am clearly of opinion that, in its true nature and character, the Act, far from being legislation adopted under the guise of criminal law to encroach on subjects reserved to the provinces, is genuine legislation in relation to criminal law in its comprehensive sense.\nDealing with the second question:\u2014It was submitted that assuming the Act to be valid legislation in toto, it does not affect the right to proceed under the Summary Convictions Act, supra, against a child for a violation of the Motor-Vehicle Act, supra. Section 39 of the Act, it is said, shows that Parliament intended that the Act and the Motor-Vehicle Act should operate side by side and that the best interests of the child be the decisive factor as to the course to be elected in any particular case. Section 39 reads as follows:\n39. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as having the effect of repealing or over-riding any provision of any provincial statute intended for the protection or benefit of children; and when a juvenile delinquent who has not been guilty of an act which is, under the provisions of the Criminal Code an indictable offence, comes within the provisions of a provincial statute, it may be dealt with either under such Act or under this Act as may be deemed to be in the best interests of such child.\nThe French version of the section is in the following terms:\n39. Rien dans la pr\u00e9sente loi ne doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ayant l\u2019effet d\u2019abroger ou d\u2019annuler quelque disposition d\u2019un statut provincial en vue de la protection ou du bien des enfants; et lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9linquant, qui ne s\u2019est pas rendu coupable d\u2019une infraction constituant un acte criminel aux termes des dispositions du Code criminel, tombe sous les dispositions d\u2019un statut provincial, il peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9, soit en vertu de ce statut, soit en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi, selon que le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat de cet enfant l\u2019exige.\nThe key words in the single sentence of this section have been italicized.\nIn my view, this section has no application in this case, for the Motor-Vehicle Act, supra, is not a statute of the class of statutes to which s. 39 is directed, namely: statutes intended for the protection or benefit of children. It was not seriously contended that the Motor-Vehicle Act, supra, is a provincial statute of that class; such a contention is palpably untenable. What was urged is that, as a matter of construction, the words provincial statute and such Act or statut provincial and de ce statut, appearing in the latter part of the sentence, are not referable to the words provincial statute intended\u2026or statut provincial en vue de\u2026, appearing in the first part thereof, but to any provincial statute. In my opinion, the wording of the sentence does not permit this interpretation but just the opposite one and as such, shows that the will of Parliament is (i) to leave untouched the provisions of any provincial statute intended for the protection or benefit of children,\u2014such as, e.g., The Protection of Children Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 47,\u2014and (ii) to authorize that a child, coming within the provisions thereof, be dealt with either under the latter or under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, as his best interests may be deemed to be in any particular case. Construed as suggested on behalf of appellant, s. 39 would be in conflict with the provisions of the Act which give exclusive jurisdiction to the Juvenile Court in matters of delinquency and would completely defeat the whole purpose of the Act and render it futile.\nThe Act and the Motor-Vehicle Act, supra, cannot operate side by side, for their provisions clash at the level of law enforcement and to this extent, the latter statute is inoperative according to the rule that a legislation of Parliament which strictly relates to subjects of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91,\u2014as the Juvenile Delinquents Act is assumed to be for the purpose of the second question,\u2014is of paramount authority, even though it trenches upon matters assigned to the provincial legislatures by s. 92: A.-G. for Canada v. A.-G. for British Columbia.[10]\nWith deference to those who entertain a different view, I must conclude that the majority of the Court of Appeal rightly decided that the Juvenile Delinquents Act is intra vires of Parliament and that the case of respondent Smith should have been dealt with under the provisions of this Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal and make no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed; no order as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cumming, Bird & Richards, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.S.

The two companions were arrested as they came out of the house and were found to have house-breaking instruments. The two companions pleaded guilty to a charge of breaking and entering, and a second charge of possession of the instruments was withdrawn. The appellant was acquitted of the charge of breaking and entering and stealing on a directed verdict because the property stolen could not be identified as being the property of the owner of the house. However, he was convicted of possession of the instruments. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the questions of law as to whether, in the circumstances, s. 21(2) of the Code could support the appellant\u2019s conviction or was the prosecution obliged to rely on s. 3(4) of the Code as being exhaustive.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court of Appeal correctly rejected the submission that, since his confederates were not convicted of the offence of possession, the appellant could not be convicted of possession because the Crown could not appeal to s. 21(2) of the Code and was obliged to rely solely upon s. 3(4). Under s. 21(2), the appellant was a party to the commission of the offence of possession of house-breaking instruments. The fact that the charge was withdrawn against the two active principals did not affect the right of the Crown to proceed against the appellant. There is no requirement in s. 21(2) that the active participants must have been convicted of the offence. The question is whether the appellant committed the offence of possession. Furthermore, the acquittal on a directed verdict did not decide in his favour any issue in the possession charge that would be inconsistent with the finding on the evidence that the appellant had formed a common intention with two others to effect a breaking and to assist in its prosecution. It was open to the jury to find that the appellant knew or ought to have known that one of his confederates at least would of necessity be in possession of house-breaking instruments when the three men drove to the house.\nThe Court of Appeal was correct in maintaining that s. 21(2) of the Code may be applied where the facts warrant the inference that the accused ought to have known that the commission of the offence\u2014possession \u2014would be the probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose. The Crown was not limited to reliance on the provisions of s. 3(4) of the Code.\nDroit criminel\u2014Partie \u00e0 une infraction\u2014Possession d\u2019instruments d\u2019effraction\u2014Possession physique actuelle des complices de l\u2019accus\u00e9\u2014Accusation de possession contre les accus\u00e9s retir\u00e9e\u2014Effet vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019accus\u00e9\u2014L\u2019article 21(2) du Code Criminel peut-il supporter le verdict ou l\u2019art. 3(4) \u00e9puise-t-il les moyens contre l\u2019accus\u00e9\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 3(4), 21(2), 292(1)(b), 295(1).\nL\u2019appelant a conduit deux compagnons \u00e0 une maison et les a attendus pendant qu\u2019ils mettaient en ex\u00e9cution l\u2019intention commune admise de s\u2019introduire par effraction. Les deux compagnons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9hend\u00e9s alors qu\u2019ils sortaient de la maison et des instruments d\u2019effraction ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s sur eux. Les deux compagnons ont admis leur culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une accusation d\u2019effraction, et une seconde accusation de possession des instruments a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 de l\u2019accusation d\u2019effraction et d\u2019avoir vol\u00e9, sur les instructions du juge, parce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e ne pouvait pas \u00eatre identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire de la maison. Cependant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de possession des instruments d\u2019effraction. Le verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel. Il a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler devant cette Cour sur les questions de droit \u00e0 savoir si, dans les circonstances, l\u2019art. 21(2) du Code pouvait supporter le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 ou si la Couronne \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de s\u2019appuyer uniquement sur l\u2019art. 3(4) du Code.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel a rejet\u00e9 avec raison la pr\u00e9tention que, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 contre ses complices sur l\u2019accusation de possession, l\u2019appelant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 coupable de possession parce que la Couronne ne pouvait pas faire appel \u00e0 l\u2019art. 21(2) du Code et \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de s\u2019appuyer uniquement sur l\u2019art. 3(4). Sous l\u2019art. 21(2), l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait une partie \u00e0 l\u2019infraction de possession d\u2019instruments d\u2019effraction. Le fait que l\u2019accusation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e contre les deux parties principales n\u2019affectait pas le droit de la Couronne de proc\u00e9der contre l\u2019appelant. L\u2019article 21(2) n\u2019exige nullement que les parties principales doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9es coupables de l\u2019offense. La question est de savoir si l\u2019appelant a commis l\u2019offense de possession. Bien plus, l\u2019acquittement, en raison des instructions du juge, n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de d\u00e9cider en sa faveur aucune question sur l\u2019accusation de possession qui pourrait \u00eatre incompatible avec la conclusion bas\u00e9e sur la preuve que l\u2019appelant avait form\u00e9 une intention commune avec les deux autres pour s\u2019introduire par effraction et pour aider \u00e0 la mise en vigueur de cette intention. Le jury pouvait trouver que l\u2019appelant savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019au moins un de ses complices aurait n\u00e9cessairement en sa possession des instruments d\u2019effraction lorsque les trois hommes se sont dirig\u00e9s vers la maison.\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel a eu raison de soutenir que l\u2019art. 21(2) du Code peut trouver son application lorsque les faits justifient une inf\u00e9rence que l\u2019accus\u00e9 devait savoir que la commission de l\u2019offense\u2014possession\u2014serait la cons\u00e9quence probable de la mise en ex\u00e9cution du but commun. La Couronne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas limit\u00e9e aux seules dispositions de l\u2019art. 3(4) du Code.

This Court granted leave to appeal on two questions of law:\n(a) whether the provisions of section 21(2) can support the conviction of the appellant when there was no conviction of his confederates for the very offence and no conviction of the accused for breaking and entering and\n(b) even if these circumstances do not affect the application of section 21(2) can that provision, in any event, be invoked for a possession offence or is the prosecution obliged to rely on section 3(4) as being exhaustive for that purpose.\nThe facts are that on December 20, 1963, the appellant drove a car to 780 Spadina Road, Toronto. He had with him two passengers, Bailey and Hudson. Bailey and Hudson left the car, entered a house at 780 Spadina Road by forcing the back door with a screwdriver. The police arrested them as they came out of the back door and found a screwdriver and a flashlight on one of the men.\nZanini was waiting for the men with the engine of the car running. He denied knowledge of the two other men. The car belonged to one of these men, and the police a week or ten days before had observed the three men driving in the vicinity of the house and observing the house.\nAll three were charged under s. 292(1) (b) with breaking and entering and stealing four fifty\u2011cent pieces, the property of the owner of the house, one Dr. Arnold Iscove, and they were also charged under s. 295(1) with possession of housebreaking instruments. Bailey and Hudson pleaded guilty to the charge of breaking and entering. The charge against them of possession was withdrawn.\nZanini pleaded not guilty to both charges. He was acquitted of the charge of breaking and entering and stealing on a directed verdict, since the four fifty-cent coins could not be identified as being the property of Dr. Iscove.\nOn the charge of possession of housebreaking instruments, he was found guilty. The learned trial judge instructed the jury that if they found that the appellant had formed a common intention with the other two men to effect an unlawful purpose, that is to say, break into the house, then they could find that he knew or ought to have known that as a result of such common intention he knew or ought to have known that the other men were in possession of instruments of housebreaking and therefore under s. 21 of the Criminal Code, the jury could find that the appellant was in possession of a screwdriver found on one of the men who entered the house.\nZanini now submits that, since his confederates were not convicted of the offence of possession, he could not be convicted of possession because the Crown could not appeal to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code and was obliged to rely solely upon s. 3(4). Section 21(2) reads:\nWhere two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.\nSection 3(4) reads:\nFor the purposes of this Act,\n(a) a person has anything in possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly\n(i) has it in the actual possession or custody of another person, or\n(ii) has it in any place, whether or not that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of another person; and\n(b) where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.\nThe Court of Appeal correctly rejected this submission. Under s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, Zanini was a party to the commission of the offence of possession of housebreaking instruments. The judge\u2019s instruction to the jury given pursuant to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code was correct. The fact that the charge was withdrawn against the two active principals does not affect the right of the Crown to proceed against this accused. There is no requirement in s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code that the active participant or participants must have been convicted of the offence. The question is whether Zanini committed the offence, i.e. the possession of instruments for housebreaking. It cannot be disputed that one of the two confederates was in fact in possession of instruments for housebreaking. In addition, it was established (and all the facts were agreed upon for the purpose of this appeal and in the Court of Appeal) that the appellant had formed an intention in common with the other two men to break and enter and assist each other for this purpose. There is no principle of law that unless there is a conviction of the confederates for the possession offence, the appellant cannot be convicted for that offence.\nOn the second question of law on which leave to appeal was given, in my opinion the Court of Appeal was correct in maintaining that s. 21(2) of the Code may be applied where the facts warrant the inference that the accused ought to have known that the commission of the offence, i.e., possession of housebreaking instruments would be the probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose. The Crown is not limited to reliance on the provisions of s. 3(4) of the Code above quoted. The very point was decided by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Rex v. Harris[2]. The Ontario Court of Appeal in this case followed the reasoning of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, correctly in my opinion.\nI now return to the second branch of the first point of law that s. 21(2) cannot support the conviction for the possession offence when there was no conviction of the appellant for breaking and entering. I have already said that the acquittal on the charge of breaking and entering and stealing four 50-cent pieces, the property of Arnold Iscove, was the result of a directed verdict because the owner of the premises entered could not identify the coins.\nThis acquittal does not decide in favour of the accused any issue in the possession charge that would be inconsist- ent with the finding on the evidence that the accused had formed a common intention with two others to effect a break-in and to assist in its prosecution. The accused cannot assert that the effect of the acquittal on this directed verdict is equivalent to a determination in his favour that he was not there or that he had no connection with the two active participants and nothing less than this would assist him.\nNotwithstanding the directed acquittal on breaking and entering, it is clear on the evidence and the admissions that the accused had formed an intention in common with the other two men to break and enter the house. The possession of housebreaking instruments was a probable consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose. The screwdriver was in fact used to break in by the back door. It was open to the jury to find that the accused knew or ought to have known that one of his confederates at least would of necessity be in possession of housebreaking instruments when the three men drove to the house. There is no \u201cissue estoppel\u201d here on any of these points.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S. Hogg, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1][1966] 1 O.R. 499, 47 C.R. 195, 2 C.C.C. 185.\n[2](1953), 105 C.C.C. 301.\n",

Henwood (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Prudential Insurance Company of America (Defendant) Respondent.\n1967: June 20; 1967: October 3.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInsurance\u2014Life\u2014Disclosure\u2014Application for insurance requiring insured to answer certain questions\u2014Untrue statements respecting medical consultations for nervous condition\u2014Whether concealment \u201cmaterial to the insurance\u201d within meaning of s. 149(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190 [rep. & subs. 1961-62, c. 63, s. 4]. The plaintiff as beneficiary under a policy of insurance issued by the defendant company to her daughter sued the defendant following the death of the insured in an automobile accident. The sole defence was that certain answers by the insured in the application for insurance were not true and constituted material misrepresentations or non-disclosures which induced the defendant to issue the policy. The application form included questions as to whether the insured had ever been treated by a physician for nervous disorders, or had any known indication thereof; whether she had been in hospital, and whether she had in the past five years ever consulted or been attended or examined by any physician or other practitioner. Although the insured had undergone an emotional disturbance which lasted for more than a year and had only cleared up a few months before the application was made, this condition was not mentioned in any way in the application.\nThe trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action after coming to the conclusion that the insured did consult some physicians and psychiatrists for some illness and complaints and that she failed to disclose those facts and that such information was material to the defendant in considering the application for insurance. An appeal from the trial judgment having been dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff appealed further to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: A misrepresentation is not necessarily \u201cmaterial to the insurance\u201d simply because it has been elicited in answer to a question devised by the insurance company but where, as in the present case, senior officials of the company testify that untrue answers given by the insured would have affected the rate and the risk, there is evidence that these answers bore a direct relation to the acceptance of the risk by the insurer.\nIf the matters here concealed had been truly disclosed they would undoubtedly have influenced the defendant company in stipulating for a higher premium and there was no evidence to suggest that this was unreasonable or that other insurance companies would have followed a different course. Accordingly, on the evidence before the Court, it had been shown affirmatively that untrue answers respecting the medical advisers consulted were material to the risk. This was enough to avoid the policy.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The defendant failed to discharge the onus of establishing misrepresentation and its materiality. The insurer chose to discharge that onus by calling certain physicians consulted by the deceased and a nurse and then by calling two officials who were its servants. The evidence given by these officials, who not only testified as to the policy of their own company but testified that they had no knowledge of the policies of other insurers, could not be accepted as a discharge of the onus upon the insurer to prove that if the facts had been truly represented they would have caused a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or required a higher premium. If it were accepted that the defendant in reciting its policy automatically recited the policy of a reasonable insurer, then any idiosyncracy of an individual company expressed in its policy would bind the Court to hold that non-disclosure of facts which were not in accordance with that idiosyncracy was automatically material.

Leven, [1940] S.C. 407, distinguished.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Landreville J. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nSanford World, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDouglas K. Laidlaw, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Spence and it is with regret that I find myself unable to agree with him.\nAt the time when application was made for the life insurance policy here in question, the insured, in respect of whose death the present claim is made against the respondent, appears to have been a frail young woman who was 21 years old, weighed only 102 pounds, and had, two years previously, undergone an emotional crisis caused by the breaking off of her engagement due to religious differences with her fiance. The nervous condition brought about by her unhappy love affair had resulted in consultation with the family doctor and later with psychiatrists, as a result of which various medications were prescribed. Her last visit to Dr. Murray, a psychiatrist at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, appears to have been in June, 1962, and her mother testified that during that summer her daughter\u2019s health had not improved. She does not appear to have returned to a normal condition until September, 1962, when her mother was hospitalized for three months and she took over the household duties. By February, 1963, she was well enough to go back to a job in which she was employed at the time when she made the application for insurance.\nThe application for insurance required the insured to answer a number of intimate questions concerning her health. There were eighteen questions which included a query as to whether the insured had ever been treated by a physician for nervous disorders, or had any known indica- tion thereof; whether she had been in hospital; whether she had in the past five years ever consulted or been attended or examined by any physician or other practitioner. Notwithstanding the probing nature of these questions, the answers given by the insured gave no indication whatever of her having had any medical or nervous troubles except for an X-ray of her right foot which was treated by the family physician and a check-up by an unknown doctor as a result of an automobile accident. The emotional disturbance, which had lasted for more than a year and had only cleared up a few months before the application was made, was not mentioned in any way in the application form signed by the insured which forms a part of the contract of insurance itself by virtue of the general provisions of the policy entitled \u201cContract\u201d which read as follows:\nThis policy is issued in consideration of the application herefor and of the payment of premiums as provided herein. The policy, together with the application, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof at issue, constitutes the entire contract. All statements made in the application will in the absence of fraud be deemed representations and not warranties, and no statement will avoid the policy or be used as a defense to a claim hereunder unless it is contained in the application.\nThis section of the contract must be read in light of the provisions of s. 149(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, as amended by 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 63, s. 4, which reads:\n149.(1) An applicant for insurance and a person whose life is to be insured shall each disclose to the insurer in the application, on a medical examination, if any, and in any written statements or answers furnished as evidence of insurability, every fact within his knowledge that is material to the insurance and is not so disclosed by the other.\nThe unfortunate insured was killed in a motor vehicle accident on May 17, 1964, and it is not disputed that the answers which she made in the application for insurance had no bearing whatever on the circumstances of her death.\nThe learned trial judge, after reviewing the evidence in a manner most favourable to the appellant, was nevertheless unable to disregard the fact that the insured had consulted physicians and psychiatrists and had failed to disclose these facts. On these grounds he concluded his judgment with the following findings of fact which governed the disposition of the action and which were tacitly approved by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed an appeal from his judgment without giving written reasons. The learned judge said:\nOn the evidence before me, I can come to no other conclusion but that (a) the insured did consult some physicians and psychiatrist for some illness and complaints; (b) she failed to disclose these facts for reasons unknown to me.\nThe defence alleges the untrue answers to have been material to the risk. It affirms it, and I have before me no evidence to contradict same. In the light of the decisions which have been quoted to me and which I have read, I must find in favor of the defendant.\nHad the plaintiff produced medical testimony to support the inference that the sickness was not a nervous or mental disorder; had it produced some expert evidence by some known underwriter disagreeing with the opinion of the defence of materiality of the answers, the decision might have been otherwise. I would hope to be found wrong in this decision.\nI agree that untrue statements were undoubtedly made by the insured with respect to the medical advisers whom she had consulted about her nervous condition and it appears to me that the only question remaining to be determined on this appeal is whether, in making these statements, the insured was concealing from the appellant a fact or facts within her knowledge \u201cmaterial to the insurance\u201d within the meaning of s. 149(1) of The Insurance Act, supra.\nThere is, in my view, no doubt that the question of materiality is one of fact and, as the learned trial judge has pointed out, no evidence was called on behalf of the appellant to contradict the categorical statement made by the respondent\u2019s own doctor to the effect that if true information had been available to the respondent, the premium rate for the policy would have been a very high one.\nDr. Roadhouse gave the following evidence in this connection:\nMR. LAIDLAW: NOW, Doctor Roadhouse, I observe to you as a fact that this application form contained none of this information. That is just a statement of fact. My question is this: If you had had the information that I have now summarized for you, what action, if any, would have been taken by you in your capacity as Associate Medical Director in accepting or rejecting this application?\nA. We would have required a medical examination. We would have required statements from the doctors who had attended her in the past. Had we obtained the history that is now apparent, we would have issued the policy at a very high rate. It is also apparent from Dr. Roadhouse\u2019s evidence that if he had had access to the information which would have been made available if the insured had answered the questions truthfully, the policy would not have contained any accidental death benefit provision or any provisions for non-occupational vehicle accident.\nIt is true that Dr. Roadhouse was employed by the respondent company and that his statements regarding the materiality of the untrue answers made by the insured are based in great measure upon his experience with that company, but I do not think that his evidence can be disregarded on this account or that his qualifications as a medical graduate of the University of Toronto are to be ignored on account of his having been the Associate Medical Director of the respondent insurance company for more than eleven years. As has been indicated, his evidence was totally uncontradicted.\nThe evidence of Dr. Roadhouse is in striking contrast to that given by Dr. McCullough, the insurance company doctor who testified in the case of Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York v. Ontario Metal Products Company, Ltd.[1] (hereinafter referred to as the Mutual Life case). In the latter case the insurance company relied on the defence of misrepresentation in exactly the same way as the respondent does in this case. As I have indicated, the striking difference between the two cases lies in the evidence of the company doctor. This is apparent from what is said by Lord Salvesen at p. 352 of the report of the proceedings of the Privy Council where the circumstances are described as follows:\n...the evidence which has impressed their Lordships most is that of Dr. McCullough\u2014a witness adduced by the appellants and who, as their medical examiner in Toronto, was the person by whom they would naturally be guided in accepting or declining the risk. Now Dr. McCullough states that if Dr. Fierheller\u2019s name had been mentioned, he would have noted it in the answer to question 18, but he also emphatically states that if he had known at the time all that Dr. Fierheller deposed to in evidence, he would still have sent up the case with a recommendation for acceptance. In other words, having, as the result of his own examination, passed Mr. Schuch [the insured] as a healthy man, his opinion would not have been altered by his prior medical history as now ascertained in great detail.\nAs the Mutual Life case is relied on by the appellant, it appears to me to be desirable to stress the distinction that exists between the facts there disclosed and the facts in the present case. In the Mutual Life case, Lord Salvesen had occasion to say, at p. 350:\nThe main difference of judicial opinion centres round the question what is the test of materiality? Mignault J. thought that the test is not what the insurers would have done but for the misrepresentation or concealment, but \u2018what any reasonable man would have considered material to tell them when the questions were put to the insured\u2019. Their Lordships are unable to assent to this definition. It is the insurers who propound the questions stated in the application form, and the materiality or otherwise of a misrepresentation or concealment must be considered in relation to their acceptance of the risk.\nIt must, of course, be recognized that a misrepresentation is not necessarily \u201cmaterial to the insurance\u201d simply because it has been elicited in answer to a question devised by the insurance company but in a case where senior officials of the company testify that untrue answers given by an insured would have affected the rate and the risk, there is, in my opinion, evidence that these answers bore a direct relation to the acceptance of the risk by the insurer. The question that remains to be determined is whether, in treating the untrue answers as material, the respondent was acting as a reasonable insurer, and whether it has sufficiently discharged the burden of proving that its actions were those of such an insurer by calling its own officials to prove the company\u2019s practice.\nLike the learned trial judge, I cannot escape from the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that any reasonable insurance company would have taken a different attitude, and I am also impressed by the fact that Dr. Roadhouse spoke as a medical doctor who had had 11\u00bd years\u2019 experience in the specialized field of underwriting in his capacity as medical director of the respondent company.\nAlthough the evidence of expert witnesses as to whether or not other insurance companies consider a question to be \u201cmaterial\u201d, is admissible and may be relevant in such a case as this, I do not think that when no evidence whatever has been adduced to suggest that the respondent\u2019s practice is anything but reasonable, it is seized with the burden of proving the practice of other insurers.\nMy brother Spence has cited an excerpt from Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 22, at p. 188, para. 360, in which the learned authors, speaking of materiality of representations in insurance policies, say:\n...that the test hinges on whether the representation is of such a nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer, not on whether the representation influenced the particular insurer looking at the proposal.\nI think it desirable to point out that the authority relied on by the authors for this proposition is Zurich General Accident and Liability Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Leven[2]. That was a Scottish case which was concerned with a motor vehicle liability policy in which the insured had failed to disclose a six-year-old conviction under the Road Traffic Act and evidence was called to show that the majority of insurance companies did not regard a conviction which was \u201cmore than five years old\u201d as being material to the insurance. In the course of his judgment, the Lord Ordinary observed:\nThe insurance companies which call for information as to convictions without any limit of time are in a small minority, but it may be that experience will prove that they alone are prudent insurers, certainly as regards convictions that are less than seven years old. In any event, it is evident from their practice in the matter, standing in contrast as it does with the well-known time-limited practice of most companies, that they regard the \u2018particular\u2019 as to convictions, no matter how old, as \u2018material\u2019.\nIn the Court of Appeal Lord Moncrieff stated the matter thus:\nIt seems to me that the question of what is prudent for an insurer to do must depend less upon the practice of others as to the risks they underwrite than upon the individual practice which he finds, according to the scale of his charges and his experience of insurance, to be that upon which it is profitable for himself to do business.\nIn the present case it is not necessary to adopt the language of Lord Moncrieff because, as I have indicated, there was no evidence here as to the practice of the other insurance companies. The determination of this appeal is to be governed by what was said by Lord Salvesen in the Mutual Life case at pp. 351-2 where he said:\n...it is a question of fact in each case whether, if the matters concealed or misrepresented had been truly disclosed, they would, on a fair consideration of the evidence, have influenced a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium.\nIf the matters here concealed had been truly disclosed they would undoubtedly have influenced the respondent company in stipulating for a higher premium and as there is no evidence to suggest that this was unreasonable or that other insurance companies would have followed a different course, I am satisfied that, on the evidence before us, it has been shown affirmatively that untrue answers respecting the medical advisers consulted by the insured were material to the risk. This is enough to avoid the policy.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which by its judgment pronounced on April 14, 1966, dismissed without written reasons an appeal from the judgment of Landreville J. pronounced on November 5, 1965.\nThe appellant was the named beneficiary under a life insurance policy issued by the respondent to the daughter of the appellant Margaret M. Henwood. The insured was born on May 1, 1943. The policy was issued on March 18, 1963, i.e., when the insured was only 19 years of age. The insured died on May 17, 1964, as a result of an automobile accident in which she, the passenger, and another person, the driver, were both killed.\nIt was admitted at trial and repeated in argument in. this Court, that the cause of death had no relation whatsoever to any of the allegations as to misrepresentation, upon which allegations the defence of the insurance company rested. Under the provisions of s. 149(2) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, as amended by 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 63, s. 4, a failure to disclose or a misrepresentation renders the contract voidable by the insurer and, therefore, the lack of any relationship between the said failure to disclose or misrepresentation, and the cause of death is irrelevant, except, that, in my view, that circumstance certainly does not lessen the onus upon the insurer, with which I shall deal hereafter. Some of the facts are relevant.\nThe late Miss Henwood had left high school in January 1960 and took employment as a clerk in the office of a Toronto newspaper. She had been a practising Roman Catholic and very devout in her religious beliefs. In that year, she met a young man whose faith was that of a Jehovah Witness. Their relationship deepened and the late Miss Henwood very seriously considered marriage to this young man but she was concerned with their varying religious faiths. Moreover, her parents objected most strenuously to the idea of marriage. There is no doubt that this personal problem and also the vague antipathy between the late Margaret Henwood and her father caused the insured a certain degree of emotional strain. It must be remembered that at this time she was a mere girl of 16 or 17 years of age. She became so worried that she stopped working feeling she could no longer face people and she even was reluctant to ride in street cars. Some of the facts showed, again in an indefinite fashion, that the insured suffered a certain amount of stomach distress, perhaps some difficulty in getting to sleep and some other vague complaints which, in my personal view, were of a very minor nature. It would appear from the evidence that this condition, and particularly the reason for it, that of the strain between religious beliefs and her romantic desires, concerned the plaintiff, her mother so that she arranged for an examination by the family physician, Dr. A. Valadka.\nApart from other unrelated complaints such as sprained ankle, etc., Dr. Valadka saw the insured on October 25, 1960, and on infrequent occasions until December 6, 1961. On the first of these occasions, the insured\u2019s complaint was as to an allergic dermatitis, which certainly could have no relationship to the misrepresentation alleged, but on March 27, 1961, the insured was complaining of tiredness, and Dr. Valadka advised her to rest and to improve her diet habits, feeling that she was underweight. On April 24, 1961, he again saw her when she complained of tiredness and general exhaustion. He had blood tests performed at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Toronto which showed only that her hemoglobin count was a little below normal and he prescribed a form of iron pills described as \u201cPalaron\u201d and also prescribed a parstelin tablet twice a day \u201cfor her depressed condition\u201d. Dr. Valadka saw her next on May 13, 1961, but then he did not see her until December 9, 1961, when her weight had increased a few pounds to 107 but she still complained of being tired. At this time, Dr. Valadka said that he advised her to take up some sports such as swimming and to start to work. That is the last time he saw her or even heard of her until he was subsequently informed of her death. Dr. Valadka\u2019s summary in cross-examination and to the learned trial judge was as follows:\nQ. Doctor, there is no doubt in your mind that she had no suicidal tendencies of any sort? A. No, not at all. I never had even an impression of that.\nQ. Would it be fair to say that it would be virtually impossible to\u2014impossible to accidentally take a fatal overdose of whatever you prescribed for her?\nHis LORDSHIP: Iron pills?\nMR. WORLD: Well, she had parstelin, your lordship.\nA. Only twenty-four tablets for a short period of time, no.\nHis LORDSHIP: How would you describe her condition generally, though? Was she a very sick girl?\nA. No, I had the impression she\u2019s like the normal average, teen-age girl at that age when they usually start to have some problems, discussions at home, arguments with parents, or especially father due to some disagreement about the dates and things like that, but nothing unusual.\nQ. Did you ever hear about her boy friend? A. She mentioned having a boy friend, and she mentioned of difficulty getting permission for dating boy friend.\nQ. Is it unusual for a girl of that age, at that time, to be low in hemoglobin and nervous, is that an unusual condition? A. At that age, it\u2019s quite frequent that girls are a little bit anemic, especially if they put themselves on certain diets\u2014if they start diet for some reason.\nQ. She had gained three pounds, you say? A. She went from 104 in March to 107 in December; December, 1961.\nI stress that this is the opinion of the general practitioner who was the family physician.\nDissatisfied with her daughter\u2019s condition, the plaintiff arranged that she should see a Dr. Blake, a psychiatrist. She saw Dr. Blake only on three occasions and discontinued the attendances because she was unable to meet the financial demands of such a course. Dr. Blake died subsequently and therefore we have no information as to what occurred on those three attendances. Again, the plaintiff arranged that her daughter, the insured, should see a person whom she chose as a Roman Catholic psychiatrist, and was recommended to a Dr. Cyril V. Murray, in the outpatients\u2019 clinic at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, in Toronto. She attended Dr. Murray in April 1962 and in accordance with the practice in the clinic she was interviewed by Dr. James L. Mclntyre, who took a history, and by a public health nurse, Miss Dorothy M. Carr. There is little to be gained by reciting the evidence of either Dr. Mclntyre or Miss Carr as it is chiefly a repetition of that set out above. Dr. Murray\u2019s consultations with the insured covered only the three months from April 1962 to June 28, 1962. Again, he repeats the two sources of emotional strain which worked upon the insured and, to the learned trial judge\u2019s question, \u201cThe main cause being what?\u201d, he replied:\nA. Well, my feeling was that the main cause was the conflict over her boy friend, and it was during this period that she first began to seek help for the condition as outlined.\nQ. There was no organic, of course, sickness or disease?\nA. Nothing organic, no, sir, no.\nCross-examined by counsel for the appellant, Dr. Murray gave his opinion definitely that there was no suicidal tendency and that the medication which he prescribed for her by name \u201cMellaril\u201d, a tranquilizer, could not be accidentally taken in a fatal overdose. He diagnosed the condition as a temporary one and to the learned trial judge\u2019s question:\nQ. I just haven\u2019t got a correct picture of how that girl was at that time. Would you describe\u2014how would you describe her condition, as a slight condition of depression or anxiety, or would you describe it as medium, or grave?\nhe replied:\nA. I would describe it as medium or moderate.\nDr. Mclntyre had given his tentative diagnosis as \u201cendogenous depression\u201d and added he could find no organic cause in examination. Blakiston\u2019s New Gould Medical Dictionary defines \u201cendogenous\u201d as being produced within; due to internal causes, but particularly in psychology, arising from within the body and directly affecting the nervous system, as a hereditary or constitutional disorder. There was no evidence whatever of any hereditary tendency to mental disorder.\nAs I have said, the insured did not see Dr. Murray after June 1962. The appellant, the insured\u2019s mother, swore that the reason for this was that the insured felt that she was not getting anywhere, that her problem with the young man was not solved, and \u201cshe felt she wanted to get a job\u201d. On September 10, 1962, the appellant herself became a patient at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital and underwent a very serious surgical operation. The appellant was discharged from the hospital on December 8, 1962. During the time the appellant was hospitalized and for a considerable time thereafter, the insured carried on all the housework. The appellant testified that that included arising at 6:30 a.m., preparing breakfast for the appellant\u2019s husband and for her sons, and two boarders, and preparing seven lunches for them to take out. She did all the cooking, all the laundry, and the management of the financial end of paying the bills and the appellant added, \u201cshe did a very fine job\u201d. The appellant was able to gradually take over from her daughter after she was released from the hospital so that in February 1963 the insured was free to take a position and did so with a hardware company in Toronto where she was a bookkeeper and where she continued to be employed until the date of her death.\nOne William Clark, an agent for the respondent insurance company, had issued certain policies in connection with the appellant\u2019s family and called at the house on frequent occasions to collect premiums. On March 18, 1963, i.e., one month after her return to employment, he took from the insured an application for the policy in question. It is as to questions 5a, 7b, 9a, 11 and 17 that the respondent complains as to failure to disclose and misrepresentation. Those questions and answers are as follows:\n5a. How much has your weight changed in the past year?\nNone Gain Loss\nx\n..... ...lbs. ...lbs.\n7. Have you ever been treated by any physician or other practitioner for or had any known indication of:\n. . .\nb. nervous or mental disorder, paralysis, or severe or frequent headaches?\nYes No\nx\n..... .....\n9. Have you ever:\na. been in any hospital, sanitarium, or other institution for observation, rest, diagnosis, treatment, or any operation?\nYes No\nx\n..... .....\n11. Other than as disclosed in the answers to Questions 7 through 10, have you, within the past 5 years, ever consulted or been attended by or been examined or had a check\u2011up by any physician or other practitioner?\nYes No\nx\n..... ..... 17. What are the full particulars with respect to each and every part of Questions 6 through 16 to which the answer is \u201cYes\u201d?\nQuestion No.\nCondition and Names and Complications, or Other Reason (If operated, so state)\nOnset Mo. Yr.\nHow long disabled\nFull recovery Mo. Yr.\nName and Addresses of Physicians and Hospitals\nlc x-ray\nfoot (right, sprain)\n7-60\n1 month\n8-60\nDr. Valadka, Bloor St. W.\n11\nCheck-up\u2014result of car accident\u2014x-ray taken\n12-60\nResult-ok.\nDr. Unknown St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital\nThe learned trial judge disposed of 5a, the question as to change of weight in the past year, by pointing out that every human being varies in weight in any year and that the variation in the weight of the insured was of only a few pounds and therefore was negligible.\nQuestion 9a\u2014\u201cHave you ever been in any hospital, sanitarium, or other institution for observation, rest, diagnosis, treatment, or any operation?\u201d was answered in the negative. As the learned trial judge points out, the insured never was a patient in bed in a hospital although she did go to the out-patient department for her consultation with Dr. Murray.\nSince Anderson v. Fitzgerald[3], the doctrine of contra proferentem has been well established in reference to the terms of an application for insurance. The words in an application should be construed in their ordinary and usual fashion, and certainly any person reading section 9a would never believe that it applied to a visit to an out-patient department of a hospital and would certainly be of the opinion that he was being asked whether he had ever been confined in bed in a hospital as a patient. I am unable to find in the insured\u2019s answer to question 9a non-disclosure or misrepresentation upon which the respondent can rely.\nQuestions 7b, and 17, the answers to which give the detail as to which question 11 asked only an affirmative or negative answer, must be the subject of more particular consideration.\nSection 7b asks whether the insured had ever been treated by any physician or other practitioner or had any known indication of \u201cnervous or mental disorder, paralysis, or severe or frequent headaches\u201d. There was no evidence whatsoever of paralysis or severe or frequent headaches, so the alleged non-disclosure or misrepresentation is reduced to the words \u201cnervous or mental disorder\u201d. Again, the question must be interpreted as the words are understood in the ordinary use of the English language and, in my view, \u201cnervous or mental disorder\u201d means a mental illness and may well be a euphonious designation of insanity. The respondent had called as its witness the psychiatrist whom the insured consulted. The respondent was dealing with question 7 and its answer, yet counsel for the respondent never asked and may indeed be said to have refrained from asking whether there was any \u201cnervous or mental disorder\u201d. Indeed on examination-in-chief by counsel for the respondent, Dr. Murray was not asked to give any diagnosis and his only approach to a diagnosis was an answer to a question by the learned trial judge who asked whether Dr. Murray would describe the insured\u2019s condition as a \u201c...slight condition of depression or anxiety or would he describe it as medium or grave\u201d, to which Dr. Murray replied he would describe it as medium or grave. It is to be noted that the word \u201cdepression\u201d was used by the learned trial judge and I am of the opinion it was not used in a technical\u2011medical sense. Dr. Murray also stated in the answer to His Lordship\u2019s question that if things were better with her boy friend she would have recovered rapidly.\nDr. Mclntyre who was not a psychiatrist, and in fact who had graduated only in 1959, the trial taking place in October 1965, gave as I have said a tentative diagnosis of \u201cendogenous\u201d depression. Blackiston, op. cit., describes \u201cdepression\u201d in psycho-pathology as\nA mental state of dejection usually associated with manic depressive psychosis. Mild depression with anxiety and hypochondria is frequently seen in youth of both sexes and often occurs whenever the adult sex problem becomes acute, as after engagement or marriage. Depression may also occur as a result of an external situation, being relieved when the external situation is removed.\nNeither Dr. Murray nor Dr. Mclntyre ever used the words \u201cneurosis\u201d or \u201cpsychosis\u201d in their evidence. It is true that Dr. Roadhouse used the former word and I shall deal with his evidence hereafter.\nQuestion No. 17 asked the full particulars in respect of each and other information; questions 6 through 16 to which the answer was in the affirmative, therefore, required the insured to give the detail in reference to question 11 and which she had answered in the affirmative. In answer to question 17 the insured was required to recite any consultation, attendance or examination by any physician or other practitioner within the last five years. The insured gave the name of Dr. Valadka, to whom I have referred above, as to an x-ray of the right ankle for a sprain, and a check-up\u2014the result of a car accident when x-rays were taken\u2014the said check-up taking place at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and the name of the doctor not being known to the insured. In the five years previous to the date of the application, i.e., March 18, 1963, the insured had consulted Dr. Valadka, Dr. Blake, Dr. Mclntyre and Dr. Murray, as I have outlined above. There is, therefore, in the insured\u2019s answer to question 17 at least non-disclosure. The insured signed the declaration immediately following question 17 which read, in part, \u201cI hereby declare that all the statements and answers to the above questions are complete and true and include full particulars...\u201d\nThe respondent has not alleged that there was any fraud on the part of the insurer and has repeated that disclaimer in argument before this Court. Therefore, to effect the avoidance of the policy the non-disclosure or misrepresentation not only must be established but its materiality must be established. The onus of establishing misrepresentation and its materiality is upon the insurer: Joel v. Law Union and Crown Insurance Company[4]; Ontario Metal Products Company v. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York[5], affirmed on appeal by the Judicial Committee sub nom. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York v. Ontario Metal Products Company, Ltd.[6]\nThe insurer in the present case chose to attempt to discharge that onus by calling the physicians and the nurse to whom I have referred above, and then by calling two officials who were its servants\u2014Dr. Robert Roadhouse and Miss Alice Degnan. Dr. Roadhouse was the associate medical director of the respondent. He had graduated from the University of Toronto in the year 1950 and he testified that for the 11 years previous he had occupied the aforesaid position, i.e., since May 1953. If one adds to the year 1950 the inevitable one or two years internship which medical doctors are always required to undergo, it would seem that Dr. Roadhouse\u2019s reference to being in the practice of medicine for \u201ca short time\u201d is by no means an exaggeration. Dr. Roadhouse had listened to the evidence throughout the trial prior to the time when he was called and that evidence was summarized for him by counsel for the respondent. He testified that he would have classified the insured\u2019s condition as \u201csevere neurosis\u201d as it fell within the definition of such an illness in the rating manual used by the respondent company, i.e., consisted of episodes of more than three months\u2019 disability or requiring shock treatments. In the first place, there is no remote suggestion that shock treatment was ever considered by any physician as being required for or beneficial to the insured. As I have said, the word \u201cneurosis\u201d was never used by any medical witness prior to its use by Dr. Roadhouse and he seems to have felt himself entitled to use that designation because of the attendance on two psychiatrists \u201cplus treatment with a specific anti-depressant which was parstelin\u201d. Dr. Roadhouse testified and Miss Degnan, an underwriting consultant, confirmed that had such a situation been revealed to the respondent then the insured would have been required to have a medical examination, she would have been required to produce statements from the attending physicians, and she would have been rated as \u201cspecial class 3\u201d at least. Moreover, no accidental death benefit would have been issued. Dr. Roadhouse\u2019s cross-examination was revealing. He testified that for the purposes of medical underwriting the respondent regarded severe episodes of neurosis as involving more than three months\u2019 disability and that disability was \u201cillness requiring an individual to either resign their job or inability to carry on in the job\u201d.\nOn the evidence, the insured had ceased her employment in the newspaper office in August 1961. It was not established that she was forced by her condition to resign or advised either by a physician or anyone else that she should do so but merely that she felt with her frequent absences from work \u201cit had to be all or nothing\u201d. As I have pointed out, Dr. Valadka testified that on December 6, 1961, he advised the insured to start work. The insured had expressed the desire to work in June 1962 when she ceased to see Dr. Murray and she commenced strenuous work in September 1962 when the appellant, her mother, was hospitalized. On this evidence, I am of the opinion that the respondent had not discharged the onus of showing that even under the respondent company\u2019s policy the insured had suffered such severe neurosis as would characterize her failure to completely answer question 17 as a material non-disclosure. In the first place, I do not see how Dr. Roadhouse was entitled to assume that the insured suffered neurosis; in the second place, I do not see how it had been proved that the insured\u2019s condition, if it amounted to neurosis, was severe.\nIt should be noted that Dr. Roadhouse specifically disqualified himself from expressing any opinion on psychiatric subjects and did so not once but repeatedly. It should also be noted that both he and Miss Degnan declared that their answers as to the materiality of the non\u2011disclosure were based upon the practice of the respondent company alone and that they had no knowledge of the policy of other insurers. The test of materiality is what would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer. Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 22, at p. 188, para. 360, says:\nIt may nevertheless be necessary or advisable to have evidence of experts as to insurance practice, seeing that the test hinges on whether the representation is of such a nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer, not on whether the representation influenced the particular insurer looking at the proposal.\nMacGillivray on Insurance Law, 5th ed., 1961, at p. 402, para. 827, says:\nThe test is, whether if the matter misrepresented had been truly represented it would have influenced a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium.\nMutual Life Insurance Company of New York v. Ontario Metal Products Company, Ltd.[7] per Lord Salvesen at pp. 351-2, says:\nIn their view, it is a question of fact in each case whether, if the matters concealed or misrepresented had been truly disclosed, they would, on a fair consideration of the evidence, have influenced a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium.\nI am of the opinion that the evidence given by Dr. Roadhouse and by Miss Degnan cannot be accepted as a discharge of the onus upon the insurer to prove that if the facts had been truly represented they would have caused a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or required a higher premium. Counsel for the respondent stressed that such evidence was at least some evidence upon the subject and it was not contradicted at all.\nI have reached the view which I have set out, however, on the basis that these two witnesses not only testified as to the policy of their own company but testified that they had no knowledge of the policies of other insurers. This, therefore, would require the Court to hold that the respondent in reciting its policy automatically recites the policy of a reasonable insurer. If one were to arrive at such a conclusion, then any idiosyncracy of an individual company expressed in its policy would bind the Court to hold that non-disclosure of facts which were not in accordance with that idiosyncracy was automatically material. It must be remembered that if a company wishes to take the position that any non-disclosure is material to it no matter what the view of reasonable insurers, then it should put the answers of the questionnaire by the insured in the position of conditions or warranties.\nAs pointed out by Lord Salvesen, supra, the question of materiality is a question of fact. In my opinion, the learned trial judge made a direct finding on this question of fact when he said:\nI, in turn, am tempted to flatly disagree with him. In March 1963, the circumstances were vastly different. For some months Margaret had ceased going out with the young man which was the serious cause of her conflicts of emotions. She was working steadily and appeared to be a happy girl. She was frail, as she always had been, and I come to no other conclusion that her anxieties and depression had long vanished. I find much quarrel with the ambiguities and looseness of the words in the medical questions of the application form. I give the following as examples:\n5a How much has your weight changed in the past year?\nI give it as common knowledge that one\u2019s weight is never static. Within ounces and a few pounds gained or lost, it varies in every year. Taken verbatim and accurately therefore the answer \u201cnone\u201d would be an untrue one. I hold as a fact that Margaret varied but a few pounds one way or the other. In March 1961 she weighed 104 lbs. and on the application date, in the same month, two years later, she weighed 102 lbs.\nAs I have said, that was a clear finding of fact that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was not material, and I can only conclude that the learned trial judge was misled into believing that his duty was to dismiss the action once misrepresentation or non-disclosure had been proved despite the failure to prove its materiality. For these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and award judgment to the appellant in the sum of $15,000 with interest at 5 per cent per annum from the date of the issuance of the writ.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Olch, World & Torgov, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: John J.

II, c. 17, s. 7\u2014Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, s. 488\u2014Charter of the City of Montreal, 1959-60 (Que.), 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 102, s. 781. The respondent company owns and operates an industrial establishment in the city of Lachine which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the appellant Protestant Board. Its immovable property comprises lands and buildings together with machinery and equipment located thereon. The valuation of its property, for purposes of municipal taxes in the year 1963, properly included an amount as to the value of the machinery and equipment. By virtue of s. 7 of an Act respecting valuation for school purposes, 1961-62 (Que.), c. 17, the appellant Board is required to revise the valuation rolls of the municipalities within its jurisdiction if they were \u201cnot established on a basis equal to the basis of the valuation made in the city of Montreal\u201d. The respondent contends that, in determining whether the valuation of its property was made on a basis equal to the valuations made in Montreal, account must be taken of the fact that, in Montreal, machinery is not valued for municipal tax purposes. The contention of the appellants is that the obligation imposed on the Board relates only to the method of valuation and not to the property constituting the tax base. The appellant Board refused to strike out the valuation of the machinery from the valuation roll of the respondent\u2019s property. An appeal to the Magistrate\u2019s Court was dismissed. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, this judgment was reversed. The School Board appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe machinery and equipment, owned by the respondent and located on its immovable property in Lachine, are not subject to tax for school purposes. Where a tax is imposed with respect to property of a like kind and character, in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to the contrary, there is a presumption that the taxing statute is intended to operate uniformly, equally and without discrimination. There is no valid reason why the owners of immovable property in the suburbs of Montreal should be discriminated against by being assessed for school tax purposes on a less favourable basis than that applied to the owners of similar property in the city itself. It was the intention of the legislature that, so far as possible, equality should be established among the owners of properties on the Protestant and neutral panels in all territories subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\u00c9coles\u2014\u00c9valuation pour fins de taxes scolaires\u2014\u00c9valuation d\u2019immeubles inscrits sur les listes protestantes et neutres dans les banlieues de Montr\u00e9al\u2014Valeur de la machinerie doit\u2011elle \u00eatre incluse\u2014Loi concernant l\u2019\u00e9valuation pour fins scolaires, 1961-62 (Qu\u00e9.), 10-11 Eliz.

Ses immeubles comprenaient des terrains et des \u00e9difices ainsi que de la machinerie situ\u00e9e dans ces \u00e9difices. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de ses immeubles, pour fins de taxes municipales pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1963, incluait avec raison un montant se rapportant \u00e0 la valeur de cette machinerie.

Goulet, for the appellant, Les Commissaires d\u2019\u00c9coles pour la Municipalit\u00e9 de Lachine.\nPierre Cimon, Q.C., and T.H. Montgomery, Q.C., for the respondent. G.E. Ledain, Q.C., and Clermont Vermette, for the invervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014These two appeals are from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench1, dated February 7, 1966, which reversed a judgment of the Magistrate\u2019s Court rendered February 27, 1964. This latter judgment had dismissed an appeal whereby the respondent company sought to have set aside a resolution of the appellant Board (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCentral Board\u201d), regarding the valuation of its properties in the City of Lachine for school tax purposes, and to have it declared that the valuation of the said properties for such purposes was $2,146,509.\nIn the Courts below, the appellant in the second appeal\u2014Les Commissaires d\u2019\u00c9coles pour la Municipalit\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 de Lachine\u2014had intervened to support the position taken by the Central Board. Before this court, the Commissaires have taken a separate appeal, and the Commission des \u00c9coles Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al has intervened to support both appeals.\nThe facts are admitted. The respondent company owns and operates an industrial establishment in the City of Lachine, which is within the territorial jurisdiction of both appellants. Its immoveable property in that city comprises land and buildings together with machinery and equipment located thereon. The valuation of its property, for purposes of municipal taxes in the year 1963, included an amount of $1,564,160 as the value of the said machinery and equipment.\nThe sole question in issue on this appeal is one of law. That question is whether the machinery and equipment referred to are subject to tax for school purposes. The answer to that question depends upon the interpretation and effect of certain statutes applicable to the Central Board, and in particular to the provisions of s. 3 of the Act 11 Geo. VI, c. 81, as amended.\nThe relevant statutory provisions have been carefully reviewed in the judgments below and I need not refer to them in detail. The Central Board was incorporated in 1925 under the provisions of the Act 15 Geo. V, c. 45. Generally speaking, its jurisdiction extends to all the protestant school municipalities in the Montreal metropolitan area, including the City of Lachine. The 1925 statute was enacted, following a report made by a Royal Commission, appointed to study and report on what measures were required to improve the financial system governing the protestant school municipalities in and around the City of Montreal. As stated in the preamble, the Central Board was established, among other purposes, \u201cto distribute evenly the cost of Protestant education among the various Protestant school municipalities in the territory affected.\u201d The major portion of the revenues of the Central Board is derived from school taxes imposed at a uniform mill rate upon (1) immoveable property owned by protestant taxpayers in the territory affected and (2) from the protestant share of taxes imposed at a uniform mill rate upon immoveable property in the said territory listed on what is known as the neutral panel and which includes the immoveable property of incorporated companies such as the respondent.\nAssessment for school tax purposes is made upon the basis of the valuation rolls prepared in each local municipality for municipal tax purposes. Under the general laws applicable to the City of Lachine, and in particular under the provisions of s. 488 of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, as amended, immoveable property subject to tax for municipal purposes includes land and buildings, together with machinery and equipment located thereon unless such machinery and equipment have been expressly excluded by by-law of the municipal council. No such by-law was passed by the City of Lachine. It follows, therefore, that the value of the machinery and equipment, located on the respondent company\u2019s immoveable property in Lachine, was properly included in the valuation of that property for municipal tax purposes.\nThe situation is different in the City of Montreal. In that municipality, under s. 781 of the City Charter, the value of machinery and equipment is not to be taken into account in establishing the real value of immoveable property for municipal tax purposes. In 1947, the Act 11 Geo. VI, c. 81, to which I have referred, was enacted. Sections 2 and 3 of that Act, as amended by 4-5 Eliz. II, c. 124 and 10-11 Eliz. II, c. 17, read as follows:\n2. The Central Board shall examine the immoveable properties entered on the Protestant and Neutral Panels, and the valuation rolls thereof, in any municipality the territory of which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Central Board for Protestant school purposes, in order to ascertain whether the valuations in such municipality are established on a basis equal to the basis of the valuations made in the city of Montreal, and the Central Board may employ valuators and experts to make the necessary examinations and to submit reports to the Central Board; such valuators and experts shall have the powers described in section 374 of the Education Act (Revised Statutes 1941, chapter 59).\n3. If the valuations, or any of them, appearing on the valuation roll of any such municipality are not established on a basis equal to the basis of the valuations made in the city of Montreal, the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal shall, by resolution, direct amendments to the valuation roll of all or any immoveable properties entered on the protestant and neutral panels in such municipality other than the city of Montreal, and that such amended valuation roll shall replace for all purposes of assessment and collection of school taxes in respect of immoveable properties entered on the protestant and neutral panels, the valuation roll theretofore in use by such municipality.\nUnder the statute as originally enacted, the Central Board had only a discretionary power to revise the valuation rolls of the municipalities within its jurisdiction other than the City of Montreal. After December 1, 1962, the date on which the amendments to ss. 2 and 3, made by the Act 10-11 Eliz. II, c. 17, came into force, the Central Board was obliged to revise such rolls if they were \u201cnot established on a basis equal to the basis of the valuations made in the city of Montreal\u201d.\nRespondent\u2019s position is, of course, that in determining whether the valuation of its immoveable property in La-chine was made on a basis equal to the valuations made in Montreal, account must be taken of the fact that, in Montreal, machinery and equipment are not valued for municipal tax purposes. The contention of appellants and the intervenant on the other hand is that the obligation imposed on the Central Board under s. 3 of 11 Geo. VI, c. 81, to revise the valuation rolls of municipalities other than Montreal, relates only to the method of valuation and not to the property constituting the tax base. The majority in the Court below refused to accept that interpretation and I am in respectful agreement with that finding. As I have said, the sole question at issue in these appeals is whether machinery and equipment, owned by respondent and located on its immoveable property in Lachine, are subject to tax for school purposes. I share the view of the majority in the Court below that the answer to this question depends upon the effect to be given to s. 3 of 11 Geo. VI, c. 81, as amended, and in particular to the interpretation of the phrase \u201ca basis equal to the basis of the valuations made in the city of Montreal\u201d. That being so I do not need to consider Mr. Cimon\u2019s argument based upon s. 16 of the Act 15 Geo. V, c. 45.\nAll owners of immoveable property on the protestant and neutral panels in the area, subject to the jurisdiction of the Central Board, are obliged to contribute to the cost of maintaining the protestant schools in that area. A uniform mill rate and the standard of valuation (the real value of the property) are prescribed by law.\nWhere a tax is imposed with respect to property of a like kind and character, in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to the contrary, there is a presumption that the taxing statute is intended to operate uniformly, equally and without discrimination. I can see no valid reason why the owners of immoveable property in the suburbs of Montreal should be discriminated against by being assessed for school tax purposes on a less favourable basis than that applied to the owners of similar property in the city itself.\nI am therefore in agreement with Montgomery J. in the Court below when he said:\nIt may be that the primary purpose of the Legislature, in enacting 11 Geo. VI, c. 81, was to provide additional revenues for Respondent, but it seems also to have been the intention of the Legislature to spread the burden of taxation for school purposes more evenly among the owners of properties on the Protestant and neutral panels in the various municipalities subject to Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction. This intent is particularly clear from the recent amendments to the above act made by 10-11 Eliz. II, c. 17, which in its title and preamble makes no reference to Appellant but is entitled merely \u201cAn Act Respecting Valuation for School Purposes\u201d. Before this act, Respondent had a discretionary power to revise the valuation rolls of the municipalities other than the City of Montreal. After Section 7 came into force on 1st December, 1962 (a few months before the date of the resolution in question), Respondent no longer had this discretion. It was obliged to revise these valuation rolls if they were not established on a basis equal to the basis of valuations made in Montreal, even if such revision were to its disadvantage. I am satisfied that it was the intention of the Legislature that, so far as possible, equality should be established among the owners of properties on the Protestant and neutral panels in all territories subject to Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction. This intention is partly defeated by giving a restricted meaning to the term \u201cbasis of the valuation\u201d, limiting it to the rules followed in determining values per square foot of land and per cubic foot of building space and ignoring the various legal provisions as to the accessories to be included in the value of the immoveable.\nBoth appeals and the intervention should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellant, The Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal: Howard, Stalker, McDougall, Graham & Stocks, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the appellant, Les Commissaires d\u2019\u00c9coles pour la Municipalit\u00e9 de Lachine: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Tetley & Phelan, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the respondent, Jenkins Bros.

The evidence which was adduced related, except as to the first count, to various acts by juveniles of sexual immorality, and the case alleged against the appellant was that he had encouraged these acts. The children were in their teens; they were witnesses for the Crown and gave sworn evidence at the trial. The appellant testified to deny the children\u2019s testimony against him. Several character witnesses testified to his good character. His appeal from the convictions was dismissed, and on further appeal to the Court of Appeal, his convictions were affirmed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Two affidavits were tendered before this Court, as well as before the Court of Appeal, sworn to by witnesses who had testified at the trial, both of which were to the effect that their evidence at trial was untrue.\nHeld (Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.: The charges in the present case were criminal charges, even though not laid under the Criminal Code. In criminal trial, it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon the evidence of an accomplice, it is dangerous to do so unless that evidence is corroborated. The reasons of the trial judge make it clear that he did not consider it necessary, as a matter of law, to pay heed to that warning. What is necessary to become an accomplice is a participation in the crime involved, and not necessarily the actual commission of it. The facts in this case show that there had been such participation. All the material evidence tendered to establish that the appellant aided and abetted at the commission of delinquencies was given by persons who had knowingly and wilfully committed those very delinquencies or, as in the case of one of them, had been guilty of aiding and abetting. In the circumstances of this case, the witnesses were participes criminis and were accomplices. Each of the witnesses whose evidence is in question here did commit an offense under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. When they seek to place the responsibilities for their conduct upon the appellant, there is no reason why, in relation to the charge brought against him, he is not entitled to the same protection, in relation to the evidence of accomplices, as he would be entitled to receive in respect of any other criminal charge. The reasons for such protection are certainly as valid, in relation to accomplices who are children, as they are with respect to accomplices who are adults. There was an error in law in the failure by the trial judge to take account of his duty to assess the evidence of the participants in the sexual acts as being that of accomplices and not of independent witnesses.\nIt was not a valid ground for the refusal to hear the evidence of the two self-contradicting witnesses that the said witnesses had testified at the trial and had been subject to cross\u2011examination.\nPer Spence J.: The view expressed by the trial judge was not only that the evidence of children, once sworn, must be received, but that it must be treated as that of a competent adult witness. This was a serious misdirection as the witnesses, despite the fact that it was properly determined that they were capable of being sworn, were nevertheless child witnesses and their testimony bore all the frailties of testimony of children. Added to this was the failure of the trial judge to give proper appreciation to the character evidence given in favour of the appellant. Per Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The essence of the case made against the appellant was not that certain children committed delinquencies, but that he did \u201can act or acts contributing\u201d to children being or becoming juvenile delinquents or likely to make them juvenile delinquents. There was no error in law in the trial judge failing to mention, in his reasons for judgment, the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the children, since the appellant was not charged with a sexual offence. Furthermore, the statement of the trial judge to the effect that the sworn evidence of a child witness may be received and treated as if it was the evidence of a competent adult witness, is to be taken as being confined to the competence of the child witness whose evidence was taken under oath, and is not to be construed as meaning that he ignored the special considerations which apply to the credibility of such witnesses.\nFinally, the trial judge did not err in law in failing to mention the danger inherent in convicting on uncorroborated evidence of the children because their evidence was that of accomplices. The evidence of the children under 16 years of age was not the evidence of accomplices, because they were not participes criminis in the offence of contributing to the delinquencies of the children named in the charges. The offence of contributing to the delinquency of children as specified in s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act is not an offence which can be committed by children under 16 years of age, and therefore these children are not to be treated as accomplices. Some of the older witnesses were accomplices. However, although the trial judge made no mention of accomplices, the reasons which he assigned for his decision did not disclose any self-misdirection in this regard.\nAs to the affidavit evidence tendered before this Court and the Court of Appeal, it should be rejected.\nDroit criminel\u2014Contribuer \u00e0 faire d\u2019un enfant un jeune d\u00e9linquant\u2014Preuve\u2014Complices\u2014Corroboration\u2014Preuve de caract\u00e8re\u2014Nouvelle preuve\u2014Affidavit d\u2019un t\u00e9moin au proc\u00e8s contredisant son t\u00e9moignage. ant\u00e9rieur\u2014Est-ce recevable en appel\u2014Loi sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160, art. 33(1)(b).\nL\u2019appelant, un ministre du culte, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de cinq chefs d\u2019accusation sur huit comportant la commission de plusieurs actes ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire d\u2019un enfant un jeune d\u00e9linquant sous l\u2019art. 33(1)(b) de la Loi sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160. La preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite se. rapportait, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de celle sur le premier chef, \u00e0 plusieurs actes d\u2019immoralit\u00e9 sexuelle commis par des adolescents, et ce qu\u2019on a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant c\u2019est d\u2019avoir encourag\u00e9 ces actes. Les enfants \u00e9taient tous \u00e2g\u00e9s de 13 \u00e0 20 ans; ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins de la Couronne et ont donn\u00e9 leur t\u00e9moignage sous serment.

Il a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler devant cette Cour o\u00f9, ainsi que devant la Cour d\u2019Appel, deux affidavits, asserment\u00e9s par des t\u00e9moins qui avaient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019effet que leur t\u00e9moignage au proc\u00e8s n\u2019\u00e9tait pas v\u00e9ridique, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Arr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et un nouveau proc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9, les Juges Fauteux, Judson et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Cartwright, Martland, Hall et Spence: Les accusations dans la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e9taient des accusations criminelles, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es sous le Code Criminel. Dans un proc\u00e8s criminel, il est du devoir du juge d\u2019avertir le jury que, quoiqu\u2019il puisse rendre un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 en se basant sur la preuve d\u2019un complice, il est dangereux de le faire \u00e0 moins que cette preuve ne soit corrobor\u00e9e. Les notes du juge au proc\u00e8s d\u00e9montrent clairement qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, en droit, de tenir compte de cet avertissement. Ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour devenir un complice c\u2019est d\u2019avoir particip\u00e9 au crime en question, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir actuellement commis ce crime. Les faits dans la cause pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019il y a eu une telle participation. Toute la preuve mat\u00e9rielle, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir que l\u2019appelant avait aid\u00e9 et avait engag\u00e9 des enfants \u00e0 commettre des d\u00e9lits, a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par des personnes qui avaient sciemment et de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 commis ces m\u00eames d\u00e9lits ou, comme dans le cas de l\u2019un d\u2019eux, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 coupables d\u2019avoir aid\u00e9 et encourag\u00e9. Dans les circonstances de cette cause, les t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient des participes criminis et \u00e9taient des complices. Chacun des t\u00e9moins dont le t\u00e9moignage est en question ici a commis une offense sous la Loi sur les Jeunes D\u00e9linquants. Lorsqu\u2019ils cherchent \u00e0 placer la responsabilit\u00e9 de leur conduite sur les \u00e9paules de l\u2019appelant, il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour que ce dernier n\u2019ait pas le droit, en regard de l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e contre lui, \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection en regard du t\u00e9moignage de complices, qu\u2019il aurait droit de recevoir en regard de toute autre accusation criminelle. Les raisons pour une telle protection sont certainement aussi valides, en regard des complices qui sont des enfants, qu\u2019elles le sont en regard des complices qui sont des adultes. Il y a eu une erreur de droit de la part du juge lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas tenu compte de son devoir d\u2019\u00e9valuer la preuve des participants aux d\u00e9lits sexuels comme \u00e9tant celle de complices et non pas de t\u00e9moins ind\u00e9pendants.\nLe fait que les deux t\u00e9moins en contradiction avec eux-m\u00eames ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9s n\u2019est pas un motif valide pour refuser de prendre connaissance des deux affidavits.\nLe Juge Spence: Le juge a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion non seulement que le t\u00e9moignage des enfants, une fois asserment\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u, mais qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant celui de t\u00e9moins adultes comp\u00e9tents. Cette directive constituait une erreur s\u00e9rieuse parce que les t\u00e9moins, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adjug\u00e9 avec raison qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00eatre asserment\u00e9s, \u00e9taient n\u00e9anmoins des jeunes t\u00e9moins et leur t\u00e9moignage comportait toutes les faiblesses du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un enfant. A ceci il faut ajouter que le juge au proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation voulue \u00e0 la preuve de caract\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en faveur de l\u2019appelant.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Judson et Ritchie, dissidents: L\u2019essence de l\u2019accusation \u00e9tablie contre l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas que certains enfants avaient commis des d\u00e9lits, mais que l\u2019appelant avait pos\u00e9 \u00abun acte ou des actes contribuant\u00bb \u00e0 faire d\u2019enfants des jeunes d\u00e9linquants ou les portant vraisemblablement \u00e0 le devenir. Le juge au proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en droit en ne mentionnant pas dans ses notes de jugement, le danger de rendre un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 en se basant sur la preuve non corrobor\u00e9e d\u2019enfants, puisque l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019une offense sexuelle. De plus, la d\u00e9claration du juge \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la preuve asserment\u00e9e des enfants peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue et trait\u00e9e comme si elle \u00e9tait la preuve d\u2019un t\u00e9moin adulte comp\u00e9tent, doit \u00eatre prise comme \u00e9tant limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019enfant dont le t\u00e9moignage est pris sous serment, et ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans le sens que le juge aurait mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les consid\u00e9rations sp\u00e9ciales qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de tels t\u00e9moins.\nFinalement, le juge au proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en droit en ne mentionnant pas le danger inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur la preuve non corrobor\u00e9e d\u2019enfants sous le pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient des complices. Le t\u00e9moignage des enfants de moins de 16 ans n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le t\u00e9moignage de complices, puisqu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des participes criminis dans l\u2019offense d\u2019avoir contribu\u00e9 aux d\u00e9lits commis par les enfants nomm\u00e9s dans les accusations.

Appel maintenu et nouveau proc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a conviction. Appeal allowed and new trial directed.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., and C.E. Perkins, Q.C., for the appellant.\nClay M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2], which, by a majority of two to one, dismissed an appeal by the appellant from a judgment of Moorhouse J., who had dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction by W.H. Fox, Esq., Q.C., a Juvenile Court Judge, on five out of eight charges brought against him under s. 33(1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160.\nSection 33(1) of that Act provides as follows:\n33. (1) Any person, whether the parent or guardian of the child or not, who, knowingly or wilfully,\n(a) aids, causes, abets or connives at the commission by a child of a delinquency, or\n(b) does any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child\u2019s being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent,\nis liable on summary conviction before a Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both fine and imprisonment.\nAlthough the charges were laid under para. (b) of this subsection, apart from the first one, they would, I think, more properly have been brought under para. (a). That paragraph makes it an offence to aid, cause, abet or connive at the commission by a child of a delinquency. \u201cJuvenile delinquent\u201d is defined in s. 2(h) so as to include a child \u201cwho is guilty of sexual immorality\u201d. The evidence which was adduced, except as to the first charge, related to various acts by witnesses of the Crown of sexual immorality, and the case alleged against the appellant was that he had encouraged these acts.\nParagraph (b) makes it an offence to do an act producing, promoting or contributing to a child\u2019s being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make a child a juvenile delinquent. The charges were framed to cover both alternatives, but the evidence, except as to the first charge, related to actual juvenile delinquency.\nThe facts are summarized by Laskin J.A., in his dissenting judgment in the Court below, as follows:\nEach of the eight charges alleged that the accused, during certain specified periods, which comprehensively covered the time span between July 24, 1963 and June 29, 1964 did certain acts contributing to the juvenile delinquency of (1) Susanne Westfall; (2) Robert Miller; (3) Mary Doolittle; (4) Jon Whyte; (5) Judy Kivell; (6) Glen Eldridge; (7) Brenda Wolfe; and (8) Janice Janes. Each charge or count set out the acts by which the contribution to juvenile delinquency was allegedly effected. Count 1 specified three acts; count 2 specified five acts; count 3 specified one act; count 4 specified one act; count 5 specified three acts; count 6 specified two acts; count 7 specified two acts, and count 8 specified seven acts.\nThe accused was convicted on five counts, as follows: count 1, in respect of specified act three; count 2 in respect of specified acts one, three and four; count 5, in respect of specified acts one and two; count 6, in respect of specified act one; and count 8, in respect of specified acts six and seven. The convictions were registered in the following terms:\n(1) Russell D. Horsburgh, at the City of Chatham, in the County of Kent, between January 1, 1964 and June 1, 1964 inclusive, knowingly or wilfully did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to Susanne Westfall, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent, to wit: by, during the Easter school vacation, 1964, attempting to induce the said child to have a relationship with Terry Lord by placing the said boy\u2019s arm around the said child and by telling the said child her boy friend would never know and that he, Russell D. Horsburgh wanted some action, contrary to section 33, subsection (1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\n(2) Russell D. Horsburgh, at the City of Chatham, in the County of Kent, between January 1, 1964 and June 29, 1964 inclusive, knowingly or wilfully did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to Robert Miller, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent, to wit: by, between March 13 and March 25, 1964 in the office of the said Russell D. Horsburgh, telling the said child that there was nothing wrong with the said child having intercourse; by, explaining to the said child how to have sexual intercourse without hurting the girl; by signs indicating to the said child to take the said girl to the apartment for sexual intercourse, contrary to section 33, subsection (1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\n(5) Russell D. Horsburgh, at the City of Chatham, in the County of Kent, between December 1, 1963 and June 1, 1964 inclusive, knowingly or wilfully did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to Judy Kivell, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent to wit: by, during the month of January or February, 1964, sending the said child to the apartment in the Park Street United Church Buildings, and sending Glen Eldridge there to have sexual intercourse with the said child; by asking the said child when she returned to his office, if she enjoyed herself, contrary to section 33, subsection (1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\n(6) Russell D. Horsburgh, at the City of Chatham, in the County of Kent, between December 1, 1963 and June 1, 1964 inclusive, knowingly or wilfully did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to Glen Eldridge, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent, to wit: by, during the month of January or February, 1964, telling the said child to have sexual intercourse with Judy Kivell in the apartment in the Park Street United Church Buildings and by asking the said child how did you make out, contrary to section 33, subsection (1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\n(8) Russell D. Horsburgh, at the City of Chatham, in the County of Kent, between July 24, 1963 and June 1, 1964 inclusive, knowingly or wilfully, did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to Janice Janes, a child, being or becoming a juvenile delinquent, to wit: by, sending the said child to the said apartment on March 31, 1964, to see Terry Lord and his friend from Toronto where sexual intercourse took place with Terry Lord; by, between July 24, 1963 and June 1, 1964, permitting the said child on several occasions to have sexual intercourse with Jack Best in the parlour and apartment of the said Park Street United Church Buildings, contrary to section 33, subsection (1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\nSusanne Westfall was 14 years of age when the alleged offence against her was committed; Robert Miller was 15 years old at the material time; Judy Kivell was 14 years of age; Glen Eldridge was then 15 years of age; and Janice Janes was also 15 years of age when the alleged offence in her case was committed. Terry Lord mentioned in the conviction on count 1 did not give evidence. Susanne Westfall was the girl mentioned in the conviction on count 2 involving Robert Miller. Judy Kivell and Glen Eldridge are associated in the acts on which the convictions on counts 5 and 6 were made. Jack Best, who, in addition to Terry Lord, is associated in an act for which there was a conviction on count 8, was at the material time 19 years old, beyond juvenile age, and was a witness for the prosecution, as were Susanne Westfall, Robert Miller, Judy Kivell, Glen Eldridge and Janice Janes.\nThe accused is a married man, 45 years of age who has been an ordained minister since 1947, following the completion of his education at McMaster University where he earned a B.A. degree and Queen\u2019s University where he earned a divinity degree. He came to a Chatham pastorate in 1961 after previous service in Creighton Mine, Sudbury, Hamilton and Waterloo. The offences of which he was convicted had as their locale the church in Chatham at which he served, and an apartment attached to the church which was not inhabited but was used as a collection and distribution centre for used clothing available to needy persons for the taking.\nThe accused on coming to Chatham expanded the existing social and recreational programme carried on at the church. With the approval of a responsible church committee, he organized a senior young people\u2019s group, a Tuxis group for boys in their late teens, a Sigma-C group for boys in their early teens and, subsequently, a teen-town and youth anonymous programme. This last mentioned group was designed to attract to the church young persons who had no traditional attachment and to provide them with an opportunity to discuss personal problems on a confidential group basis. The result of this expanded programme was to keep the church buildings in constant use by a range of young people. The accused set aside, in addition, a counselling period from 4:30 to 6 p.m. for teenage persons and this was made known through church publications. There is evidence that many youngsters visited the accused in his office for general talk and that he made himself accessible to them, even lending them small amounts of money, apparently in line with a social service conception of his ministry.\nThe young people named in the charges brought against the accused admittedly engaged in delinquent conduct in the church premises. Neither the church nor the accused can be held responsible for this simply because they permitted access to the church unless they were, or should have been, aware of what was happening and allowed it to continue. There was evidence that the frequent dances held in the church were chaperoned, there was a janitor who serviced the premises, and the accused\u2019s secretary was there from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. or later. What is alleged against the accused are not acts of omission but of commission, and, as already indicated, of the twenty-four acts specified in the eight counts, nine were brought home to him under five counts. Various grounds of appeal were submitted on behalf of the appellant, but it is only necessary for me to deal with one of them; namely, that the learned trial judge failed to apply the rule of caution as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices.\nThe learned trial judge gave detailed reasons for his judgment. He did not consider the matter of the evidence of accomplices at all, but he did deal with the requirement as to the matter of corroboration of the evidence of a complainant in relation to a sexual offence. With respect to this matter he said:\nThe second observation I would like to make concerns the question of \u201ccorroboration\u201d and the necessity for it in a case of this kind, having regard to the nature of the offences and the ages of the witnesses for the prosecution.\nIn the first place the accused is not charged with one of the sexual offences mentioned in the Criminal Code. Therefore, the possibility of false accusations of sexual crime does not exist in this case and there is no possibility of a conviction on the uncorroborated evidence of a possible victim, with respect to a sexual crime. The accused is simply charged with contributing to Juvenile Delinquency in connection with eight different counts. Because of the nature of the offences, therefore, I do not believe that corroboration is required.\nHe also dealt with the need for corroboration of the evidence of a child, who has been sworn as a witness. After discussing the provisions of s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 59, he went on to say:\nIn other words, once the Judge has decided, after making due inquiry, that a child witness may be sworn, that child\u2019s evidence may be received and treated as if it was the evidence of a competent adult witness. From my reading of the law, and, in particular, those cases which have been decided under section (16) (above) notably R. v. Antrobus 87 C.C.C. 18 and R. v. Sankey (1923) S.C.R. 436 such is the law with respect to the admissibility of the evidence of a child and, in particular, the necessity of corroboration of a child\u2019s evidence\u2014qua child.\nIt is clear from these passages that the learned trial judge approached the consideration of the evidence of the child witnesses on the basis that the matter of corroboration did not enter into the case at all.\nIt is now settled law that in a criminal trial, where a person who is an accomplice gives evidence on behalf of the prosecution, it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon his evidence, it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated.\nThe charges in the present case are criminal charges, even though not laid under the Criminal Code. The warn- ing required to be given to the jury is for the purpose of ensuring that, in their consideration of the evidence, the danger involved in convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice should always be present in their minds. The reasons of the learned trial judge make it clear that he did not consider it necessary, as a matter of law, to pay heed to that warning in weighing the evidence. If the evidence against the accused did consist of the evidence of accomplices, then there was error in law.\nThe question then arises as to whether or not the various children, who were parties to the sexual acts of which evidence was given, are to be considered as accomplices.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that they were not, and relied upon the judgment of the House of Lords in Davies v. Director of Public Prosecutions[3]. At page 400 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds, said:\nThere is in the authorities no formal definition of the term \u201caccomplice\u201d: and your Lordships are forced to deduce a meaning for the word from the cases in which X, Y and Z have been held to be, or held liabie to be treated as, accomplices. On the cases it would appear that the following persons, if called as witnesses for the prosecution, have been treated as falling within the category:\u2014\n(1) On any view, persons who are participes criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing, procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanors). This is surely the natural and primary meaning of the term \u201caccomplice\u201d. But in two cases, persons falling strictly outside the ambit of this category have, in particular decisions, been held to be accomplices for the purpose of the rule: viz.:\n(2) Receivers have been held to be accomplices of the thieves from whom they receive goods on a trial of the latter for larceny (Rex v. Jennings, (1912) 7 Cr. App. R. 242: Rex v. Dixon, (1925) 19 Cr. App. R. 36):\n(3) When X has been charged with a specific offence on a particular occasion, and evidence is admissible, and has been admitted, of his having committed crimes of this identical type on other occasions, as proving system and intent and negativing accident; in such cases the court has held that in relation to such other similar offences, if evidence of them were given by parties to them, the evidence of such other parties should not be left to the jury without a warning that it is dangerous to accept it without corroboration. (Rex v. Farid, (1945) 30 Cr. App. R. 168).\nA little later in his reasons he went on to say that he could see no reason for any further extension of the term \u201caccomplice\u201d.\nIn the Davies case the charge was murder, the victim having been stabbed by a knife. Davies, with other youths, including the witness Lawson, attacked, with their fists, another group, one of whom was the victim who was stabbed. In considering whether or not Lawson was an accomplice of Davies, the Lord Chancellor said:\nLawson, if he was to be an accomplice at all had to be an accomplice to the crime of murder. I can see no reason for any further extension of the term \u201caccomplice\u201d. In particular, I can see no reason why, if half a dozen boys fight another crowd, and one of them produces a knife and stabs one of the opponents to death, all the rest of his group should be treated as accomplices in the use of a knife and the infliction of mortal injury by that means, unless there is evidence that the rest intended or concerted or at least contemplated an attack with a knife by one of their number, as opposed to a common assault. If all that was designed or envisaged was in fact a common assault, and there was no evidence that Lawson, a party to that common assault, knew that any of his companions had a knife, then Lawson was not an accomplice in the crime consisting in its felonious use. It should be borne in mind in this connexion that all suggestion of a concerted felonious onslaught had, by consent at the instance of counsel for the defence himself, been expunged from the Crown\u2019s case and from the issues put to the jury.\nIt will be seen that the issue considered was as to whether or not Lawson was \u201cparticeps criminis\u201d in respect of the crime of murder.\nIt was submitted by counsel for the respondent that, to be particeps criminis, the witness in question would have to be guilty of the crime charged against the accused. On this basis, as none of the witnesses in question in this case could have been charged with the crime of which the appellant was charged under s. 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, they could not be accomplices.\nI do not agree that this result follows from the Davies case. Particeps criminis means one who shares or co-operates in a criminal offence. The passage cited from that case shows that the term includes an accessory after the fact, who certainly could not be convicted of the main offence. What is necessary to become an accomplice is a participation in the crime involved, and not necessarily the actual commission of it. Whether or not there has been such participation will depend upon the facts of the particular case.\nThe substance of the case made against the appellant was that he had aided and abetted at the commission of delinquencies. The delinquencies consisted of various acts of sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse was not involved in the first charge, in relation to Susanne Westfall, but she is the girl mentioned in the second charge and she gave evidence of sexual intercourse with Robert Miller. Terry Lord, who is mentioned in the first charge, did not give evidence. Jack Best, who is mentioned in the last charge, and who did give evidence, was not a juvenile at the material time. In the result, each of the persons to whose delinquency the appellant was charged with contributing had been guilty of an offence under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, i.e., sexual immorality.\nIn addition, each of such persons, other than Janice Janes, mentioned in the last count, had aided and abetted another juvenile in the commission of an act of juvenile delinquency, an act which is made an offence by s. 33(1)(a). It appeared to be assumed in argument that only adults could be charged under that section, but, apart from the marginal note, which forms no part of the Act (Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 14(2)), this section does not so provide.\nIn any event, the situation in this case is that all the material evidence tendered to establish that the appellant aided and abetted at the commission of delinquencies was given by persons who had knowingly and wilfully committed those very delinquencies, or, as in the case of Best, had been guilty of aiding and abetting. In the circumstances of this case, in my opinion they were particeps criminis and were accomplices. In saying this I do not contend that every child who becomes a juvenile delinquent is necessarily an accomplice of a person who contributes to such a delinquency. I say only that such a child may, depending upon the circumstances of the case, be an accomplice.\nI recognize that the charges against the appellant were laid under para. (b) and not para. (a) of s. 33(1), but I repeat that the case, as presented, other than the first charge, related to an offence under para. (a). I agree, on this point, with what was said by Laskin J.A.:\nCrown counsel contended that the accused would be guilty of the offences charged by reason merely of giving the encouragement to the acts committed by the juveniles, regardless of whether they were committed or not. I do not disagree, but that is not how the case against him was proved; and it is the nature of the evidence given against the accused that has to be regarded in determining whether accomplice evidence is being adduced.\nIn the reasons of Evans J.A., in the Court below, the following proposition is stated:\nIt is my view that the children under sixteen who testified cannot be considered as accomplices nor as particeps criminis. The Juvenile Delin- quents Act was specifically designed for the protection of such children and to hold that they are accomplices in the very act which contributed to their delinquency would be contrary to the intention expressed in the Act. They did not commit a crime by becoming involved in an action which forms the basis of a prosecution against the appellant.\nI am not in agreement with this reasoning. The fact is that each of the witnesses whose evidence is in question here did commit an offence under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Had proceedings been taken against them, they would have enjoyed the benefits afforded by ss. 2 and 38 in being treated not as criminals, but as misdirected children. But when they seek to place the responsibility for their conduct upon the appellant, I see no reason why, in relation to the charge brought against him, he is not entitled to the same protection, in relation to the evidence of accomplices, as he would be entitled to receive in respect of any other criminal charge and the reasons for such protection are certainly as valid, in relation to accomplices who are children, as they are with respect to accomplices who are adults.\nIn my opinion, there was an error in law in the failure by the learned trial judge, when weighing the evidence, to take account of his duty to assess the evidence of the participants in the sexual acts as being that of accomplices and not of independent witnesses.\nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary to deal with the ground of appeal based upon the refusal by the Court of Appeal to consider the self-contradicting evidence of two witnesses who testified at the trial. I would, however, like to express my view that the fact that the witnesses in question had testified at the trial on the issues on which further examination was sought, and had been subject at trial to cross-examination, is not a valid ground for the refusal to hear such evidence.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Martland in which he recites much of the factual background giving rise to this appeal. I shall endeavour not to duplicate this recital excepting in so far as it appears to me to be essential to an understanding of my views.\nAlthough the accused was a man of 45 years of age and an ordained minister of the United Church of Canada, he was tried in the Juvenile and Family Court of the County of Kent on eight charges involving the alleged commission of 24 separate acts of contributing to children becoming juvenile delinquents or which were likely to make them juvenile delinquents contrary to s. 33(1)(b) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. It was, in my view, unfortunate that all these charges were heard together but there was no motion for severance and no objection appears to have been raised to this procedure on behalf of the accused although in the result, in my opinion, its adoption made a difficult case more difficult for the judge to try.\nJudge Fox, who presided at the trial, is described in the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal as \u201ca learned and experienced Juvenile Court Judge\u201d and I do not question this assessment. He appears to have been able to deal with each charge independently of the others and the fact that he only found 9 of the 24 alleged acts to have been committed and consequently dismissed 3 of the charges, is the best evidence of his approach to the matter.\nThe trial, which involved the taking of more than 1,600 pages of evidence, was characterized by a direct conflict of testimony between the Crown witnesses, many of whom were admittedly juvenile delinquents, and the evidence for the defence which consisted of a complete denial of all the charges by a minister of the Church whose integrity was vouched for by a number of respectable citizens.\nThis was preeminently a case which turned on the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and Judge Fox was careful to instruct himself in this regard in the following terms:\nCounsel for both the Crown and the defence referred to that issue in their arguments as the most important issue in the whole case and with that view I am in entire agreement for on that issue, solely, I think depends the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence.\nAs the Honourable Mr. Justice Estey of the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out in the case of Rex v. White, 1947 S.C.R. 268 at 272:\n\u2018the issue of credibility is one of fact and cannot be determined by following a set of rules which it has been suggested have the force of law.\u2019 In his judgment in that case Mr. Justice Estey quoted as follows from a judgment of Mr. Justice J. Anglin (later Chief Justice) in the case of Raymond v. Township of Bosanquet (1919) 59 S.C.R. 452:\n\u2018...by that (in speaking of credibility) I understand not merely the appreciation of the witnesses\u2019 desire to be truthful but also of their opportunities of knowledge and powers of observation, judgment and memory\u2014in a word, the trustworthiness of their testimony, which may have depended very largely on their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving evidence...\u2019\n\u2018Eminent Judges\u2019 Mr. Justice Estey says, \u2018have from time to time indicated certain guides that have been of the greatest assistance but so far as I have been able to find there has never been an effort made to indicate all the possible factors that might enter into the determination. It is a matter in which so many human characteristics, both the strong and the weak, must be taken into consideration. The general integrity and intelligence of the witness, his power to observe, his capacity to remember, and his accuracy in statement are important. It is also important to determine whether he is honestly endeavouring to tell the truth, whether he is sincere or frank or whether he is biased, reticent and evasive. All these questions and others may be answered from the observation of the witness\u2019 general conduct and demeanour in determining the question of credibility.\u2019\n...I respectfully adopt the decision in that case and particularly the statement of Mr. Justice Estey as my guide in determining the issue of credibility in this case.\nI do not think that the comments made by the trial judge in the course of his detailed consideration of the evidence of the various witnesses indicate that he deviated, in assessing their credibility, from the standards which he found to have been laid down by this Court, and I therefore proceed on the assumption that in reaching his conclusions Judge Fox treated credibility as the most important issue in the whole case and that he evaluated the testimony of the witnesses having regard to (1) their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving evidence, (2) their general integrity and intelligence, (3) their powers to observe, (4) their capacity to remember, (5) their accuracy in statement, (6) whether they were honestly endeavouring to tell the truth and (7) whether they were sincere and frank, or whether they were biased, reticent and evasive. Applying these standards, the learned judge determined the issue of credibility against the accused.\nAs Mr. Justice Estey said, supra, \u201cthe issue of credibility is one of fact...\u201d and it is not open to this Court to interfere with the conclusions reached by the trial judge in this regard unless it can be shown that he erred in law in his consideration of the evidence. One of the chief errors in law alleged by counsel for the appellant was that the trial judge wrongfully directed himself on the issue of corroboration in relation to the evidence of the children who testified before him. In this regard it was contended that the trial judge should have found that corroboration of the children\u2019s evidence was necessary because of the sexual nature of the offences, the ages of the children, their bad character and the fact that they were accomplices.\nThe trial judge specifically directed himself on the question of corroboration and whether it was necessary having regard (a) to the nature of the offences and (b) to the ages of the witnesses for the prosecution, but he made no mention whatever of the rule relating to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice although, as will hereafter appear, I do not think that this affords any basis for the assumption that he was ignorant of that rule or that he ignored it in the present case.\nIn finding that corroboration was not made necessary by the nature of the offences here charged, the learned trial judge said:\nIn the first place the accused is not charged with one of the sexual offences mentioned in the Criminal Code. Therefore, the possibility of false accusations of sexual crime does not exist in this case and there is no possibility of a conviction on the uncorroborated evidence of a possible victim, with respect to a sexual crime. The accused is simply charged with contributing to Juvenile Delinquency in connection with eight different counts. Because of the nature of the offences, therefore, I do not believe that corroboration is required.\nThe trial judge\u2019s concept of the \u201cnature of the offences\u201d is spelled out in the comments which he made on the third act alleged on the first charge. This act consisted in the accused placing a young man\u2019s arm around a girl whom he knew was \u201cgoing with\u201d somebody else, and then turning towards them, saying, \u201cI want to see some action\u201d. Under all the circumstances, the trial judge found the accused guilty of this act although no sexual intercourse took place between the young people and no offence of delinquency was committed by either of them, and in so finding he said:\nWith respect to act (3) in the first charge Counsel for the defence said in his summation that the act itself could not possibly make Susanne or cause her to become \u00e0 juvenile delinquent, that unless there is direct evidence of sexual intercourse there is no act of contributing to juvenile delinquency. I cannot agree with the second part of this proposition. Subsection (4) of Section 33 is directly opposed to it, when it provides that it is not a valid defence to a prosecution under the section that the child, notwithstanding the conduct of the accused, did not in fact become a juvenile delinquent. Section 33 speaks of any act producing, promoting, or contributing to a child\u2019s being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child a juvenile delinquent. This wording, in my view, defines precisely what an act of contributing is and it does not make it dependent upon an accomplished act of delinquency by the child.\nThe italics are my own.\nThe contention of counsel for the appellant as to the necessity for self-instruction by the judge concerning the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the children insofar as it relates to the nature of the offences and to the assumption that they were accomplices, is based on the fact that there was evidence of sexual intercourse having taken place between them and I think it to be of first importance to recognize at the outset that such intercourse was not an essential ingredient of the charges against the appellant. With the very greatest respect for those who may hold a different view, I do not think that the essence of the case made against the appellant was that certain children committed delinquencies; the essence of the case made against the appellant was that he \u201cdid unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to\u201d children being or becoming juvenile delinquents or likely to make them juvenile delinquents, and I regard it as essential to the disposition of this case that the evidence of sexual intercourse having taken place between these children should not be treated as altering the rules of evidence which apply to the proof of the offences with which the accused was actually charged.\nAt common law the evidence of a complainant in a sexual case was always admissible but the rule requiring that the jury should be warned of the danger of convicting on such evidence without corroboration has long been recognized as a rule of practice. Section 131 of the Criminal Code requires corroboration in cases of incest, seduction, illicit sexual intercourse and in the case of a parent or guardian procuring the defilement of a female person, and section 134 provides that a jury must be instructed that it is not safe to find the accused guilty on the uncorroborated evidence of a female complainant in cases where he is charged with rape, attempted rape, inter- course with children or indecent assault. These provisions, of course, have the force of law but they have no application to the present case as the appellant was not charged with any of the specified offences, and accordingly the only argument open to counsel for the appellant in this regard is that the trial judge erred in law in failing to instruct himself in respect of a rule of practice. This appears to me to be a non sequitur. The case which was chiefly relied upon in support of this branch of the argument is Regina v. McBean[4], where the accused had been charged under s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act and Mr. Justice Davey of the British Columbia Supreme Court said at page 30:\nIt is a rule of practice that in trials without a jury the judge should keep in mind the danger of convicting a person charged with a sexual offence upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. It appears that this rule of practice should be applied not only in charges under the Criminal Code but in all judicial inquiries involving sexual offences.\nIt will be noted that it is the evidence of a complainant which requires corroboration and in the McBean case, although the charge was one of \u201ccontributing\u201d to delinquency, the contribution which McBean was alleged to have made to the delinquency of the child in question was \u201cthat he did have carnal knowledge of her\u201d and the decision was based on the case of Mattouk v. Massad[5], where Lord Atkin, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council said, at page 591:\nIt is now a commonplace that in judicial inquiries it is very dangerous to accept the uncorroborated story of girls of this age (15) in charging a man with sexual intercourse. No doubt there is no law against believing them but in nearly all cases justice requires such caution in accepting their story that a practical precept has become almost a rule of law.\nIn the present case the accused is not charged with sexual intercourse with young girls and although the delinquency to which he is alleged to have contributed is \u201csexual immorality\u2019\u2019 the gravamen of the offences of which he was convicted is, as I have said, that he did \u201can act or acts contributing\u201d to children being or becoming juvenile delinquents or likely to make them juvenile delinquents.\nThe reasons for the rule requiring corroboration of the evidence of a complainant in a sexual case do not appear to me to be clearly defined in any of the authorities, but it is suggested in Cross on Evidence, 2nd ed., page 177, that they are in some respects similar to those which apply to the uncorroborated evidence of an adulterer in that in both cases the charge is easy to make and difficult to refute \u201cand could easily be concocted on account of hysterical or vindictive motives\u201d. In any event, it appears to me to be clear that the danger to be guarded against in cases of sexual offences is that the complainant, through a motive of spite, vengeance, hysteria or perhaps gain by way of blackmail, may make false accusations against which the accused, by reason of the nature of the charges, has no means of defence except his own unsupported denial. It is the fact of sexual misconduct which requires corroboration and this rule of practice can have no application to a case like the present in which such conduct is freely admitted by the persons concerned. I am satisfied that there was no error in law in the Judge failing to mention this rule in his reasons for judgment.\nThe passage from the trial judge\u2019s reasons for judgment in which he dealt with the question of \u201ccorroboration\u201d in relation to the evidence of children was made the subject of bitter attack by counsel for the appellant. This passage reads as follows:\nBut what of the evidence of children? Fourteen of them gave evidence for the Crown, only one of whom was under the age of fourteen years.\nSection 16 of the Canada Evidence Act, dealing with the evidence of a child provides that:\n(1) In any legal proceeding where a child of tender years is offered as a witness, and such child does not, in the opinion of the judge, justice or other presiding officer, understand the nature of an oath, the evidence of such child may be received, though not given upon oath, if, in the opinion of the judge, justice or other presiding officer, as the case may be, the child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence, and understand the duty of speaking the truth.\n(2) No case shall be decided upon such evidence alone, and it must be corroborated by some other material evidence.\nBy that is meant, of course, no case shall be tested upon the unsworn evidence alone.\nI have been unable to find any definition of the term \u2018tender years\u2019 but I think it is clear from the wording in the above section that it is only the evidence of a child who, after due inquiry, is permitted to give unsworn evidence, that must be corroborated by some other material evidence, before a conviction can be made on that child\u2019s evidence alone. In other words, once the judge has decided, after making due inquiry, that a child witness may be sworn, that child\u2019s evidence may be received and treated as if it was the evidence of a competent adult witness. From my reading of the law, and, in particular, those cases which have been decided under Section (16) (above) noteably R. v. Sankey (1927) S.C.R. 436 such is the law with respect to the admissibility of the evidence of a child and, in particular, the necessity of corroboration of a child\u2019s evidence\u2014qua child.\nI do not think that in this passage the learned judge was doing more than stating that the sworn evidence of children differs from their unsworn evidence in that unsworn evidence must be corroborated before it can form the basis of a decision. I think that he was quite right in saying that a child who has been sworn as a witness is as competent a witness as any adult. In this regard, the distinction between \u201ccompetency\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d must be borne in mind, and I refer to the judgment of Buller J. in the old case of R. v. Atwood and Robins[6], where he said:\nThe distinction between competency and the credit of a witness has been long settled. If a question be made respecting his competency, the decision of that question is the exclusive province of the judge; but if the ground of the objection go to his credit only, his testimony must be received and left with the jury, under such directions and observations from the court as the circumstances of the case may require, to say whether they think it sufficiently credible to guide their decision on that case.\nAs I have indicated, I think that the excerpt last above quoted from the reasons of the learned trial judge is to be taken as being confined to the competency of the child witnesses whose evidence was taken under oath, and I do not think that it is to be construed as meaning that he ignored the special considerations which apply to the credibility of such witnesses. These considerations are described in the reasons for judgment delivered on behalf of this Court by Judson J. in Kendall v. The Queen[7], where he said:\nThe basis for the rule of practice which requires the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child, even when sworn as a witness is the mental immaturity of the child. The difficulty is four-fold: (1) his capacity of observation, (2) his capacity of recollection, (3) his capacity to understand the questions put and frame intelligent answers, and (4) his moral responsibility.\nIn my view, all these considerations are included in the factors referred to by Mr. Justice Estey in Rex v. White[8] and in the case of \u201can experienced Juvenile Court Judge\u201d who had expressly directed himself in accordance with that case, I do not think that his failure to mention in his reasons for judgment the rule of practice with respect to the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child is to be treated as an error in law. In the nature of things Judge Fox must have had to deal with child witnesses daily in the course of discharging his duties.\nAs I have indicated, counsel for the appellant further alleged that the trial judge erred in law in failing to state in his reasons for judgment that he had taken into consideration the danger of convicting on the evidence of persons of bad character. It appears to me that Judge Fox, who spent his time trying cases under the Juvenile Delinquents Act must be taken to have been aware of the fact that the Crown witnesses in this case were mostly juvenile delinquents and must be taken also to have been aware of the danger of convicting on their evidence without giving it the most careful and anxious consideration. His reasons for judgment indicate to me that he did give this evidence just that kind of consideration and I am not prepared to hold that his failure to make any specific comment on the bad character of these children constituted an error in law.\nFinally, appellant\u2019s counsel took the position that the evidence of those who had participated in the alleged delinquencies was the evidence of accomplices and that the trial judge erred in law in failing to mention the danger inherent in convicting on their uncorroborated evidence.\nIn so far as the evidence of the children under 16 years of age is concerned, I do not think that it is the evidence of accomplices.\nBefore considering this submission in relation to that evidence, I think it desirable to consider the reasons for the existence of the rule which is now recognized as a rule of law that a judge should always instruct a jury that although they may convict on the evidence of an accomplice, it is dangerous for them to do so unless that evidence is corroborated.\nThe rule appears to have its origin in the old law respecting approvers which fell into disuse during the first half of the 18th century and under which a person who was in custody and who had been indicted of the offence with which the accused was charged could upon confessing his guilt and accusing accomplices obtain his pardon. By 1775 Lord Mansfield was able to say in the case of Rex v. Rudd[9]:\nGreat inconvenience arose out of this practice of approvement.\u2014No doubt, if it was not absolutely necessary for the execution of the law against notorious offenders, that accomplices should be received as witnesses, the practice is liable to many objections. And though, under the practice, they are clearly competent witnesses, their single testimony alone is seldom of sufficient weight with a jury to convict the offenders; it being so strong a temptation to a man to commit perjury, if by accusing another he can escape himself.\nBy 1837 the rule had begun to take on something of the character of the rule of law as which it is presently recognized. In that year Lord Abinger in addressing the jury in R. v. Farler[10] observed at page 107:\nIt is a practice which deserves all the reverence of law, that judges have uniformly told juries that they ought not to pay any respect to the testimony of an accomplice, unless the accomplice is corroborated in some material circumstance.\nand he pointed out at page 108 the nature of the danger against which the rule was designed to protect saying:\nthe danger is, that when a man is fixed, and knows his own guilt is detected, he purchases impunity by falsely accusing others.\nThis observation is quoted by Wigmore in his work on evidence 3rd ed., (1940) at page 322, paragraph 2057 and is accompanied by the following comment:\nThe essential element however, it must be remembered, is the suggested promise or expectation of conditional clemency. If that is lacking the whole basis of mistrust fails.\nIn Cross on Evidence, 1963, 2nd ed., page 172, the matter is approached from a slightly different angle. The author there says:\nThe danger that the accomplice will minimize his role in the crime and exaggerate that of the accused is the usual justification for the requirement.\nDifferent shades of meaning are to be found in the reasons given for the rule by other text writers, but running-through them all is the thought that the accomplice\u2019s evidence is to be mistrusted because his testimony might be given in order to purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused by co-operating with the authorities. It does not appear to me that any useful purpose is to be served by reviewing the history of the law as to who is and who is not an accomplice because I am satisfied to adopt the definition of that term which is found in the reasons for judgment of Lord Simonds L.C. in Davies v. Director of Public Prosecutions[11], to which reference has been made by my brother Martland. In that case Lord Simonds made it plain that he thought the natural and primary meaning of the term \u201caccomplice\u201d to be limited to\n...persons who are participes criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing, procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanors).\nThe Lord Chancellor, however, also recognized receivers of stolen goods and witnesses giving evidence of similar crimes committed by the accused to which they had been parties, as persons whose evidence required the same warning as that of accomplices.\nIt will be seen that apart from receivers of stolen goods and accessories after the fact to a felony (both of which offences are distinct from the main charge) the only witnesses who come within the meaning of \u201caccomplices\u201d as defined by Lord Simonds are those who have been participes criminis in respect of the actual crime charged against the accused or in respect of some similar crime concerning which they, being parties, have testified against him.\nIn the present case none of the witnesses were receivers of stolen goods and the fact that the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontribution\u201d to their delinquency resulted in some of the child witnesses having sexual intercourse does not, in my opinion, make them accessories after the fact to the offence of making the \u201ccontribution\u201d with which the appellant is charged. It follows, in my view, that in order to have been \u201caccomplices\u201d within the meaning of that word as defined in the Davies case, the child witnesses in the present case would have had to be participes criminis in and therefore subject to prosecution for, the offence of contributing to the delinquencies of the children named in the charges against the appellant or contributing to some other delinquencies concerning which they had testified as to his guilt to which they had been parties. As I take it to be obvious that the offence of contributing to the delinquency of children as specified in s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act is not an offence which can be committed by children under 16 years of age, I am satisfied that these children are not to be treated as \u201caccomplices\u201d.\nI am, with the greatest respect, unable to accept the suggestion that children are capable of committing this offence. The word \u201cchild\u201d is defined in s. 2(1)(a) and I think that it is used in s. 33(1) in contradistinction to the word \u201cperson\u201d as that word is employed in the same section. The only offence for which a child can be convicted under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is the offence of \u201cdelinquency\u201d and s. 3(2) makes it plain that when a \u201cchild\u201d has committed a delinquency \u201che will be dealt with, not as an offender, but as one in a condition of delinquency and therefore requiring help and guidance and proper supervision\u201d. These latter provisions conform with the terms of s. 38 which defines the purpose of the Act as being:\n...that the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents, and that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.\nAll these provisions appear to me to conflict with the suggestion that it was intended that children should be exposed to being fined $500, imprisoned for two years or to both fine and imprisonment for contributing to the delinquency of other children. This in my view would be the effect of making s. 33(1) applicable to children.\nIt is said, however, that the essence of the case against the appellant is that certain children committed delinquencies and that although he is not charged with aiding and abetting the delinquencies to which these children confessed, the appellant is to be treated as having done so, so that he is participes criminis in relation to the commission of delinquencies by the children for which he could not himself be charged.\nIt is on this basis that it is contended that the children are to be treated as having been accomplices in the commission of offences of which the appellant was found guilty and with which they could not themselves have been charged. With the greatest respect for those who may take the opposite view, I do not think that, even if the appellant had been participes criminis in committing the delinquencies, it would follow that the juveniles were accomplices of his in committing the offences of which he was convicted.\nThe two things appear to me to be quite different and this is illustrated by the fact that the reasoning based on the appellant being participes criminis in the commission of the delinquencies could not, as it seems to me, have any application to his conviction on the first charge with respect to which the trial judge found no evidence of the commission of a delinquency by anyone.\nThe gravamen of each charge on which the accused was convicted was the same, namely, that he \u201cknowingly or wilfully did unlawfully do an act or acts contributing to... a child being or becoming a juvenile delinquent or likely to make the said child a juvenile delinquent\u201d. It is the act or acts of the appellant which were in question and I am unable to follow any reasoning which leads to the conclusion that when his \u201ccontribution\u201d has resulted in a child committing a sexual delinquency that child is an accomplice in the doing of the appellant\u2019s acts which contributed to it, whereas when the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontribution\u201d has not resulted in anyone committing a delinquency, the children in respect of whom the \u201ccontribution\u201d was made are not accomplices.\nIt appears to me that the suggestion that because there was evidence of Susanne Westfall\u2019s delinquency in respect of the second charge she should therefore be treated as an accomplice in respect of the first charge, must be predicated on the assumption that the essence of the case made against the appellant was that the children committed delinquencies. If this indeed were the essence of the case then it would perhaps be understandable to treat the mere fact of a child having been guilty of sexual delinquency in respect of one charge as tainting her evidence and constituting her an accomplice in another offence with respect to which the accused is charged with contributing to her delinquency whether any delinquency was in fact involved in that offence or not. As I have indicated, with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I do not agree with this reasoning. To treat children of tender years as untrustworthy witnesses on the ground that they have been concerned in contributing to their own delinquency by reason of the fact that the \u201ccontribution\u201d made by the appellant to their immorality has actually resulted in their committing acts of sexual delinquency, is in my view inconsistent with the purpose of s. 33(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act which is clearly designed to protect children against being led astray by the bad influence of adults. The fact that they have actually gone astray does not, in my opinion, make the children accomplices of the adult accused in exercising the bad influence which led them to their state of delinquency.\nIt was strongly contended on behalf of the appellant that the judgment of Pickup C.J.O., speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Reg, v. Gauthier[12], constituted authority for enlarging the class of \u201caccomplices\u201d whose evidence requires corroboration so as to include all persons \u201cconcerned...in committing or attempting to commit\u201d the offence with which the accused was charged. The Gauthier case was one in which charges had been withdrawn against two of the witnesses who had allegedly been engaged in the armed robbery for which the accused was indicted. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Chief Justice Pickup said:\nThere was evidence tending to indicate the complicity of at least one of these witnesses, if not both, and in our opinion it was the duty of the learned trial judge to tell the jury what in law constitutes an accomplice, and direct their attention to any facts in evidence which would tend to indicate the witnesses\u2019 complicity and then submit to the jury the issue whether what a witness was proved to have done made her an accomplice...\nThis excerpt does not, in my view, indicate any broadening of the rule but it is contended that by adopting a sentence from the reasons for judgment of Chisholm J., (as he then was) in The King v. Morrison[13], Chief Justice Pickup approved an enlarged meaning of the word \u201caccomplice\u201d. The sentence referred to reads as follows:\nAn accomplice is one who is concerned with another or others in committing or attempting to commit any criminal offence whether treason, felony or misdemeanor. This statement was made in relation to the effect of s. 69(2) of the Criminal Code (now s. 21(2)) and Mr. Justice Chisholm went on to say of the two witnesses (Burke and McNeil) who were alleged to be accomplices:\nI am of opinion that both Burke and McNeil were accomplices of the accused; that each is as liable to indictment as is the accused,\u2014and this is sometimes made the test in deciding who is an accomplice\u2014and that the requirements of the law as to the corroboration of the evidence of accomplices ought to have been observed...\nThere are two other cases decided in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, R. v. Morin[14] and R. v. Fleming[15], in both of which it was held that the evidence of certain prostitutes was to be taken as the evidence of accomplices in cases where the accused was charged with living on the avails of prostitution. These cases turned on their own particular facts but it is revealing to note that in the course of his reasons for judgment in the Fleming case, Porter C.J.O. put his decision on the ground that the witnesses whose evidence was there in question were accomplices because they were actual parties to the offence. He there said:\nI am of opinion that the witnesses in question in the case at bar were accomplices, being concerned with another in committing a criminal offence, and being parties to the offence by aiding and assisting in its commission.\nThe italics are my own.\nI do not think that anything which was said in the last two cases alters the law applicable to the evidence of prostitutes testifying in respect of such charges as it was laid down by Lord Reading in Rex v. King[16] where he found no evidence that the prostitute there in question was an accomplice and where, at page 119, he applied this test:\nIt is impossible to say that she is therefore an accomplice in the crime with which the appellant was charged.\nThe italics are my own.\nI have said that the rule requiring a judge to direct a jury as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice does not, in my opinion, apply to the children under 16 years of age who gave evidence in this case because they are not capable of committing the offence with which the appellant was charged, but the same considerations do not apply to the evidence of Jack Best, an adult of 19 years, who testified to having had sexual intercourse with a child named Janice Janes with the knowledge and encouragement of the accused. In so doing, he was, in my opinion, undoubtedly contributing to the child\u2019s delinquency and he was doing so in concert with Mr. Horsburgh and was therefore an accomplice. I think also that James Butler and Michael Bechard, who were both over 16 years of age and could thus have been guilty of contributing to the delinquency of young girls, must also be regarded as accomplices because they gave evidence of similar acts by the accused in which they had participated.\nAlthough, as I have indicated, Judge Fox instructed himself carefully in respect of corroboration (a) in relation to the nature of the offences and (b) in relation to the evidence of children, qua children, he at no time made any reference to the law relating to accomplices.\nThe well-known rule concerning the evidence of accomplices was stated in this Court by Anglin C.J.C. in Vigeant v. The King[17], where it was recognized as a rule of law that where an accomplice has given evidence the judge must first instruct the jury as to what in law constitutes an accomplice and then proceed to tell them that although they are at liberty to do so, it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such witnesses.\nThe rule there stated is so well known that it is difficult to imagine that a \u201clearned and experienced Juvenile Court Judge\u201d would not have it in mind and I would adopt the following statement of Martin C.J.B.C., speaking in the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Bush[18] as being applicable to the present circumstances. The learned judge there said:\n...there is no obligation upon a Judge to exemplify his legal qualifications respecting the rules of evidence in trying a case, because his requisite knowledge of the law pertaining to the proper discharge of the duties of his office must be assumed, and it cannot be inferred that he does not possess a sufficient knowledge of the rules of evidence to try a case properly as regards the evidence of accomplices, or otherwise, without distinction. Nor can it be presumed that he has fallen into error and misdirected himself unless that error is made manifest, e.g. it has been in some appeals that have come before us wherein the reasons assigned themselves disclosed the self-misdirection. As I have said, the trial judge made no mention of accomplices and in my opinion the reasons which he assigned for his decision did not disclose any self-misdirection in this regard. If he had given no reasons at all, his decision would not, in my view, have been open to question and I do not think that what he did say afforded any ground for presuming that he fell into error in relation to one of the most elementary rules of evidence.\nJudge Fox obviously gave the most careful consideration to the evidence of Jack Best and while I do not say that I would have reached the same conclusion as he did concerning that young man\u2019s evidence, the question of credibility is not before us on this appeal and the trial judge was certainly at liberty to convict on it.\nIn this regard it may also be observed that even Mr. Justice Laskin in the powerful dissent which he delivered in the Court of Appeal did not find the young girls to be accomplices although he did say that their evidence could not amount to corroboration against the accused because it did not itself confirm his participation or implicate him in the offences charged. I disagree with this latter finding and observe that Janice Janes stated that on more than one occasion on Saturday nights the accused had admitted Jack Best and herself to the church where they repaired to an apartment which was furnished with nothing but two couches and one chair, and there had sexual intercourse and remained until about 11:30 p.m. during all of which time Mr. Horsburgh was in the church and after which Janice Janes says: \u201cI think we always went to say goodbye to him\u201d. In my opinion this evidence corroborates and confirms the evidence of Jack Best in relation to the accused\u2019s participation in the offence of contributing to the girl\u2019s delinquency.\nThe evidence of the youths Butler and Bechard was admissible as proving system and intent, but there is no way of knowing what weight was attached to it by the trial judge as he made no comment whatever on either of these witnesses. I am not prepared on this account to assume that he acted on it or that if he did act on it he failed to appreciate the danger of doing so. There was, in my view, ample other evidence that the accused committed the offences of which he was found guilty. Counsel for the appellant advanced the further objection that the examination of the child witnesses on the question of whether or not they understood the nature of an oath was not sufficient to enable the judge to form an opinion in that regard as he is required to do under s. 19 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. That section is almost identical with s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act and reads as follows:\n19. (1) When in a proceeding before a Juvenile Court a child of tender years who is called as a witness does not, in the opinion of the judge, understand the nature of an oath, the evidence of such child may be received, though not given under oath, if in the opinion of the judge such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence and understands the duty of speaking the truth.\n(2) No person shall be convicted upon the evidence of a child of tender years not under oath unless such evidence is corroborated in some material respect.\nThe provisions of s. 16 of the Canada Evidence Act were considered in this Court in Sankey v. The King[19], where Anglin C.J. said at 439 and 440:\nNow it is quite as much the duty of the presiding judge to ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child offered as a witness does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it is to satisfy himself on the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of the duty of speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the statute to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term \u2018child of tender years\u2019 is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it be safely predicated from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the nature of an oath. Such a child may be convicted of crime. A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on this point. But some inquiry would seem to be indispensable.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn my opinion, very special considerations apply to the determination of this issue when the child is appearing before \u201can experienced Juvenile Court Judge\u201d who has the special advantage of having children come before him from day to day. A man of such experience should, indeed, be able to satisfy himself on this point after \u201ca very brief inquiry\u201d. I am not prepared to find on the present record that Judge Fox acted otherwise than judicially in forming the opinions which he did with respect to the children who came before him. Two affidavits were tendered before this Court, as they were before the Court of Appeal, sworn to by witnesses who had testified at the trial, both of which were to the effect that their evidence was untrue. We were asked to accept these affidavits, and while I do not for a moment suggest that there might not be cases where this kind of evidence should be accepted, I am nonetheless of opinion, for the reason stated by Mr. Justice Evans, whose conclusion was unanimously adopted by the Court of Appeal, that these affidavits should be rejected. As Mr. Justice Evans said: \u201cI believe there must be some finality to the evidence of a trial.\u201d\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of Mr. Justice Martland and I agree with his conclusion and also agree with the view which he expressed that it is not a valid ground for the refusal to hear the evidence of the two self-contradicting witnesses that the said witnesses had testified at the trial on the very issues where they now had expressed willingness to retract their previous evidence and contradict it.\nIn view, however, that a new trial may result, I think it proper to express my view on other submissions made by counsel for the appellant.\nThe said counsel submitted that five young witnesses who gave evidence for the Crown should not have been sworn in that the examination of the said witnesses failed to demonstrate that they understood the nature of an oath. These witnesses were the following persons:\nSusanne Westfall who was, at the time of the trial, one month less than 15 years of age.\nRobert Miller who was 16 years of age.\nJudy Kibble who was 15 years of age.\nGlen Eldridge who was 16 years of age, and\nJanice Janes who was 15 years of age.\nI have considered the authorities quoted by counsel for the appellant and it should be noted that none of them is concerned with children of such age, but on the other hand deal mostly with children much younger in years. Mr. Justice Ritchie in his reasons for judgment herein has cited the judgment of Anglin C.J. in this Court in Sankey v. The King[20]. As the learned Chief Justice pointed out, the trial judge is entrusted with a discretion to determine whether or not a child offered as a witness understands the nature of an oath, and that such discretion, of course, must be exercised judicially and upon reasonable ground. The learned Chief Justice, however, noted that a very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on this point.\nSankey v. The King was concerned with a child ten years of age, who indeed first gave her age as eight. I am of the opinion that a very brief inquiry indeed would have sufficed to satisfy the learned trial judge as to the ability of witnesses 15 and 16 years of age to understand the nature of an oath.\nI have considered the examination of each of the witnesses by the learned trial judge and I have come to the conclusion, to use the words of the majority of this Court in The Matter of a Reference concerning Steven Murray Truscott[21], that \u201cthe learned trial judge properly exercised the discretion entrusted to him and that there were reasonable grounds for concluding that (the child witnesses) understood the moral obligation of telling the truth\u201d. I am of the opinion that the test so set out must be considered to be that upon which the competency of a child of tender years to be sworn must now be determined.\nAs Mr. Justice Ritchie notes, the statement in the learned trial judge\u2019s reasons in reference to the consideration of the evidence of children who had been sworn was made the subject of a vigorous attack by counsel for the appellant. I refer particularly to the sentence \u201cin other words, once the judge has decided, after making due inquiry, that a child witness may be sworn, that child\u2019s evidence may be received and treated as if it was the evidence of a competent adult witness\u201d. With respect, I must differ from the view of Mr. Justice Ritchie that there the learned trial judge was doing no more than stating that the sworn evidence of children differs from unsworn evidence of children in that the latter requires corroboration. The view expressed by the learned trial judge is not only that the evidence of children, once sworn, must be received, but it must be treated as that of a competent adult witness. In my opinion, this is a serious misdirection, as the witnesses, despite the fact that it was determined, in my opinion properly, that they were capable of being sworn, were nevertheless child witnesses and their testimony bore all the frailties of testimony of children, such frailties as Judson J. in this Court referred to in Kendall v. The Queen[22]. The evidence of such children was, as Judson J. pointed out, subject to the difficulties related to (1) capacity of observation, (2) capacity to recollect, (3) capacity to understand questions put and frame intelligent answers, and (4) the moral responsibility of the witness. It is this fourth difficulty which is very marked in the present case.\nThese five children particularly as well as other witnesses were all juveniles who had on their own repeated admissions been guilty of the most serious sexual misconduct. It was the whole import of their evidence that they had been encouraged or even led into that conduct by the words and acts of the accused. It would be natural that children making such confessions of their own misconduct would be only too anxious to seek excuse in attempting to put, whether it be to foist or not, the blame on the adult accused. To consider their evidence as that of competent adult witnesses under the circumstances, in my opinion, constituted the gravest error. Their testimony should have been weighed in the light of these most serious circumstances. With respect, I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge did not do so. Having noted the inconsistencies of their evidence, and having shown he was fully aware of their equivocal position, he nevertheless proceeded to assign credibility to their testimony, it would appear, basing such view upon their demeanour and not keeping in mind their history.\nFindings of fact are, of course, for the learned trial judge but such findings must be made upon a consideration of the proper factors. I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge here, in the sentence I have quoted, deprived himself of one of the proper factors and proceeded, in his assignment of the credibility of the witnesses, to exhibit that he had so deprived himself.\nI am further of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in his assessing the credibility of the witnesses not only by failing to view with sufficient caution the evidence of children given in the circumstances to which I have referred but by failing to consider the evidence given by the accused in denial of such evidence of the children with any proper appreciation of the character of the accused who gave such evidence. There was adduced at trial for the defence not only the evidence of the accused but, inter alia, evidence testifying to the good character of the accused given by:\nMrs. Beatrice W. Fennell who had known the accused during the four years he occupied the position of pastor at this Church in Chatham;\nThe Reverend G. Morton Patterson, who had been acquainted with the accused since 1948 in the Sudbury area and in the City of Hamilton, and who had worked with him;\nReginald Johnson, a metallurgical chemist with the International Nickel Company at Copper Cliff, who had also worked with the accused in the Church at Sudbury;\nDavid Innes, a barrister practising at Sudbury;\nCecil Robinson, Q.C., of Hamilton, who had been a member of the Trustees of the Church in Hamilton at which the accused was minister for some years;\nDr. Gordon Price, Director of Education in the City of Hamilton, a member of the same Church for many years;\nDonald Fairfax, another member of the same Church in Hamilton;\nThe Reverend Donald Smeaton, a United Church clergyman who had been the accused\u2019s assistant when the accused had been pastor of a congregation in Waterloo, Ontario;\nMrs. Mae Hallman, who had been a member of the congregation in Waterloo; Jack Hansford, Sr., and Jack Hansford, Jr., members of the same Church in Waterloo;\nMrs. Ida Davis, also a member of such Church;\nRobert Lang, another member of such Church.\nWithout stating the evidence of these twelve witnesses in detail, suffice it to say they gave very strong character evidence in favour of the accused man. The learned trial judge, although he realized and acknowledged that the accused was a clergyman and had been so for years, did not, in weighing the evidence of the many child witnesses for the prosecution whose admitted conduct may well be characterized as disreputable, assess that evidence having in view the denial of it by the accused whose character was vouched for by the very large volume of evidence to which I have referred.\nThe learned trial judge did not refer at all to the character evidence in giving his reasons.\nIn Rex v. Britnell[23], Meredith J.A., in considering an appeal by a bookseller from a conviction for sale of obscene books, said at pp. 137-8:\nThe convicted man is a reputable book-seller, who carries on business, in an extensive way, in one of the business centres of Toronto. Although neither his reputation, or the character and extent of his business, is a reason why he should not be convicted, and punished, if guilty, yet they are not things without weight, and very considerable weight, in considering the probabilities of the truth of the charge against him upon the question whether there was any reasonable evidence of guilt adduced against him at the trial, as well as upon the question of fact, with which the Court cannot deal, whether guilty or not guilty.\nIn Regina v. Chapman[24], O\u2019Halloran J.A. said at p. 362:\nAccording to the rules which this Court recognizes as inherent in any finding of credibility, his professional reputation must stand unless it is shown by conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt, that he has engaged in some practice that denies the maintenance of that reputation.\nAnd at 363:\nIn the second place a man\u2019s professional reputation ought not to be taken away from him, except for conclusive reasons which in fairness to the man himself ought to be carefully set out by the trial judge whose decision deprives him of that reputation. It is to be regretted that was not done in this case. I am of the opinion that the accused on whose behalf such evidence had been adduced was entitled to have that evidence of his character cited and considered by the trial judge in arriving at his decision. As the record stands, there is no way of determining whether such evidence was given any consideration by the learned trial judge.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those outlined by Mr. Justice Martland, I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered, FAUTEUX, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: C.

On September 26, 1931, H had given a signed note, addressed to the appellants, which read: \u201cThe price I am asking for the [land] is $13,500. This price is good until Nov. 30th, 1961.\u201d Tenders of the said purchase price in cash were made to H on November 17 and November 29, 1961. On October 2, 1961, H and his wife signed an agreement for the sale of the half-section to the respondent D for the price of $14,000 and on October 18, 1961, executed a transfer of title to him but this transfer was not registered until January 1962 and in the meantime the appellants had, on November 14, 1961, filed a caveat claiming as purchasers of the land in question.\nThe court of Appeal held, (i) that H had agreed to sell the half-section to the appellants but, (ii) that as the northwest quarter of the section had been a homestead of H and his wife and she had refused to consent to the sale to the appellants the agreement could not be enforced as to that quarter and, (iii) that in all the circumstances of the case the Court ought not to decree specific performance as to the southwest quarter but should award damages which it fixed at $800. In the result it was directed that judgment be entered against H for $800 with costs of the trial and of the appeal and that as against D the action and appeal stand dismissed without costs.\nOn appeal to this Court the appellants asked specific performance as to the half-section, alternatively specific performance as to the southwest quarter-section with compensation, in either case consequential relief and, as against D, that they be awarded costs throughout. The respondents, by notice to vary, asked that the action be dismissed as to both respondents with costs throughout.\nAt the opening of argument the question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal was raised from the bench and, after some discussion, it was decided that this question should be reserved and counsel were heard fully on the merits of the appeal as well as on the question of jurisdiction.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be quashed.\nThere was in existence on November 30, a contract binding H to sell the half-section in question to the appellants for $13,500. This contract would prima facie have been specifically enforceable but for the facts that the northwest quarter of the section was subject to the provisions of The Homesteads Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 111, as amended by 1954 (Sask.), c. 21, and the wife of H at no time consented to the sale thereof to the appellants. H\u2019s wife could not be compelled to consent to the sale of the said quarter-section to the appellants and without her consent there was no enforceable contract as to that quarter. The appellants were entitled neither to a decree of specific performance in regard to the northwest quarter nor to damages for failure to carry out the agreement to convey it. Meduk v. Soja, [1958] S.C.R. 167; British American Oil Co. Ltd. v. Kos, [1964] S.C.R. 167; Halldorson v. Holizki, [1919] 1 W.W.R. 472, affirmed [1919] 3 W.W.R. 86, applied; Scott and Sheppard v. Miller, [1922] 1 W.W.R. 1083, referred to.\nAs to whether the Court of Appeal had erred in not directing specific performance of the sale of the southwest quarter-section with compensation, that Court had fully recognized that while the jurisdiction conferred by The Queen\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 67, to award damages in lieu of specific performance is discretionary, the discretion must be exercised judicially. That being so, this Court ought not to interfere unless satisfied that the discretion has been wrongly exercised and should have been exercised in the contrary way. Far from being so satisfied, the Court agreed that in the circumstances of this case the award, of damages was \u201cnot only an adequate but a more appropriate remedy\u201d. The amount at which the Court of Appeal assessed the appellants\u2019 damages had not been shown to be erroneous. Accordingly, assuming that the Court had jurisdiction, the appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the matter of jurisdiction, the question raised was whether, as required by s. 36(a) of the Supreme Court Act, \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds ten thousand dollars\u201d. Since the case of Orpen v. Roberts, [1925] S.C.R. 364, it has been settled that the amount or value of the matter in controversy is the loss which the appellant will suffer if the judgment in appeal is upheld. In the case at bar the loss which the appellants will suffer if the judgment is upheld is not $13,500, the price which they agreed to pay, but rather the difference between that sum and the value of the half-section, plus a possible award of damages in addition to the decree of specific performance. On the evidence, it appeared impossible to say that the total of these two amounts could amount to as much as $10,000. Jurisdiction could not be assumed in a doubtful case.\nIn the opinion of the Court, the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal did not exceed $10,000 and the Court was without jurisdiction.

Taylor, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1 allowing in part an appeal from a judgment of Balfour J.\nThe action was for specific performance of a contract for the sale by the respondent Hiscock to the appellants of the west half of Section 31 in Township 30 in Range 12 west of the Third Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan. The learned trial judge dismissed the action without costs, holding that the negotiations between the parties had never ripened into contract.\nThe Court of Appeal held, (i) that the respondent Hiscock had agreed to sell the half\u2011section mentioned above to the appellants but, (ii) that as the northwest quarter of the section had been a homestead of Hiscock and his wife and she had refused to consent to the sale to the appellants the agreement could not be enforced as to that quarter and, (iii) that in all the circumstances of the case the Court ought not to decree specific performance as to the southwest quarter but should award damages which it fixed at $800. In the result it was directed that judgment be entered against the respondent Hiscock for $800 with costs of the trial and of the appeal and that as against the respondent Dowie the action and appeal stand dismissed without costs.\nIn this Court the appellants ask specific performance as to the half-section, alternatively specific performance as to the southwest quarter-section with compensation, in either case consequential relief and, as against Dowie, that they be awarded costs throughout.\nThe respondents, by notice to vary, ask that the action be dismissed as to both respondents with costs throughout.\nAt the opening of the argument before us the question of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal was raised from the bench and, after some discussion, it was decided that this question should be reserved and counsel were heard fully on the merits of the appeal as well as on the question of jurisdiction.\nThe facts are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of Brownridge J.A. with whom Hall J.A. agreed. Woods J.A. agreed in the result but for somewhat different reasons. A comparatively brief statement of the facts will be sufficient to indicate the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe plaintiffs farmed the west half of the section in question as tenants of the respondent Hiscock during the years 1946 to 1961. From time to time during this period the matter of the sale of the land to the McKenzies was discussed and about the month of July 1961, Hiscock informed the plaintiffs that he had decided to sell. At this time the Hiscocks were living in the City of Saskatoon and the McKenzies were farming the half-section together with other land which they owned in the district of Zealandia, Saskatchewan.\nCommencing in July 1961, there were discussions and correspondence between the appellants and the respondent Hiscock looking to the sale of the half-section and seeking to fix the price. It is not necessary to set these out in detail.\nUp to September 26, 1961, the price discussed had been $12,800 and the appellants had applied to the Farm Credit Corporation for a loan of that amount.\nOn September 26, 1961, the respondent Hiscock telephoned to the appellant George McKenzie and told him the price of $12,800 was not satisfactory and that the appellants would have to pay $13,500. The McKenzies asked to be assured that the price would not be raised again and later in the day drove to Saskatoon accompanied by a friend, Lyle Moen, to see the Hiscocks. After a conversation lasting some two hours a document filed as ex. P.1 was written out and signed. It reads as follows:\nSept. 26th, 1961.\nGeorge and Cyril McKenzie\nThe price I am asking for the W1\/2-31-30-12-W3 is $13,500. Thirteen Thousand five hundred dollars.\nThis price is good until Nov. 30th, 1961.\nG.W. McKenzie\nper Cyril McKenzie\n\u2018Henry Benjamin Hiscock\u2019\n214 Ave. Q.N.,\nSaskatoon\nLyle Moen\nSept. 26, 1961\nSaskatoon\nThe appellants contend that a binding agreement to sell was made on September 26, 1961, of which ex. P.1 is a sufficient memorandum in writing and, alternatively, that ex. P.1 was an offer to sell at the price stated which was open for acceptance by them up to November 30, 1961, and which was accepted by tenders of the purchase price in cash made to the respondent Hiscock on November 17 and November 29, 1961. The second of these tenders was accompanied by a letter dated November 30, 1961, reading as follows:\nNovember 30, 1961.\nMr. Henry Benjamin Hiscock,\n214 Avenue Q. North,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nDear Sir:\nWe are hereby tendering Thirteen Thousand, Five Hundred ($13,500.00) Dollars in cash on behalf of George McKenzie and Cyril McKenzie, for the purchase of the West Half of Section 31, in Township 30, in Range 12, West of the Third Meridian, in compliance with your agreement dated the 26th of September, A.D. 1961.\nIn the event that you cannot sell the whole of the West half of Section 31, in Township 30, in Range 12, West of the Third Meridian because of homestead rights on one Quarter-Section of the said Half-Section, we hereby tender one-half of the sum of Thirteen Thousand Five Hundred ($13,500.00) Dollars in cash for the purchase of the remaining Quarter Section of the said West Half of the Third Meridian, being Six Thousand, Seven Hundred and Fifty ($6,750.00) Dollars in cash.\nThe tender of the amount of Six Thousand, Seven Hundred and Fifty ($6,750.00) Dollars is based on the negotiated price for the One-Half Section of Forty ($40.00) Dollars per acre for approximately Three Hundred and Twenty (320) acres, and Seven Hundred ($700.00) Dollars in addition thereto, making the sum of Twelve Thousand, Eight Hundred ($12,800.00) Dollars plus Seven Hundred ($700.00) Dollars, amounting to Thirteen Thousand, Five Hundred ($13,500.00) Dollars for the said one-half Section, Six Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty ($6,750.00) Dollars is the sum of Forty ($40.00) Dollars per acre for approximately One Hundred and Sixty (160) acres plus Three Hundred and Fifty ($350.00) Dollars.\nWe are making these tenders by way of a new tender and also by way of affirming our tender on the 17th day of November, A.D., 1961, of Thirteen Thousand, Five Hundred ($13,500.00) Dollars in cash on behalf of George McKenzie and Cyril McKenzie for the purchase of the West Half of Section 31, in Township 30, in Range 12, West of the Third Meridian, in compliance with your agreement dated the 26th day of September, A.D. 1961.\nYours truly,\nMACKLEM & CUELENAERE\nper \u2018M.C. Cuelenaere\u2019\nSolicitors for George\nMcKenzie and Cyril McKenzie.\nOn October 2, 1961, the respondent Hiscock and his wife signed an agreement for the sale of the half-section to the respondent Dowie for the price of $14,000 and on October 18, 1961, executed a transfer of title to him but this transfer was not registered until January 1962 and in the meantime the appellants had, on November 14, 1961, filed a caveat claiming as purchasers of the land in question. At the time of making the later of the two tenders mentioned above the appellants had not been given notice of the sale to Dowie or of any revocation by the respondent Hiscock of the offer (if such it was) contained in ex. P.1. Prior to agreeing to purchase the land in question Dowie had knowledge of the existence and contents of ex. P.1 and had obtained legal advice as to its effect.\nBoth the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal found the facts to be as briefly summarized above. These findings are supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed.\nThe learned trial judge held that ex. P.1 was not an offer to sell but rather an indication of a willingness to negotiate or an invitation to the appellants to submit an offer to buy; he found the case to be indistinguishable from the judgment of the full Court of the North-West Provinces in Blackstock v. Williams.[2]\nIn the Court of Appeal Brownridge J.A., with whom Hall J.A. agreed, held that on September 26, 1961, the respondent Hiscock orally offered to sell the half-section to the appellants for $13,500, that they immediately accepted his offer, that in the evening of the same day an added term was agreed to and that thereupon there came into existence a contract for the sale of the half-section at the price mentioned a condition of which was that if the appellants could not raise the purchase money by November 30 neither party would be bound. He held further that ex. P.1 constituted a sufficient memorandum in writing of this contract.\nWoods J.A. took the view that ex. P.1 was an offer to sell the land for $13,500 open for acceptance at any time up to November 30, that it was accepted by the tender of the purchase price at a time when the appellants had not been notified that the offer was revoked and that accordingly the respondent Hiscock was bound by the contract.\nWhile I incline to prefer the view of Woods J.A., I do not find it necessary to choose between these two views as on either there was in existence on November 30 a contract binding the respondent Hiscock to sell the half-section in question to the appellants for $13,500 and I agree with this conclusion. This contract would prima facie have been specifically enforceable but for the facts that the northwest quarter of the section was subject to the provisions of The Homesteads Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 111, as amended by 1954 (Sask.), c. 21, and Mrs. Hiscock at no time consented to the sale thereof to the appellants.\nThe relevant provision of The Homesteads Act is the first paragraph of subs. 1 of s. 3 which reads as follows:\n3 (1) Every transfer, agreement for sale lease or other instrument intended to convey or transfer an interest in a homestead to any person other than the wife of the owner, and every mortgage intended to charge a homestead in favour of any such person with the payment of a sum of money, shall be signed by the owner and his wife if he has a wife who resides in Saskatchewan or has resided therein at any time since the marriage, and she shall appear before a district court judge, local registrar of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, registrar of land titles or their respective deputies or a solicitor or justice of the peace or notary public and, upon being examined separate and apart from her husband, she shall acknowledge that she understands her rights in the homestead and signs the instrument of her own free will and consent and without compulsion on the part of her husband.\nWhile the form of this enactment differs considerably from the corresponding provisions of The Dower Act of Alberta which were considered by this Court in Meduk v. Soja[3] and in British American Oil Co. Ltd. v. Kos[4], in my opinion, the reasoning in those cases shews that Mrs. Hiscock could not be compelled to consent to the sale of the northwest quarter-section to the appellants and that without her consent there was no enforceable contract as to that quarter. The matter has been considered in the Courts of Saskatchewan in the case of Halldorson v. Holizki[5]. The Act respecting Homesteads there considered was 1915 (Sask.), c. 29, as amended by 1916 (Sask.), c. 27, and is in substantially the same terms as the Act with which we are concerned. In that case a husband had agreed to sell 400 acres part of which was the homestead and the wife did not consent to the sale. At. p. 477 of the trial judgment Taylor J. said:\nI conclude therefore that the assent of the husband alone to an agreement of sale respecting the homestead is an ineffectual assent. The bargain is inchoative until the wife assents in the manner required by the statute, and the husband is not liable for failure to perform the agreement in so far as it relates to the homestead. In Scott and Sheppard v. Miller[6], the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan left open the question whether a husband could be held liable in damages for failure to perform an agreement by him to sell the homestead when his wife refused to consent to the sale; but the reasoning of Lamont J., with whom Haultain C.J.S. agreed, appears to me to be persuasive for the view that the husband would not be liable. He said at pp. 1087 and 1088:\nOur Homestead Act was passed for the purpose of preventing a husband from disposing of the homestead without the consent of his wife, given without compulsion and of her own free will. Although the Act gives the wife an interest in the homestead independent of her husband, it must not be forgotten that they are still man and wife, with, in most respects, interests which are identical. The prosperity of the husband generally speaking means the prosperity of the wife, while any losses sustained by him are losses which she must share. If, therefore, the husband enters into an agreement to sell the homestead, and if it be held that his wife\u2019s refusal to consent to the sale results in the husband being mulcted in heavy damages for breach of his contract, which damages will be so much loss to their joint estate, it seems to me that the freedom of will and the absence of compulsion which the statute requires on the part of the wife would be very greatly interfered with. In many of such cases I fear the wife would be found making a declaration that she was signing the conveyance of her own free will, when, in fact, she was doing so very reluctantly, and under the compulsion, which threatened loss by way of heavy damages for her husband\u2019s breach of contract, would exert upon her. To put this species of compulsion upon a wife seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the spirit of the Act.\nIn my view, in the case at bar, the appellants were entitled neither to a decree of specific performance in regard to the northwest quarter nor to damages for failure to carry out the agreement to convey it.\nBefore leaving this point mention should be made of the argument developed in the appellants\u2019 factum, but not referred to in the judgments below, to the effect that because Mrs. Hiscock consented to the sale to Dowie her refusal to consent to the sale to the appellants cannot be relied upon as a defence to their action. This argument should, in my opinion, be rejected. If the appellants are to be awarded specific performance the sale and transfer to Dowie would of necessity have to be set aside. The circumstance that a wife is willing to consent to the sale of the homestead to one person is no ground for holding that her consent to its sale to another person at a lower price is unnecessary. Turning now to the question whether the Court of Appeal erred in not directing specific performance of the sale of the southwest quarter-section with compensation, it may first be observed that s. 44(9) of The Queen\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 67, provided:\n44. The law to be administered in this province as to the matters next hereinafter mentioned shall be as follows:\n(9) In all cases in which the court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for an injunction against a breach of any covenant, contract or agreement or against the commission or continuance of any wrongful act or for the specific performance of any covenant, contract or agreement, the court may if it thinks fit award damages to the party injured either in addition to or in substitution for such injunction or specific performance, and such damages may be ascertained in such a manner as the court may direct, or the court may grant such other relief as it may deem just;\nThe jurisdiction conferred by this section to award damages in lieu of specific performance has existed in England since the enactment of 21 & 22 Vict., c. 27 (commonly called Lord Cairn\u2019s Act). While the jurisdiction conferred is discretionary the discretion must be exercised judicially and this was fully recognized in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. That being so, it is my view that we ought not to interfere unless satisfied that the discretion has been wrongly exercised and should have been exercised in the contrary way. Far from being so satisfied, it is my opinion that in the particular circumstances of this case which are examined at length in the reasons of Brownridge J.A. the award of damages is as he found \u201cnot only an adequate but a more appropriate remedy\u201d. I find no error in the reasoning which led him to this result.\nThe amount at which the Court of Appeal assessed the appellants\u2019 damages has not been shown to be erroneous.\nFor these reasons, assuming that we have jurisdiction, I would dismiss the appeal. On the same assumption, I would dismiss the cross-appeal raised by the notice to vary. I have already stated my agreement with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the respondent Hiscock did agree to sell the lands in question to the appellants and with its decision to award damages in lieu of specific performance. The figure at which the damages were fixed has not been shown to be excessive. I would not interfere with the orders as to costs made by the Court of Appeal. It remains to consider the question of our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Upon this question being raised counsel for the appellants submitted that we have jurisdiction while counsel for the respondents argued to the contrary.\nThe relevant provision of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, is clause (a) (substituted 1956, c. 48) of s. 36. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is a final judgment of the highest Court of final resort in the province pronounced in a judicial proceeding and the question is whether \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds ten thousand dollars\u201d.\nWhile, in my opinion, on the facts as found it was impossible for the appellants to be awarded a decree of specific performance as to the whole of the half-section that claim was put forward in the appeal and I cannot say that this was done frivolously or otherwise than in good faith. Had the appeal succeeded in toto the appellants would have been awarded specific performance of the agreement to convey the half-section, plus perhaps some damages for delay in performing the contract, but would, of course, have had to pay the purchase price of $13,500. In Tonks et al. v. Reid et al.[7], it was said, in a unanimous judgment of this Court, at p. 627:\nSince the case of Orpen v. Roberts, [1925] S.C.R. 364, it has been settled that the amount or value of the matter in controversy is the loss which the appellant will suffer if the judgment in appeal is upheld.\nIn the case at bar the loss which the appellants will suffer if the judgment is upheld is not $13,500, the price which they agreed to pay but rather the difference between that sum and the value of the half-section, plus, as mentioned above, a possible award of damages in addition to the decree of specific performance. On the evidence in the record it appears to me impossible to say that the total of these two amounts could amount to as much as $10,000. In Cully v. Ferdais[8], Taschereau J., as he then was, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court said at p. 333, after stating that the question of jurisdiction in that case might not be free from doubt:\nHowever the right to appeal is not clear, and the rule as to appeals is that the Court cannot assume jurisdiction in a doubtful case. In my opinion, the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed ten thousand dollars and we are without jurisdiction. Had this question been raised at an early stage by a motion to quash sub-stantial expense would have been saved.\nI would quash both the appeal and the cross-appeal. In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case I would make no order as to costs in this Court.\nAppeal and cross-appeal quashed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Wedge, McKercher & McKercher, Saskatoon.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Goldenberg, Taylor, Tallis & Goldenberg, Saskatoon.\n[1] (1966), 54 W.W.R. 163.\n[2] (1907), 6 W.L.R. 79, 7 Terr.

Act, 1871\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1962, c. 259, s. 55.\nThe Governor General in Council, pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, has requested this Court to give its opinion on questions concerning the respective proprietary rights and legislative jurisdiction of Canada and British Columbia in relation to certain lands adjacent to the coast line of that Province. [These questions are cited in full at the beginning of the joint opinion delivered by the Court]. Only Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were not represented on this reference. The Attorney General for Canada submitted that the answer to all the questions should be \u201cCanada\u201d. The province of British Columbia, whose position was supported by the other provinces, submitted that it possesses exclusive proprietary rights and sole legislative jurisdiction in relation to the lands in question and enjoys the sole right to exploration and exploitation within the limits defined by the terms of reference.\nHeld: All questions were answered in favour of Canada. As to the Territorial Sea.\nThe sovereign state which has the property in the bed of the territorial sea adjacent to British Columbia is Canada. At no time has British Columbia, either as a colony or a province, had property in these lands.\nIt is the sovereign state of Canada that has the right to explore and exploit these lands.\nCanada has exclusive legislative jurisdiction in respect of these lands either under s. 91(1) (a) of the B.N.A. Act or under the residual power in s. 91. British Columbia has no legislative jurisdiction since the lands in question are outside its boundaries. The lands under the territorial sea do not fall within any of the enumerated heads of s. 92 since they are not within the province. Legislative jurisdiction with respect to such lands must, therefore, belong exclusively to Canada, for the subject matter is one not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces within the meaning of the initial words of s. 91 and may, therefore, properly be regarded as a matter affecting Canada generally and covered by the expression \u201cthe peace, order and good government of Canada\u201d. The mineral resources of these lands are of concern to Canada as a whole and go beyond local or provincial concern or interests.\nMoreover, the rights in the territorial sea arise by international law and depend upon recognition by other sovereign states. Canada is a sovereign state recognized by international law and thus able to enter into arrangements with other states respecting the rights in the territorial sea.\nAs to the Continental Shelf.\nThe rights now recognized by international law to explore and exploit the natural resources of the continental shelf do not involve any extension of the territorial sea. The superjacent waters continue to be recognized as high seas. There is no historical, legal or constitutional basis upon which the province of British Columbia could claim the right to explore and exploit or claim legislative jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf. There are two reasons why British Columbia lacks these rights: (i) the continental shelf is outside the boundaries of British Columbia, and (ii) Canada is the sovereign state which will be recognized by international law as having the rights stated in the 1958 Geneva Convention, and it is Canada that will have to answer the claims of other members of the international community for breach of the obligations and responsibilities imposed by that convention.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Droits min\u00e9raux au large des c\u00f4tes\u2014Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale\u2014Loi sur la Mer territoriale et les zones de p\u00eache, 1964 (Can.), c. 22\u2014Loi de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1871\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 55.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 55 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Conseil a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour de lui donner son opinion sur des questions concernant les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 respectivement du Canada et de la Colombie\u2011Britannique ainsi que leur juridiction l\u00e9gislative en regard de certains terrains adja- cents au littoral de cette province. [Ces questions sont cit\u00e9es au long au commencement de l\u2019opinion collective qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par la Cour]. Seules les provinces de Qu\u00e9bec, du Manitoba, de la Saskatchewan et de I\u2019Alberta n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a soutenu que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 toutes les questions devait \u00eatre \u00abCanada\u00bb. La province de la Colombie-Britannique, dont la position est support\u00e9e par les autres provinces, a soutenu qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusifs et la juridiction l\u00e9gislative exclusive en regard de ces terrains et qu\u2019elle jouit du droit exclusif d\u2019explorer et d\u2019exploiter dans les limites d\u00e9finies par les termes des questions d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es.\nArr\u00eat: Les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 toutes les questions doivent \u00eatre en faveur du Canada.\nQuant \u00e0 la mer territoriale\nL\u2019\u00e9tat souverain qui a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lit de la mer territoriale adjacent \u00e0 la Colombie\u2011Britannique est le Canada. A aucun moment de son existence, soit comme colonie soit comme province, la Colombie-Britannique a-t-elle eu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces terrains.\nC\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat souverain du Canada qui a le droit d\u2019explorer et d\u2019exploiter ces terrains.\nLe Canada a la juridiction l\u00e9gislative exclusive en regard de ces terrains, soit en vertu de l\u2019art. 91(1) (a) de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique ou en vertu du pouvoir r\u00e9siduaire dans l\u2019art. 91. La Colombie-Britannique n\u2019a pas la juridiction l\u00e9gislative puisque les terrains en question sont au-del\u00e0 de ses fronti\u00e8res. Les terrains sous la mer territoriale ne tombent sous aucun des sujets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 92 puisqu\u2019ils ne sont pas situ\u00e9s dans la province. La juridiction l\u00e9gislative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces terrains doit, en cons\u00e9quence, appartenir exclusivement au Canada parce que la mati\u00e8re n\u2019est pas une de celles tombant dans les cat\u00e9gories de sujets attribu\u00e9s exclusivement aux l\u00e9gislatures des provinces dans le sens des mots que l\u2019on trouve au d\u00e9but de l\u2019art. 91 et que cette mati\u00e8re peut, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avec raison comme \u00e9tant une mati\u00e8re affectant le Canada g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et tombant sous l\u2019expression \u00abla paix, l\u2019ordre et le bon gouvernement du Canada\u00bb. Les ressources min\u00e9rales de ces terrains sont l\u2019affaire du Canada entier et vont au-del\u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats purement locaux ou provinciaux.\nDe plus, les droits dans la mer territoriale proviennent du droit international et doivent \u00eatre reconnus par les autres \u00e9tats souverains. Le Canada est un \u00e9tat souverain reconnu par le droit international et cons\u00e9quemment a la comp\u00e9tence de passer des ententes avec les autres \u00e9tats concernant les droits dans la mer territoriale.\nQuant au plateau continental\nLes droits maintenant reconnus par le droit international d\u2019explorer et d\u2019exploiter les ressources naturelles du plateau continental ne comportent pas une extension de la mer territoriale. Les eaux surjacentes continuent d\u2019\u00eatre reconnues comme \u00e9tant la haute mer. La province de la Colombie-Britannique ne peut s\u2019appuyer sur aucune base historique, l\u00e9gale ou constitutionnelle pour r\u00e9clamer le droit d\u2019explorer et d\u2019exploiter, ou pour r\u00e9clamer la juridiction l\u00e9gislative sur les ressources du plateau continental. Il y a deux raisons pour lesquelles la Colombie\u2011Britannique ne peut pas avoir ces droits: (i) Le plateau continental est au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res de la Colombie-Britannique et (ii) le Canada est l\u2019\u00e9tat souverain qui sera reconnu par le droit international comme ayant les droits d\u00e9finis \u00e0 la Convention de Gen\u00e8ve de 1958, et c\u2019est le Canada qui devra repousser les r\u00e9clamations des autres membres de la communaut\u00e9 internationale pour toute violation des obligations et des responsabilit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es par cette convention.\nSon Excellence le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Conseil a d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 55 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, pour audition et examen, les questions cit\u00e9es au long au commencement de l\u2019opinion collective qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par cette Cour.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration of the questions cited in full at the beginning of the joint opinion delivered by this Court.\nC.F.H.

In respect of the lands, including the mineral and other natural resources, of the sea bed and subsoil seaward from the ordinary low-water mark on the coast of the mainland and the several islands of British Columbia, outside the harbours, bays, estuaries and other similar inland waters, to the outer limit of the territorial sea of Canada, as defined in the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act, Statutes of Canada 1964, Chapter 22, as between Canada and British Columbia,\n(a) Are the said lands the property of Canada or British Columbia?\n(b) Has Canada or British Columbia the right to explore and exploit the said lands?\n(c) Has Canada or British Columbia legislative jurisdiction in relation to the said lands?\n2. In respect of the mineral and other natural resources of the sea bed and subsoil beyond that part of the territorial sea of Canada referred to in Question 1, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the mineral and other natural resources of the said areas, as between Canada and British Columbia,\n(a) Has Canada or British Columbia the right to explore and exploit the said mineral and other natural resources?\n(b) Has Canada or British Columbia legislative jurisdiction in relation to the said mineral and other natural resources?\nSection 3 of the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act, 1964 (Can.), c. 22, reads as follows:\n3. (1) Subject to any exceptions under section 5, the territorial sea of Canada comprises those areas of the sea having, as their inner limits, the baselines described in section 5 and, as their outer limits, lines measured seaward and equidistant from such baselines so that each point of the outer limit line of the territorial sea is distant three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.\n(2) The internal waters of Canada include any areas of the sea that are on the landward side of the baselines of the territorial sea of Canada.\nAll the provinces of Canada, with the exception of Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were represented on this Reference. Argument was heard from their counsel, who all supported the position taken by the Province of British Columbia. The Attorney General of Canada submitted that the answer to all the questions should be \u201cCanada\u201d. British Columbia submitted it possesses exclusive proprietary rights and sole legislative jurisdiction in relation to the lands in question and enjoys the sole right to exploration and exploitation within the limits defined by the terms of reference. Historical Outline\nFor some years before 1849, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company carried on trading activities in various parts of the land area now known as British Columbia but it was not until July 16, 1849, that a Civil Government was established by the Queen by the appointment of Richard Blanshard as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Vancouver\u2019s Island. In the same month of the same year, the Imperial Parliament enacted a statute to provide for the administration of justice in Vancouver\u2019s Island. This statute is to be found in the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911, vol. IV, p. 115, published in 1913.\nOn January 13, 1849, the Crown granted Vancouver\u2019s Island to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. On April 3, 1867, the Company reconveyed to the Crown whatever lands it had not disposed of.\nOn August 2, 1858, an Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament \u201cto provide for the Government of British Columbia\u201d, that is, the mainland colony. Section 1 of this enactment defines the western boundary of the colony as \u201cthe Pacific Ocean\u201d.\nOn November 19, 1858, a proclamation by the then Governor, Sir James Douglas, introduced into the colony of British Columbia the law of England as of November 19, 1858, (Vancouver Island and British Columbia Statutes, 1858-1871).\nOn December 2, 1858, Sir James Douglas issued a proclamation making it lawful for the Governor of the colony\nby any instrument in print or in writing, or partly in print and partly in writing, under his hand and seal to grant to any person or persons any land belonging to the Crown in the said Colony;\nand providing that\nevery such Instrument shall be valid as against Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors for all the estate and interest expressed to be conveyed by such instrument in the land therein described. (Vancouver Island and British Columbia Statutes 1858-1871)\nOn February 14, 1859, Sir James Douglas issued a proclamation the first paragraph of which read as follows:\n1. All the lands in British Columbia, and all the Mines and Minerals therein, belong to the Crown in fee. (Vancouver Island and British Columbia Statutes 1858-1871) On July 28, 1863, the Imperial Parliament passed an Act to define the boundaries of the colony of British Columbia and to continue an Act to provide for the government of the said colony. Section 3 of this enactment again defines the western boundary of the colony as \u201cthe Pacific Ocean\u201d. (Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911, vol. IV, p. 266.)\nOn August 6, 1866, the Imperial Parliament passed an Act for the union of the colony of Vancouver Island with the colony of British Columbia, Again, the western boundary of British Columbia was defined in the same way. With the proclamation of this Act by the Governor of both colonies on November 19, 1866, the boundaries of British Columbia as we now know them came into being; no changes were made at the time of Confederation. (Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911, vol. IV, p. 273).\nIn 1866, when the present boundaries of British Columbia were established, the Crown in the right of the Colony owned in fee all the unalienated land in British Columbia and all the mines and minerals therein. This was the opinion of the Privy Council in Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada[1], where Lord Watson, in giving judgment at p. 301, used the following language:\nThe title to the public lands of British Columbia has all along been and still is vested in the Crown; but the right to administer and dispose of these lands to settlers, together with all royal and territorial revenues arising therefrom, had been transferred to the Province, before its admission into the federal union.\nIn Attorney General of British Columbia v. Pacific Railway Co.[2], Sir Arthur Wilson, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council, at p. 208, makes the following statement:\nPrior to the time when British Columbia entered the Confederation in 1871, the foreshore in question was Crown property of the Colony, now the Province, of British Columbia.\nThe British North America Act passed in 1867 contemplated the possibility of British Columbia being admitted into the Union. Section 146 of that Act reads as follows:\n146. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty\u2019s Most Honourable Privy Council, on Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or Provinces, or any of them, into the Union, and on Address from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory, or either of them, into the Union, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe Terms of Union whereby the Colony of British Columbia was admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada became effective on July 20, 1871. Paragraph 10 of the Terms of Union made the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, applicable in the following language:\n10. The provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, shall (except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to and only affect one and not the whole of the Provinces now comprising the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this Minute) be applicable to British Columbia, in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the other Provinces of the Dominion, and as if the Colony of British Columbia had been one of the Provinces originally united by the said Act.\nSection 109 of the British North America Act, 1867 was thus made applicable to British Columbia. That section reads as follows:\n109. All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Province in the same.\nThe Privy Council interpreted the above section and has held that whatever Proprietary Rights were vested in the Provinces at the date of Confederation remain so vested unless by the express provisions of the Act transferred to the Dominion: Attorney General of the Dominion of Canada v. The Attorney General for the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia[3].\nAn example of the express transfers referred to above is contained in s. 108 of the Act, which provided that \u201cThe Public Works and Property of each Province enumerated in the Third Schedule to this Act, shall be the Property of Canada.\u201d The judgment of Chief Justice Rinfret in Attorney General of Canada v. Higbie et al.[4], is to like effect:\nUp to the time when British Columbia entered Confederation the title to public lands was in the Crown, and the latter\u2019s prerogative in respect thereof was in full effect. The Crown lands remained vested in His Majesty in right of the Province and His Royal prerogative to deal therewith remained unaltered, subject to any provincial statutory provisions binding the Crown, of which there were none.\nThis historical survey shows that:\n1. Before Confederation all unalienated lands in British Columbia including minerals belonged to the Crown in right of the colony of British Columbia;\n2. After union with Canada such lands remained vested in the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia.\nBut it leaves untouched the problem that we have to face\u2014whether the territorial sea was within the boundary of the Province of British Columbia at the time of Confederation.\nQUESTION 1\u2014The Territorial Sea\nIt will be noted that Question 1(a) asks whether the lands are the \u201cproperty\u201d of Canada or British Columbia. The word \u201cproperty\u201d is susceptible of two meanings here. Canada says that it means rights recognized by international law as described in the Geneva Convention of 1958. The alternative meaning is property in the common law sense, i.e., ownership. British Columbia can only succeed on this branch of the case if it is found that the solum was situate in British Columbia in 1871 at the time of British Columbia\u2019s entry into Confederation. This is the whole purpose of the historical survey set out in the British Columbia factum. British Columbia takes the position that the Province of British Columbia included the territorial sea in 1871. Canada, on the other hand, argues that in 1871 at the time of British Columbia\u2019s entry into the Union, land below the low-water mark was regarded at common law as being outside the realm; that it was not part of the Colony of British Columbia in 1871, and that at, or following Union, it did not become part of the Province of British Columbia. The British North America Act 1871, 34-35 Vict., c. 28, makes provision in s. 2 for the establishment by the Parliament of Canada of new provinces. By s. 3 it provides for the alteration of the limits of the provinces in the following terms:\n3. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time, with the consent of the Legislature of any Province of the said Dominion, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of such Province, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the said Legislature, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any such increase or diminution or alteration of territory in relation to any Province affected thereby.\nThere has never been any alteration of the limits of the Province of British Columbia pursuant to this section and there is no provision for extending the limits in any other way. The history of the province affords no assistance in settling the problem whether the territorial sea was within the boundary of the Province of British Columbia at the time of Confederation. Section 109 of the British North America Act 1867 affords no assistance in the solution of this problem. Therefore, to succeed on this Reference, British Columbia must show that the territorial sea was, in 1871, part of the territory of British Columbia.\nThe question was raised in the Privy Council in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[5], but it was left unanswered at p. 174:\nIn the argument before their Lordships much was said as to an alleged proprietary title in the Province to the shore around its coast within a marine league\u2026 Their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low-water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit, because they are of opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries, and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. They desire, however, to point out that the three-mile limit is something very different from the narrow seas limit discussed by the older authorities such as Selden and Hale, a principle which may safely be said to be now obsolete. The doctrine of the zone comprised in the former limit owes its origin to comparatively modern authorities on public international law. Its meaning is still in controversy. The questions raised thereby affect not only the Empire generally but also the rights of foreign nations as against the Crown, and of the subjects of the Crown as against other nations in foreign territorial waters. Until the Powers have adequately discussed and agreed on the meaning of the doctrine at a conference, it is not desirable that any municipal tribunal should pronounce on it\u2026 Until then the conflict of judicial opinion which arose in R. v. Keyn, 2 Ex. D., 63, is not likely to be satisfactorily settled, nor is a conclusion likely to be reached on the question whether the shore below low-water mark to within three miles of the coast forms part of the territory of the Crown or is merely subject to special powers necessary for protective and police purposes. The obscurity of the whole topic is made plain in the judgment of Cockburn C.J., in that case. But apart from these difficulties, there is the decisive consideration that the question is not one which belongs to the domain of municipal law alone.\nThe question was again raised in Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for the Province of Quebec[6],but was left unanswered at p. 431:\nThe Chief Justice, following their Lordships\u2019 view, expressed in the British Columbia case, declined to answer so much of any of the questions raised as related to the three\u2011mile limit. As to this their Lordships agree with him. It is highly inexpedient, in a controversy of a purely municipal character such as the present, to express an opinion on what is really a question of public international law. If their Lordships thought it proper to entertain such a question they would have directed the Home Government to be notified, inasmuch as the point is one which affects the Empire as a whole.\nThe question came up again in Re Dominion Coal Company Limited[7].That case had to do with the right of the County of Cape Breton to assess for municipal taxation under-sea coal workings of the company. Part of these workings were under inland waters and therefore within the County of Cape Breton and assessable by it. (There was no evidence that these workings formed part of a public harbour within the Third Schedule (s. 108) of the British North America Act so as to involve the Federal Crown Proprietary rights.) Other workings carried on under Spanish Bay were held not to be under inland waters. They were, therefore, outside the municipality and not subject to assessment by that authority. Currie J. dissented on this point and would have held that this part of the operations which was under Spanish Bay was also under inland waters and consequently within the county.\nThe ratio of the judgment was confined within the narrow limits that we have stated. There was, however, a wider discussion in the reasons of MacDonald J. and Currie J. which dealt with the issues with which we are concerned. MacDonald J. stated these issues, including the effect of the decision in Reg. v. Keyn[8] and the effect of the enactment of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878, c. 73. He regarded Reg. v. Keyn as settling the common law rule that the territory of the realm ends at low-water mark and that territorial waters within three miles of this limit are not within the body of adjacent counties or of the realm (p. 629). The Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878, he said, was directed to redefining criminal jurisdiction as to offences in territorial waters and did not purport to affect, nor did it affect, the juridical character of those waters as being outside the territorial limits of the realm and the adjoining counties or confer property rights therein (p. 630). But he was careful to define the problem at p. 626 in these terms:\nBasically the problem is whether one or both of the submarine workings can be said to be within the limits of the municipality.\nAnd again at p. 632:\nAccordingly this Court should refuse to be drawn unnecessarily into a pronouncement of such a nature as the proprietary interest in the maritime belt. Moreover, the Assessment Act in any case does not purport, expressly or by necessary implication, to bring such beds within the territorial limits of the county defined in the Order in Council of 1824, nor to authorize taxation of the property of others situate therein.\nCurrie J. also had an obiter opinion:\nPrior to Confederation, Nova Scotia exercised jurisdiction over territorial waters three miles in width measured from its coasts, bays and rivers, and under s. 109 of the B.N.A. Act, all property rights held by Nova Scotia before Confederation were retained. The subsoil in territorial waters belongs to the Provinces rather than to Canada, subject to certain reservations in the B.N.A. Act.\nWe have already stated the obiter opinion of MacDonald J. delivered in the Dominion Coal case upon the effect of Reg. v. Keyn. This case was argued before the Court of Crown Cases Reserved and the reported judgments are lengthy and diverse. The facts were that the Commander of a foreign ship, the Franconia, was indicted for manslaughter before the Central Criminal Court arising from the loss of life on a British ship which was sunk by the Franconia within three miles of the Port of Dover. The accused was a German national and his ship was on a voyage to a foreign country and was merely passing through English territorial waters at the time of collision. The accused set up a plea of jurisdiction, saying that as the offence was committed out of the United Kingdom by a foreigner on board a foreign ship, it was not within the jurisdiction of the English Criminal Courts.\nThe English Criminal Courts would have had jurisdiction if the act had occurred within the body of a county of England. The question whether the territorial sea was within the body of a county was, therefore, directly in issue. If it had been within the body of the county, the Court of Oyer and Terminer would have had jurisdiction. The majority decision of the court was that the territory of England ends at low-water mark. There was, therefore, no jurisdiction in the Court of Oyer and Terminer. The court also held that the case did not fall within the historical jurisdiction of the Lord High Admiral. That court would have had jurisdiction if the accused had been a British national. The jurisdiction of the Admiral, which begins at low-water mark, did not extend to foreign nationals on foreign ships.\nThe lengthy reasons of the majority are summarized on the branch of the case in which we are particularly interested in the brief judgment of Lush J., which we quote in full:\nI have already announced that, although I had prepared a separate judgment, I did not feel it necessary to deliver it, because, having since perused the judgment which the Lord Chief Justice has just read, I found that we agreed entirely in our conclusions, and that I agreed in the main with the reasons upon which those conclusions are founded. I wish, however, to guard myself from being supposed to adopt any words or expressions which may seem to imply a doubt as to the competency of Parliament to legislate as it may think fit for these waters. I think that usage and the common consent of nations, which constitute international law, have appropriated these waters to the adjacent State to deal with them as the State may deem expedient for its own interests. They are, therefore, in the language of diplomacy and of international law, termed by a convenient metaphor the territorial waters of Great Britain, and the same or equivalent phrases are used in some of our statutes denoting that this belt of sea is under the exclusive dominion of the State. But the dominion is the dominion of Parliament, not the dominion of the common law. That extends no further than the limits of the realm. In the reign of Richard II the realm consisted of the land within the body of the counties. All beyond low-water mark was part of the high seas. At that period the three-mile radius had not been thought of. International law, which, upon this subject at least, has grown up since that period, cannot enlarge the area of our municipal law, nor could treaties with all the nations of the world have that effect. That can only be done by Act of Parliament. As no such Act has been passed, it follows that what was out of the realm then is out of the realm now, and what was part of the high seas then is part of the high seas now; and upon the high seas the Admiralty jurisdiction was confined to British ships. Therefore, although, as between nation and nation, these waters are British territory, as being under the exclusive dominion of Great Britain, in judicial language they are out of the realm, and any exercise of criminal jurisdiction over a foreign ship in these waters must in my judgment be authorized by an Act of Parliament.\nAs a result of this decision, Parliament enacted the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878, 41-42 Vict., c. 73. This Act declares that all offences committed on the open sea within one marine league of the coast of any part of Her Majesty\u2019s Dominions to be within the jurisdiction of the Admiral. The Act did no more than deal with what was regarded as a gap in the Admiral\u2019s jurisdiction. It did not enlarge the realm of England, nor did it purport to deal with the juridical character of British territorial waters and the sea-bed beneath them.\nWe have to take it, therefore, that even after the enactment of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act the majority opinion in Reg. v. Keyn that the territory of England ends at low\u2011water mark was undisturbed.\nThe application of the Act of 1878 is relevant to the problem under consideration here. The Admiral\u2019s jurisdiction was made to extend to all offences committed on the open sea within one marine league of the coast of any part of Her Majesty\u2019s Dominions. The term \u201coffence\u201d was defined in the Act as \u201cany act of such a nature that it would, if committed within the body of an English county, be punishable on indictment according to the law of England at the time being in force\u201d. What would have happened in 1879 if an offence had been committed within one marine league of the coast of British Columbia? Had the case come up in a British Columbia court, the applicable law would not have been the criminal law of Canada but the law of England for the time being in force. If the territory of British Columbia had extended one marine league from low-water mark, the offence would have occurred within Canada and Canadian criminal law ought to have been applicable, but by the express terms of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act it was the law of England that applied. The legislation is inconsistent with any theory that in 1878 the Province of British Columbia possessed as part of its territory the solum of the territorial sea. Equally inconsistent with any such theory is early Canadian legislation. The Customs Act 1867, 31 Vict., c. 6, s. 83, deals with vessels \u201chovering (in British waters) within one league of the coasts or shores of Canada\u201d.\nAn Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels, 1868, 31 Vict., c. 61, s. 1, empowers the Governor to grant licences to foreign vessels to fish\nin British waters, within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours whatever, of Canada, not included within the limits specified and described in the first article of the convention between His late Majesty King George the Third and the United States of America, made and signed at London on the twentieth day of October, 1818.\nIn contrast, An Act to amend The Customs Act, Statutes of Canada 1928, 18-19 Geo. V., c. 16, s. 1, speaks on two occasions of vessels hovering in \u201cterritorial waters of Canada\u201d and proceeds to define for the purposes of the section and s. 207 of the Customs Act the territorial waters of Canada in the following terms:\n\u201cTerritorial waters of Canada\u201d, shall mean the waters forming part of the territory of the Dominion of Canada and the waters adjacent to the Dominion within three marine miles thereof, in the case of any vessel, and within twelve marine miles thereof, in the case of any vessel registered in Canada.\nRegina v. Keyn was decided in 1876. In the following year it was considered in two reported cases: Harris v. Franconia[9] and Blackpool Pier Co. v. Fylde Union[10]. In Harris v. Franconia there was a motion to set aside an order for the service of a writ on a foreigner residing abroad in respect of a cause of action arising at sea below low-water mark though within three miles of the English coast. The judges were Lord Coleridge C.J., Grove J., and Denman J. These were three minority judges in Reg. v. Keyn and they were all of the opinion that that case decided that the territory of England and the sovereignty of the Queen stopped at low\u2011water mark (except where under special circumstances and in special Acts, Parliament had thought fit to extend it).\nIn the Blackpool Pier case Lord Coleridge held that the pier extended 500 feet beyond low\u2011water mark and was therefore beyond the realm of England and was not assessable to that extent for poor rate under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1867. The other judge was Grove J. To express our conclusion up to this point, we adopt the summary in Coulson & Forbes on Waters and Land Drainage, 6th ed., 1952, at p. 12:\n1. The realm of England where it abuts upon the open sea only extends to low water mark; all beyond is the high sea.\n2. For the distance of three miles, and in some cases more, international law has conceded an extension of dominion over the seas washing the shores.\n3. This concession is evidenced by treaty or by long usage.\n4. In no case can the concession extend the realm of England so as to make the conceded portion liable to the common law, or to vest the soil of the bed in the Crown. This must be done by the act of the Legislature.\nWe do not intend to trace the history of the claims to the territorial sea in International Law. That history is conveniently summarized in the work, published in 1965, by D.P. O\u2019Connell on International Law, vol. I, pp. 523-528. Very wide claims have been made from time to time. In Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[11], as we have observed, the Privy Council said:\nThey desire, however, to point out that the three-mile limit is something very different from the narrow seas limit discussed by the older authorities such as Selden and Hale, a principle which may safely be said to be now obsolete.\nThe logical starting point is now the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone which may now be regarded as defining the present state of international law on this subject. We set out Articles 1 to 4(1). (The rest of Article 4 deals with methods of drawing baselines):\nArticle 1. 1. The sovereignty of a State extends, beyond its land territory and its internal waters, to a belt of sea adjacent to its coast, described as the territorial sea.\n2. This sovereignty is exercised subject to the provisions of these articles and to other rules of international law.\nArticle 2. The sovereignty of a coastal State extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.\nArticle 3. Except where otherwise provided in these articles, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State.\nArticle 4. 1. In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This Convention was signed by Canada on April 29, 1959, but not yet ratified. It came into force on September 10, 1964, upon ratification by a sufficient number of nations.\nThe Convention does not state the width of the territorial sea over which the sovereignty of the state is recognized. A second conference which was held in 1960 was unable to reach any agreement on this subject. The claims of the various states of the world as to the extent of the territorial sea are set out in D.P. O\u2019Connell\u2019s International Law, Vol. I, pp. 531-2. Canada claims three nautical miles plus nine nautical miles for fishing. (Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act, 13 Eliz. II, Statutes of Canada 1964, c. 22, s. 3 (quoted at the beginning of these reasons) and s. 4 as to the extent of the fishing zones.)\nWe have already said that, in our opinion, in 1871 the Province of British Columbia did not have ownership or property in the territorial sea and that the province has not, since entering into Confederation, acquired such ownership or property. We are not disputing the proposition that while British Columbia was a Crown Colony the British Crown might have conferred upon the Governor or Legislature of the colony rights to which the British Crown was entitled under international law but the historical record of the colony does not disclose any such action.\nThis brings us to the Conception Bay case, The Direct United States Cable Company v. The Anglo-American Telegraph Company.[12] The Supreme Court of Newfoundland had granted an injunction to prevent the appellant, The Direct United States Cable Company, from infringing certain rights which Newfoundland had granted to the respondent company, Anglo-American Telegraph. The appellant had laid a telegraph cable to a buoy more than thirty miles within Conception Bay, which is on the east coast of Newfoundland between two promontories which are slightly more than twenty miles apart. The average width of the Bay is fifteen miles. The distance from the head of the Bay to the two promontories is forty miles on one side and fifty miles on the other. The buoy and cable were more than three miles from the shore of the Bay. The appeal was dismissed in the Privy Council and the injunction upheld. This was done for two reasons. First, there was legislation of Newfoundland, 17 Vict., c. 2, which authorized the prohibition of the laying of the cable. Second, there was legislation of the Imperial Legislature, 59 Geo. 1ll, c. 38, which asserted exclusive dominion over the Bay. This legislation had never been questioned by any foreign state and, by 35-36 Vict., c. 45, the Imperial Legislature conferred upon the Legislature of Newfoundland the right to legislate with regard to Conception Bay as part of the territory of Newfoundland. This is the ratio of the case and it does not carry with it any general delegation by the British Crown over the territorial sea surrounding Newfoundland.\nRex v. Burt[13] was concerned with the seizure of a ship carrying a cargo of intoxicating liquor off Chance Harbour in the County of Saint John within approximately one and three-quarter miles from shore. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the locus of the seizure was part of the Province of New Brunswick and that the offence, as set forth in the conviction under appeal, was committed within the Province of New Brunswick and within the body of a county.\nThis case is within the principle of the Conception Bay case. It is based upon the fact that\nby the Royal Instructions issued to Governor Carleton upon the separation of what is now the Province of New Brunswick from the Province of Nova Scotia, the southern boundary of the new Province was defined as \u201ca line in the centre of the Bay of Fundy from the River Saint Croix aforesaid to the mouth of the Musquat (Missiquash) River\u201d clearly indicating the claim of Great Britain at that time to the whole of the Bay of Fundy as a portion of her territory.\nThe place of seizure was therefore within the Province of New Brunswick. As in the Conception Bay case, this case did not involve a delegation by the British Crown of its rights in the territorial sea.\nIn Capital City Canning and Packing Company, Limited v. Anglo-British Columbia Packing Company, Limited[14], the British Columbia Court was concerned with a fishing lease granted by the province entitling the plaintiff to erect and operate traps for the purpose of taking salmon on certain foreshore and tidal lands. The defendant also had a similar lease. The decision of Duff J. was that there was no right to grant these leases in the province because they did not come within the terms of the enabling legislation, but he did say at p. 339:\nBy that clause it is enacted that, \u201c \u2018Crown lands\u2019 shall mean all lands of this Province held by the Crown without incumbrance\u201d. The site of the defendant\u2019s trap is not, in my opinion, within this definition. It was not disputed, and I assume for the purpose of this application, that this site is intra fauces terrae. The bed of the sea in such places is part of the territorial possessions of the Crown; and\u2014except in the case of public harbours, within the disposition of the Provincial Legislature\u2014is comprehended within the terms of the description, \u201clands of this Province held by the Crown\u201d. But this ownership of the soil, is subject to the servitudes arising from the public rights of navigation and fishing and the rights concomitant with and subsidiary to them; and I apprehend that property held under a title so weighted, cannot (in the ordinary meaning of the words or within any signification fairly to be imputed to them as they stand in the clause I am discussing) be said to fall within the qualification expressed by the phrase, \u201cheld without incumbrance\u201d.\nThe concession and assumption that the locus quo in the case was intra fauces terrae is fundamental to the judgment finding that this was Crown property in right of the province. It is no authority for any general statement that the territorial sea was ever within the limits of the Province of British Columbia.\nClosely related to these cases is Reg. v. Cunningham[15], where the whole of the Bristol Channel was stated to be within the bodies of the Counties of Glamorgan and Somerset. In that case, the crime, which was tried at the Glamorgan Assizes, was committed on board an American ship in the Penarth Roads in Bristol Channel three-quarters of a mile from the coast of Glamorganshire at a spot never left dry by the tide but within one-quarter of a mile from the land, which is left dry by the tide. The Fagernes[16] is inconsistent with Reg. v. Cunningham as to the status of the Bristol Channel. The Fagernes was decided upon the admission by the Attorney General and the acceptance of that admission by the majority of the Court as conclusive that the spot where this collision was alleged to have occurred was not within the limits to which the territorial sovereignty of His Majesty extended. The spot in question was 10\u00bd to 12 miles from the English coast and 7\u00bd or 9\u00bd miles from the Welsh coast.\nThe Attorney General for British Columbia relied on certain dicta in some mid-19th century cases which are contrary to the majority judgment in Reg. v. Keyn. These dicta have all to be taken subject to the caution expressed by the Privy Council in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[17] and quoted above.\nIn Attorney General v. Chambers[18], Lord Cranworth said at p. 212-3:\nThe Crown is clearly in such a case, according to all the authorities, entitled to the littus maris as well as to the soil of the sea itself adjoining the coasts of England. What then, according to the authorities in our law, is the extent of this littus maris?\nThe point at issue in the case was the ownership of certain coal seams lying under \u201cthat part of the Parish of Llanelly which was contiguous to the seashore and particularly under the land known by the name of Old Castle Farm.\u201d The actual decision was that in the absence of all evidence of particular usage, the extent of the right of the Crown to the seashore landwards is prima facie limited by the line of the medium high tide between the springs and the neaps.\nThe Cornwall Submarine Mines Act 1858, 21-22 Vict., c. 109, is no authority of general application in support of British Columbia\u2019s claim of ownership of the territorial waters. The dispute was between the Crown and the Duchy of Cornwall concerning the ownership of mines below low-water mark. The Duchy of Cornwall extends to low-water mark. The mines had been carried out beyond the low-water mark. An arbitrator decided that the mines and minerals below low-water mark belonged to the Crown, on the landward side to the Duchy of Cornwall. The legislation above referred to was enacted to give statutory effect to the award. We adopt the analysis of Cockburn C.J. in the Keyn case, at p. 201, as follows:\nThis was a bill for the settlement of the question as to the right to particular mines and minerals between the Crown and the duchy, a measure in which both the royal personages particularly concerned and their respective advisers concurred, and in which no other person whatever was interested \u2026 To whom would it occur that, in passing it, Parliament was asserting the right of the Crown to the bed of the sea over the three-mile distance, instead of settling a dispute as to the specific mines which were in question?\nIn Gammell v. Woods and Forest Commissioners[19], the question was the exclusive right of the Crown to the salmon fishery on the coast of Scotland. Lord Wensleydale expressed the following opinion:\nThat it would be hardly possible to extend fishing seaward beyond the distance of three miles, which, by the acknowledged law of nations, belongs to the coast of the country\u2014that which is under the dominion of the country by being within cannon range\u2014and so capable of being kept in perpetual possession.\nThe actual decision in the case was made on the following propositions:\n1. The salmon-fishings in the open sea around the coast of Scotland, unless parted with by grant, belong exclusively to the Crown, and form part of its hereditary revenue.\n2. This right of the Crown is not merely a right of fishing for salmon, but \u201ca right to the salmon-fishings around the sea-coast of Scotland\u201d.\n3. It is not to be regarded simply as an attribute of sovereignty, but rather as a patrimonium, a beneficial interest constituting part of the regal hereditary property.\n4. Salmon fishings in the open sea around the coast of Scotland may not only become the subject of a royal grant, but they may be feudalized.\n5. The assertion that the sea is common to all, and that there can be no appropriation of it, except where it adjoins the shore, is an erroneous assertion.\n6. The Statute 7 & 8 Vict., c. 95, recognizes and proceeds on these principles.\nIn Gann v. Whitstable Free Fishers[20], there are similar dicta on Crown ownership of the three\u2011mile limit. The plaintiffs, who were the owners of an oyster bed in Whitstable Bay, claimed tolls for anchorage. The plaintiffs claimed as owners of a free fishery within the Manor of Whitstable. They proved their title from 1775 onwards. They were held not to be entitled to these tolls because whatever their grant was, they took subject to the public right of navigation, which included the right to anchors Again, this case is no authority for any general proposition that, contrary to Keyn, the soil of the sea outside the body of a county and within the three-mile limit was vested in the Crown.\nBetween 1891 and 1916 there were four cases containing judicial dicta asserting Crown ownership of the territorial sea. These are: Lord Advocate v. Clyde[21]; Lord Advocate v. Wemyss[22]; Lord Fitzhardinge v. Purcell[23]; Secretary of State for India v. Rao[24]. Lord Advocate v. Clyde dealt with Crown rights in Loch Long. The decision was that the solum of Loch Long was vested in the Crown, the loch being intra fauces terrae. The opinion of Lord Justice-Clerk at p. 180 was that it was unnecessary to consider ownership of the solum of the territorial sea. Two judges, however, stated their opinion on this matter to the effect that ownership was in the Crown.\nIn Lord Advocate v. Wemyss, a proprietor of estates adjoining the sea claimed the coal below low-water mark. The decision was in favour of the Crown that baronies of Wemyss, on an interpretation of the grants, included the minerals under the foreshore only. The case also held that the Crown lease granted to the trustees of a minor for the benefit of the minor could not be repudiated after the minor had obtained his majority and had affirmed the lease. Lord Watson\u2019s dictum is at p. 60:\nI see no reason to doubt that, by the law of Scotland, the solum underlying the waters of the ocean, whether within the narrow seas, or from the coast outward to the three-mile limit, and also the minerals beneath it, are vested in the Crown.\nIn Fitzhardinge v. Purcell, the defendant claimed the right to hunt for ducks on the foreshore of the River Severn, a tidal and navigable river. He was sued for trespass by the lord of certain manors adjoining the river. The judgment was that the plaintiff had proved his title to the foreshore as part of the manors. The rights of the public were confined to navigation and fishing on the foreshore. Mr. Justice Parker expressed the opinion that \u201cthe bed of the sea, at any rate for some distance below low-water mark, and the beds of tidal navigable rivers, are prima facie vested in the Crown \u2026\u201d The manors were in the County of Gloucester. The river was tidal and navigable at this point. The waters were clearly inland waters and not part of the territorial sea.\nIn the Indian case, the dispute was over the ownership of three small islands which had appeared between 1840 and 1860 off the coast of Madras. They were within three miles of the shore. Certain parcels of the land were claimed by two zemindars. The High Court of Madras had awarded these parcels to the zemindars. The Privy Council based its decision upon the following proposition taken from Hale\u2019s de Juris Maris:\nThe lands in dispute fall under the third category, which is thus dealt with by Hale:\u2014\n3. The third sort of maritime increase are islands arising de novo in the king\u2019s seas, or the king\u2019s arms thereof. These upon the same account and reason prima facie and of common right belong to the king; for they are part of that soil of the sea, that belonged before in point of propriety to the king; for when islands de novo arise, it is either by the recess or sinking of the water, or else by the exaggeration of sand and slubb, which in process of time grow firm land environed with water.\nThe reasons of Lord Shaw also quoted with approval all the dicta that we have referred to in the three previous cases and are undoubtedly based on the proposition that the islands were Crown land because located in the territorial sea. This is Hale\u2019s proposition. An alternative explanation is given in Oppenheim\u2019s International Law, vol. 1, 8th ed., p. 565:\n234. The natural processes which create alluvions on the shore and banks, and deltas at the mouths of rivers, together with other processes, may lead to the birth of new islands. If they rise on the high seas outside the territorial maritime belt, they belong to no State, and may be acquired through occupation on the part of any State. But if they arise in rivers, lakes, or within the maritime belt, they are, according to the Law of Nations, considered accretions to the neighbouring land.\nSo far, we are of the opinion that the territorial sea lay outside the limits of the Colony of British Columbia in 1871 and did not become part of British Columbia following union with Canada. We are also of the opinion that British Columbia did not acquire jurisdiction over the territorial sea following union with Canada.\nAfter 1871, the extent of the jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia is to be found in the British North America Act. The effect of the union was that the former Colony of British Columbia became part of the larger Dominion of Canada. At that date Canada was not a sovereign state.\nAs late as 1926, the Privy Council decided in Nadan v. The King[25] that s. 1025 of the Criminal Code of Canada if and so far as it was intended to prevent the King in Council from giving leave to appeal against an order of a Canadian Court in a criminal case, was invalid. The ratio is contained in the following extract at p. 492 of the report:\nUnder what authority, then, can a right so established and confirmed be abrogated by the Parliament of Canada? The British North America Act, by s. 91, empowered the Dominion Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to matters not coming within the classes of subjects by that Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and in particular it gave to the Canadian Parliament exclusive legislative authority in respect of \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters\u201d. But however widely these powers are construed they are confined to action to be taken in the Dominion; and they do not appear to their Lordships to authorize the Dominion Parliament to annul the prerogative right of the King in Council to grant special leave to appeal.\nOn the other hand, in Croft v. Dunphy[26], the Privy Council decided that in order to support Dominion legislation enacted in 1928 against hovering in \u201cCanadian waters\u201d within twelve miles of the Canadian coast, it was unnecessary to argue that the Statute of Westminster had retrospective operation.\nIt will thus be seen that when the Imperial Parliament in 1867 conferred on the Parliament of Canada full power to legislate regarding customs, it had long been the practice to include in Imperial statutes relating to this branch of law executive provisions to take effect outside ordinary territorial limits. The measures against \u201chovering\u201d were no doubt enacted by the Imperial Parliament because they were deemed necessary to render anti-smuggling legislation effective. In these circumstances it is difficult to conceive that the Imperial Parliament in bestowing plenary powers on the Dominion Parliament to legislate in relation to customs should have withheld from it the power to enact provisions similar in scope to those which had long been an integral part of Imperial customs legislation and which presumably were regarded as necessary to its efficacy: cf. Att.-Gen. for Canada v. Cain (1906) A.C. 542. The British North America Act imposed no such restriction in terms and their Lordships see no justification for inferring it, nor do they find themselves constrained to import it by any of the cases to which they were referred by the respondent, for these cases are not in pari materia.\nThe rights in the territorial sea formerly asserted by the British Crown in respect of the Colony of British Columbia were after 1871 asserted by the British Crown in respect of the Dominion of Canada. We have already dealt with the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act of the Imperial Parliament in 1878. To summarize, its effect was that the United Kingdom clearly claimed jurisdiction over a territorial sea in respect of the Dominion of Canada. During the period prior to 1919, Canada had only limited rights to legislate in respect of the territorial sea. Legislation of the Dominion Parliament in 1867 and 1868, previously quoted, referred to these waters as \u201cBritish waters\u201d. Not until 1928 did Canadian legislation refer to these waters as the \u201cterritorial waters of Canada\u201d.\nThere can be no doubt now that Canada has become a sovereign state. Its sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, 22 Geo. V., c. 4. Section 3 of the Statute of Westminster provides in an absolutely clear manner and without any restrictions that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.\nIt is Canada which is recognized by international law as having rights in the territorial sea adjacent to the Province of British Columbia. Canada signed and implemented by legislation the Pacific Salmon Fisheries Convention and the Pacific Fur Seals Convention, 1957 (Can.), c. 11 and c. 31. The first of these was between Canada and the United States in respect of the salmon fisheries in the Fraser River system, and the second was a convention among the governments of Canada, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America.\nCanada has now full constitutional capacity to acquire new areas of territory and new jurisdictional rights which may be available under international law. The territorial sea now claimed by Canada was defined in the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act of 1964 referred to in Question 1 of the Order-in-Council. The effect of that Act, coupled with the Geneva Convention of 1958, is that Canada is recognized in international law as having sovereignty over a territorial sea three nautical miles wide. It is part of the territory of Canada.\nThe sovereign state which has the property in the bed of the territorial sea adjacent to British Columbia is Canada. At no time has British Columbia, either as a colony or a province, had property in these lands. It is the sovereign state of Canada that has the right, as between Canada and British Columbia, to explore and exploit these lands, and Canada has exclusive legislative jurisdiction in respect of them either under s. 91(1) (a) of the British North America Act or under the residual power in s. 91. British Columbia has no legislative jurisdiction since the lands in question are outside its boundaries. The lands under the territorial sea do not fall within any of the enumerated heads of s. 92 since they are not within the province.\nLegislative jurisdiction with respect to such lands must, therefore, belong exclusively to Canada, for the subject matter is one not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces within the meaning of the initial words of s. 91 and may, therefore, properly be regarded as a matter affecting Canada generally and covered by the expression \u201cthe peace, order and good government of Canada\u201d.\nThe mineral resources of the lands underlying the territorial sea are of concern to Canada as a whole and go beyond local or provincial concern or interests.\nMoreover, the rights in the territorial sea arise by international law and depend upon recognition by other sovereign states. Legislative jurisdiction in relation to the lands in question belongs to Canada which is a sovereign state recognized by international law and thus able to enter into arrangements with other states respecting the rights in the territorial sea.\nCanada is a signatory to the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone and may become a party to other international treaties and conventions affecting rights in the territorial sea.\nWe answer Questions 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c) in favour of Canada.\nQUESTION 2\u2014The Continental Shelf\nInternational law in relation to the continental shelf is a recent development. Lord Asquith said in the Abu Dhabi Arbitration[27] that in the year 1939 it did not exist as a legal doctrine. It was foreshadowed by the agreement between Great Britain and Venezuela\u2014\u201cTreaty Relating to the Submarine Areas of the Gulf of Paria\u201d, February 26, 1942,\u2014and the Truman Proclamation of 1945 No. 2667, September 28, 1945, Code of Federal Regulations 12303, 1943-48, Title 3, p. 67. We will deal with these two briefly in order.\nVenezuela had annexed certain parts of the submarine areas of the Gulf of Paria. The two states, Great Britain acting on behalf of Trinidad and Tobago, then made the above recited agreement. Following the agreement, an Order-in-Council was issued (United Kingdom (Trinidad and Tobago) Submarine Areas of the Gulf of Paria (Annexation)) dated August 6, 1942. The Order-in-Council recites:\n\u2026 and whereas the Government of the Republic of Venezuela have annexed to Venezuela certain parts of the submarine areas of the Gulf of Paria: and whereas it is expedient that the rest of the submarine area of the Gulf of Paria should be annexed to and form part of His Majesty\u2019s dominions and should be attached to the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago for administrative purposes \u2026\nWe set out the Truman Proclamation of 1945 in full:\nPRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION 2667, SEPTEMBER 28, 1945, WITH RESPECT TO NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE SUBSOIL AND SEA BED OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF\n10 Federal Register 12303(1945)\nWHEREAS the Government of the United States of America, aware of the long range world-wide need for new sources of petroleum and other minerals, holds the view that efforts to discover and make available new supplies of these resources should be encouraged; and\nWHEREAS its competent experts are of the opinion that such resources underlie many parts of the continental shelf off the coasts of the United States of America, and that with modern technological progress their utilization is already practicable or will become so at an early date; and\nWHEREAS recognized jurisdiction over these resources is required in the interest of their conservation and prudent utilization when and as development is undertaken; and\nWHEREAS it is the view of the Government of the United States that the exercise of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf by the contiguous nation is reasonable and just, since the effectiveness of measures to utilize or conserve these resources would be contingent upon cooperation and protection from the shore, since the continental shelf may be regarded as an extension of the land mass of the coastal nation and thus naturally appurtenant to it, since these resources frequently form a seaward extension of a pool or deposit lying within the territory, and since self-protection compels the coastal nation to keep close watch over activities off its shores which are of the nature necessary for utilization of these resources:\nNOW THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the following policy of the United States of America with respect to the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf.\nHaving concern for the urgency of conserving and prudently utilizing its natural resources, the Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control. In cases where the continental shelf extends to the shores of another state, or is shared with an adjacent state, the boundary shall be determined by the United States and the state concerned in accordance with equitable principles. The character as high seas of the waters above the continental shelf and the right to their free and unimpeded navigation are in no way thus affected.\nThe 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf defines the rights that a coastal state may exercise over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural resources. Articles 4 and 5 deal with the obligations and responsibilities which must be assumed. Article 6 deals with the problem of delimiting the boundaries of the shelf when it is adjacent to the territories of two or more states which are opposite or adjacent to each other. We set out Articles 1 to 5.\nArticle 1. For the purpose of these articles, the term \u201ccontinental shelf\u201d is used as referring (a) to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas; (b) to the seabed and subsoil of similar areas adjacent to the coasts of islands.\nArticle 2. 1. The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\n2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities, or make a claim to the continental shelf, without the express consent of the coastal State.\n3. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation.\n4. The natural resources referred to in these articles consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the sea-bed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the sea-bed or the subsoil.\nArticle 3. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the airspace above those waters.\nArticle 4. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines on the continental shelf.\nArticle 5. 1. The exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources must not result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation, fishing or the conservation of the living resources of the sea, nor result in any interference with fundamental oceanographic or other scientific research carried out with the intention of open publication.\n2. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 6 of this article, the coastal State is entitled to construct and maintain or operate on the continental shelf installations and other devices necessary for its exploration and the exploitation of its natural resources, and to establish safety zones around such installations and devices and to take in those zones measures necessary for their protection.\n3. The safety zones referred to in paragraph 2 of this article may extend to a distance of 500 metres around the installations and other devices which have been erected, measured from each point of their outer edge. Ships of all nationalities must respect these safety zones.\n4. Such installations and devices, though under the jurisdiction of the coastal State, do not possess the status of islands. They have no territorial sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea of the coastal State.\n5. Due notice must be given of the construction of any such installations, and permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained. Any installations which are abandoned or disused must be entirely removed.\n6. Neither the installations or devices, nor the safety zones around them, may be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognized sea lanes essential to international navigation.\n7. The coastal State is obliged to undertake, in the safety zones, all appropriate measures for the protection of the living resources of the sea from harmful agents.\n8. The consent of the coastal State shall be obtained in respect of any research concerning the continental shelf and undertaken there. Nevertheless, the coastal State shall not normally withhold its consent if the request is submitted by a qualified institution with a view to purely scientific research into the physical or biological characteristics of the continental shelf, subject to the proviso that the coastal State shall have the right, if it so desires, to participate or to be represented in the research, and that in any event the results shall be published.\nThe responsibilities of the coastal state under international law set out in Articles 4 and 5 are many and onerous.\nThis Convention has been signed by Canada but to date has not been ratified. It came into force on June 10, 1964, upon ratification by a sufficient number of states and it defines the present state of international law on these matters. The United States had anticipated the jurisdiction given by this Convention as early as 1953 by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Laws of 83rd Congress, First Session, 1953, ss. 2 and 3.\nSec. 3. Jurisdiction Over Outer Continental Shelf.\u2014.\n(a) It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition as provided in this Act.\nThe United Kingdom enacted the Continental Shelf Act in 1964, (Imp.), c. 29. There was similar legislation enacted in New Zealand in the same year (Statutes of New Zealand, 1964, No. 28). The rights now recognized by international law to explore and exploit the natural resources of the continental shelf do not involve any extension of the territorial sea. The superjacent waters continue to be recognized as high seas.\nAs with the territorial sea, so with the continental shelf. There are two reasons why British Columbia lacks the right to explore and exploit and lacks legislative jurisdiction:\n(1) The continental shelf is outside the boundaries of British Columbia, and\n(2) Canada is the sovereign state which will be recognized by international law as having the rights stated in the Convention of 1958, and it is Canada, not the Province of British Columbia, that will have to answer the claims of other members of the international community for breach of the obligations and responsibilities imposed by the Convention.\nThere is no historical, legal or constitutional basis upon which the Province of British Columbia could claim the right to explore and exploit or claim legislative jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf.\nWe answer Questions 2(a) and 2(b) in favour of Canada.\nAnswers to the questions submitted on the Reference\nOur answers to the questions submitted to the Court are, therefore, as follows:\n1. In respect of the lands, including the mineral and other natural resources, of the sea bed and subsoil seaward from the ordinary low-water mark on the coast of the mainland and the several islands of British Columbia, outside the harbours, bays, estuaries and other similar inland waters, to the outer limit of the territorial sea of Canada, as defined in the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act, Statutes of Canada 1964, Chapter 22, as between Canada and British Columbia,\n(a) Are the said lands the property of Canada or British Columbia?\nAnswer: Canada.\n(b) Has Canada or British Columbia the right to explore and exploit the said lands?\nAnswer: Canada.\n(c) Has Canada or British Columbia legislative jurisdiction in relation to the said lands?\nAnswer: Canada.\n2. In respect of the mineral and other natural resources of the sea bed and subsoil beyond that part of the territorial sea of Canada referred to in Question 1, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the mineral and other natural resources of the said areas, as between Canada and British Columbia,\n(a) Has Canada or British Columbia the right to explore and exploit the said mineral and other natural resources?\nAnswer: Canada.\n(b) Has Canada or British Columbia legislative jurisdiction in relation to the said mineral and other natural resources?\nAnswer: Canada.\nWe hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are our reasons for the answers to the questions referred herein for hearing and consideration.\n[1] (1889), 14 App. Cas. 295.\n[2] [1906] A.C. 204.\n[3] [1898] A.C. 700.\n[4] [1945] S.C.R. 385 at 409, 3 D.L.R. 1.\n[5] [1914] A.C. 153 at 174.\n[6] [1921] 1 A.C. 413 at 431.\n[7] (1963), 40 D.L.R.

Following the imposition of a sentence, an application was made under s. 661 of the Criminal Code to have him declared a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of s. 659(b) of the Code. The appellant\u2019s previous record showed a conviction some five years before on eighteen charges for similar offences. The evidence of the two psychiatrists was to the effect that the appellant was likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind with other consenting adult males, that he had never caused injury, pain or other evil to any person and was not likely to do so in the future. The judge imposed a sentence of preventive detention. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories was dismissed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law: (i) whether there was evidence that he was a person who had shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) whether the evidence could support the conclusion that he had shown such a failure and was likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a further sexual offence.\nHeld (Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ.: Under the new definition of \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d, as enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 32, the likelihood of the commission of a further sexual offence has been added and made an alternative element to that of the danger of injury to others. Applied to this case, this new definition justified the concurrent findings of the Courts below that the appellant, having shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and that he was likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind, was a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning which Parliament ascribed to this expression. The intent and object of the provisions dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is not solely to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses rendered them a source of danger.\nPer Cartwright and Hall JJ., dissenting: The intent and object of the sections of the Code dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger. The words \u201ca further sexual offence\u201d are general words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual element. Applying the maxim verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae to s. 659(b) of the Code, the concluding words of the section should be given the meaning \u201cor is likely to commit a further sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person\u201d. On this view of s. 659(b), it was clear that the finding that the appellant was a dangerous sexual offender could not stand as it would be directly contrary to the evidence.\nDroit criminel\u2014D\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux\u2014Homosexuel\u2014D\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014Est-il un d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 149, 659(b) [tel que d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, art. 32], 661.\nL\u2019appelant a admis sa culpabilit\u00e9 sur quatre chefs d\u2019accusation de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence sous l\u2019art. 149 du Code Criminel.

Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Cartwright et Hall \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories, affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nB.A. Crane, for the appellant.\nJohn A. Scollin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories pronounced on October 26, 1966, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Sissons J. pronounced on March 9, 1966, finding that the appellant was a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of the Criminal Code and imposing a sentence of preventive detention upon him in lieu of the sentences imposed by Magistrate Parker to be mentioned hereafter.\nThe appeal to this Court was by leave granted on March 22, 1967, under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259. The order of this Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:\n(1) Whether there was evidence before Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to control his sexual impulses.\n(2) Whether the evidence before Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused \u201chas shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence\u201d.\nThe facts are not in dispute and may be stated briefly.\nOn the morning of August 16, 1965, the appellant was arrested by the R.C.M.P. at Pine Point, N.W.T., as a result of an investigation with respect to a charge of arson (in which he was not involved). In the evening of August 16 he was taken to Hay River after he had given the police a statement. On August 17 the accused was arraigned before Magistrate Parker on four charges of gross indecency under s. 149 of the Criminal Code as follows:\n1. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic\u2019s helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 21st day of December, 1964 and the 6th day of August 1965 at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with William Gordon Mellett, another male person, contrary to Section 149 of the Criminal Code.\n2. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic\u2019s helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of May, 1965 and the 15th day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Patrick Betty, another male person, contrary to Section 149 of the Criminal Code.\n3. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic\u2019s helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 10th day of July, 1965, and the 31st day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with David Frank L\u2019Heureux, another male person, contrary to Section 149 of the Criminal Code.\n4. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic\u2019s helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of July, 1965 and the 10th day of August, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Christopher Logan Wolff, another male person, contrary to Section 149 of the Criminal Code. Pleas of guilty were entered to each charge and the appellant was remanded in custody until August 24, 1965, at Fort Smith, at which time Magistrate Parker imposed a sentence of three years concurrent with respect to each charge.\nFollowing such conviction and sentence a notice of application under s. 661 of the Criminal Code to have the appellant declared a dangerous sexual offender was served on him. The appellant was examined by two psychiatrists on behalf of the Crown, Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher, nominated by the Attorney General pursuant to s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code, and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald.\nThe application was heard before Sissons J. The Crown proved the four convictions before Magistrate Parker. Corporal Armstrong of the R.C.M.P., who had laid the information and had been present at the trial before the Magistrate, identified the appellant as the person convicted but was not asked by either counsel for the Crown or for the defence for any particulars of the offences to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. Corporal Armstrong produced the fingerprints and fingerprint certificates of the appellant which included a record of his conviction on May 4, 1960, on eighteen charges of gross indecency contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code on which he was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently.\nNo evidence was adduced as to the nature of the acts committed by the appellant in respect of either the four substantive charges to which he had pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker or the eighteen other charges upon which he had been convicted in 1960.\nThe Crown called the evidence of the two psychiatrists mentioned above, each of whom gave evidence as to, inter alia, statements made to him by the appellant during his examination.\nIt was held by this Court in Wilband v. The Queen[1], that a psychiatrist acting pursuant to s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code is not a person in authority to whom the rule as to proof by the Crown of the voluntary nature of a statement applies and no question is raised as to the admissibility of any of the evidence which these two witnesses gave. The effect of their evidence is shown by the following extracts.\nDr. Donald Griffith McKerracher testified:\nHe (the appellant) did say that he had had homosexual activities at the age of 15 for the first time;\u2026\n* * *\nFurther that he had not married; that sexual behaviour, homosexual behaviour had existed since the age of 15; that to him homosexual activity provided his only satisfactory method of the release of sexual tensions. It was his only satisfactory sexual outlet. He found the thought of heterosexual conduct abhorrent. He told me he never had had heterosexual relations, that during 24 years of fairly active homosexual practice he had many partners whose ages varied from the middle teens to 30 or 35. He obtained his sexual partners through previous contacts through some, what I would judge, was discreet soliciting because others in the same pattern of behaviour would, one would judge, be tending to make contacts too. There was no suggestion whatsoever of any violence at any time; that he was most co-operative throughout the interview, restrained in manner, courteous, coherent, relevant and frank.\n* * *\nQ. What are your conclusions from those observations?\nA. Well in the first place my opinion is that Mr. Klippert is not inhibited, let us put it this way, his sexual drive is not inhibited and it is my opinion based on my experience with others with similar patterns of conduct that he would have difficulty in inhibiting them in the future.\n* * *\nDR. McKERRACHER: Yes. My conclusion was in terms of this pattern of sexual behaviour that he would have the same drive\u2014a drive toward homosexual relations in the future that he had had in the past. I also concluded that in my opinion there was no danger, this is strictly my opinion, of him doing physical violence or injury to anyone. He did not fit that pattern. If I might put it the same way, if I might make an analogy with the heterosexual activity of a man with heterosexual drives he will continue to seek heterosexual outlets for those drives, some men would do it violently, some would not. I did not feel the accused showed any evidence that he would behave in a violent fashion.\n* * *\nQ. On the question of his sexual conduct in the past what are you able to conclude from that?\nA. I conclude\u2014it is based on a homosexual pattern and has been since he was sexually active.\nQ. Has he been able to control this?\nA. No\u2014I would put it inhibit. He has not inhibited these drives.\nQ. Now as to\u2026\nTHE COURT: Just to make it clear what do you mean by \u201cnot inhibited\u201d? A. The drive is a desire, to inhibit it is to refuse to follow the desire. It is like a heterosexual drive\u2014most people do not inhibit their heterosexual drives, they follow their drives, the impulse is a drive to seek heterosexual relief.\nDr. Ian McLaren McDonald testified:\nQ. And what information did you receive on those points? A. He informed me that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of having engaged in homosexual activity; that he was sentenced in August of 1965. He told me that this was the second sentence for similar behaviour. He told me that he had engaged in homosexual activity since the age of 14 or 15. He told me that the people with whom he engaged in these activities ranged in age from 15 to the mid or late 30\u2019s. The 15 year old, he said, took part in an incident when he was 17 or 18. He had little or no heterosexual experience, certainly no complete heterosexual experience never having completed a sexual act with a female. He said that he had no desire to partake in heterosexual activity. He said this filled him with revulsion, as I believe his words were \u201csome people are revolted at the idea of having homosexual relations while I am revolted at the idea of having heterosexual relations\u201d. He stated that he had engaged in homosexual activity actively when he started work in the dairy in Calgary which would be about the age of 16 or 17; that he had continued this up until his being confined to the penitentiary I believe in 1960. Having been discharged from the penitentiary he was aware of the need to refrain from engaging in this behaviour again. He stated that some attempt, some contacts had been made with him by ex-friends and for this reason, as well as the feeling of his continued presence bringing shame on his family, he decided to leave Calgary and head North.\nHe acknowledged that he had been warned, or at least a discussion had taken place between himself and a member of the Mounted Police Force at Pine Point some time in the summer of 1964, the implication being that his record was known and that he should more or less watch his behaviour. He said he was able to do this until these events transpired of which he was charged and sentenced.\nIn describing his behaviour, his homosexual behaviour, he said first of all that he was very careful of the person whom he approached, he was very careful to ascertain whether or not they preferred heterosexual outlets and if they did then he didn\u2019t make an overture. If they were ambivalent, that is they had no strong feelings one way or the other then he would make some overtures, generally conversationally. He denied ever having physically assaulted or coerced any of these people he engaged in these pursuits. He acknowledged that in the past he had a good number of short term affairs. These were not lasting relationships.\nQ. Short term affairs with whom? A. The men. He also stated that he denied having any preference for young men, his preference was for people who were responsive, that is people who shared his enthusiasm about the endeavour. As a result of this information that he told me, and based on past experience with people who have presented this kind of sexual behaviour pattern I came to the conclusion that Mr. Klippert was (a) primarily and essentially a homosexual, that this was the prime outlet for sexual drives (b) I thought it unlikely that he could refrain from indulging in this behaviour again without assistance, that is assistance from other people, trained people. I felt that this man was not the type who would physically injure or coerce people to take part in these activities.\nQ. Dr. McDonald then on the point of past sexual conduct and the question of control, briefly what can you tell us about his control from his past conduct? Does he have control, I mean can he stop, as indicated from his past conduct? A. He obviously cannot stop for long periods of time on past performance, on his own.\nI have perhaps quoted at unnecessary length from the evidence of these witnesses as it is clear from reading their testimony as a whole that in the opinion of each of them there was no danger of the appellant using violence of any sort or attempting coercion of anyone. They do not suggest that he sought out youthful partners for his misconduct. What they did foresee was the likelihood of the appellant committing further acts of gross indecency with other consenting adult males.\nThe question before us is whether on this state of facts the finding that the appellant is a dangerous sexual offender can be sustained in law.\nIn the case of an application under s. 661 of the Criminal Code the onus lies upon the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender. In the case at bar not only is there no evidence that the accused if at liberty would constitute a danger to any person but the evidence of the two psychiatrists, quoted from and summarized above, expressly negatives the existence of any such danger. This would be an end of the matter if it were not for the definition of the phrase \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d contained in s. 659 which reads as follows:\n659. In this Part,\u2026\n(b) \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d means a person who, by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and who is likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.\nFor the purposes of this appeal I will assume that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support a finding that the accused has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and that, if at liberty, he is likely to commit a further sexual offence of the same sort as those to which he pleaded guilty; there is not a tittle of evidence to suggest that he is likely to commit any other type of sexual offence.\nIn construing the definition of \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d it must be borne in mind that by the combined effect of s. 2(2), s. 2(3) and s. 2(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 659(b) of the Criminal Code must be read as if it concluded with the words \u201cexcept in so far as this definition is inconsistent with the intent or object of this Part or would give to the expression \u2018dangerous sexual offender\u2019 an interpretation inconsistent with the context\u201d.\nThe intent and object of those sections in the Criminal Code which deal with dangerous sexual offenders is to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger. To construe the definition as compelling the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention on a person shown by the evidence led by the Crown not to be a source of danger would be to give it an effect inconsistent with the intent or object of the Part.\nThe words \u201ca further sexual offence\u201d are general words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual element and in construing them resort may properly be had to the maxim verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae (Bac. Max. reg. 10). The following statement, now found in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed., at pages 58 and 59, is supported by the authorities cited and has often been quoted with approval:\nIt is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While expressing truly enough all that the legislature intended, they frequently express more in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be construed as particular if the intention be particular; that is, they must be understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the legislature, and limited to it.\nA case often referred to on this point is Cox v. Hakes[2], in which it was held by the House of Lords that the following words in s. 19 of the Judicature Act, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 66: \u201cThe said Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any judgment or order of Her Majesty\u2019s High Court of Justice or any Judges or Judge thereof\u201d did not confer jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order discharging a prisoner under a habeas corpus although such an order fell plainly within the literal meaning of the words of the enactment.\nApplying this principle to s. 659(b) it is my opinion that the concluding words \u201cor is likely to commit a further sexual offence\u201d should be given the meaning \u201cor is likely to commit a further sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person\u201d.\nIf this is the right construction of s. 659(b), as I think it is, it is clear that the finding that the appellant is a dangerous sexual offender cannot stand; it would be directly contrary to the evidence.\nI am glad to arrive at this result. It would be with reluctance and regret that I would have found myself compelled by the words used to impute to Parliament the intention of enacting that the words \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d shall include in their meaning \u201ca sexual offender who is not dangerous\u201d.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to mention a further consideration which is not, I think, irrelevant in seeking to ascertain the intention of Parliament. It is not wholesome that the existing criminal law should not be enforced. A law which ought not to be enforced should be repealed. If the law on this subject matter is as interpreted by the Courts below, it means that every man in Canada who indulges in sexual misconduct of the sort forbidden by s. 149 of the Criminal Code with another consenting adult male and who appears likely, if at liberty, to continue such misconduct should be sentenced to preventive detention, that is to incarceration for life. However loathsome conduct of the sort mentioned may appear to all normal persons, I think it improbable that Parliament should have intended such a result. It may be that we cannot take judicial notice of the probable effect which such an interpretation would have on the numbers of those confined to penitentiaries; no one, I think, would quarrel with the suggestion that it would bring about serious overcrowding.\nI would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal can be briefly stated. In August 1965, the appellant pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker on four charges under s. 149 of the Criminal Code, namely gross indecency, and on August 24, he was sentenced to three years concurrent with respect to each charge. On an application, subsequently made under s. 661 Cr. C., before Sissons J., he was declared a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of s. 659(b) of the Criminal Code, Being of the view that a penitentiary term would be harmful rather than beneficial to the appellant, the learned judge sentenced him to preventive detention,\u2014a detention for an indeterminate period\u2014cf. 659(c), in lieu of the sentence of three years in penitentiary imposed by Magistrate Parker, and recommended to the Minister of Justice to review the case of the appellant, at the earliest possible moment, and that he be released on licence on condition that he submit himself to such treatment which, in the opinion of psychiatrists, could be helpful to him.\nAn appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Sissons was launched and was, ultimately, unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal for the North West Territories.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was thereafter sought and granted on the two following questions of law:\n(i) Whether there was evidence before Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to control his sexual impulses.\n(ii) Whether the evidence before Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.\nThe evidence before Sissons J. consists of the four convictions before Magistrate Parker, a conviction in 1960 on eighteen charges for similar offences\u2014for which appellant was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment with respect to each charge, sentences to run concurrently,\u2014and, as required by s. 661(2), the evidence of two qualified psychiatrists, namely Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald. The substance of the evidence of these doctors appears in the excerpts from their testimony, quoted in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright. Considered as a whole, the evidence reasonably indicates that the appellant is a person who, by his conduct in sexual matters, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and that he is likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind, though, he never did cause injury, pain or other evil to any person and is not likely to do so in the future through his failure to control his sexual impulses.\nOn this state of facts, the determination of the questions of law mentioned above, depends on the meaning given by Parliament to the expression dangerous sexual offender.\nPart XXI of the Criminal Code, which deals with Preventive Detention, contains its own interpretation provisions in s. 659. Section 659(b) defines dangerous sexual offender as follows:\n659. In this Part,\n(a)\u2026\n(b) \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d means a person who, (i) by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a) is likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to commit a further sexual offence, and\n(c)\u2026\nUnderlining, numerals and letters have been added to point out the necessary or alternative constituent elements in the definition.\nThis is a new definition. It was enacted by Parliament in 1961, by 9-10 Elizabeth II, c. 43, s. 32, of which the opening words are:\n32. Paragraph (b) of section 659 of the said Act is repealed and the following substituted therefor:\nPrior to this change, s. 659(b) read:\n659. In this Part,\n(a)\u2026\n(b) \u201ccriminal sexual psychopath\u201d means a person who, (i) by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who (ii) as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on any person.\nUnderlining and numerals have been added to point out the necessary constituent elements in this former definition.\nThus, it appears that, under the new definition, (i) the element of psychological ability to control has been replaced by that of a straight factual investigation and (ii) the likelihood of the commission of a further sexual offence, has been added and made an alternative element to that of the danger of injury to others. Applied to this case, the new definition justifies the concurrent finding of the Courts below, that the appellant who, on the evidence, (i) has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and (ii) is likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind, is a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning which Parliament itself ascribed to this expression.\nDuring the hearing of this appeal, reference was made to a certain part of the French version of the former and of the new definition and some reliance appears to have been placed, by counsel for the appellant, on a lack of difference between the two texts to support the contention that the psychological ability to control has not been replaced by a straight factual investigation and is still a constituent element in the definition. The part of the definition to which we were referred reads as follows:\nin the former definition:\n\u201c\u2026qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son inconduite en mati\u00e8re sexuelle, a manifest\u00e9 une impuissance \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser ses impulsions sexuelles\u2026\u201d\nand in the new definition:\n\u201c\u2026qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa conduite en mati\u00e8re sexuelle, a manifest\u00e9 une impuissance \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser ses impulsions sexuelles\u2026\u201d\nBoth texts are obviously identical in substance. In my opinion, this, in no way, supports the proposition contended for by the appellant. We are not dealing here with a situation where each of the English and of the French text is capable of assisting the other, in a matter of interpretation, but with a situation where one has to elect between either the English text, which manifests the actual intervention of Parliament to change the existing law with respect to one of the constituent elements in the definition, or the French text, which is indicative of no change at all. In Blackford v. McBain[3], Taschereau J., as he then was, disposed of a similar question by ignoring the version which left the law in the state in which it was, prior to the Act adopted to change it, cf. p. 275. Indeed, to give priority to the French version would, in this case, render the change made in the English version meaningless and the actual intervention of Parliament, to make this change, futile.\nWith deference, I cannot either agree with the view that the intent and object of the provisions dealing with dan- gerous sexual offenders, is solely to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger and that to apply the definition to a person, who is not to be a source of danger, would give the definition an effect inconsistent with the intent or object of these provisions. Obviously, the intent and object of an Act is to be found in its provisions and, in the case of this particular legislation, the provisions which are relevant in this respect are those of s. 659\u2014the interpretation section\u2014and those of s. 661\u2014the operative section. Section 659(b), as above indicated, clearly added, as an alternative element in the definition to the danger of injury to others, that of the likelihood of the commission of a further sexual offence, and a consideration of s. 661 shows that the operative provisions are only consistent with this view of the matter. Section 661 reads as follows:\n661. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of\n(a) an offence under\n(i) section 136,\n(ii) section 138,\n(iii) section 141,\n(iv) section 147,\n(v) section 148, or\n(vi) section 149; or\n(b) an attempt to commit an offence under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),\nthe court shall, upon application, hear evidence as to whether the accused is a dangerous sexual offender.\n(2) On the hearing of an application under subsection (1) the court shall hear any relevant evidence, and shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General.\n(3) Where the court finds that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired.\n(4) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.\nIn some of the offences referred to in s. 661(1)(a), such as rape, indecent assault on female, indecent assault on male, violence is involved to a variable degree as an element of the offence. In others, such as sexual intercourse with a female under 14, sexual intercourse with a female between 14 and 16, buggery and gross indecency, violence is not an element of the offence. Particularly, the offence of gross indecency, in which appellant has indulged, is one which necessarily implies consent of the person which must participate with the accused for its commission and one which excludes danger of injury to the participants. With respect to the offences of the first category, it may well be said that the object and intent of Parliament is, as indicated by my brother Cartwright, to protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger, but, in my respectful view, the same thing cannot be said with respect to the offences of the second category which also includes the offence of bestiality. The language of s. 661 is clear; if an accused is convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the section, be that one of the first or of the second category, the Court shall, upon application, hear evidence and decide whether the accused is a person who, (i) by his conduct, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a) is either likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person through his failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to commit a further sexual offence. The general words further sexual offence are clearly embracing the offences mentioned in s. 661(1) of which, as above indicated, many exclude, as being one of their constituent elements, a source of danger of injury to other persons.\nI would, therefore, affirmatively answer the two questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted.\nWhether the criminal law, with respect to sexual misconduct of the sort in which appellant has indulged for nearly twenty-five years, should be changed to the extent to which it has been recently in England, by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, c. 60, is obviously not for us to say; our jurisdiction is to interpret and apply laws validly enacted.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT and HALL JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Respondent.\n1967: November 6, 7; 1967: December 18.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nLabour relations\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Provision whereby company agreed to continue support of welfare plans in accordance with terms of present agreements\u2014Dispute arising from proposed integration of company pension plan with Canada Pension Plan\u2014Arbitration award in favour of appellant unions\u2014Motion to set aside award on basis board exceeded jurisdiction\u2014Validity of award.\nThe respondent company proposed to \u201cintegrate\u201d the benefits under its retirement pension plan with those under the Canada Pension Plan and this involved a change with respect to contributions. The appellant unions took exception to this proposal and submitted a grievance which was referred to an arbitration board. The appellants contended that the action by the respondent involved a breach by it of Art. XIV of the collective agreement made between the appellants and the respondent. They contended that, under this article, the respondent had agreed that it would not discontinue its support of the existing welfare plans, and that the phrase \u201cin accordance with the terms of the present agreements\u201d meant that the support of the plans as they existed when the collective agreement became effective would be continued. The respondent contended that the phrase meant in accordance with all of the terms of the present agreements, including the terms giving the right to change or discontinue the company plan.\nThe arbitration board, by a majority of two to one, upheld the appellants\u2019 interpretation of Art. XIV. The respondent was directed to reinstate the company plan and to make adjustment for the period since the plan had been changed. On a motion to set aside the award based on the submission that the board had exceeded its jurisdiction, it was held that the board had not exceeded its jurisdiction and the motion was dismissed. An appeal from this decision was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The majority of that Court was of the view that the arbitration board, by its decision, had amended the terms of the collective agreement, which, under s. 3 of Art. XXIII of the agreement they were precluded from doing. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the judge of first instance restored.\nIn reaching the conclusion which it did, the arbitration board was fulfilling its duty to interpret Art. XIV and it did not, by its decision, amend the collective agreement. When the respondent agreed to continue its support of the welfare plans in accordance with the terms of the present agreements that commitment could certainly be construed as an undertaking by it not to discontinue any of those plans, but to maintain them as they then existed. Such an interpretation of the article was not only a proper one, but was probably the right one. But whether right or wrong, the board interpreted and did not amend the agreement. This being so, it did not exceed its jurisdiction and its award was valid.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, reversing a judgment of Dickson J. dismissing a motion to set aside an award of an arbitration board. Appeal allowed.\nS. Green and L. Mitchell, for the appellants.\nAlan Sweatman, Q.C., and W.L. Palk, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[1], which, by a majority of two to one (Freedman J.A. dissenting), reversed the decision of Dickson J. (as he then was), who had dismissed a motion by the respondent for an order to declare that an award, dated August 16, 1966, by an arbitration board constituted pursuant to Art. XXIII of a collective agreement, dated September 16, 1965, made between the appellants and the respondent, exceeded the board\u2019s jurisdiction and was invalid.\nThe collective agreement contained provision for the determination of a grievance concerning its interpretation, and provided for a reference of any dispute, which could not be settled by negotiation between the Company and the Unions, to an arbitration board constituted pursuant to Art. XXIII. Section 3 of that Article provided:\nThe decision of a majority of the arbitration board shall be in writing and delivered to the parties hereto. It shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, subject to the condition that the decision shall not, without the consent and approval of the parties hereto, rescind or amend any of the terms or conditions of this collective bargaining agreement, but shall be in general accord with the scope and terms thereof.\nThe dispute which was referred to the arbitration board in this case was as to the interpretation of Art. XIV of the collective agreement, which provided:\nWELFARE PLANS\nThe Company agrees to continue, in accordance with the terms of the present agreements, its support of the welfare plans now available to the employees, namely:\nApprentice Plan\nVacations-with-Pay Plan\nGroup Life Insurance\nRetirement Pension Plan\nNon-occupational Accident and Sickness Benefit Plan\nHudson Bay Mining Employees\u2019 Health Association\nHudson Bay Mining Employees\u2019 Death Benefit Plan.\nAt the time this Article came into effect there were in existence the welfare plans described in it. The dispute arose in relation to the Retirement Pension Plan, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Company Plan\u201d. This Plan became effective on May 1, 1940, and had undergone various revisions after its inception, the last of these being effected on January 1, 1964. The respondent\u2019s employees contributed 3 per cent of their earnings and the respondent contributed the balance necessary to purchase the amount of pension to which employees became entitled; namely, an annual pension equal to 45 per cent of the employee\u2019s total contributions.\nThe respondent\u2019s position in relation to this Plan is summarized in a booklet entitled \u201cWelfare Plans\u201d, which the respondent issued to its employees, the relevant portion of which states:\n(a) The Company shall administer the Plan and have the power to decide all matters with respect thereto, insofar as there is no conflict with the rules, regulations and practices of the Canadian Government Annuities Branch and the North American Life Assurance Company. (b) The Company reserves the right to change or discontinue the Plan at any time if, in the sole opinion of the Company, conditions require. In the event of it being necessary to discontinue the Plan, contributions deposited up to such time by both employee and Company shall vest solely with the employees.\nOn December 3, 1965, the respondent advised its employees that the Canada Pension Plan would become effective January 1, 1966, requiring under its regulations contribution of 1.8 per cent of an employee\u2019s earnings; that instead of deducting extra contributions from employees, appropriate Canada Pension Plan contributions would be taken out of the contributions deducted for the Company Plan, i.e., from the 3 per cent of earnings, and forwarded to the Canada Pension Plan at Ottawa. The effect of this was that instead of 3 per cent of the employee\u2019s salary going to the Company Plan, 1.2 per cent would go to the Company Plan and 1.8 per cent to the Canada Pension Plan. As the employee\u2019s pension under the Company Plan was directly related to his contributions to the Company Plan, he would receive a reduced pension under the Company Plan. He would, of course, also be contributing to the Canada Pension Plan and in due course receive a pension under the Canada Pension Plan.\nIn other words, the respondent proposed to \u201cintegrate\u201d the pension benefits under the Company Plan with the pension benefits under the Canada Pension Plan.\nThe appellants contended that this action by the respondent involved a breach by it of Art. XIV of the collective agreement. They contended that, under this Article, the respondent had agreed that it would not discontinue its support of the existing welfare plans, and that the phrase \u201cin accordance with the terms of the present agreements\u201d meant that the support of the plans as they existed when the collective agreement became effective would be continued.\nThe respondent contended that that phrase meant in accordance with all of the terms of the present agreements, including the terms giving the right to change or discontinue the Company Plan.\nThe arbitration board, by a majority of two to one, upheld the appellants\u2019 interpretation of Art. XIV. Dickson J., who heard the motion to set aside the award based on the submission that the board had exceeded its jurisdiction, held that the board had not exceeded its jurisdiction. His reasons appear in the following passage from his judgment:\nThe Board of Arbitration was constituted by applicant and respondents. At the outset of the hearing before the Board, counsel for applicant agreed, according to the report of the applicant\u2019s nominee, Mr. Taylor, \u201cthat the grievance was properly before the Board\u201d. The Award makes it clear that the members of the Board of Arbitration directed their minds to the question of the construction to be placed upon Article XIV. This was the question put to the Board by applicant and respondents. The Award does not go beyond that question. The interpretation given by the Board is one which the language of Article XIV will reasonably bear. That is sufficient to defeat applicant\u2019s motion, which therefore fails.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal was of the view that the arbitration board, by its decision, had amended the terms of the collective agreement, which, under s. 3 of Art. XXIII of the agreement they were precluded from doing. Guy J.A. states this view, as follows:\nThe issue to be decided in the instant case is clear-cut and brief. It is simply this: Did the majority of the Arbitration Board exceed its jurisdiction by in fact amending the contract between the parties?\nWith great respect, I am of the view that it did just that. When the collective bargaining agreement and the booklet outlining the Welfare Plans are read together (as they must be to determine the real consensus ad idem between the parties) it seems to me to be abundantly clear that the signatories to the collective bargaining agreement were fully aware of the fact that the welfare plans would have to be adjusted from time to time as conditions demand. This is shown by the portions of the Welfare Plans\u2019 booklet quoted above. Viewed in this light, it is apparent to me that when the new agreement became effective in 1965, the words quoted above: \u201cThe Company agrees to continue, in accordance with the terms of the present agreements, its support of the welfare plans now available to the employees\u2026\u201d, did not in any way limit that support to the exact formulae which had been previously followed, but simply provided that the support of any particular Welfare Plan would not be withdrawn. As I have indicated, the proposed integration of the Pension Welfare Plan with the new Canada Pension Plan is certainly contemplated by the parties to the dispute.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with these conclusions and I share the view expressed by Dickson J. that in reaching the conclusion which it did, the arbitration board was fulfilling its duty to interpret Art. XIV and it did not, by its decision, amend the collective agreement. When the respondent agreed to continue its support of the welfare plans in accordance with the terms of the present agreements that commitment can certainly be construed as an undertaking by it not to discontinue any of those plans, but to maintain them as they then existed. Such an interpretation of the Article is, in my opinion, not only a proper one, but is probably the right one. But whether right or wrong, in my view the board interpreted and did not amend the agreement. This being so, it did not exceed its jurisdiction and its award is valid.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the order of the learned judge of first instance. The appellants should be entitled to their costs in this Court and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mitchell, Green & Minuk, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pitblado, Hoskin & Company, Winnipeg.\n[1] [1967], 59 W.W.R. 472, 61 D.L.R.

Act, 1867, s. 92(10)\u2014Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 16\u2014Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234.\nThe government of Ontario decided to operate a commuter train service, using its own rolling stock but utilizing the Canadian National Railways tracks. The train crews would be those of the Canadian National Railways performing services for the government of Ontario on an agency basis under terms and conditions to be provided for in a formal agreement to be entered into in the near future. The Board of Transport Commissioners, on an application by the Canadian National Railways to discontinue certain passenger trains on that line, declared that it had jurisdiction in respect of the tolls to be charged by the province in respect of the proposed services. On appeal to this Court by the province of Ontario against that declaration, two questions were raised: (1) Whether the Board of Transport Commissioners has jurisdiction to set the tolls, and (2) Whether the commuter service comes within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the first question, the tolls to be charged by the province of Ontario are subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nThe Board has jurisdiction over tolls within the meaning of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, and the question is whether the tolls to be charged by the province in this case are tolls within the definition of that word in the Railway Act. The answer to the contention that they will not be charged by the \u201ccompany\u201d but by Her Majesty is that the definition applies not only to tolls charged by the \u201ccompany\u201d but also to tolls charged \u201cupon or in respect of a railway owned or operated by the company, or by any person on behalf or under authority or consent of the company, in connection with the carriage and transportation of passengers\u2026\u201d While it is true that the the rolling stock belongs to the province of Ontario, the railway on which this equipment runs is the \u201ccompany\u2019s\u201d railway. Therefore, the tolls cannot be said not to be \u201cin respect of a railway owned\u201d by the Canadian National Railways.\nAs to the second question, the commuter service comes within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada as being a local work or undertaking within the meaning of s. 92(10)(a) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867.\nThe Canadian National Railways, extending beyond the limits of the province of Ontario, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and the question is whether the commuter service can be said not to form part of this railway. To come to this conclusion, it would be necessary to hold that federal jurisdiction over inter-provincial railways extends only to interprovincial services provided on such railways. It is not possible to so hold. The constitutional jurisdiction depends on the character of the railway line and not on the character of a particular service provided on that railway line. The fact that for some purposes the commuter service should be considered as a distinct service does not make it a distinct line of railway. From a physical point of view, the commuter service trains are part of the overall operations of the line over which they run. Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction over everything that physically forms part of a railway subject to its jurisdiction.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Juridiction\u2014Chemins de fer\u2014Service de trains de banlieue exploit\u00e9 par le gouvernement provincial en se servant de son mat\u00e9riel roulant\u2014Utilisation de la voie des Chemins de Fer Natio- naux du Canada\u2014Le tarif exig\u00e9 par la province est-il sujet \u00e0 la juridiction de la Commission des Transports du Canada\u2014Le service de trains de banlieue tombe-t-il sous la juridiction l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada\u2014D\u00e9sirable que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soit repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 chaque fois qu\u2019est soulev\u00e9e la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2014Commuter Services Act, 1965 (Ont.), c. 17\u2014L\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867, art. 92(10) \u2014Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, S.R.C. 1952, c. 158, art. 16\u2014Loi sur les chemins de fer, S.R.C. 1952, c. 234.\nLe gouvernement de l\u2019Ontario a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019exploiter un service de trains de banlieue, tout en se servant de son mat\u00e9riel roulant mais en utilisant la voie des Chemins de Fer Nationaux du Canada. Le personnel du train devait \u00eatre celui des Chemins de Fer Nationaux en service aupr\u00e8s du gouvernement de l\u2019Ontario, sur une base d\u2019agence en vertu des termes et conditions devant faire partie d\u2019un contrat formel \u00e0 \u00eatre pass\u00e9 tout prochainement. La Commission des Transports du Canada, sur une demande des Chemins de Fer Nationaux de discontinuer certains trains de voyageurs sur la ligne en question, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait juridiction sur les tarifs devant \u00eatre exig\u00e9s par la province relativement au service propos\u00e9. Sur appel devant cette Cour par la province de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9claration, deux questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es: (1) La Commission des Transports du Canada a-t-elle juridiction pour \u00e9tablir le tarif, et (2) Le service de trains de banlieue tombe-t-il sous la juridiction du Parlement du Canada.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, le tarif devant \u00eatre exig\u00e9 par la province de l\u2019Ontario est sujet \u00e0 la juridiction de la Commission des Transports du Canada.\nLa Commission a juridiction sur les tarifs dans le sens de la Loi sur les chemins de fer, S.R.C. 1952, c. 234, et le probl\u00e8me est de savoir si le tarif devant \u00eatre exig\u00e9 par la province dans le cas pr\u00e9sent est un tarif selon la d\u00e9finition de ce mot dans la Loi sur les chemins de fer. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention que le tarif ne sera pas exig\u00e9 par la \u00abcompagnie\u00bb mais par Sa Majest\u00e9 est que la d\u00e9finition s\u2019applique non seulement au tarif exig\u00e9 par la \u00abcompagnie\u00bb mais aussi au tarif exig\u00e9 \u00absur un chemin de fer que la compagnie poss\u00e8de ou tient en service, ou relativement \u00e0 ce chemin de fer, ou pour toute personne agissant au nom de la compagnie ou avec son autorisation ou son consentement, pour le transport des voyageurs\u2026\u00bb Il est vrai que le mat\u00e9riel roulant appartient \u00e0 la province de l\u2019Ontario, mais la voie ferr\u00e9e sur laquelle ce mat\u00e9riel roule est la voie ferr\u00e9e de la \u00abcompagnie\u00bb. En cons\u00e9quence, on ne peut pas dire que le tarif n\u2019est pas \u00abrelativement \u00e0 un chemin de fer poss\u00e9d\u00e9\u00bb par les Chemins de Fer Nationaux du Canada.\nQuant \u00e0 la seconde question, le service d\u2019un train de banlieue tombe sous la juridiction l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada comme \u00e9tant un travail ou une entreprise d\u2019une nature locale dans le sens de l\u2019art. 92(10) (a) de L\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 .\nLes Chemins de Fer Nationaux du Canada, s\u2019\u00e9tendant au-del\u00e0 des limites de la province de l\u2019Ontario, sont sujets \u00e0 la juridiction du Parlement du Canada, et le probl\u00e8me est de savoir si on peut dire que le service de trains de banlieue ne fait pas partie de ce chemin de fer. Pour en venir \u00e0 une telle conclusion, il serait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider que la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les chemins de fer interprovinciaux s\u2019\u00e9tend seulement aux services interprovinciaux fournis sur ces chemins de fer. Il n\u2019est pas possible de d\u00e9cider de cette fa\u00e7on. La juridiction constitutionnelle d\u00e9pend du caract\u00e8re de la ligne de chemin de fer et non pas du caract\u00e8re des services particuliers fournis sur cette ligne de chemin de fer. Le fait que pour certaines fins le service de trains de banlieue doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un service distinct n\u2019en fait pas une ligne distincte de chemin de fer. Du point de vue physique, le service de trains de banlieue fait partie de l\u2019exploitation enti\u00e8re de la ligne sur laquelle ces trains roulent. Le Parlement du Canada a juridiction sur tout ce qui fait partie physiquement des chemins de fer sujets \u00e0 sa juridiction.\nAPPEL d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Transports du Canada. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Board of Transport Commissioners. Appeal dismissed.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., J.R. Houston and D.A. Crosbie, for the appellant.\nJ.M. Fortier, Q.C., and L. Salembier, for the respondent.\nThe JOINT OPINION OF THE COURT:\u2014This case arose in the following way.\nUnder the authority of the Commuter Services Act, 1965, Statutes of Ontario 1965, c. 17, the Minister of Highways for Ontario decided to operate a Government of Ontario Commuter Service from Toronto westerly to Hamilton and easterly to Pickering utilizing Canadian National Railways\u2019 trackage in the entire area of its operation. Although no contract for that purpose has yet been signed, the Canadian National Railways, on July 16, 1965, made an application to the Board of Transport Commissioners for authority to discontinue four passenger trains operating between Toronto and Hamilton. It was stated in the application that the train crews on the Commuter Service would be those of the Canadian National Railways performing services for the Ontario Government on an agency basis under terms and conditions to be provided for in a formal agreement to be entered into in the near future. By the order appealed from authority to discontinue the four trains was given and in addition the Board declared that:\nIt has jurisdiction in respect of the tolls to be charged by the Province of Ontario in respect of the proposed services.\nThe appeal by Ontario is against that declaration only and raises two points:\n1. Whether the tolls to be charged by Ontario in respect of the Commuter Service are subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners;\n2. Whether the Commuter Service comes within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nOn the first question it is not disputed that the Board of Transport Commissioners has jurisdiction over tolls within the meaning of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234. The issue is whether the tolls to be charged by Ontario in respect of the Commuter Service are tolls within the definition of this word in the Railway Act. The material part of this definition is as follows:\n(32) \u2018toll,\u2019 or \u2018rate,\u2019 when used with reference to a railway, means any toll, rate, charge or allowance charged or made either by the company, or upon or in respect of a railway owned or operated by the company, or by any person on behalf of or under authority or consent of the company, in connection with the carriage and transportation of passengers, or the carriage, shipment, transportation, care, handling or delivery of goods, or for any service incidental to the business of a carrier; and includes any toll, rate, charge or allowance so charged or made in connection with rolling stock, or the use thereof, or any instrumentality or facility of carriage, shipment or transportation, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, expressed or implied, with respect to the use thereof;\u2026\nAppellant points out that the tolls in question will not be charged by the \u201ccompany\u201d within the meaning of the definition since they will be charged by Her Majesty in the right of the Province of Ontario. The answer to this contention is that the definition applies not only to tolls charged by the \u201ccompany\u201d but also to tolls charged \u201cupon or in respect of a railway owned or operated by the company, or by any person on behalf or under authority or consent of the company, in connection with the carriage and transportation of passengers\u2026\u201d. While it is true that the rolling stock used in operating the Commuter Service belongs to Ontario, the railway on which this equipment runs is the \u201ccompany\u2019s\u201d railway. Therefore, the tolls cannot be said not to be \u201cin respect of a railway owned\u201d by the Canadian National Railways; they are obviously a charge for the transportation of passengers over this railway by means of such equipment.\nIt is worth noting that under the Railway Act the rolling stock, is not considered an essential part of the railway. Although it is included in the definition of \u201crailway\u201d it is also included in the definition of \u201ctraffic\u201d:\n(33) \u201ctraffic\u201d means the traffic of passengers, goods and rolling stock;\nIt should be further noted that under s. 315 of the Railway Act, a railway company is obliged to furnish \u201csuitable accommodation for the receiving and loading of all traffic offered for carriage upon the railway\u201d. Therefore it cannot be said that the operation of a commuter service by means of rolling stock owned by the Government of Ontario is not an operation of the \u201crailway\u201d within the meaning of the Railway Act. On the contrary, to the extent that the tolls charged to the passengers can be said to be charged in connection with the use of the rolling stock they are expressly covered by the last quoted part of the definition: \u201cand includes any toll\u2026 so charged in connection with rolling stock, or the use thereof\u2026 irrespective of ownership\u201d.\nIt is argued that, although the provisions of the Railway Act respecting tolls might be applicable in such a situation if the rolling stock was owned by and operated on the account of any other person or corporation, they cannot be applied to Her Majesty in right of the Province of Ontario by reason of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act that was in force at the time the order was made, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158. This section is as follows:\n16. No provision or enactment in any Act affects, in any manner whatsoever, the rights of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty is bound thereby.\nIt should be pointed out that this section does not provide that no enactment applies to Her Majesty unless it is expressly stated therein that Her Majesty is bound thereby but only that no enactment affects the rights of Her Majesty unless it is so stated. Therefore, in order to rely on the rule to exclude Her Majesty from the application of an enactment, it must be shown that Her rights are affected thereby. It was held by the Privy Council in Dominion Building Corporation, Limited v. The King[1], with respect to a similar enactment of the Ontario Legislature that, at page 549:\nThe expression \u201cthe rights of His Majesty\u201d in this context means, in their Lordships\u2019 view, the accrued rights of His Majesty, and does not cover mere possibilities such as rights which, but for the alteration made in the general law by the enactment under consideration, might have thereafter accrued to His Majesty under some future contract.\nThis observation is applicable to the present case. Her Majesty in right of Ontario has, apart from an agreement in principle with the Canadian National Railways, no right to operate the Commuter Service and therefore no right to levy tolls for the carriage of passengers over part of the Canadian National Railways lines. Such rights as Ontario has are derived either from such agreement or from the Railway Act and therefore are subject to the conditions prescribed in that Act, one of these being that tolls are within the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nIt appears to us that Ontario can no more claim to be exempt in the operation of the Commuter Service from the application of the general provisions of the Railway Act respecting tolls than British Columbia could claim to be exempt from the general provisions of the Customs and Excise Acts in the operation of its Liquor Control Board, as was held in Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[2], It is true that in that case, the claim to exemption was based on s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act, however, the decision also involves the application to a provincial government of the general provisions of the Customs and Excise Acts.\nOn the second question, it is urged that the Commuter Service is operated exclusively within the Province of Ontario and reference is made to the following sentence in the reasons for judgment of the Board:\nThe service to be provided will be a service of the Government of Ontario and will not form part of the Canadian National Railway operations. It must first be pointed out that this sentence comes immediately after the following: \u201cIt will use existing C.N.R. trackage\u201d. It is therefore apparent that, when the service is said not to \u201cform part of the Canadian National Railways operations\u201d this must be taken in a special sense in considering the operations from an accounting or financial point of view. It cannot be taken as meaning that the Commuter Service will not form part of the physical operations of the railway seeing that the equipment runs on the railway tracks. That this is of substantial importance in the physical operation of the railway appears in the record from uncontradicted evidence. John Howard Spicer, Manager of the Toronto area said:\nWe are presently expanding the capacity of our plant to ensure that we can handle this new traffic adequately and also protect the existing traffic that moves on the line. This is one of our more important lines in Ontario and we must ensure that we can handle the traffic well. The new design for facilities will permit this.\nHow important \u201cthe trackage\u201d is in the operation of the Commuter Service appears from what the same witness also said respecting the limited service provided to Hamilton.\nQ. Now, if this facility was constructed at Bayview, Mr. Spicer, would it in any way enable the Ontario Government utilizing C.N. facilities to operate more frequent commuter trains into Hamilton?\nA. Not without the expansion of the physical plant between Bayview and Burlington. The main problem we have at the present time is that the stretch of track between Burlington and Bayview is our highest traffic density portion of the entire line. Over that stretch of track we have all the traffic coming out of our hump yard, down the Halton Subdivision connecting into the Oakville Subdivision at Burlington. And of course we have all the trains going to London and Chicago and also down to Niagara Falls. So that over that short stretch of line we have an extreme density of trains. We don\u2019t feel that our existing plant has sufficient capacity to handle anything like the proposed commuter service. This is why we were forced to restrict our operations to two trains in each direction, the equivalent of our present commuter service to this area. To handle more trains than this or any significant more larger number of trains than this we would have to add lines, new rail lines, and of course they would have to be fully signalled, crossover networks would have to be put in to tie into the existing main lines that we have through here. So this would be a very expensive part of the entire project and I believe we made an estimate on it that the cost of extending the commuter service through this approximately three\u2011mile stretch would equal the entire capital cost of installing the commuter service on the rest of the area,\u2026 On the basis of what has just been said as to the nature of the Commuter Service it remains to be seen whether it can be said to be a local work or undertaking within the meaning of head 10 of s. 92 of The British North America Act:\n10. Local Works and Undertakings other than such as are of the following Classes:\u2014\n(a) Lines or Steam or other Ships, Railways, Canals, Telegraphs, and other Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others of the Provinces, or extending beyond the Limits of the Province:\n(b) Lines of Steam Ships between the Province and any British or Foreign Country:\n(c) Such Works as, although wholly situate within the Province, are before or after their Execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general Advantage of Canada or for the Advantage of Two or more of the Provinces.\nIt is, of course, admitted that the Canadian National Railways extends beyond the limits of the Province of Ontario. Therefore it is clear that this railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. The only question is whether the Commuter Service can be said not to form part of this railway. To come to this conclusion, it would be necessary to hold that federal jurisdiction over interprovincial railways extends only to interprovincial services provided on such railways. This is clearly not possible. In Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd.[3], Rand J. said at p. 923:\nThe analogy of railways and telegraphs was pressed upon us. These works are specifically named, and it is the clear implication that their total functioning was to be under a single legislature. But even they are limited to essential objects: Attorney General for British Columbia v. C.P.R. (1950 A.C. 122), in which a hotel operated by the company was held not to be part of the railway\u2026\nKellock J. said at p. 929:\nThe words, \u2018Lines of ships\u2019 and \u2018railways,\u2019 as used in the section, no doubt include all traffic carried by such means, but that is because these undertakings are specifically mentioned and, being mentioned, include everything normally understood by those words\u2026\nIn the Privy Council the judgment of this Court was varied by taking a wider view of the operations included in an international or interprovincial bus service. No doubt was cast on the correctness of the views expressed in the passages just quoted (Attorney\u2011General for Ontario v. Winner[4]):\nTheir Lordships might, however, accede to the argument if there were evidence that Mr. Winner was engaged in two enterprises, one within the province and the other of a connecting nature. Their Lordships, however, cannot see any evidence of such a dual enterprise. The same buses carried both types of passenger along the same routes; the journeys may have been different, in that one was partly outside the province and the other wholly within, but it was the same undertaking which was engaged in both activities.\nIn the present case, the constitutional jurisdiction depends on the character of the railway line not on the character of a particular service provided on that railway-line. The fact that for some purposes the Commuter Service should be considered as a distinct service does not make it a distinct line of railway. From a physical point of view the Commuter Service trains are part of the overall operations of the line over which they run. It is clearly established that the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction over everything that physically forms part of a railway subject to its jurisdiction. In Canadian Pacific Railway v. Notre-Dame de Bonsecours[5], Lord Watson said at p. 372:\n\u2026 the Parliament of Canada has, in the opinion of their Lordships, exclusive right to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair, and alteration of the railway, and for its management,\u2026\nIn Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[6], Lord Moulton said at p. 370:\nBy s. 8 of the Dominion Railway Act Parliament treats in a special manner the crossing of Dominion railways by provincial railways. These portions of the provincial railways are made subject to the clauses of the Dominion railway legislation, which deal also with the crossings of two Dominion railways, so that the provincial railways are in such matters treated administratively in precisely the same way as Dominion railways themselves. The Parliament of the Dominion is entitled to legislate as to these crossings because they are upon the right of way and track of the Dominion railway as to which the Dominion Parliament has exclusive rights of legislation, and moreover, as the provincial railways are there by permission and not of right, they can fairly be put under terms and regulations.\nHotels operated by railways were held to be separate undertakings only because they are not \u201ca part of, or used in connexion with the operation of a railway system\u201d. Canadian Pacific Railway v. Attorney\u2011General for British Columbia[7].\nCounsel for appellant did not contend that the Commuter Service wholly escaped federal legislative jurisdiction, he conceded that for such matters as signals and safety, the commuter trains would be subject to the same rules as other trains. It is, of course, obvious that no railway could be operated with trains on the same line not governed by the same set of rules; as Davies J. said in City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Company[8]:\nThere cannot be two conflicting tribunals legislating at the same time upon such a vital subject as the public safety at railway crossings.\nCounsel for appellant also felt obliged to concede that the train crews would be subject to federal labour laws not provincial. This cannot be true on any other basis than that the commuter service is not a distinct undertaking but part of the railway operations from the physical point of view. The criterion for the application of the labour laws as well as for the application of the safety rules is the same: whether the undertaking connects the province with any other.\nThe decision in Luscar Collieries, Limited v. McDonald et al[9], shows that even a work which is of itself local, such as a provincial railway, may become a part of a federal undertaking by being put under the same management through an agreement with the latter. It thereby becomes part of a railway connecting the province with other provinces. There again the criterion of the jurisdiction is the fact that the operations are a part of the interprovincial system.\nIt must also be noted that in this last mentioned case, the order of the Railway Board which was affirmed on appeal to this Court was, as in the present case, an order declaring only that the Board had jurisdiction.\nBefore concluding, two observations should be made.\nIn his reasons for judgment, the dissenting Commissioner said: \u201cI am of the opinion the requirements of the Railway Act can be adequately and properly met by the simple process of the railway filing with the Board, as a tariff, the agreement which it has or will have with the Province and which must contain a full disclosure of the remuneration the railway will receive for the carriage and services it performs\u201d. It may well be that after considering all relevant circumstances the Board will come to the conclusion that it need not exercise its jurisdiction over the tolls charged to passengers and will find it sufficient to consider the adequacy of the charges made by the railway company to Ontario under the terms of the contemplated agreement. However, the question on this appeal is not whether the Board should in fact exercise its jurisdiction but whether it does have jurisdiction.\nIn the second place, it must be said that while at the hearing of this appeal the Court had the benefit of a thorough argument from both sides on the first question, no one appeared to oppose appellant on the constitutional issue. Counsel for the Board of Transport Commissioners declined to offer argument on that point in view of the Board\u2019s practice to refrain from dealing with such issues and the Attorney-General of Canada was not represented at the hearing. It is undesirable that this Court should be obliged to rule upon constitutional issues without the benefit of argument for both sides and the hope is expressed that, in the future, whenever the constitutional validity or application of federal legislation is in issue, this Court will always have the benefit of argument by counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada.\nOn the whole, we are of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. There should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed; no order as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Carson, Findlay & Wedd, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.M.

The expropriation took place during the respondent\u2019s 1954 taxation year, but an agreement fixing the amount of compensation and the payment of that compensation took place only in the respondent\u2019s 1955 taxation year. The respondent argued that, by virtue of s. 23 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, it had the right to receive compensation from the moment of expropriation, that the compensation was therefore \u201creceivable\u201d in the taxation year 1954 within the meaning of s. 85B.(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and was required to be accounted for as income for that year. The Minister contended that the taxpayer\u2019s profit did not form part of its income for the year 1954 because it was not received in that year and because it did not become an amount receivable in that year. The Exchequer Court set aside the Minister\u2019s assessment and held that the profit was taxable and should be assessed in the respondent\u2019s 1954 taxation year. The Minister appealed to this Court, where the appeal was argued on the assumption that the profit was taxable.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nIt is true that at the moment of expropriation the respondent acquired a right to receive compensation in place of the land, but, in the absence of a binding agreement between the parties or of a judgment fixing the compensation, the respondent had no more than a right to claim compensation and there was nothing which could be taken into account as an amount receivable due to the expropriation. Until the amount was fixed either by arbitration or agreement, there could be no amount receivable under s. 85B.(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Expropriation d\u2019une terre\u2014Contribuable r\u00e9alisant un profit imposable\u2014Ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition\u2014Loi sur les expropriations, S.R.C. 1952, c. 106, art. 23\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 85B (1)(b).\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e, qui faisait affaires en vertu du principe de comptabilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercice, a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un profit lorsque sa terre fut expropri\u00e9e par la Couronne. L\u2019expropriation a eu lieu durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 1954 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais une entente \u00e9tablissant le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et le paiement de cette indemnit\u00e9 ont eu lieu durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 1955 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que, en vertu de l\u2019art. 23 de la Loi sur les expropriations, S.R.C. 1952, c. 106, elle avait droit de recevoir une indemnit\u00e9 du jour de l\u2019expropriation, que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence \u00abrecevable\u00bb durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 1954 dans le sens de l\u2019art. 85B.(1)(b) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, et devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un revenu pour cette ann\u00e9e. Le Ministre a soutenu que le profit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le contribuable ne faisait pas partie de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1954 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u durant cette ann\u00e9e et parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas devenu un montant recevable durant cette ann\u00e9e. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la cotisation du Ministre et a jug\u00e9 que le profit \u00e9tait imposable et qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre cotis\u00e9 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 1954 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., for the appellant.\nN.N. Genser, Q.C., Philip F. Vineberg, Q.C., and Sidney Phillips, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The sole question in this appeal is whether a profit of $263,864.03 was properly assessed in the taxation year 1955. The judgment of the Exchequer Court1 holds that this profit must be excluded in assessing the profits for the taxation year 1955 on the ground that it should have been assessed in the taxation year 1954. The facts are simple. On January 7, 1954, the Crown in right of Canada expropriated two parcels of land belonging to the respondent company, Benaby Realties Limited, on the Island of Montreal. The company\u2019s 1954 fiscal year ended on April 30, 1954. On November 9, 1954, as a result of an agreement fixing the amount of compensation, the Crown paid the sum of $371,260. This happened during the company\u2019s 1955 fiscal year, which ended on April 30, 1955. The profit of $263,864.03 is the difference between the cost of the land and the amount of compensation.\nIt was argued in the Exchequer Court that the profit was not taxable but the judgment of the Exchequer Court was against this and the appeal in this Court was argued on the assumption that this was a taxable profit. The only issue was the appropriate year of assessment.\nThe taxpayer\u2019s argument in this Court is that from the moment of expropriation, the taxpayer no longer had its land but had instead the right to receive compensation. This is set out in s. 23 of the Expropriation Act, which reads:\nThe compensation money agreed upon or adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for or injuriously affected by the construction of any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property; and any claim to or encumbrance upon such land or property shall, as respects Her Majesty, be converted into a claim to such compensation money or to a proportionate amount thereof, and shall be void as respects any land or property so acquired or taken, which shall, by the fact of the taking possession thereof, or the filing of the plan and description, as the case may be, become and be absolutely vested in Her Majesty.\nThe taxpayer conducted its business on the accrual basis unders s. 85B.(1)(b), which reads:\n85B.(1) In computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year, (b) every amount receivable in respect of property sold or services rendered in the course of the business in the year shall be included notwithstanding that the amount is not receivable until a subsequent year unless the method adopted by the taxpayer for computing income from the business and accepted for the purpose of this Part does not require him to include any amount receivable in computing his income for a taxation year unless it has been received in the year.\nThe Crown\u2019s argument is that the general rule under the Income Tax Act is that taxes are payable on income actually received by the taxpayer during the taxation period; that there is an exception in the case of trade receipts under s. 85B.(1)(b), which include not only actual receipts but amounts which have become receivable in the year; that the taxpayer\u2019s profit from this expropriation did not form part of its income for the year 1954 because it was not received in that year and because it did not become an amount receivable in that year.\nIn my opinion, the Minister\u2019s submission is sound. It is true that at the moment of expropriation the taxpayer acquired a right to receive compensation in place of the land but in the absence of a binding agreement between the parties or of a judgment fixing the compensation, the owner had no more than a right to claim compensation and there is nothing which can be taken into account as an amount receivable due to the expropriation.\nThe Exchequer Court founded its judgment on Newcastle Breweries v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[2], which was a case involving the government\u2019s requisitioning of a supply of rum in 1918. The company accepted the government\u2019s price without prejudice to its right to claim a larger amount. This was subsequently granted under legislation enacted in 1920. This additional sum was received in 1922. The Inland Revenue then reopened the company\u2019s 1918 trading account to include this additional sum and the Courts held throughout that this could be done. What happened was that in 1918 there was a compulsory sale at a fixed price with an award of additional compensation under statutory authority three or four years later.\nThe application of this decision to the Canadian Income Tax Act is questionable. This decision implies that accounts can be left open until the profits resulting from a certain transaction have been ascertained and that accounts for a period during which a transaction took place can be reopened once the profits have been ascertained.\nThere can be no objection to this on the properly framed legislation, but the Canadian Income Tax Act makes no provision for doing this. For income tax purposes, accounts cannot be left open until the profits have been finally determined. Taxpayers are required to file a return of income for each taxation year (s. 44(1)) and the Minister must \u201cwith all due despatch\u201d examine each return of income and assess the tax for the taxation year. However, in many cases, compensation payable under the Expropriation Act is not determined until more than four years after the expropriation has taken place and, in many of these cases, the Minister would be precluded from amending the original assessment because of the four-year limitation for the assessment (s. 46(4)).\nMy opinion is that the Canadian Income Tax Act requires that profits be taken into account or assessed in the year in which the amount is ascertained.\nTry v. Johnson[3] is much closer to the point in issue here. The claim was for compensation under legislation which imposed restrictions on \u201cRibbon Development\u201d. When the case reached the Court of Appeal, the amount of compensation was admitted to be a trade receipt. The argument in that Court was directed to the appropriate year of assessment. The judgment was that the right of the frontager to compensation under the Ribbon Development Act contained so many elements of uncertainty both as to the right itself and the quantum that it could not be regarded as a trade receipt for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate year of assessment until the amount was fixed either by an arbitration award or by agreement.\nUnder the Canadian Expropriation Act, there is no doubt or uncertainty as to the right to compensation, but I do adopt the principle that there could be no amount receivable under s. 85B.(1)(b) until the amount was fixed either by arbitration or agreement.\nThe case of Minister of National Revenue v. Lechter[4] does not support the taxpayer\u2019s submission. In that case, the expropriation was in the 1954 fiscal year; the settlement was in the 1955 fiscal year and, according to its terms, payment should have been made within 60 days. For some reason the Treasury Board authorization was 7 months later and the actual payment 10 months later, both events falling within the 1956 fiscal year.\nThe judgment says no more than this, that the respondent, operating on an accrual basis, was bound to treat the profit of $234,506.91 on the disposition of part of lot 507, as having been earned prior to January 31, 1955, and that it was not taxable income in his taxation year ending January 31, 1956. The governing factor was the settlement made in the 1955 taxation year. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and restore the assessment of the Minister, with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

Hallonquist, [1968] S.C.R. 130\nDate: 1967-12-18\nDonna Marie Holland, an infant under the age of twenty-one years by her next friend Frank Holland and the said Frank Holland (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nRichard Hallonquist (Defendant).Respondent.\n1967: November 14; 1967: December 18.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Injuries sustained by gratuitous passenger\u2014Whether cause of action against owner for negligently operating motor vehicle which he knew, or should have known, was in unsafe condition\u2014Necessity of establishing gross negligence\u2014Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, s. 71.\nThe appellant commenced an action against the respondent for damages in respect of injuries which she sustained while being driven as a passenger in an automobile owned and driven by the respondent. The statement of claim alleged that the appellant sustained her injuries as a result of:\u2014(a) the grossly negligent driving of the respondent; (b) the negligence of the respondent in the maintenance and upkeep of his automobile. Before a statement of defence had been filed the parties jointly referred a point of law to the Court, as to whether \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to maintain a claim against the defendant as owner for negligent maintenance of his motor vehicle notwithstanding the provisions of s. 71 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253 and amendments thereto\u201d. The question was answered in the negative by the judge who heard the application and his judgment was sustained on appeal. From that decision the appellant, with leave, appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe statement of claim alleged that, at the time the appellant was injured, the respondent was the owner and driver of a motor vehicle. The appellant stated that she was carried as a passenger in that motor vehicle. Her claim was for injury sustained by reason of the operation of that vehicle by the respondent, the driver, while she was a passenger in it. These facts alleged in the statement of claim brought the action squarely within s. 71, and, that being so, gross negligence on the part of the respondent contributing to her injury had to be established if she was to succeed. It was unnecessary to consider what might be the position, under s. 71, of an owner of a motor vehicle against whom a claim is made by an injured passenger, where the owner is not the driver, and where some specific negligence of the owner is alleged to have caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Wootton J. Appeal dismissed. B.A. Crane, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nR. Weddigen, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The appellant commenced an action against the respondent for damages in respect of injuries which she sustained on August 30, 1964, while being driven, as a passenger, in an automobile owned and driven by the respondent. Her statement of claim alleged, in para. 3, that she sustained her injuries as a result of the grossly negligent driving of the respondent. Particulars of the alleged gross negligence were given, including an allegation that the respondent drove his motor vehicle at an excessive rate of speed when he knew or ought to have known that his motor vehicle was in a bad state of repair and when he knew or ought to have known the front end was in a dangerous condition.\nThe statement of claim also contained, in para. 4, an allegation that the respondent, on or about the month of February 1964 had purchased a 1954 Oldsmobile motor vehicle, that he had negligently maintained it and was careless in its upkeep, so that, just prior to the accident, it had travelled across the highway, then parallel to the highway and collided with a railway embankment, causing the injuries to the appellant. Six particulars of negligence were given, three of which related to failure to keep the vehicle in good repair and three of which referred to the respondent\u2019s having permitted the vehicle to be driven while in an unsafe condition.\nBefore a statement of defence had been filed the parties jointly referred a point of law to the Court, as to whether\nthe Plaintiff is entitled to maintain a claim against the Defendant as owner for negligent maintenance of his motor vehicle notwithstanding the provisions of Section 71 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, Chapter 253 and amendments thereto.\nSection 71, as it read at the relevant time, provided as follows:\n71. No action shall lie against either the owner or the driver of a motor-vehicle or of a motor-vehicle with a trailer attached by a person who is carried as a passenger in that motor-vehicle or trailer, or by his executor or administrator or by any person who is entitled to sue under the Families Compensation Act, for any injury, loss, or damage sustained by such person or for the death of such person by reason of the operation of that motor-vehicle or of that motor-vehicle with trailer attached by the driver thereof while such person is a passenger on or is entering or alighting from that motor-vehicle or trailer, unless there has been gross negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence contributed to the injury, loss, or damage in respect of which the action is brought; but the provisions of this section shall not relieve\n(a) any person transporting a passenger for hire or gain; or\n(b) any person, to whose business the transportation of passengers is normally incidental, transporting a passenger in the ordinary course of the transporter\u2019s business\nfrom liability for injury, loss, or damage to such passenger, or arising from the death of such passenger. No final judgment shall be entered in any such action until the Court is satisfied upon evidence adduced before it that the driver of the vehicle has been guilty of gross negligence.\nThe question was answered in the negative by the learned judge who heard the application and his judgment was sustained on appeal[2]. From that decision the appellant, with leave, has appealed.\nIn the Courts below the issue was dealt with in two stages. First, the question was considered as to whether an owner, qua owner, could be held liable for ordinary negligence in the maintenance and condition of his motor vehicle. As to this, both Courts held that he could, notwithstanding s. 71. Second, they went on to hold that where the owner was the driver of the car in which the passenger was riding, when injured, s. 71 did apply because the cause of action against the owner, qua owner, for negligent maintenance became fused into the character and nature of his operation of the motor vehicle. The learned judge of first instance puts the matter this way:\nHere, however, the owner and the driver of the vehicle are one and the same person and consequently, as the facts pleaded in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim indicate that the defendant \u201cwas driving his 1954 Oldsmobile motor vehicle\u201d and the infant plaintiff was his passenger, the defendant is entitled to the protection of the statute in its requirement that gross negligence must be established. The operation of the vehicle by the defendant in such circumstances includes in the field of negligence surrounding that operation the knowledge of the defendant as to the condition of his vehicle and the condition of the vehicle itself. The particulars indicated in paragraph 4 of the statement of claim are particulars which are relevant to the negligence in the operation of the vehicle itself. The pleadings clearly indicate that the defendant owned and operated the vehicle at the time of the accident. With respect, while reaching the same conclusion as to the answer to be given to the question of law raised, I have adopted a somewhat different approach to the issue.\nTo the question of law, as framed, the answer had to be in the negative. Apart altogether from the application of s. 71, negligent maintenance of a motor vehicle, per se, could not give rise to a cause of action. Facts would have to be established to link the negligence alleged to the injuries sustained by the appellant. In the particulars given in para. 4 of the statement of claim, it is alleged that the respondent \u201cpermitted\u201d his motor vehicle to be driven while it was in an unsafe condition, but it is clear, from para. 3, that the appellant alleges that the respondent was the driver. The cause of action alleged in the statement of claim is, in substance, that he negligently operated his motor vehicle which he knew, or should have known, was in an unsafe condition. The question which the parties sought to put in issue is whether, in such circumstances, s. 71 is applicable.\nEliminating from that section those words which are not relevant in this case, it provides:\nNo action shall lie against either the owner or the driver of a motor-vehicle\u2026 by a person who is carried as a passenger in that motor-vehicle\u2026 for any injury\u2026 sustained by such person\u2026 by reason of the operation of that motor-vehicle\u2026 by the driver thereof while such person is a passenger\u2026 unless there has been gross negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle\u2026\nThe statement of claim alleges that, at the time the appellant was injured, the respondent was the owner and driver of a motor vehicle. The appellant states that she was carried as a passenger in that motor vehicle. Her claim is for injury sustained by reason of the operation of that vehicle by the respondent, the driver, while she was a passenger in it.\nThese facts alleged in the statement of claim bring the action squarely within the section, and, that being so, gross negligence on the part of the respondent contributing to her injury must be established if she is to succeed.\nIt is unnecessary to consider, and for that reason I express no opinion upon, what might be the position, under s. 71, of an owner of a motor vehicle against whom a claim is made by an injured passenger, where the owner is not the driver, and where some specific negligence of the owner is alleged to have caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. That question would have to be determined in relation to the circumstances proved in the particular case.\nI would dismiss the appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Heath & Hutchison, Nanaimo.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Harper, Gilmour, Grey & Company, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961), 59 W.W.R. 41, 61 D.L.R.

The Registrar concluded that the use of both marks would lead to the inference that the wares emanate from the same source. It is admitted that the trade mark \u201cSmarties\u201d is inherently distinctive and has been in use for a much longer time than the mark \u201cSmoothies\u201d, that the nature of the trade is the same for both and that the wares are the same. The Exchequer Court, on appeal from the Registrar\u2019s decision, found that there was no probability of confusion and ordered the registration. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the registration refused. In deciding whether or not an unregistered trade mark is \u201cconfusing\u201d with a registered trade mark, it is enough if the words used in the registered and the unregistered trade marks respectively are likely to suggest the idea that the wares with which they are associated were produced or marketed by the same person. This was the approach adopted by the Registrar of Trade Marks and no grounds were established to justify the Exchequer Court to interfere with the conclusion reached by him.\nMarques de commerce\u2014Enregistrement\u2014Bonbons\u2014\u00abSmoothies\u00bb pour des bonbons\u2014\u00abSmarty\u00bb pour des biscuits et des bonbons et \u00abSmarties\u00bb pour des sucreries\u2014Les marques de commerce cr\u00e9ent-elles de la confusion\u2014Loi sur les marques de commerce, 1952-53, (Can.), c. 49, arts. 6(2), (5), 12(1)(d), 55(5).\nLa demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la compagnie intim\u00e9e pour obtenir l\u2019enregistrement de la marque de commerce \u00abSmoothies\u00bb concernant des bonbons fut rejet\u00e9e par le registraire des marques de commerce pour le motif que la marque de commerce cr\u00e9ait de la confusion avec la marque de commerce \u00abSmartie\u00bb concernant des biscuits et des bonbons et \u00abSmarties\u00bb concernant des sucreries, marque appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie appelante et enregistr\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement. Le registraire a conclu que l\u2019emploi des deux marques serait susceptible de faire conclure que les marchandises \u00e9manaient de la m\u00eame source.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in a trade mark matter. Appeal allowed.\nDonald F. Sim, Q.C., for the appellant. James D. Kokonis and Norman R. Shapiro, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Gibson of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 allowing the respondent\u2019s appeal from a decision by which the Registrar of Trade Marks had refused the respondent\u2019s application of September 13, 1961, for registration of the trade mark SMOOTHIES in respect of candy.\nThe Registrar\u2019s refusal was based on the ground that the trade mark applied for was \u201cconfusing\u201d with the appellant\u2019s trade mark SMARTIE as applied to biscuits and candy and SMARTIES as applied to confections which had been registered on March 6, 1928, and March 7, 1940, respectively.\nThe effect of, s. 12(1) (d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, (hereafter called \u201cthe Act\u201d) is that a trade mark is not registerable if it is \u201cconfusing with a registered trade mark\u201d and the question of whether it is confusing or not is to be determined in accordance with the standard fixed by s. 6(2) of the Act which reads as follows:\n6(2) The use of a trade mark causes confusion with another trade mark if the use of both trade marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with such trade marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not such wares or services are of the same general class.\nIt will be seen from these provisions that the essential question to be determined in deciding whether or not a trade mark is confusing with a registered trade mark is whether its use would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with it and those associated with the registered trade mark were produced or marketed by the same company.\nIn determining this issue, the Court or the Registrar is directed by s. 6(5) of the Act to \u201chave regard to all the surrounding circumstances including\n(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade marks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;\n(b) the length of time the trade marks or trade names have been in use;\n(c) the nature of the wares, services or business; (d) the nature of the trade; and\n(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade marks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.\nIt is expressly admitted, and was found by the learned trial judge, that the trade mark SMARTIES is inherently distinctive and as of September 16, 1961, the date of the application, had been used for a very long time in comparison to the length of time that SMOOTHIES had been used, and it is further admitted, in accordance with the trial judge\u2019s finding, that the nature of the trade in which the wares SMOOTHIES and SMARTIES are sold is the same and for the purpose of this appeal the respondent admits also that the wares sold under the two marks are the same.\nUnder these circumstances, the learned Registrar of Trade Marks directed himself, in determining the question of confusion between the marks, in accordance with the provisions of s. 6(2) of the Act and concluded:\nI have considered the evidence on file and also the representations of counsel for both parties at a hearing held in my Office November 19th, 1963. The nature of the wares and the nature of the trade in both cases is identical and the wares are distributed through the same channels of trade. Both marks are slang terms commonly used to describe a \u2018smart aleck\u2019 or a \u2018smooth operator\u2019. After carefully reviewing the evidence, I have arrived at the conclusion that there is a strong possibility that the concurrent use of both marks would lead to the inference that the wares of the applicant and those of the opponent emanate from the same source.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn reaching the opposite conclusion, it will be observed that the learned trial judge did not expressly apply the standards fixed by s. 6(2) and based his conclusion on his view of the meaning of the two words SMARTIES and SMOOTHIES. His finding reads as follows:\n\u2026that there is no resemblance between the trade marks in appearance, sound or in the idea suggested by them. There was no dispute between the parties that there is no appearance or sound resemblance, but there was a dispute as to whether there was a degree of resemblance in the idea suggested by them. As to the latter, however, it is clear that the meaning of these words are entirely dissimilar. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u2018smarties\u2019 and \u2018smoothies\u2019 as follows:\nsmart or smartie\u2026 one that tries in a callow fashion to be witty or clever: smart aleck.\nsmoothy or smoothie \u2026 1a: a person with polished manners b: one who behaves or performs with deftness, assurance, easy competence\u2026\nAll of which, on balance, leads to the conclusion, in my view, that there is no probability of confusion within the meaning of section 6 of the Trade Marks Act of \u2018Smoothies\u2019 with \u2018Smarties\u2019. In the factum filed on behalf of the respondent, it is submitted that \u201cIt is the degree of resemblance between the two trade marks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them (s. 6(5)(e) of the Trade Marks Act) that is the essential question to be decided on the issue of confusion\u201d. As I have indicated, the learned trial judge determined this question by reference to the meaning attributed to the words in question by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary and his conclusion is based on the finding that \u201cthe meaning of these words are entirely dissimilar\u201d.\nOn the other hand, I am, as I have stated, of opinion that the essential question to be determined is whether the use of the word SMOOTHIES by the respondent would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with that word and those associated with the registered trade marks of the appellant were produced or marketed by the same company and I do not think that this necessarily involves a resemblance between the dictionary meaning of the word used in the trade mark applied for and those used in the registered trade marks. It is enough, in my view, if the words used in the registered and unregistered trade marks are likely to suggest the idea that the wares with which they are associated were produced or marketed by the same person. This is the approach which appears to me to have been adopted by the Registrar of Trade Marks.\nIt is contended on behalf of the respondent that the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge should not be disturbed having regard to the terms of s. 55(5) of the Act which provides that \u201con the appeal\u2026 the Court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar\u201d. I do not, however, take this as meaning that the Court is entitled to substitute its view for that of the Registrar unless it can be shown that he proceeded on some wrong principle or that he failed to exercise his discretion judicially.In this latter regard I would adopt the approach outlined by Lord Evershed In the Matter of Broadhead\u2019s Application for Registration of a Trade Mark[2], where he was speaking of a case in which the Court of first instance had overruled a finding of the Registrar of Trade Marks as to whether a trade mark was distinctive or not and the Court of Appeal approved the Court\u2019s judgment. At the time of this decision the English Trade Marks Act, 1-2 Geo. 6, 1938, c. 22, was in force, s. 22 of which provides that \u201cthe Court shall have and exercise the same discretionary powers as under this Act are conferred upon the Registrar\u201d. Lord Evershed there said at page 213:\nIt has been argued that, the question being one of the discretion of the Registrar, there is at any rate a strong case against interference with that discretion by the Court. Like all discretions, the Registrar\u2019s discretion must be judicially exercised; and such an exercise of discretion is, according to the principle recently laid down in the House of Lords in Evans v. Bartlam (1937) 53 Times L.R. (689), liable to review on grounds which are well understood. There can be added the further consideration that the subject matter in such a case as this is one with which the Registrar and his assistants are peculiarly well versed, and the greatest weight should, therefore, be attached to their experience in such matters. In the case of Edward Hack\u2019s Trade Mark (1941) 58 R.P.C. (91) Morton J., as he then was, referred to the well known statement of Lord Dunedin in the case of George Banham & Coy. v. F. Reddaway & Coy. Ltd. Lord Dunedin said: \u2018Now it is true that an appeal lies from the decision of the Registrar, but, in my opinion, unless he has gone clearly wrong, his decision ought not to be interfered with. The reason for that is that it seems to me that to settle whether a trade mark is distinctive or not\u2014and that is the criterion laid down by the statute\u2014is a practical question, and a question that can only be settled by considering the whole of the circumstances of the case.\u2019\nIn my view the Registrar of Trade Marks in the present case applied the test required of him by the statute and I do not think that grounds were established justifying the learned judge of the Exchequer Court in interfering with his conclusion. For all these reasons I would allow this appeal and restore the decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks refusing the respondent\u2019s application S.N. 264951.\nThe appellant will have the costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy and McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: N.R.

The work done at the respondent\u2019s plant on the raw marble consisted of book matching, grouting, rodding, gluing, grinding, rough and fine polishing, cutting and edge finishing. The sole issue to be determined was whether the work done by the respondent on the slabs resulted in such marble becoming \u201cgoods produced or manufactured in Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 30(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100. The trial judge found that the activities to which the slabs were subjected were not the application of an art or process so as to change the character of the imported natural product so as to come within the meaning of \u201cproduced or manufactured\u201d in the Excise Tax Act. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Crown\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nThe work done by the respondent on the marble slabs resulted in such marble becoming \u201cgoods produced or manufactured in Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 30(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act. Adopting one of the definitions of \u201cmanufacture\u201d in M.N.R. v. Dominion Shuttle Co. Ltd. (1933), 72 Que. S.C. 15, the finished marble slabs which left the respondent\u2019s plant had by work, both by hand and machinery, received new form, new quality and new properties. The words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d as used in the present statute are not synonymous, and if there were any doubts that the various procedures taken by the respondent resulted in the manufacture of a piece of marble, there was no doubt that those procedures did result in the production of a piece of marble.\nThe fact that the respondent used the marble pieces in executing the building subcontracts did not exempt it from the liability of the tax since the Excise Tax Act imposes a consumption tax as well as a sales tax.\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014P\u00e9tition de droit pour obtenir remboursement\u2014Tranches de marbre import\u00e9es\u2014Polissage et sciage avant l\u2019installation dans des \u00e9difices par l\u2019importateur\u2014Est-ce que le marbre fini est \u00abune marchandise produite ou fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada\u00bb et en cons\u00e9quence sujet \u00e0 la taxe de vente ou de consommation\u2014Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, arts. 30(1)(a), 31(1)(d)\u2014Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, S.R.C. 1952, c. 200, art. 10(1).\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e importe des tranches de marbre brut de diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9paisseurs et grandeurs, et apr\u00e8s les avoir travaill\u00e9es installe le produit fini dans diff\u00e9rents \u00e9difices pour lesquels elle agit comme sous-entrepreneur. Les travaux qui se font \u00e0 l\u2019atelier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur le marbre brut consistent en l\u2019appariation ou l\u2019appareillement, le masticage, l\u2019insertion de baguettes de fer, le collage, le rodage, le polissage en gros et en fin, le sciage et la finition des bords. La seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider \u00e9tait de savoir si les travaux faits par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur les tranches de marbre avaient eu comme r\u00e9sultat de faire de ces marbres de la \u00abmarchandise produite ou fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada\u00bb dans le sens de l\u2019art. 30(1)(a) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu que les activit\u00e9s auxquelles les tranches de marbre \u00e9taient soumises n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u2019application d\u2019un art ou d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au point de changer le caract\u00e8re du produit naturel import\u00e9 de telle sorte qu\u2019il tombe dans le sens de \u00abproduit ou manufactur\u00e9\u00bb de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, concerning a petition of right for refund of sales tax. Appeal allowed. C.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and N.A. Chalmers, for the appellant.\nW.D. Goodman and B.A. Spiegel, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gibson of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] delivered on May 11, 1966, whereby he allowed a petition of right brought by the respondent to recover moneys paid by it to the Receiver General of Canada pursuant to a demand made by the Minister of National Revenue for payment of the sales or consumption tax imposed by the Excise Tax Act and the Old Age Security Act on marble products. The provisions under which the taxes were claimed were ss. 30(1)(a) and 31(1)(d) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, and s. 10(1) of the Old Age Security Act, R.S.C. 952, c. 200, as enacted by Statutes of Canada 1959, c. 14, s. 1. These sections read as follows:\nExcise Tax Act:.\n30. (1) There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of eight per cent. on the sale price of all goods\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada\n(i) payable, in any case other than a case mentioned in subparagraph (ii), by the producer or manufacturer at the time when goods are delivered to the purchaser or at the time when the property in the goods passes, whichever is the earlier, and\u2026\n* * *\n31. (1) Whenever goods are manufactured or produced in Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for the consumption or sales tax because\n* * *\n(d) such goods are for use by the manufacturer or producer and not for sale;\nthe Minister may determine the value for the tax under this Act and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this Act be regarded as sales.\nOld Age Security Act:\n10. (1) There shall be imposed, levied and collected an Old Age Security tax of three per cent on the sale price of all goods in respect of which tax is payable under section 30 of the Excise Tax Act, at the same time, by the same persons and subject to the same conditions as the tax payable under that section.\nBy agreement between the parties, the sole issue to be determined in the Exchequer Court was whether the work done by the respondent on slab marble during the period in question resulted in such marble becoming \u201cgoods produced or manufactured in Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 30(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act.\nThe respondent imported slabs of raw marble. At the time of their arrival at the respondent\u2019s plant these slabs had merely been cut from a large block. The slabs varied in thickness and in size both as to length and width. The surface was rough and greyish in colour and the slab edges were rough and unfinished. Exhibit 2 filed at the trial is a photograph of such rough marble slabs as they were stored in the respondent\u2019s warehouse and illustrates that the said slabs possessed none of the beauty of the finished product installed by the respondent in the various buildings as to which the company was sub-contractor.\nThe work done at the respondent\u2019s plant from the time the rough marble arrived there until the finished pieces left ready for installation in the various buildings was described by the vice\u2011president, Alfred Peirol, C.A., in his evidence and may be summarized as follows:\n(a) Book Matching: Each slab of marble is matched against other slabs which have been sawn from the same block so that the veining which appears in the marble will follow a pattern from piece to piece in a particular installation.\n(b) Grouting: Certain slabs of marble such as Travertine marble have voids at their surfaces which are often filled with coloured cement material.\n(c) Rodding: Certain slabs of marble are weak and must be re-enforced with metal rods. This is done by cutting grooves in one surface of the slab of marble and by inserting and cementing metal rods into the grooves.\n(d) Gluing: Certain slabs of marble often break in the course of being worked on and consequently are glued together with special materials.\n(e) Grinding: The surface of a slab of marble is sometimes reduced and levelled by using a grinder.\n(f) Rough Polishing: Marble is polished on polishing tables. The marble is laid flat on the table and a disc mounted on an electrically powered polishing head is caused to rotate on the surface of the marble. To the disc may be attached an abrasive such as carborundum segments or the disc may be left bare and an abrasive in the form of carborundum grain is placed on the marble itself. The rough polishing is usually done in two stages and the result thereby obtained is referred to as a honed finish.\n(g) Fine Polishing: From time to time polishing is begun on the polishing table to the time the marble leaves the table, the marble may undergo five polishing stages. In each stage, finer abrasives or carborundum segments are used until in the final stage the marble is polished with felt buffing pads and fine abrasive powders. The stages of polishing performed after the marble surface has been honed are referred to as fine polishing.\n(h) Cutting: Once the marble is polished, it is cut to the desired dimension with a power diamond circular saw. The saw is mounted over a table on which the marble is placed and fastened. Sawing marble is a delicate operation as the edges of a piece of marble which will be exposed must not be damaged in the operation.\n(i) Edge Finishing: The exposed edges of a piece of marble are polished with belt sanders or by hand and again several stages are used to obtain the desired finish.\nThe learned Exchequer Court Judge in his reasons for judgment found that the activities aforesaid were not the application of an art or process so as to change the character of the imported natural product dealt with so as to come within the meaning of \u201cproduced or manufactured\u201d in the Excise Tax Act, and it is this finding which is contested by Her Majesty the Queen in this appeal.\nMany authorities were cited but in my view few are enlightening. It must always be remembered that decisions in reference to other statutory provisions, and particularly decisions in other jurisdictions, are of only limited assistance in construing the exact provisions of a statute of Canada. In reference to the words \u201call goods (a) produced or manufactured in Canada\u201d, Duff C.J. noted in His Majesty the King v. Vandeweghe Limited[3]:\nThe words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d are not words of any very precise meaning and, consequently, we must look to the context for the purpose of ascertaining their meaning and application in the provisions we have to construe.\nFurther reference shall be made to that judgment hereunder. It was delivered on March 6, 1934, and on December 2, 1933, Archambault J., in Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Shuttle Company Limited[4], gave a very interesting judgment in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec.\nBoth of these judgments considered the said ss. 85 ff. of the Special War Revenue Act in which the same words, \u201cproduced or manufactured in Canada\u201d were used. Archambault J., outlined the facts as follows:\nThe evidence shows that these lengths of lumber were sold and delivered by the saw\u2011mill in British Columbia to defendants at Lachute, in lengths of 20\u2019, 16\u2019 and 25\u2019 and at so much per thousand feet. The work done on these lengths by defendant was: first, to cut them in lengths of 10\u2019, or 8\u2019; second, to creosote them, or dip them in creosoting oils to preserve them against the elements of the weather (for which defendants have a special plant); third, to round them or mill or dress the lumber to the rounded shape; fourth, to bore holes in them in order to insert the pin on which the insulator is placed, and after this work was done, they were sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway at the price, not based on so much a thousand feet, but based on so much per hundred \u201ccross arms\u201d.\nand he then continued:\nThe questions to be decided are: first, are the defendants the producers or manufacturers of these \u201ccross arms\u201d? second, should the cost of transportation from British Columbia to Lachute be included in the sale price?\nFirst, what is a manufacturer? There is no definition of the word \u201cmanufacturer\u201d in the Act and it is practically impossible to find a definition which will be absolutely accurate, but from all the definitions contained in leading dictionaries, Corpus Juris, Encyclopedias, etc., the Court gathers that to manufacture is to fabricate; it is the act or process of making articles for use; it is the operation of making goods or wares of any kind; it is the production of articles for use from raw or prepared material by giving to these materials new forms, qualities and properties or combinations whether by hand or machinery.\nThis is exactly what the defendant company did. They received the raw material or prepared raw material, or lengths of lumber, and put them through the processes already mentioned to make \u201ccross arms\u201d and sold them to the consumer.\nFor the present purposes, I wish to note and to adopt one of the definitions cited by the learned judge, i.e., that \u201cmanufacture is the production of articles for use from raw or prepared material by giving to these materials new forms, qualities and properties or combinations whether by hand or machinery\u201d. (The italics are my own.) If one were to apply the latter test to the question at issue in this appeal, in my view, the finished marble slabs which left the respondent\u2019s plant had by work, both by hand and machinery, received new form, new quality and new properties. The form differed in that what arrived were great slabs of raw marble sometimes as long as sixteen feet and of varying widths, and what left were exactly shaped pieces of polished marble much smaller in size cut with precision to fit the places into which they were to be installed. As to quality, what arrived was a greyish, non-descript slab of stone and what left was a highly polished marble facing whether it was to be installed in a wall, as a window sill, or as a post. As to properties, what arrived was in many cases a piece of unfilled stone and sometimes one which would be too fragile for use and what left in most cases was a piece of marble in which the rough unevenness had been filled in by grouting and where necessary the weakness had been remedied by rodding.\nIn my view, the application of this test alone would be sufficient justification to find that the marble pieces which left the respondent\u2019s plant had been \u201cproduced\u201d or \u201cmanufactured\u201d there from the raw material of the rough slabs of marble which had arrived.\nIn Gruen Watch Company of Canada Ltd. et al. v. Attorney General of Canada[5], McRuer C.J.H.C. considered the same question in reference to the same statute. The facts may be briefly stated from the first paragraph of his judgment at p. 430:\nThe plaintiffs in this action have been engaged for many years in the importation of watch movements from abroad. They import or purchase in Canada watch cases adapted to the particular movements imported, and by a very simple operation performed by unskilled labour, taking only a very few minutes at an expense of from 1.25 to 3.6 cents each, the watch movement is placed in the case and a watch ready for sale is produced. In some cases wrist-bands, bracelets or brooches are attached to the watch case for the personal convenience of the purchasers. The plaintiffs do not manufacture either watch movements or watch cases.\nAt p. 442, the learned Chief Justice said:\nI cannot find that the simple operation of putting a watch movement into a watch case is \u201cmanufacturing\u201d a watch in the \u201cordinary, popular and natural sense\u201d of the word, but I feel clear that the plaintiffs \u201cproduced\u201d watches \u201cadapted to household or personal use\u201d. It may well be that, as counsel for the plaintiffs argued, the movement as imported in the tin or aluminum case will keep time and could be used as a watch. It is not a watch \u201cadapted to household or personal use\u201d as the term is used in its ordinary and popular sense, and the movement in the aluminum case would be quite unsaleable as such.\nIt is to be noted that the learned Chief Justice used the firmly established principle that the taxing statute must be interpreted by the consideration of the words thereof in the ordinary, proper, and natural sense, and that doing so he found himself able to distinguish between the two words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d. It was the submission of counsel for the respondent before this Court that the two words must be considered as being practically synonymous and Charles Marchand Co. v. Higgins[6] was quoted as an authority therefor. That was a decision of Mandelbaum, District Judge in the District Court of the Southern District of New York, and the decision on this point may be taken from one sentence in the reasons of the learned District Court Judge, \u201cI am of the opinion that the terms as used in the present taxing statute are synonymous\u201d. The learned District Court Judge reached that conclusion because Article 4 of Treasury Regulation 46 (1932 edition) provided:\nAs used in the Act, the term \u201cproducer\u201d includes a person who produces a taxable article by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of the article, or produces a taxable article by combining or assembling two or more articles.\nand then various authorities relied on by the learned District Court Judge held that \u201cmanufacture\u201d implied a change into a new and different article.\nFor these reasons, I am not able to accept the decision in Charles Marchand v. Higgins as being an authority which should persuade this Court to hold that \u201cproduce\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d as used in the statute presently considered in which neither is defined are synonymous, and I adopt the course of McRuer C.J.H.C., in Gruen Watch Co. v. Attorney General of Canada in holding that an article may be \u201cproduced\u201d although it is not \u201cmanufactured\u201d. In that case, although he was unable to come to the conclusion that the mere insertion of the movement into the watch case was the manufacture of the watch, he found no difficulty in determining that such a process was the production of a watch.\nSimilarly, in the present case, if I had any doubt that the various procedures taken by the respondent in reference to the marble slabs resulted in the manufacture of a piece of marble, I would have no doubt that those procedures did result in the production of a piece of marble.\nIn The King v. Vandeweghe Limited, supra, Duff C.J., upon commenting that the words \u201cproduce\u201d and \u201cmanufacture\u201d were not words of any very precise meaning, sought an aid to construction in a consideration of the exemptions from the impositions which were listed in subs. (4) of s. 86 of the then statute. Amongst those exemptions were pulpwood, tan bark, wool no further prepared than washed and raw fur. The Chief Justice of this Court remarked at p. 248:\nLight is thrown upon the meaning of the word \u201cproduced\u201d by the fact that pulpwood and tan bark and other articles the product of the forest are contemplated as being produced within the meaning of the statute. We have further the item \u201cwool no further prepared than washed\u201d which seems to imply that wool still further prepared, by dyeing for example, if sold, comes within the incidence of the tax. Then we have \u201craw furs\u201d which is not without its implication. It is not easy to see why a raw fur which is separated from the animal upon which it grew, when combed, \u201cmade pliable\u201d and dyed and thereby turned into \u201cmerchantable stock-in-trade\u201d, has not become something which is \u201cproduced\u201d if the term \u201cproduced\u201d is properly applicable to such things as \u201cpulpwood\u201d and \u201ctan bark\u201d.\nTo apply the same method of testing to the present situation, Schedule 3 to the Excise Tax Act contains a list of exemptions, including:\nBuilding stone (exemption removed effective June 14, 1963)\nSand\nGravel\nRubble\nField Stone\nCut flowers\nStraw\nForest products when produced and sold by the individual settler or farmer\nFurs, raw\nLogs and round unmanufactured timber\nSawdust and wood shavings\nWool not further prepared than washed\nOf course, such goods as sand, gravel, rubble or field stone could not be considered either \u201cmanufactured\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d. Nor in all probability would they have been imported and so taxable under s. 30(1)(b). There have been, however, some very simple operations in the production of cut flowers, straw, raw furs and wool not further prepared than washed, and yet it is apparent that these items were regarded by Parliament as being \u201cmanufactured\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d.\nIn at least two recent decisions, the Court has considered the schedules to the Customs Act as being a revenue statute in pari materia and therefore an aid in the interpretation of words in the Excise Tax Act. In Bradshaw v. Minister of Customs and Excise[7], Duff C.J., when considering the phrase \u201cnursery stock\u201d as used in subs. (4) of s. 19BBB of c. 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 5 Geo. V, pointed out that in the Customs Tariff the words used were \u201ctrees, plants and shrubs, commonly known as nursery stock\u201d and in The King v. Planters Nut and Chocolate Company Ltd.[8], Cameron J., at p. 130, said:\nIt is of considerable interest, also, to note that in the tariff rates under The Customs Act (which, as a revenue Act, I consider to be in pari materia), separate items are set up for fruits, for vegetables, and also for \u201cnuts of all kinds, not otherwise provided, including shelled peanuts\u201d. This would seem to indicate that in the minds of the legislators, nuts were not included in the categories of fruits or vegetables, and also that peanuts fell within the category of nuts.\nWhen one calls in aid of the construction of the words \u201cmanufactured\u201d and \u201cproduced\u201d in s. 30(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act, the provisions of the Customs Tariff, items 306(b) and 306(c), which read as follows:\n306b. Building stone, other than marble or granite, planed, turned, cut or further manufactured than sawn on four sides.\n306c. Marble, not further manufactured than sawn, when imported by manufacturers of tombstones to be used exclusively in the manufacture of such articles, in their own factories.\nit would appear that the legislators regarded mere sawing of both building stone and marble as being the manufacture thereof. I view these considerations of both the exemptions in Schedule C of the Excise Tax Act and the items in the Customs Act as being confirmatory of my view that the legislators intended that the words \u201cmanufactured\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d should encompass goods such as the polished marble slabs in question in this appeal.\nGibson J., in the penultimate paragraph of his reasons for judgment, stated:\nThe activities of the suppliant in relation to the imported marble were done as part and parcel of executing building sub-contracts resulting in such marble becoming part of the realty and in doing so the suppliant did not at any material time produce or manufacture in Canada \u201cgoods\u201d as meant in s. 30(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act.\nIt should be noted that the Excise Tax Act in s. 30 imposes not only a sales tax but a consumption tax and that s. 31(1)(d) of the said Excise Tax Act makes specific provision for goods which although manufactured or produced in Canada were for use by the manufacturer or producer and not for sale. This Court, in The King v. Fraser Companies Ltd[9], held that a corporation which produced lumber and used the same in the performance of a building contract was liable for the tax, and again, in The King v. Dominion Bridge Co. Ltd.[10], held that a company which produced steel members in order to fabricate them in the superstructure of a bridge was liable to the tax.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the fact that the respondent used the marble pieces in executing the building sub-contracts does not exempt it from the liability of the tax.\nI would allow the appeal with costs. Her Majesty should have the costs in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

The appellant met the police officers at an agreed location and under her direction they drove to the home of her confederate. There, they were told that the confederate intended to take them to another house as soon as a telephone call, which she was expecting, confirmed the arrangements she had already made. Eventually, a telephone call came and the confederate was heard to say \u201cleave the front door open\u201d. The men and the two girls then drove to a private home in a suburban residential area, the owner of which was not disclosed in the record. Money exchanged hands and after the girls had removed some of their clothing, they were arrested. There was no evidence in the record that the home had ever been used for the purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency. It had no such reputation nor was there any evidence of undue traffic to or from the premises. The appellant was convicted of keeping a common bawdy house, and her conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and a verdict of acquittal entered.\nTo obtain a conviction of keeping a common bawdy house, the Crown must prove that there had been a frequent or habitual use of a place for the purpose of prostitution. There was no such evidence in this case nor was there any evidence upon which the magistrate could properly base an inference that the place had been habitually so used.\nDroit criminel\u2014Maisons de d\u00e9sordre\u2014Tenancier de maison de d\u00e9bauche\u2014Aucune preuve que la maison utilis\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 ces fins\u2014Verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 peut-il \u00eatre soutenu\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 168.\nA la suite d\u2019un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d\u2019un officier de police, un agent provocateur, aux fins de rapports sexuels illicites, l\u2019appelante a convenu d\u2019embaucher une autre fille qui ferait des arrangements pour obtenir un local o\u00f9 les deux filles pourraient recevoir celui qui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait ainsi que trois amis, aussi des officiers de police. L\u2019appelante a rencontr\u00e9 les officiers de police \u00e0 l\u2019endroit convenu et, sous sa direction, ils se sont tous dirig\u00e9s en automobile \u00e0 la maison de l\u2019autre fille. A cet endroit, on leur a dit que cette fille avait l\u2019intention de les amener \u00e0 une autre maison d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique confirmant les arrangements qu\u2019elle avait faits ant\u00e9rieurement. \u00c9ventuellement, l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u et on entendit la fille demander de laisser la porte d\u2019en avant ouverte. Les hommes et les deux filles se sont alors dirig\u00e9s en automobile vers une maison priv\u00e9e dans un quartier r\u00e9sidentiel de banlieue. Le nom du propri\u00e9taire de cette maison n\u2019appara\u00eet pas au dossier. Les officiers ont donn\u00e9 de l\u2019argent aux filles et apr\u00e8s que ces derni\u00e8res eurent enlev\u00e9 quelques-uns de leurs v\u00eatements, elles furent mises sous arr\u00eat. Il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve dans le dossier que la maison avait en aucun temps servi \u00e0 des fins de prostitution ou pour la pratique d\u2019actes d\u2019ind\u00e9cence. La maison n\u2019avait pas cette r\u00e9putation et il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve d\u2019entr\u00e9es ou de sorties inusit\u00e9es.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal allowed.\nJohn F. Hamilton, for the appellant.\nC.J. Meinhardt, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 delivered on January 5, 1967, whereby that Court dismissed the appeal from the conviction of the accused on February 8, 1966, by a police magistrate. The accused was charged with unlawfully keeping a common bawdy house, situate and known as 43 Harding Boulevard. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario, MacKay J.A., with whom Porter C.J.O. concurred, gave reasons for dismissing the appeal and Schroeder J.A. gave reasons for allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction. The facts were accurately stated in considerable detail in the judgment of Schroeder J.A. as follows:\nOn December 2, 1966 (sic-a, misprint for 1965) a morality squad officer of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department, Detective John Leybourne, telephoned the appellant, using an assumed name, and made an instigative sexual proposition to her. In the result, it was arranged that she should procure another girl who would make arrangements for a suitable place of assignation where both could satisfy the sexual appetites of the agent provocateur and of three male friends (fellow officers of the morality squad but not so made known to the appellant).\nSubsequently Detective Leybourne and two fellow detectives, all attired in plain clothes, met the appellant at an agreed location on Bloor Street, and under her direction they drove to the home of her confederate, one Beverley Dixon. Upon their arrival Dixon informed them that she intended to take them to another house and was awaiting a telephone call to confirm the plans which she had set afoot. A call eventually came and in responding to it Dixon was heard to say \u201cleave the front door open\u201d.\nThe three detectives and the two girls then repaired to a suburban home in a quiet residential section of Richmond Hill, known and described for municipal purposes as 43 Harding Boulevard. The record discloses nothing as to the identity of the owner or occupant of that property.\nDetective Leybourne had given the appellant $75 as compensation for the favours to be bestowed upon him and his two companions and an additional $10 to pay for the use of the premises. After their arrival the appellant and her female companion repaired to another part of the house, and later returned to the presence of the detectives wearing nothing but their under-garments. At this point the three police officers disclosed their identity and after Detective Leybourne had repossessed himself of the $85 previously paid to the appellant he charged her and her companion with the offence out of which the present appeal arises. Beverley Dixon, who had made the necessary arrangements for the use of the Harding Boulevard premises, was acquitted by the Magistrate and a conviction was entered against the appellant only.\nThere is not the remotest suggestion in the record that house number 43 Harding Boulevard in Richmond Hill, a private residence in a quiet and respectable residential subdivision, had ever been used by the appellant or any other person for the purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency. No evidence was adduced as to any undue traffic to and from the said premises which would reflect prejudicially upon the reputation of the house or its occupants. The only evidence offered was that of the three detectives which undoubtedly proved the intent of the appellant and her co-accused to commit an act of prostitution with these witnesses at the place in question.\nThe appellant has stated the points at issue in this appeal as follows:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in finding 43 Harding Boulevard was a common bawdy house?\n2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the appellant was the keeper of a common bawdy house, pursuant to s. 168 of the Criminal Code?\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal found that the premises at 43 Harding Boulevard were a common bawdy house and that the appellant was the keeper thereof. Schroeder J.A., dissenting, was of the opinion that the premises were not a common bawdy house and that the appellant was not the keeper thereof. I am of the opinion that this appeal may be disposed of by considering the first question only and I have come to the conclusion for the reasons which I shall outline that the premises were not a common bawdy house within the meaning of those words as used in s. 168 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, as Roach J.A. said in giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. King[2]:\nSince this place was not a common bawdy house, it is irrelevant who the keeper was. Section 168 of the Criminal Code provides in subs. (1), paras. (b), (h), and (i):\n168. (1) In this Part,\n(b) \u201ccommon bawdy house\u201d means a place that is\n(i) kept or occupied, or\n(ii) resorted to by one or more persons for the purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency;\n* * *\n(h) \u201ckeeper\u201d includes a person who\n(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,\n(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,\n(iv) has the care or management of a place,\nor\n(v) Uses a place permanently or temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and\n(i) \u201cplace\u201d includes any place, whether or not\n(i) it is covered or enclosed,\n(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily,\nor\n(iii) any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it.\nSchroeder J.A. was of the opinion that the words \u201ckept or occupied\u201d and the words \u201cresorted to\u201d as used in s. 168(1) (b) (i) and (ii) connote a frequent or habitual use of the premises for the purposes of prostitution. I am in accord with that view. I have considered all the cases cited and I have noted that there has been evidence, in each case where conviction has resulted, of one of three types,\nfirstly, there has been actual evidence of the continued and habitual use of the premises for prostitution as in The King v. Cohen[3] and Rex v. Miket[4],\nsecondly, there has been evidence of the reputation in the neighbourhood of the premises as a common bawdy house, or\nthirdly, there has been evidence of such circumstances as to make the inference that the premises were resorted to habitually as a place of prostitution, a proper inference for the court to draw from such evidence.\nExamples of the latter are, particularly, Rex v. Davidson[5], where Stewart J.A. giving judgment for the majority of the Court said at p. 54:\nIt might very well happen that a clerk in a hotel who had become friendly with a man, a guest or inmate or a regular customer of the hotel, might, on receiving a wink, shut his eyes to his friend\u2019s proposed escapade and allow him to take a woman to his room on one occasion without protest, and yet not be guilty at all of habitually allowing any casual guest to do so.\nAnd at p. 55:\nThe way in which the whole thing happened was such that the magistrate might quite properly infer that it was not an isolated instance but rather a matter of course and of custom or habit. Moreover, I think the decision in Rex v. James, 25 Can. Cr. Cas. 23, 25 D.L.R. 476, 9 A.L.R. 66, 9 W.W.R. 235, went upon the same principle, viz., that the existence of a habit or custom of doing a certain thing might be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the doing and the manner of doing or even of offering to do that thing on a single occasion.\nThis is sufficient to sustain the conviction and the motion should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nIt was admitted that though the accused was only a night clerk he came within the definition of a \u201ckeeper\u201d given in sec. 228(2) of the Code.\nAlso, in Rex v. Clay[6], Bissonnette J. said at p. 40:\nAs a general rule, proof of an isolated act of prostitution cannot suffice to establish the offence of keeping a disorderly house. But if, from circumstances surrounding the evidence of this isolated act, a certainty arises that this house is habitually used for purposes of prostitution, the magistrate is thereupon justified in not requiring direct proof of the bad reputation or delictual character of this house.\nIt would therefore appear that the element of habitual or frequent use of the place will remain the necessary interpretation of proof despite the amendment of the definition of \u201ccommon bawdy house\u201d to add the words \u201cresorted to by one or more persons\u201d and in fact that the word \u201cresorted\u201d itself has been relied upon to support the view that such habitual or frequent use of a place is required. (See Rex v. Davidson, supra). So in cases where the Crown has failed to prove a habitual or frequent use of a place for the purposes of prostitution, the conviction has not been upheld. In Rex v. King, supra, Roach J.A. said at p.325:\nIt was not a place kept or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for the purposes of prostitution or the practice of acts of indecency. The authorities make it clear that to come within that definition the place must be one that is habitually so kept or resorted to.\nI echo the words of Hanrahan P.M., in Rex v. Martin[7], when he said:\nIt is true convictions have been registered and sustained on appeal on evidence of a single act of prostitution, but always in such cases the surrounding circumstances established the premises had been habitually used for such a purpose and in most cases had acquired such a reputation in the community.\nAs I have said, there was no evidence in the present case of any reputation in the community and there was no evidence of the use of the premises for prostitution on any other occasion than the one which was the subject of this prosecution. There was moreover no evidence upon which the learned magistrate properly could base an inference that the place had been habitually so used.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and direct a verdict of acquittal.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and verdict of acquittal directed.\nCounsel for the appellant: John F. Hamilton, Toronto.\nCounsel for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 1 O.R. 429, 3 C.C.C. 39.\n[2] [1965] 2 C.C.C. 324 at 325, [1965] 1 O.R. 389.\n[3] [1939] S.C.R. 212, 71 C.C.C. 142, 1 D.L.R. 396.\n[4] [1938] 2 W.W.R. 459, 70 C.C.C. 202, 53 B.C.R. 37, 3 D.L.R. 710.\n[5] (1917), 28 C.C.C. 44, 1 W.W.R. 160, 11 Alta.

The trial judge had refused to grant an injunction, the effect of which was to compel the appellant company to abide by the terms of a decree providing, among other things, for the closing of retail food stores on certain days and during certain hours. The Court of Appeal directed that the injunction should issue. The appellant company inscribed an appeal to this Court from that judgment and, after having unsuccessfully applied to the Court of Appeal for a stay of execution, applied to this Court for an order staying the operation of the injunction.\nHeld: The application for a stay of execution should be dismissed.\nAssuming, without deciding, that this Court had jurisdiction to grant the stay of execution, and assuming that, should its appeal be successful, the appellant company would have no legal means to recover the monies which it had lost, the stay of execution ought not to be granted in the circumstances of this case as otherwise the appellant company would have an unfair advantage over its competitors.\nJuridiction\u2014Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Injonction\u2014Suspension durant l\u2019appel\u2014Doit-elle \u00eatre accord\u00e9e\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 44.\nLe juge de. premi\u00e8re instance a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder une injonction dont l\u2019effet aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de contraindre la compagnie appelante \u00e0 se conformer aux termes d\u2019un d\u00e9cret ordonnant, entre autres choses, la fermeture des \u00e9tablissements commerciaux o\u00f9 se fait la vente au d\u00e9tail de produits alimentaires, \u00e0 certains jours et durant certaines heures.

Requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nAPPLICATION for a stay of execution of an injunction pending the appeal. Application dismissed.\nC.A. Geoffrion, Q.C., and P. Lamontagne, for the applicant.\nC. Tellier, for the Comit\u00e9 Paritaire.\nL.E. B\u00e9langer, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Quebec. Pierre Langlois, for the Employees Association.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an application for an Order staying the operation of an Injunction granted by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side), the effect of which, so far as the applicant is concerned, is to compel it to close its stores except during the hours of\n1.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. on Mondays\n9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays\n9.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays\n9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Saturdays.\nThe application was argued on November 27 and 28, 1967, and judgment was reserved. On December 18, 1967, judgment was given as follows:\nThe Court is unanimously of opinion that this application should be dismissed. It is ordered that the appeal be set down for the sittings of the Court commencing on January 23, 1968 and that the hearing of the appeal be expedited. The motion is dismissed and the costs of the motion are reserved to be dealt with by the Court which hears the appeal. Reasons for judgment will be delivered at a later date.\nReasons are now being delivered.\nThe judge of first instance held that the Injunction should be refused on the ground that articles 3.02, 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07 of Section III of the Decree Respecting the Retail Food Trade published in the Quebec Official Gazette of May 15, 1965, were beyond the powers conferred on the Lieutenant-Governor in Council by the Collective Agreement Act, that they were not severable and that consequently the Decree was ultra vires in toto.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) held by a majority that the Order in question was valid and directed that the Injunction should issue. Tremblay C.J.P.Q., with whom Salvas J. agreed, dissenting, was of opinion that the Decree was invalid for reasons expressed differently from those of the judge of first instance.\nIn support of the application for a stay it was argued that compliance with the Order will cause a loss to the applicant of approximately $10,000 a week and that if this Court, when the appeal is heard on the merits, should allow the appeal, there would be no way in which the applicant could recover the monies which it had lost. For the purposes of this application I will assume, without deciding, that the applicant is right in its submission that such a loss could not be recovered; this would seem to follow from the judgment of Fauteux J. speaking for the Court in La Ville Saint-Laurent v. Marien[1], particularly at p. 586.\nCounsel for the respondent objected to the granting of the Order sought on three grounds.\nFirst, it was contended that the main appeal of the applicant is not properly before this Court as (i) it does not appear that more than $10,000 is involved in the appeal and (ii) an order for an Injunction made in the Province of Quebec is an order made in the exercise of judicial discretion within the meaning of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act which deprives the Court of jurisdiction. As to (i), the uncontradicted affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the applicant states that the loss which it will suffer if the injunction is maintained will greatly exceed $10,000. As to (ii), it is my view that the order sought to be appealed was not one made in the exercise of judicial discretion within the meaning of s. 44. The order is not attacked on the ground that any discretion was wrongly exercised but on the ground that the Decree under which it purported to be made was invalid. However, all the Members of the Court were of opinion that, if leave to appeal were necessary because otherwise the appeal would not lie by reason of the terms of s. 44, the case was one in which leave to appeal should be granted nunc pro tunc if it were applied for Mr. B\u00e9langer, on being asked by the Court, said that he would have no objection to leave being granted. Mr. Geoffrion applied for leave and leave to appeal nunc pro tunc was granted. Further consideration has brought me to the view that such leave was unnecessary.\nThe second objection raised by the respondent is that this Court has no jurisdiction to grant the stay asked for, that if jurisdiction to grant such a stay exists it is in either the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) or in the Superior Court. In this case an application for a stay was made to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench but that Court in a unanimous judgment ruled that it had no power to grant a stay pending the disposition of the appeal to this Court. The question whether the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was right in so deciding is not before us and I express no opinion in regard to it,\nThe question whether this Court has jurisdiction to grant the stay asked for was fully and ably argued but it becomes unnecessary to express an opinion upon it, because, assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction, it is the view of all the Members of the Court that the stay ought not to be granted.\nThe third ground on which counsel for the respondent objected to the granting of the order was that in all the circumstances of the case the Court ought not to grant a stay. I agree with this submission. It is true that if the appellant\u2019s appeal is successful it will have suffered a financial loss for which, as indicated above, I am assuming that it will have no legal redress; on the other hand, if its appeal should fail the granting of the stay would have brought about the result that it would have obtained an unfair advantage over all of its competitors in the area covered by the Decree who have seen fit to obey the order which the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench now in appeal has held to be valid. Balancing these two possibilities against each other I am of opinion that the stay should be refused.\nThese are my reasons for disposing of the application as was done on December 18, 1967.\nApplication dismissed.\nAttorneys for the applicant: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the Comit\u00e9 Paritaire: Blain, Piche, Bergeron, Godbout & Emery, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the Attorney-General of Quebec: Ahern, B\u00e9langer, de Brabant & Nuss, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the Employees Association: Cutler, Lamer, Bellemare, Robert, Desaulniers, Proulx & Sylvestre, Montreal.\n[1] [1962] S.C.R. 580.\n",

When the British Columbia government expropriated those shares, the appellant commenced litigation in order to obtain a greater compensation. The action was successful and the appellant obtained a higher price for the shares. In computing its income for the years 1962 and 1963, the appellant sought to deduct its outlays for the litigation costs on the ground that they fell within the exception in s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and not within para. (b) thereof. The appellant sought also to deduct from its income for those two years the costs of communications to its shareholders, the purpose of which was to inform them of the expropriation and of ensuing developments occurring form time to time. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment and ruled that the appellant was not entitled to deduct the litigation costs or the costs of communications to the shareholders. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part.\nThe litigation outlays fell within s. 12(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act and were therefore not deductible. The case was governed by the judgment in M.N.R. v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 19, where the proposition was established that legal expense incurred in order to preserve an existing capital asset was a payment on account of capital. In the present case, the action was brought and the legal expenses incurred in order to preserve the appellant\u2019s title to the shares. Such a payment falls within s. 12(1) (b) of the Act. As to the costs of communications to the shareholders, the reasonable furnishing of information from time to time to shareholders by a company respecting its affairs is properly a part of the carrying on of the company\u2019s business of earning income and is an expense properly deductible.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales\u2014Proc\u00e8s attaquant avec succ\u00e8s la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation d\u2019expropriation\u2014D\u00e9pense est-elle d\u00e9ductible\u2014Communications par une compagnie \u00e0 ses actionnaires\u2014Le co\u00fbt est-il une d\u00e9pense d\u00e9ductible\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 12(1) (a), (b).\nL\u2019actif principal de la compagnie appelante se composait de toutes les actions communes \u00e9mises de la British Columbia Electric Company Limited. Lorsque le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a expropri\u00e9 ces actions, l\u2019appelante a commenc\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures devant les tribunaux dans le but d\u2019obtenir une plus grosse indemnit\u00e9. Les proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s et l\u2019appelante a obtenu un plus haut prix pour les actions. En calculant son revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 1962 et 1963, l\u2019appelante a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire les sommes qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9bours\u00e9es en frais de proc\u00e8s pour le motif que ces sommes tombaient dans l\u2019exception de l\u2019art. 12(1) (a) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, et non pas sous le para.

Le contribuable en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu en partie.\nLes sommes d\u00e9bours\u00e9es en frais de proc\u00e8s tombaient sous l\u2019art. 12(1) (b) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et en cons\u00e9quence n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9ductibles.

Appel maintenu en partie. APPEAL from a judgment of Sheppard, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, upholding the Minister\u2019s assessment. Appeal allowed in part.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., H.H. Stikeman, Q.C., and D.M.M. Goldie, for the appellant.\nP.M. Thorsteinsson and D.G.H. Bowman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court[2] which decided that the appellant was not entitled, in computing, for the purposes of tax, its income for the years 1962 and 1963, to deduct certain litigation costs, or to deduct certain expenses incurred for communications to its shareholders. The amounts involved for litigation costs were $742,623.89 in the year 1962 and $414,199.81 in 1963. The expense for communications to shareholders was $6,020.31 in 1962 and $3,126.27 in 1963.\nThe appellant was incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada on May 19, 1928, and was empowered to own, control and manage companies and enterprises in the public utility field. It owned all of the issued common shares of British Columbia Electric Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Electric Company\u201d, a public utility company incorporated under the Companies Act of British Columbia in 1926. The income of the appellant was mainly derived from dividends paid to it by the Electric Company.\nWith effect on August 1, 1961, the British Columbia Legislature enacted the Power Development Act, 1961. This statute, inter alia, provided that:\n1. Each share, issued or unissued, of the capital stock of the Electric Company vested in Her Majesty the Queen, in right of the Province.\n2. The term of office of each director of the Electric Company holding office when the Act came into force was terminated.\n3. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council should appoint the directors of the Electric Company. 4. Holders of common shares of the Electric Company at the time the Act came into force were to receive as compensation for their shares $110,985,045.\n5. Upon the request of the appellant, the Electric Company would purchase all the undertaking and property of the appellant at a price equivalent to $38.00 for each issued share of the appellant\u2019s capital stock less the amount paid for the Electric Company shares, referred to in paragraph 4 above. This worked out at approximately $68,500,000 for assets worth about $11,000,000.\nDirectors of the Electric Company were subsequently appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, who took possession of the undertaking and who paid to the appellant the sum of $110,985,045.\nOn September 21, 1961, the appellant submitted for fiat a petition of right asking that full and complete compensation for the Electric Company shares be determined by the Court. This was refused by the Provincial Secretary.\nOn November 13, 1961, the appellant commenced an action against the Attorney-General of British Columbia, the Electric Company and others, and asked for a declaration that the Act was ultra vires of the British Columbia Legislature.\nIn December 1961, the appellant reduced its capital and paid to its shareholders $18.70 per share, in a total amount of $89,236,605.70.\nOn March 29, 1962, two further Acts were passed. The Power Development Act, 1961, Amendment Act, 1962, increased the compensation for the Electric Company shares to $171,833,052. It vacated the appellant\u2019s option for the sale of its undertaking and property. The sum of $60,848,007 was thereafter paid to the appellant.\nThe British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority Act amalgamated the Electric Company and the British Columbia Power Commission under the name of British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.\nThe appellant amended its pleadings to allege the invalidity of these two statutes.\nThe trial of the action commenced on May 1, 1962, and was completed on February 25, 1963. Chief Justice Lett delivered judgment on July 29, 1963, holding that all three statutes were ultra vires of the British Columbia Legislature. A considerable part of the 144 day trial was occupied with evidence as to the value of the Electric Company \u2018 shares, and a value was determined in the judgment of $192,828,125.\nOn the day the judgment was delivered, the appellant informed the Premier of British Columbia, by telegram, that its principal concern was to obtain fair compensation. He replied on August 1, 1963, accepting the amount found due by the Chief Justice. By agreement a reference was made to the Chief Justice to determine what amount should be paid to the appellant for its shares in the Electric Company. He fixed a figure of $197,114,358 and the appellant, on September 27, 1963, sold those shares to Her Majesty in right of the Province of British Columbia, for that amount, crediting the two payments of $110,985,045 and $60,848,007 already received.\nOn November 1, 1963, the shareholders of the appellant resolved to wind up the company, and on November 6, 1963, an order was made appointing a liquidator.\nThe first issue on this appeal is as to whether the appellant, in the determination of its income tax, is legally entitled to deduct its outlays for the litigation costs. Its right to do so depends upon whether it can establish that such outlays fall within the exception to para. (a) and do not fall within para. (b) of s. 12(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, which provide:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a property or business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part.\nI have reached the conclusion that the outlays in question do fall within s. 12(1) (b) and for that reason are not deductible. This makes it unnecessary to determine whether or not, apart from s. 12(1)(b), they fall within the exception to s. 12(1) (a).\nIn my opinion this case is governed by the judgment of this Court in The Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited[3]. The question in that case was as to whether Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited could properly deduct from \u2018its income legal expenses incurred by it for litigation, concerning its franchise rights in the City of Hamilton. The case ultimately reached the Privy Council: United Gas and Fuel Company of Hamilton, Limited v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited[4]. In brief, in 1904, Dominion had been granted a franchise by the Township of Barton enabling it to lay its pipe lines and distribute gas in the township. In the same year, United Company had been granted a franchise from the City of Hamilton. Later, portions of the township became annexed to the City of Hamilton. The United Company, which in 1931 had been granted an exclusive franchise in the city, sued Dominion for a declaration that Dominion was wrongfully maintaining its mains in the streets of the city, an injunction to restrain such use of the streets and the distribution of gas in Hamilton, and a mandatory injunction to compel the removal of its mains from such streets.\nThe position in which Dominion was then placed was that it faced a challenge to its legal right to continue the use of its mains and to distribute gas in the Hamilton area. It defended the action successfully, and incurred legal expense in so doing.\nIt was held in this Court that those expenses were not deductible for income tax purposes. Chief Justice Duff and Davis J. held that they did not fall within the category of \u201cdisbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\u201d within s. 6(a) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c 97, as they were not working expenses incurred in the process of earning \u201cthe income\u201d. They also held that the expense was a capital expense, incurred \u201conce and for all\u201d and for the purpose of procuring \u201cthe advantage of an enduring benefit\u201d within the sense of the language of Lord Cave in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherton[5]. That well known statement is as follows:\nBut when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital. Kerwin J. (as he then was) and Hudson J., at p. 31, held that the legal costs were a \u201cpayment on account of capital\u201d (quoting the words of s. 6(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act) because \u201cit was made (to use Viscount Cave\u2019s words) with a view of preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade\u201d.\nCrockett J. held that the expenses were excluded under s.6(1) (a).\nReferring to this case, in his judgment in The Minister of National Revenue v. The Kellogg Company of Canada Limited[6], Chief Justice Duff, at p. 60, said:\nIt was held by this Court that the payment of these costs was not an expenditure \u201claid out as part of the process of profit earning\u201d but was an expenditure made \u201cwith a view of preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the trade\u201d and, therefore, capital expenditure.\nIn the Kellogg case the taxpayer was held entitled to deduct the legal expenses there involved, which had been incurred in defending a suit brought for alleged infringement of a registered trade mark. Chief Justice Duff, at p. 60, in distinguishing that case from the Dominion case, said:\nThe right upon which the respondent relied was not a right of property, or an exclusive right of any description, but the right (in common with all other members of the public) to describe their goods in the manner in which they were describing them.\nThe Dominion case was distinguished in The Minister of National Revenue v. Goldsmith Bros. Smelting & Refining Company Limited[7], in which the taxpayer was held to be entitled to deduct the legal expense involved in defending successfully a charge of participating in an illegal combine, on the basis that the Dominion case was concerned with money paid to preserve a capital asset.\nThe facts in Evans v. The Minister of National Revenue[8] were distinguished from those in the Dominion case because the issue in relation to which legal expense had been incurred did not relate to an item of fixed capital, but to a right to receive income. In Premium Iron Ores Ltd, v. The Minister of National Revenue[i][9], the legal expenses had been incurred in resisting the claim of a foreign government to collect income tax. The preservation of a capital asset was not in issue.\nThe authority of the Dominion case is not weakened by subsequent alterations in the statute, in so far as it deals with the question as to what constitutes a payment on account of capital. The definition of what constitutes an allowable deduction under s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act is broader in its terms than that contained in s. 6(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, as was pointed out by Abbott J. in British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue[10]. However, there is no material difference between s. 12(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act and s. 6(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act dealing with payments on account of capital.\nThe appellant\u2019s submission was that the purpose of the action in which its costs were incurred was to test the validity of provincial legislation which, if valid, would have had the effect of divesting the appellant of its shares in the Electric Company. The action was not for the purpose of bringing into existence an asset or advantage of enduring benefit to the appellant or for the purpose of recovering a capital asset.\nReliance was placed on the decision of Lawrence J. in Southern v. Borax Consolidated, Limited[11]. In that case the taxpayer had incurred legal expense in resisting an action brought by the City of Los Angeles claiming the invalidity of its title to land in California on which its subsidiary had erected wharves and buildings. It claimed the right to deduct these expenses in computing its income tax, the issue being as to whether they were wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade, within the provisions of the English Act.\nLawrence J., holding that these expenses were properly deductible, said at p. 120:\nIt appears to me that the legal expenses which were incurred by the respondent company did not create any new asset at all, but were expenses which were incurred in the ordinary course of maintaining the assets of the company and the fact that it was maintaining the title and not the value of the company\u2019s business does not, in my opinion, make it any (different.\nAt p. 117 he had said:\nThe title of the company, which must be assumed, in my opinion, to have been a good title, remains the same; there is nothing added to the title or taken away, and the title has simply been maintained by this payment.\nThis decision was cited with approval by Lord Greene M.R., in Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[12], where he said:\nThe money that you spend in defending your title to a capital asset, which is assailed unjustly, is obviously a revenue expenditure.\nIt may be noted, however, that this was not the issue actually before the Court in that case. What was actually decided was that payments made to two retiring directors, in order to prevent competition with the company\u2019s business, were in the nature of capital expenditure and not deductible.\nFavourable reference was also made to the case of Southern v. Borax in some of the judgments in the House of Lords in Morgan v. Tate & Lyle Ltd.[13], in which the taxpayer was permitted to deduct from income the cost of a campaign to oppose the threatened nationalization of the sugar industry.\nIn that case the question of whether the expenses were of a capital nature was not raised, and so the only issue was as to whether, under rule 3(a), the expenses represented money \u201cwholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade\u201d.\nThis case may be contrasted with the earlier decision of the Privy Council in Ward & Company, Limited v. Commissioner of Taxes[14], which decided that expenses incurred by a New Zealand brewery in distributing antiprohibition literature prior to a poll of the electors upon the possible introduction of legislation prohibiting intoxicants, was not a deductible expense for income tax purposes. The relevant statutory provision in that case precluded deduction of expenditure \u201cnot exclusively incurred in the production of the assessable income\u201d.\nThe Ward case was distinguished in Morgan v. Tate & Lyle Ltd., as it was by Kerwin J. in the Dominion case because of the difference in wording between the New Zealand statute and the relevant provisions under consideration in each of those cases.\nThe reasoning in Southern v. Borax was critically analysed by Dixon J. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons in Hallstroms Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[15], when he said:\nUpon the facts as they appear from the case stated set out in the report (1941) 1 K.B., at pp. 111-114; 23 Tax Cas., at pp. 597-599, I do not think that this decision can be supported. The costs were incurred in order to retain a capital asset of the company employed in the business as fixed capital and to avoid the payment, in consequence of its loss, of a charge upon revenue of indefinite duration. Next to the outlay of purchase money and conveyancing expenses in acquiring the title to the land, it would be hard to find a form of expenditure in relation to property more characteristically of a capital nature.\nThe basis of the decision of Lawrence J. may be seen from two passages in his judgment. In the first, his Lordship said: \u201cIn my opinion the principle which is to be deduced from the cases is that where a sum of money is laid out for the acquisition or the improvement of a fixed capital asset it is attributable to capital, but that if no alteration is made in the fixed capital asset by the payment, then it is properly attributable to revenue, being in substance a matter of maintenance, the maintenance of the capital structure or the capital assets of the company\u201d, (1941) 1 K.B., at pp. 116, 117; 23 Tax Cas., at p. 602. The first or positive statement contained in this passage is open to no substantial objection, but the second, the converse and negative proposition that if no alteration is made in the capital asset by the payment it is a revenue expenditure, appears to me to have no foundation in principle or authority. No alteration in a fixed capital asset was effected by the outlay that was in question in what has become the leading case upon the subject (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherton, (1926) A.C. 205; 10 Tax Cas. 155) and there was none, to take one or two examples only, in English Crown Spelter Co. Ltd. v. Baker, (1908) 5 Tax Cas. 327; 99 L.T. 353; in Countess Warwick Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Ogg, (1924) 2 K.B. 292; 8 Tax Cas. 652; in Collins v. Joseph Adamson & Co., (1938) 1 K.B. 477 (at all events as to one of the two payments) and in Henderson v. MeadeKing Robinson & Co. Ltd., (1938) 22 Tax Cas. 97, at p. 105. The New Zealand decision in Commissioner of Taxes v. Bollinger & Co. Ltd., (1903) 23 N.Z.L.R. 188 seems much in point and is quite opposed to the view of Lawrence J.\nThe second passage in the judgment of Lawrence J. reads thus: \u201cIt appears to me that the legal expenses which were incurred by the respondent company did not create any new asset at all, but were expenses which were incurred in the ordinary course of maintaining the assets of the company and the fact that it was maintaining the title and not the value of the company\u2019s business does not, in my opinion, make it any different. (1941) 1 K.B., at p. 120; 23 Tax Cas., at p. 605).\u201d\nIt is possible to find in this statement two reasons not necessarily interdependent. One is the lack of any fresh acquisition of assets. That, in my view, does no more than put aside one possible state of facts in which the payment would have certainly been of a capital nature. The other is that the defence of the title against impeachment amounted to maintenance, the costs forming part of the business expenditure in the ordinary course upon maintaining the company\u2019s assets. An analogy which suggests itself is the cost of restoring the front door of the business premises after an attempted entrance by bandits. No ground was disclosed in the case stated, as set out in the reports, and none exists in the known customs or propensities of Californian city authorities, for supposing that the company was exposed to regular or recurrent attacks upon the validity of its title. His Lordship probably did not doubt that the purpose of the litigation was to decide once and for all whether the taxpayer had or had not a valid title; but, as appears from the first of the foregoing passages cited from his judgment, his Lordship regarded outlays making no alteration in a fixed capital asset as amounting in substance to a matter of maintenance. I should have thought that the decided cases illustrated the fact that these are not exhaustive alternatives. A decision of the Canadian Supreme Court that is entirely at variance with the view of Lawrence J. is the Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. (1941) S.C.R. (Can.) 19.\nThis view of Southern v. Borax was affirmed by the High Court of Australia in Broken Hill Theatres Proprietary Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[16], where it is stated at p. 434:\nWe would add that we all think, as Dixon J. thought in Hallstroms\u2019 case, that, on the facts as stated, the decision of Lawrence J. in Southern v. Borax Consolidated cannot be supported.\nIt must be borne in mind that the only issue which had to be determined in Southern v. Borax was whether the expense there involved was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade, under the relevant English statutory provision somewhat equivalent to, but not identical with, our s. 12(1)(a). The existence in our Act of both paras. (a) and (b) of s. 12 shows that Parliament contemplated that there might be expenses made for the purpose of gaining or producing income, which were of a capital nature, and which, under para. (a) taken alone, might be deducted, but, by virtue of para. (b), notwithstanding the fact that they so qualified under para. (a), could not be deducted. There was no equivalent to para. (b) under consideration in that case. To the extent that Southern v. Borax is authority for the proposition that a legal expense which is incurred to protect from attack a taxpayer\u2019s title to a capital asset is not a capital but a revenue expenditure, it cannot be reconciled with the decision of this Court in the Dominion case. Dominion\u2019s gas franchise was a capital asset. The attempt by United to establish that such franchise was non-existent within the boundaries of the City of Hamilton was an attack upon its title to that asset. The attack was found to be unwarranted and Dominion\u2019s franchise remained a valid franchise as it had always been. Nothing was added to or taken away from it as a result of the proceedings. But the proposition established by this Court was that legal expense incurred in order to preserve an existing capital asset was a payment on account of capital. A payment of that kind falls within s. 12(1) (b).\nIn the present case, the appellant was faced with legislation the effect of which was to vest title to the shares which it had owned, in the Crown, at a price fixed by the statute. These shares constituted the appellant\u2019s principal capital asset. In the opinion of the appellant the compensation fixed was not adequate. In order to obtain what it considered to be a fair compensation (which the learned trial judge has found, on ample evidence, to have been the appellant\u2019s primary purpose) it was necessary to seek to set the legislation aside. The action was brought and the legal expenses incurred in order to preserve the appellant\u2019s title to the shares. Thereafter, the appellant was able to dispose of the shares to the Crown at a more favourable price. In essence, the main purpose and the result of the litigation was to improve the consideration received for the disposition of a capital asset.\nIn my opinion the principle established in the Dominion case must apply to the facts in the present case, and, consequently, the appeal on this point fails.\nThe second, and relatively minor item relates to the claim for deduction of the cost of communications to shareholders. The purpose of these letters was to inform shareholders, first, as to the situation which faced the appellant when the legislation was passed, and, later, as to developments which had occurred from time to time. The learned trial judge refused to allow a deduction in respect of these expenses, holding that they related to capital and not to earning income within s. 12(1) (a).\nWith respect, I am of the opinion that these expenses should be viewed differently from the legal expenses previously discussed. Those expenses represented payments to preserve a capital asset. The expenses now under discussion did not, and I do not regard them as falling within s. 12(1) (b). Are they properly deductible under s. 12(1) (a)?\nThe ultimate control in law of a limited company rests with its shareholders and it is they who have the legal power to determine its policy. This power cannot be properly exercised unless the shareholders are informed periodically with respect to the company\u2019s affairs. A public company incorporated under the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 53, is required, by s. 121, to furnish its shareholders with copies of its balance sheet, statement of income and expenditure and statement of surplus prior to its annual meeting.\nIn my opinion, the reasonable furnishing of information from time to time to shareholders by a company respecting its affairs is properly a part of the carrying on of the company\u2019s business of earning income and a corporate taxpayer should be entitled to deduct the reasonable expense involved as an expense of doing business.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this expense was properly deductible.\nThe appellant also urged that the judgment of the learned trial judge, which awarded to the respondent two-thirds of his taxed costs against the appellant and to the appellant one-third of its taxed costs against the respondent, should be varied by awarding to the appellant all its costs and by depriving the respondent of any costs. It was submitted that, as the appellant had succeeded in part at the trial, thus justifying its resort to the Court for relief, it should be entitled to all its costs.\nIn my opinion the matter of costs was at the discretion of the learned trial judge and the appellant has failed to establish that the discretion was not properly exercised according to law.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal in part and refer the assessment in question back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment in accordance with the reasons for judgment herein. As the appellant has failed in respect of the major part of its appeal, I would award costs of the appeal to this Court to the respondent.\nAppeal allowed in part; costs to the respondent.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell & Dumoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The applicant inscribed an appeal to this Court from that judgment and, after having unsuccessfully applied to the Court of Appeal for a stay of the injunction, applied to this Court for an order staying the execution of and suspending the injunction until after judgment has been given by this Court on the merits of the appeal.\nHeld (Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The application for a stay of the injunction should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The material filed was not adequate to support an application of this kind for what is an unusual form of relief. This Court is being asked to suspend the operation of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered after full consideration of the merits. It is not sufficient to justify such an order being made to urge that the impact of the injunction upon the applicant would be greater than the impact of its suspension upon the respondent. The applicant elected to carry on a business on the assumption that the patent was invalid. The Court of Appeal held that this assumption was wrong. The applicant, in such circumstances, is not in a position to complain if it has to comply with that judgment until it has been reversed on appeal.\nPer Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: Equity calls for the suspension of the injunction. If the injunction remains in operation and the appeal succeeds, the applicant will, in the interval, suffer an important prejudice for which it shall never be indemnified. On the contrary, if the injunction is suspended and the appeal fails, the respondent will be entitled to an indemnity. The loss of the monopoly is not in question because other manufacturers can obtain the right to use the patent. In view of the judgment of the trial Court in its favour, the applicant was not required to establish that, prima facie, the appeal was well-founded.\nInjonction\u2014Suspension durant l\u2019appel\u2014Doit-elle \u00eatre accord\u00e9e\u2014De quel c\u00f4t\u00e9 est le plus grand pr\u00e9judice\u2014Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Question de juridiction soulev\u00e9e mais non d\u00e9cid\u00e9e. Dans une action concernant la violation d\u2019un brevet devant expirer le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1968, la Cour d\u2019appel a infirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le brevet \u00e9tait invalide et elle a accord\u00e9 une injonction d\u00e9fendant \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante de fabriquer, importer, produire, acheter, livrer, vendre ou offrir en vente une substance dite chloramphenicol pendant la dur\u00e9e de ce brevet.

Application dismissed, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nL.Y. Fortier, for the applicant.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by MARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an application by the appellant for an order staying the execution of and suspending an injunction granted by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec[2], dated September 25, 1967. It was heard on November 27, 1967, and was dismissed on December 18, 1967, it being then stated that reasons for judgment would be delivered later.\nThis litigation involves a patent no. 479,333 granted to the respondent, bearing date December 11, 1951, relating to \u201ca new chemical compound \u2026 called Chloramphenicol.\u201d The respondent sued the appellant for infringement of this patent, claiming a permanent injunction and damages. The defence was that the patent was invalid, and consequently could not be infringed.\nAt trial, the action was dismissed, the learned trial judge holding that the patent was invalid. This judgment was reversed, on appeal. A permanent injunction order was granted on September 25, 1967, restraining the appellant from manufacturing, importing, producing, buying, delivering, selling or offering for sale Chloramphenicol for the duration of the respondent\u2019s patent. The respondent\u2019s right to claim damages up to the amount of $10,000, with interest, was reserved.\nFrom this judgment an appeal has been launched to this Court.\nOn October 27, 1967, the Court of Appeal rejected an application by the appellant to suspend the injunction until after judgment has been given by this Court on the appeal, holding that it was without jurisdiction in the proceedings after its final judgment had been rendered[3].\nThis decision has not been appealed to this Court.\nThe question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain a motion made to it directly to suspend the operation of the injunction was argued before us, but, as I have reached the conclusion that, if jurisdiction does exist, the appellant\u2019s application should be dismissed, I do not find it necessary to state any opinion on the jurisdictional issue.\nOn the merits, the appellant\u2019s application was supported by an affidavit of the appellant\u2019s attorney, on information and belief, the relevant part of which reads:\nI am informed by Messrs. G\u00e9rard Dufault and Claude Lafontaine, officers of Appellant company and I do believe that the maintaining in force of this injunction pending judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada on the merits of the appeal will cause Appellant, Laboratoire Pentagone Lt\u00e9e, irreparable harm and injury which even a favourable judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada could never remedy.\nIn addition to this there was filed, as a part of the material before us, the petition made to the Court of Appeal for the suspension of the injunction, supported by the affidavit of G\u00e9rard Dufault, president of the appellant, stating that the facts alleged in the petition were true. One of the allegations in the petition was that the appellant is a relatively small pharmaceutical company for which Chloramphenicol represented in excess of 50 per cent of its annual volume of sales of pharmaceutical products. It also alleged that the appellant had an inventory of the product Chloramphenicol of about $20,000 which the injunction precluded it from selling, which was of a perishable nature, and the bulk of which could not be returned to the vendor thereof without considerable loss.\nI do not think that this material is adequate to support an application of this kind for what is an unusual form of relief. The burden upon the appellant is much greater than it would be if the injunction were interlocutory. In such a case the Court must consider the balance of convenience as between the parties, because the matter has not yet come to trial. In the present case we are being asked to suspend the operation of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered after full consideration of the merits. It is not sufficient to justify such an order being made to urge that the impact of the injunction upon the appellant would be greater than the impact of its suspension upon the respondent.\nEven on the matter of balance of convenience I note that Puddicombe J., when dealing with an application by the respondent for an interlocutory injunction, had this to say:\nAs to the latter, I must admit, taken by itself, to grave doubts respecting the efficacy of a plea of greater inconvenience made by one who knows or has had every opportunity of knowing, before engaging in an undertaking, of the existence of a patent which, if valid, and enforced, can destroy the commerce of such a one. Such a position is at the least, incongruous.\nWith this view I agree. The appellant elected to carry on a business on the assumption that the patent duly issued to the respondent was invalid. The Court of Appeal has held that this assumption was wrong. The appellant, in such circumstances, is not in a position to complain if it has to comply with that judgment until it has been reversed on appeal.\nThe patent which is in issue will expire on December 10, 1968. All that the respondent succeeded in obtaining, by virtue of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in its favour, was an injunction restraining the use of its patented product from September 25, 1967, to December 10, 1968. A suspension of that injunction until a decision of this Court on the appeal would further reduce that limited period.\nThe appellant will not be affected in its operations by the respondent\u2019s patent after December 10, 1968. In the meantime, it was properly conceded by the respondent\u2019s counsel that the appellant is not precluded by the injunction from dealing in Chloramphenicol purchased from any person or corporation holding from the respondent a licence to manufacture or sell the same. The appellant\u2019s petition to the Court of Appeal stated that approximately one-third of its sales of Chloramphenicol were represented by purchases from a company which obtained its supplies from a manufacturer, manufacturing under a compulsory licence under the respondent\u2019s patent granted by the Commissioner of Patents.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that this application should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident):\u2014A la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Cour du banc de la reine de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec[4] si\u00e9geant en appel a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 contre la requ\u00e9rante, le 25 septembre 1967, par jugement sur le fond infirmant celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, une injonction d\u00e9fendant \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante de fabriquer, importer, produire, acheter, livrer, vendre ou offrir en vente la substance dite chloramph\u00e9nicol vis\u00e9e par le brevet canadien num\u00e9ro 479,333 pendant la dur\u00e9e de ce brevet.\nLa requ\u00e9rante, qui avait contest\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure la validit\u00e9 du brevet, a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 cette Cour. Elle a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel par requ\u00eate la suspension de l\u2019injonction jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 du jugement sur son pourvoi dans cette Cour. Le 27 octobre, cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le motif suivant[5].\nLe Juge en chef Tremblay:\nQuand notre Cour a rendu son jugement final dans un appel, il me para\u00eet clair qu\u2019elle en est dessaisie et qu\u2019elle ne peut s\u2019en ressaisir que dans les cas pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la loi. Cela est encore plus \u00e9vident quand le litige est pendant devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\nOr, l\u2019article 760 C.p., plac\u00e9 dans son contexte, r\u00e9f\u00e8re manifestement \u00e0 un jugement final de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure port\u00e9 en appel devant notre Cour et non pas \u00e0 un jugement final de notre Cour port\u00e9 en appel devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Autrement, la L\u00e9gislature provinciale aurait pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre devant un tribunal qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada comme le reconna\u00eet l\u2019article 24 C.p.:\n\u00abLes tribunaux qui rel\u00e8vent du Parlement du Canada et ont juridiction en mati\u00e8re civile dans la province sont la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et la Cour d\u2019\u00e9chiquier du Canada.\nLa comp\u00e9tence de ces tribunaux et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit y \u00eatre suivie sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par les lois du Parlement du Canada.\u00bb\nCe jugement n\u2019\u00e9tant pas frapp\u00e9 d\u2019appel, je m\u2019abstiens d\u2019examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 de ce motif pour consid\u00e9rer d\u2019abord le fond de la requ\u00eate.\nL\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 me para\u00eet r\u00e9clamer la suspension de l\u2019injonction. En effet, si elle reste en vigueur, la requ\u00e9rante au cas o\u00f9 son appel serait jug\u00e9 bien fond\u00e9 subira dans l\u2019intervalle un important pr\u00e9judice dont elle n\u2019aura jamais droit d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e. Au contraire, si l\u2019injonction est suspendue, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, advenant le rejet de l\u2019appel, aura droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que cette indemnit\u00e9 ne la compensera pas int\u00e9gralement parce qu\u2019elle aura \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e du monopole que le brevet est destin\u00e9 \u00e0 lui assurer. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, cet argument ne saurait \u00eatre retenu parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un brevet que d\u2019autres manufacturiers peuvent obtenir le droit d\u2019utiliser \u00e0 des conditions fix\u00e9es par le Commissaire des brevets. De fait, il appert qu\u2019un permis a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi obtenu par un autre manufacturier de telle sorte que l\u2019injonction, dans les termes o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cern\u00e9e, interdit \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est oblig\u00e9e d\u2019admettre qu\u2019elle a le droit de faire, savoir: acheter et revendre le produit fabriqu\u00e9 par cet autre manufacturier. Devant nous, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019injonction devait s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas la rendre applicable en pareil cas. Tout en prenant acte de cette attitude pour l\u2019avenir, il me faut dire que cette pr\u00e9tention para\u00eet contestable. N\u2019est-elle pas contraire au principe d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel une injonction doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e comme elle est \u00e9crite puisque l\u2019on ne saurait se d\u00e9fendre d\u2019y avoir contrevenu en plaidant qu\u2019elle est mal fond\u00e9e?\nIl me faut ajouter que le droit reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, lors de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, d\u2019acheter et revendre le produit fabriqu\u00e9 par un tiers, ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre la difficult\u00e9 car ce tiers ne fournit le produit que sous l\u2019une de ses trois formes de telle sorte que l\u2019injonction continue d\u2019avoir des cons\u00e9quences graves pour l\u2019appelante dont elle paralyse une forte partie des op\u00e9rations.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a ensuite soutenu que, pour obtenir la suspension de l\u2019ordonnance, la requ\u00e9rante devait d\u00e9montrer que prima facie l\u2019appel \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9. Il est possible que dans certains cas l\u2019on soit oblig\u00e9 d\u2019examiner le fond du litige \u00e0 cette fin. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, cela ne para\u00eet aucunement n\u00e9cessaire. Il suffit de constater que non seulement le brevet a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 invalide par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, mais que pr\u00e9alablement la Cour d\u2019appel avait confirm\u00e9 le refus d\u2019injonction interlocutoire qui avait suivi la rescision de l\u2019int\u00e9rimaire.\nEnfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a ni\u00e9 que cette Cour ait le pouvoir d\u2019accorder la suspension sollicit\u00e9e. Il est s\u00fbr que nous pourrions, en vertu de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, accorder l\u2019autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel du. jugement qui l\u2019a refus\u00e9e et l\u2019accorder ensuite sur un appel ainsi autoris\u00e9, si nous en venions \u00e0 la conclusion que la Cour d\u2019appel a le pouvoir de le faire comme un juge de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario semble l\u2019avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans des causes qui ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de cette Cour sur le fond. K.V.P. Co. c. McKie et al.[6] Mais faut-il dire que notre juridiction ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e que de cette fa\u00e7on? Ce n\u2019est pas ainsi que le Conseil priv\u00e9 a statu\u00e9 sur une requ\u00eate pour sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution dans une affaire venant de la Haute Cour du Bengal o\u00f9 il avait accord\u00e9 une permission sp\u00e9ciale d\u2019appeler. Srimati Nityamoni Dasi c. Madhu Sudan Sen[7]. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 une certaine jurisprudence voudrait qu\u2019il appartienne \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019accorder la suspension de l\u2019injonction. Baldwin c. O\u2019Brien[8].\nVu que la majorit\u00e9 est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une instance o\u00f9 il y ait lieu d\u2019accorder la suspension de l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019injonction, il ne me para\u00eet pas \u00e0 propos d\u2019\u00e9tudier cette \u00e9pineuse question de comp\u00e9tence. Je me borne donc \u00e0 dire que, prenant pour acquis sans l\u2019affirmer, que cette Cour ait le pouvoir de le faire, j\u2019accorderais la suspension de l\u2019injonction d\u00e9cern\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec en date du 27 octobre 1967 et ce, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition, aux conditions dont les parties pourraient convenir par \u00e9crit remis au Registraire dans les huit jours ou, \u00e0 leur d\u00e9faut de ce faire, aux conditions qui seraient fix\u00e9es par un juge de cette Cour, le tout d\u00e9pens r\u00e9serv\u00e9s.\nApplication dismissed, HALL SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the applicant: Gate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous and Hansard, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the respondent: Greenblatt, Godinsky and Resin, Montreal.\n[1] [1967] Que.

On application for an order interpreting the said mortgage and declaring that no interest was chargeable thereunder, the appellants contended (1) that the payments of interest and principal as stated in the repayment clause were \u201cblended payments\u201d within the meaning of s.6 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156; (2) that being blended payments the mortgage did not contain a statement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of said s. 6 showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance; (3) that in consequence no interest whatever was payable under the said mortgage.\nThe trial judge dismissed the appellants\u2019 application, holding that the payments to be made under the mortgage were not blended. On appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and the appellants then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe quarterly payments required to be made by the mortgagor were not blended payments of principal money and interest within the meaning of the word \u201cblended\u201d as used in s. 6 of the Interest Act. The purpose of this section is to protect a mortgagor from having concealed from him the true rate of interest which he is paying. In the case at bar there was no concealment. The amount of principal and the interest were clearly stated. On each quarterly payment date the mortgagor was required to pay interest at 6\u00bd per cent on the principal outstanding and to pay on account of principal the difference between the amount of such payment and the sum of $7,002. It was impossible to say that this brought about the result that the payments of principal and interest were \u201cblended\u201d, that is to say, \u201cmixed so as to be inseparable and indistinguishable\u201d. APPEAL from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from an order of Brooke J. Appeal dismissed.\nClaude R. Thomson, for the appellants.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation to be placed on the repayment clause in a mortgage granted by the appellants to the respondents on March 12, 1965, covering an hotel property in Toronto for the principal sum of $315,000. The repayment clause in the mortgage reads as follows:\nPROVIDED THIS MORTGAGE TO BE VOID on payment of THREE HUNDRED & FIFTEEN THOUSAND ($315,000.00) Dollars of lawful money of Canada with interest at six & one-half (6\u00bd %) per centum per annum calculated quarter-yearly, not in advance, as well after as before maturity and both before and after default, as follows:\u2014\nThe sum of THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($315,000.00) with interest thereon at the aforesaid rate computed from the 23rd day of March 1965, shall become due and be paid in instalments of $7,002.00 each, on the 23rd day of March, June, September and December in each and every year from and including the 23rd day of June 1965 to and including the 23rd day of December 1984, (such instalments to be applied FIRST in payment of the interest due from time to time, calculated at the said rate of 6\u00bd % per centum per annum, and the BALANCE to be applied in reduction of the principal sum) and the BALANCE of the said principal sum of THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS with interest thereon as aforesaid shall become due and payable on the 23rd day of March 1985.\nThe appellants contend: (1) that the payments of interest and principal as stated in this clause are \u201cblended payments\u201d within the meaning of s. 6 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156; (2) that being blended payments the mortgage does not contain a statement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of said s. 6 showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance; (3) that in consequence no interest whatever is payable under the said mortgage.\nSection 6 of the Interest Act reads:\nWhenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan that involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThe learned trial judge, Brooke J., dismissed the appellants\u2019 application for a declaration that no interest was payable, holding that the payments to be made under the mortgage in question were not blended payments. He did not deal with appellants\u2019 contention #2 above. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, after hearing argument on the blended payment issue only, dismissed the appeal without giving reasons.\nI would dismiss the appeal on the ground that the quarterly payments required to be made by the mortgagor are not blended payments of principal money and interest within the meaning of the word \u201cblended\u201d as used in s. 6 of the Interest Act. Section 2 of that Act reads as follows:\n2. Except as otherwise provided by this or by any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, any person may stipulate for, allow and exact, on any contract or agreement whatsoever, any rate of interest or discount that is agreed upon.\nThe rate of interest agreed upon as set out in the mortgage in this case is 6\u00bd per cent payable quarterly.\nThe purpose of s. 6 of the Interest Act is to protect a mortgagor from having concealed from him the true rate of interest which he is paying.\nIn the case at bar there is no concealment. The amount of principal and the rate of interest are clearly stated. On each quarterly payment date the mortgagor is required to pay interest at 6\u00bd per cent on the principal outstanding and to pay on account of principal the difference between the amount of such interest payment and the sum of $7,002. This is the plain effect of the repayment clause; it appears to me impossible to say that this brings about the result that the payments of principal and interest are \u201cblended\u201d, that is to say, \u201cmixed so as to be inseparable arid indistinguishable\u201d. They are distinguished by the very wording of the clause:\nSuch instalments to be applied first to payment of the interest due from time to time calculated at the said rate of 6\u00bd per centum per annum and the balance to be applied in reduction of the principal sum. The arithmetical calculation involved on each payment date could scarcely be simpler.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the Courts below correctly held that this is not a case in which the mortgage provides for blended payments of principal and interest within the meaning of s. 6 of the Interest Act, I find it unnecessary to consider the question whether had the mortgage provided for blended payments it contained a statement sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s. 6, that is to say, showing the amount of principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Claude R. Thomson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Starr, Allen & Weekes, Toronto.\n",

Greening Metal Products and Screening Equipment Co. et al., [1968] S.C.R. 30\nDate: 1967-11-27\nDirk Hoogendoorn (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nGreening Metal Products and Screening Equipment Company and The United Steelworkers of America, Local 6266 (Defendants) Respondents.\n1967: June 2; 1967: November 27.\nPresent: Cartwright, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLabour relations\u2014Collective agreement providing for compulsory deduction of union dues\u2014Refusal by appellant to sign deduction authorization\u2014\u201dWildcat\u201d strike arising out of objection of other employees to appellant\u2019s continued employment\u2014Matter submitted by company and union to arbitration\u2014Application to quash award\u2014Whether appellant entitled to be represented at arbitration hearing in his own right.\nA collective agreement between the respondent company and the respondent union provided for the compulsory deduction of union dues. The appellant H was discharged for refusing to execute an authorization for deduction of such dues. He was later reinstated because the company accepted representations made by his solicitors that the article relating to deduction of dues could only have application to new employees and not to those in the employment of the company at the time of the execution of the agreement. The agreement was subsequently amended so as to make the said article applicable to all present and future employees.\nH persisted in his refusal to sign authorization after the collective agreement was amended and there followed a \u201cwildcat\u201d strike, which arose out of the objection of the other employees of the company to H\u2019s continued employment. To break this impasse, the company and the union agreed to submit the matter to arbitration. The arbitrator concluded that the company was in violation of the collective agree- ment and directed it to notify H to deliver an authorization for deduction of his union dues, and if he did not comply, then the company was to exercise its powers to dismiss him.\nH was not notified of, nor present, nor represented directly at the hearing. He moved in the Supreme Court of Ontario to quash the award. His motion was dismissed. He appealed to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal. This appeal failed. The only modification made by the Court of Appeal was to direct the deletion of that part of the arbitrator\u2019s award which directed the company to discharge H if he failed to comply with the request for an authorization. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ.: On the facts it was obvious that the arbitration proceeding was aimed entirely at securing H\u2019s dismissal because of his refusal either to join the union or pay the dues. The proceeding was unnecessary as between the union and the company. Both fully understood and agreed that the collective agreement required H to execute and deliver to the company a proper authorization form.\nThe issue was whether an employee whose status was being affected by the hearing was entitled to be represented in his own right as distinct from being represented by the union which was taking a position adverse to his interests. The majority of the Court agreed that the employee was entitled to be heard. In the circumstances of the case it was improper for the arbitrator to proceed as he did in H\u2019s absence. Natural justice was not done by proceeding in his absence and without notice to him.\nPer Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The case was concerned solely with a policy grievance and the interpretation of the article in the agreement relating to deduction of dues. As held by the majority decision of the Court of Appeal, H had no enforceable right to participate in the administration of the collective agreement, or to intervene in arbitration respecting the union\u2019s policy grievance, and had, therefore, no right to notice of the arbitration.\nThe rights or interests of H were not in issue and could not be affected by the answer to the question placed before the arbitrator, namely, whether the company was required under the terms of the collective agreement to require each employee to execute a dues authorization form.\n[Re Bradley et al. and Ottawa Professional Fire Fighters Association et al., [1967] 2 O.R. 311, applied.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from an order of Grant J. on an application to him to quash a labour arbitration award. Appeal allowed, Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nB.A. Kelsey, for the appellant.\nJohn H. Osler, Q.C., for the respondents. CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the question in issue are set out in the reasons of other Members of the Court and do not require repetition.\nI agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Hall and wish to add only a few words, to emphasize my view that the decision of this appeal turns on the peculiar facts of the case.\nI agree with the opinion of my brother Judson as to the scheme of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, which he expresses as follows:\n\u2026The scheme of The Labour Relations Act is to provide for a bargaining agent which is given power to conclude an agreement with an employer, on behalf of the employees of that employer, which agreement becomes binding upon all employees. No ratification or consent by the employees or any of them is required before a lawful agreement can be concluded and the bargaining agent is given specific authority by the Act to make the kind of agreement represented by art. 5.02 in the instant case. No individual employee is entitled as of right to be present during bargaining or at the conclusion of such an agreement. To require that notice and the right to be present be given to each employee on any occasion when a provision in a collective agreement having general application to all employees was being interpreted would be to destroy the principle of the bargaining agent and to vitiate the purpose of the Act.\nThe reason that I differ from the result at which he arrives is that I am unable to regard the arbitration which was held as anything other than an inquiry as to a single question, that is whether or not the employer was bound to discharge the appellant.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Hall.\nThe judgment of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014Greening Metal Products and Screening Equipment Company and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 6266, entered into a collective agreement on March 18, 1965. The company and the union amended art. 5.02 of the original agreement on September 1, 1965, so as to read as follows:\nAs a condition of their continued employment, all present employees shall, on or before the 15th day of September, 1965, and all future employees shall, within 30 days following their employment be required to execute and deliver to the Company an authorization for deduction of their union dues or an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues paid by members as the case may be. Such authorization may be revoked by any employee by giving written notice to the Company and the Union within the 30 day period prior to the termination date of the contract. Before the amendment of September 1, 1965, art. 5.02 had read as follows:\nAll employees shall as a condition of employment within thirty (30) days of their employment be required to execute an authorization for deduction of their union dues or an amount equivalent thereto. Such authorization may be revoked by the employees by giving written notice to the company and the union within the thirty day period prior to the termination date of the contract.\nHoogendoorn had been discharged on March 22, 1965, for refusing to execute an authorization for deduction of union dues under the original art. 5.02. He was reinstated on April 5, 1965, because the company accepted representations made by his solicitors that the article could only have application to new employees and not to those in the employment of the company at the time of the execution of the agreement. This was the reason why the agreement was amended on September 1, 1965.\nHoogendoorn persisted in his refusal to sign authorization after the collective agreement had been amended. On March 18, 1966, all other employees of the plant ceased to work and pickets were set up as a result of his continued refusal to execute a dues authorization form.\nThe company and the union went to arbitration on the question whether the company was in violation of art. 5.02 of the current collective agreement as amended on September 1, 1965. They agreed to submit the matter to a sole arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator was in the following terms:\n\u2026I therefore conclude that the company is in violation of Article 5.02 as amended and require the company to notify the employee Hoogendoorn in writing forthwith by registered mail that he must execute and deliver to the company a proper authorization form for deduction of his union dues or an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues paid by members as the case may be (enclosing such form) within seven (7) days from the date of the postmark date on the envelope containing the notice or be discharged from his employment. If Mr. Hoogendoorn fails to comply then I direct that the company exercise its powers as an employer and discharge him.\nHoogendoorn was not notified of, nor present, nor represented directly at the hearing. He moved before Grant J. in the Supreme Court of Ontario to quash the award. His motion was dismissed. He appealed to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal. This appeal failed. The only modification made by the Court of Appeal was to direct the deletion of the last sentence of the arbitrator\u2019s award, which had directed the company to discharge Hoogendoorn if he failed to comply with the request for an authorization.\nThe only issue in the present appeal is whether Hoogendoorn was entitled to notice of and representation at the arbitration proceedings. The union says that this was a \u201cpolicy grievance\u201d for the purpose of obtaining a decision whether the employer was in breach of one of the provisions of the collective agreement\u2014a provision of general application to all employees. The majority decision of the Court of Appeal accepted this and held that Hoogendoorn had no enforceable right to participate in the administration of the collective agreement against the wishes of the union, or to intervene in arbitration respecting the union\u2019s policy grievance, and that he had, therefore, no right to notice of the arbitration.\nThe dissenting judgment of Wells J.A. held that the union was seeking the dismissal of Hoogendoorn and at the same time was the only agency that in fact represented him before the arbitration, and that, in these circumstances, he should have been notified of the arbitration and allowed to intervene and state his case, and that failing to do this was failure to render natural justice.\nI agree with the majority judgment. The scheme of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, is to provide for a bargaining agent which is given power to conclude an agreement with an employer, on behalf of the employees of that employer, which agreement becomes binding upon all employees. No ratification or consent by the employees or any of them is required before a lawful agreement can be concluded and the bargaining agent is given specific authority by the Act to make the kind of agreement represented by art. 5.02 in the instant case. No individual employee is entitled as of right to be present during bargaining or at the conclusion of such an agreement. To require that notice and the right to be present be given to each employee on any occasion when a provision in a collective agreement having general application to all employees was being interpreted would be to destroy the principle of the bargaining agent and to vitiate the purpose of the Act.\nWhat was before the learned arbitrator was an allegation that the respondent company had violated the agreement by failure to notify the appellant Hoogendoorn of the obli- gation imposed on all employees, including Hoogendoorn, to execute an authorization to deduct dues, as a condition of employment. The disputed clause was in no sense more or less applicable to Hoogendoorn than to any other employee within the bargaining unit and the question of whether or not the clause had been violated was, at that stage, the exclusive concern of the company and the union.\nThe rights or interests of Hoogendoorn were not in issue and could not be affected by the answer to the question placed before the arbitrator, namely, whether the company was obligated under the terms of the collective agreement to require each employee to execute a dues authorization form. There was only one possible answer to this question and it applied to all employees whether they agreed or disagreed with the existence of art. 5.02 in the collective agreement. What they would do when the demand for the authorization was made by the company was entirely within their own choice, although it is obvious that the consequence of a refusal would be dismissal. The arbitration procedure has been attacked as a sham battle designed to secure the dismissal of one man. This, I do not accept. I agree with the ratio of the majority reasons of the Court of Appeal expressed in the following terms:\nOn the facts the contention fails. It was not in the union\u2019s power to procure the discharge of the applicant if he was prepared to pay the periodical union dues. Discharge is for management, either as a matter of cause at large or as specifically provided by the collective agreement. The union policy grievance was designed to force management to put the option under art. 5.02 before the applicant. If he decided to pay, his job was secure against union coercion.\nThe question of the right to notice of and the right to participate in an arbitration has again been dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in reasons dated June 14, 1967, in the case of Re Bradley et al. and Ottawa Professional Fire Fighters Association et al.[2] That case had to do with art. 12.01 of the collective agreement dealing with promotions. It provided that all promotions in the fire department were to be based on seniority of years of service together with efficiency. The Fire Chief made a number of promotions of men whom I will refer to as included in Group A. The association protested and claimed that the promotions should have been made in favour of Group B. The arbitrator stated that \u201cthe grievance concerns solely the proper interpretation to be placed on s. 12.01\u201d. He did construe this provision and it was admitted in the Court of Appeal that if he had stopped there, Group B could not have challenged his award because the arbitration would have amounted to no more than a declaratory proceeding by which the association and the city would have resolved their difference as to the proper meaning of art. 12.01. How that meaning would affect promotions already made or those to be made in the future would be a matter for further consideration and determination.\nHowever, he went further. He revoked the promotions of five of the six members of Group A. Both the judge of first instance on an application for certiorari and the Court of Appeal held that in spite of the arbitrator\u2019s declaration that he was concerned only with the interpretation of art. 12.01, he went on to apply it to five members of Group A without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The Court of Appeal held, in agreement with Hartt J., that the award should be quashed. They distinguished the case from Hoogendoorn\u2019s case. What the Fire Fighters\u2019 Association did was to take up the cause of Group B in opposition to Group A. The association did not represent Group A. Nevertheless, it persisted throughout the proceedings in asking for the replacement of Group A by Group B, whose cause alone it was advocating. Hoogendoorn\u2019s case is concerned solely with a policy grievance and the interpretation of art. 5.02.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[3] which dismissed an appeal from the order of Grant J. on an application to him to quash an arbitration award made by His Honour G.H.F. Moore as arbitrator, pursuant to an agreement between the respondent company and the respondent union, entered into to bring an end to a \u201cwildcat\u201d strike which had started on March 18, 1966, and continued to March 25, 1966.\nThe facts are shortly that the appellant Hoogendoorn became an employee of the respondent company in Sep- tember 1955. On June 27, 1962, the respondent union, Local No. 6266, was certified by the Ontario Labour Relations Board as the sole and exclusive agency representing the employees. A collective agreement was entered into in December 1962, which provided for a check-off of union dues. Subsequently, on March 18, 1965, there was a new collective agreement which provided for the compulsory deduction of union dues. Hoogendoorn had taken the position and had told the company that he and two other employees could not join or financially support the union because of political and religious convictions. Following this, on March 22, 1965, Hoogendoorn and the two other employees were dismissed. Hoogendoorn was reinstated on April 5, 1965, following a protest from his solicitors that the dismissal was unlawful and a threat of legal action for reinstatement and damages. The two other employees appear to have accepted their dismissal and gone elsewhere.\nThe situation remained static until September 1, 1965, when Article V of the collective agreement of March 18, 1965, was amended to read:\n5.01 During the term of this Agreement the Company agrees to deduct Union dues or a sum equivalent to Union dues as certified by the Union to be currently in effect according to the Constitution of the International Union from the wages of each employee, who has authorized such deduction, on the second pay day of each calendar month and to remit the amounts so deducted to the International Secretary-Treasurer of the United Steelworkers of America.\n5.02 As a condition of their continued employment, all present employees shall, on or before the 15th day of September, 1965, and all future employees shall, within 30 days following their employment be required to execute and deliver to the Company an authorization for deduction of their union dues or an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues paid by members, as the case may be. Such authorization may be revoked by any employee by giving written notice to the Company and the Union within the 30 day period prior to the termination date of the contract.\nHoogendoorn\u2019s solicitors again notified the company and the union that even as amended Article V did not apply to him. The company and the union thereupon agreed between themselves that the amendment should not be enforced until March 17, 1966, the expiry date of the March 18, 1965, agreement. However, by virtue of Article XXVIII the collective agreement continued in force from year to year unless terminated by notice as provided in that article. As no notice of termination had been given, the agreement continued in force after March 17. As of March 17, 1966, Hoogendoorn still refused to sign any authorization as required by arts. 5.01 and 5.02 to the deduction of union dues and as a result, there occurred the \u201cwildcat\u201d strike previously referred to. This strike arose out of the objection of the other employees to Hoogendoorn\u2019s continued employment. To break this impasse, the company and the union agreed to submit the matter to arbitration. A grievance in writing, dated March 22, 1966, reading as follows:\nIt is the Union contention that on March 18, 1966, the Company did violate Article V, Section 5.02 of the Current Collective Agreement as amended on September 1st, 1965.\nwas brought by the union.\nThe company and the union did not follow the grievance procedure set out in Article VIII of the collective agreement, but entered into an agreement which read in part as follows:\nThe parties appearing at this hearing re the dispute covered in grievance dated March 22, 1966 have mutually agreed to waive the grievance procedure as outlined in the collective agreement, and to waive a Board of Arbitration, and instead submit this matter to a sole arbitrator whose authority will be the same as that of a Board of Arbitration under the collective agreement.\nReferring to this, Wells J.A. said:\nIt was argued also that this was a policy grievance, and as such the only parties concerned were the union and the employer company. In my opinion the hearing was not a policy grievance at all. The provisions of Articles 7 and 8 were completely disregarded, particularly section 8.04 which provides:\nNo matter may be submitted to arbitration which has not been properly carried through all previous steps of the Grievance Procedure.\nThe arbitration before us can only be described as an ad hoc body set up by the union and employer to solve the situation created by the unlawful strike caused by Hoogendoorn\u2019s continued employment. If there was a power to do this it must be justified under Part 26, section 26.01, which is as follows:\nThe parties reserve the right to amend and supplement this Contract by mutual agreement at any time during the duration thereof.\nOn the facts it is obvious that the proceeding was aimed entirely at securing Hoogendoorn\u2019s dismissal. The learned arbitrator correctly understood the situation for he concluded his award by saying: \u201cIf Mr. Hoogendoorn fails to comply, then I direct that the Company exercise its powers as an employer and discharge him\u201d. The majority in the Court of Appeal recognized the impropriety of this direc- tion and ordered that it be deleted from the award, holding that it was severable and that the award could be amended by its deletion and as so amended, should be upheld. On this aspect of the case, Wells J.A. said:\nIn my opinion, there might be some weight to this point of view if the proceedings before the learned arbitrator had proceeded as an impersonal interpretation of the agreement without reference to any individual. One has only to look at the learned arbitrator\u2019s reasons however, to realize that this was not the case. He dealt exclusively with Hoogendoorn\u2019s case and any reference to general principles as unrelated to Hoogendoorn, in my opinion, was coincidental.\nI agree that this represents the actual situation as it developed. I think the learned arbitrator correctly understood what he was adjudicating upon namely, Hoogendoorn\u2019s continued employment and nothing else. His proper understanding of his function in the ad hoc arbitration proceeding led him inevitably to ordering Hoogendoorn\u2019s dismissal. The arbitration proceeding was unnecessary as between the union and the company. Both fully understood and agreed that the collective agreement required Hoogendoorn to execute and deliver to the company a proper authorization form for deduction of the monthly union dues being paid by members of the union. Both the company and the union wanted him to do so. The arbitration proceeding was not necessary to determine that Hoogendoorn was required so to do. Both knew he was adamant in his refusal. The proceeding was aimed at getting rid of Hoogendoorn as an employee because of his refusal either to join the union or pay the dues. It cannot be said that Hoogendoorn was being represented by the union in the arbitration proceeding. The union actively took a position completely adverse to Hoogendoorn. It wanted him dismissed.\nI can come to no other conclusion but that in the circumstances of this case it was improper for the learned arbitrator to proceed as he did in Hoogendoorn\u2019s absence. The issue here is whether natural justice was done by proceeding in his absence and without notice to him. On this issue I agree fully with Wells J.A. when he said:\nThe requirements that natural justice should be done is a fundamental one in our jurisprudence and I think may be succinctly stated by quoting from the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of University of Ceylon v. Fernando, reported in [1960] 1 All E.R. 631. This was a case of a student accused of cheating at examinations and the Judicial Committee examined the problem at some length. Lord Jenkins expressing the reasons for the report by the Committee made the following observations at p. 638, which I would respectfully adopt.\nThe last general statement as to the requirements of natural justice to which their Lordships would refer is that of HARMAN J., in Byrne v. Kinematograph Renters Society, Ltd. [1958] 2 All E.R. 579 at p. 599, of which their Lordships would express their approval. The learned judge said this:\nWhat, then, are the requirements of natural justice in a case of this kind? First, I think that the person accused should know the nature of the accusation made; secondly, that he should be given an opportunity to state his case; and, thirdly, of course, that the tribunal should act in good faith. I do not think that there really is anything more.\nAs I have indicated, these observations apply in my opinion to the circumstances revealed in this case. Without questioning anyone\u2019s good faith, I am of the opinion that Hoogendoorn, under all the peculiar circumstances, which I have indicated, was entitled to be heard and with respect, I differ from the view that part of the learned arbitrator\u2019s decision can be deleted and that what is left is a proper adjudication of the problem, without any intervention by Hoogendoorn.\nThe case of Re Bradley et al. and Ottawa Professional Fire Fighters Association et al.[4] was relied on by the respondents. That case had to do with art. 12.01 of a collective agreement dealing with promotions. It provided that \u201call promotions in the [Fire] Department shall be based on seniority of years of service together with efficiency\u201d. The Chief of the Fire Department promoted a number of men, six in all. The Association objected, claiming that others should have been promoted. The dispute was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator, Judge Shortt, stated at the outset of his award that \u201cthe grievance concerns solely the proper interpretation to be placed upon Section 12.01\u201d. In this respect, the grievance there being arbitrated was singularly like the grievance dealt with by the arbitrator in the instant case which reads:\nIt is the Union contention that on March 18, 1966, the Company did violate Article V, Section 5.02 of the Current Collective Agreement as amended on September 1st, 1965.\nThe present case and the Ottawa case are identical in that upon such similar submissions the arbitrator in the Ottawa case went beyond interpreting clause 12.01 and directed that five of the six promotions made by the Chief of the department be revoked. The Court of Appeal set aside the award because it was made without notice to the five men so affected although three of them were in fact present during the arbitration hearing as onlookers and not as parties and the other two were alleged to have been aware of the pending arbitration.\nLaskin J.A. said at pp. 313-4 of the judgment in the Ottawa case:\nJudge Shortt in his award stated at the outset that \u201cthe grievance concerns solely the proper interpretation to be placed upon Section 12.01\u201d. He went on to construe this provision, and it is conceded that if he had concluded his award after giving his construction, it would not have been open to Bradley and the other certiorari applicants to challenge it. The arbitration would then have amounted to a declaratory proceeding by which the Association and the city would have resolved their difference as to the proper meaning of art. 12.01; and how that meaning would affect promotions already made or those to be made would be a matter for further consideration and determination. If the arbitrator had proceeded in this manner the case would be within the principles examined by this Court in Re Hoogendoorn and Greening Metal Products & Screening Equipment Co. et al., [1967] 1 O.R. 712, 62 D.L.R. (2d) 167.\nJudge Shortt went beyond his terms of reference in directing that the disputed promotions be revoked. The arbitrator in the present case likewise went too far when he directed the company to dismiss Hoogendoorn. Accordingly, on substantially the same question, the Court of Appeal appears to have taken directly opposite positions. It deleted the direction to discharge Hoogendoorn in the one case and upheld the award and in the other it refused to delete the part revoking the promotions and struck down the whole award. I think it was right in the Ottawa case and wrong in Hoogendoorn\u2019s. In both cases the issue was whether an employee whose status was being affected by the hearing was entitled to be represented in his own right as distinct from being represented by the union which was taking a position adverse to his interests.\nIt follows that I would allow the appeal and quash the award made by the learned arbitrator.\nThe appellant should have his costs here and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto. Solicitors for the respondent, Greening Metal Products and Screening Equipment Co.: Miller, Thomson, Hicks, Sedgwick, Lewis & Healy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The United Steelworkers of America, Local 6266: Joliffe, Lewis & Osler, Toronto.\nEDITORIAL NOTE:\u2014On March 4, 1968, a motion was made on behalf of the respondent Greening Metal Products and Screening Equipment Company that the judgment pronounced in the above appeal on November 27, 1967, be varied to read as follows: \u201cThe appeal is allowed, and the Order of the Court of Appeal and the Order of Grant J. are set aside and it is directed that an Order be entered quashing the arbitration award made on the 1st day of April, 1966, by His Honour Judge G.H.F.

He sought to deduct from his income for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954, substantial profits he had realized from the acquisition, exchange and disposition of shares of several companies of which he was a director and for which his brokerage firm had acted as underwriters. The appellant argued that the profits constituted the realization of an investment, so as to constitute a capital gain. In the Minister\u2019s view, the profits were derived from a \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nThe Exchequer Court held that the appellant had assisted materially in the marketing of the securities and that the turning of these investments into profit was not merely incidental but rather the essential feature of his personal trading operations. The trial judge held further that because of his fiduciary relationship to the companies to which he was connected, the appellant was in a position to and did avail himself of the opportunity to make these profits. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the second ground stated by the trial judge, there was no suggestion that in any of the transactions the appellant had obtained for himself a personal profit at the expense of any of the companies of which he was a director, or that he had placed himself in a position where he should account for the profits as a trustee. That issue was not before the Court in this case.\nAs to the first ground stated by the trial judge, there was sufficient evidence on which the trial judge could properly find that the appellant was engaged in the business of buying and selling securities, and that he was not in the position of an owner of an ordinary investment choosing to realize it. Consequently, the profits were income subject to tax.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Gain en capital ou revenu imposable\u2014Courtier\u2014Achat et vente d\u2019actions\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 3, 4, 139(1)(e).

L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que les profits constituaient la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un placement pour en devenir un gain en capital.

Ainslie and P. Cumyn, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, which dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeals from re-assessments, made for income tax purposes, of his income for the taxation years 1952, 1953 and 1954. The issue for determination is as to whether profits, in the total amount of $380,983.46, realized on the acquisition and sale by the appellant of units of the St. John\u2019s Trust and of shares of Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd., Yankee Princess Oils, Ltd. and Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. were income from a business, within ss. 3, 4 and para, (e) of subs. (1) of s. 139 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, or constituted the realization of an investment, so as to constitute a capital gain.\nThe appellant was a shareholder, officer and director of the investment dealer and stock brokerage firm of Ross Whittall Ltd., at all material times, until its winding up in 1954. Norman R. Whittall Ltd. succeeded to the business of Ross Whittall Ltd. The appellant was the president of Norman R. Whittall Ltd.\nIn the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 the appellant owned about 67\u00bd per cent of the equity capital of Ross Whittall Ltd.\nRoss Whittall Ltd. and Norman R. Whittall Ltd. conducted a business, similar to that of any reputable investment house, of filling orders, buying or selling for clients on a commission basis, and taking portions of underwritings which they in turn distributed to their clients.\nThe transactions which are in issue can be dealt with under three headings:\n1. The acquisition and sale of units of the St. John\u2019s Trust and of shares of Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd.\n2. The acquisition and sale of shares of Yankee Princess Oils Ltd.\n3. The acquisition and sale of shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. I THE ACQUISITION AND SALE OF UNITS OF THE ST. JOHN\u2019S TRUST AND OF SHARES OF INLAND NATURAL GAS CO. LTD.\nThe re-assessments made in respect of these transactions were as follows:\nfor 1952\nShare of proceeds re sale of St. John\u2019s Trust units .......................................................................\n$ 116,500.00\nLess cost of interest in four Wilson Syndicate units .......................................................................\n7,500.00\n$ 109,000.00\nfor 1953\nProceeds of sale of shares of Inland Natural Gas Co.

Ltd........................\n$ 55,721.50\nLess cost at $1.00 per share..........................................\n21,000.00\n$ 34,721.50\nThe appellant, who had been the owner of 27 out of 164\u00bd units created under an agreement known as the St. John\u2019s Trust Agreement, together with the other owners of the units sold them to Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd. on October 14, 1952, for the sum of $710,000. The appellant\u2019s share of the proceeds was $116,500.\nThe St. John\u2019s Trust Agreement, which was dated March 8, 1952, was an agreement which the appellant, his son, Richard Whittall, W.K. McGee, who was secretary of Ross Whittall Ltd., and Frank and George McMahon had entered into with the Eastern Trust Company as trustee in order to pool the interests which they had in oil and natural gas exploration rights in the lands covered by Permits 22 and 30 issued by the British Columbia Government. The 164\u00bd units representing the total interest in the assets of the St. John\u2019s Trust were owned in the following proportions:\nThe appellant................................................................................\n27 units\nRoss Whittall Ltd. .........................................................................\n43 units\nH. Richard Whittall .......................................................................\n4\u00bd units\nW.K. McGee ................................................................................\n4\u00bd units\nFrank and George McMahon .....................................................\n85\u00bd units\n164\u00bd units\nThe lands covered by Permits 22 and 30 were located in the St. John area of the Peace River country of British Columbia. The area covered by Permit 22 was 100,000 acres and the area covered by Permit 30, which was nearby but not contiguous to Permit 22, was 200,000 acres.\nThe interests in Permits 22 and 30 which the parties conveyed to the trustee were as follows:\n(a) four units in the Wilson Syndicate which were conveyed to the Trustee by the following persons:\nThe appellant ....................................................................\n1\u00bd units\nGeorge McMahon ............................................................\n1 unit\nFrank McMahon ...............................................................\n1 unit\nRichard Whittall ................................................................\n\u00bc unit\nW.K. McGee .....................................................................\n\u00bc unit\n(b) a 51% undivided beneficial interest which Frank and George McMahon owned in the interests of Ross Whittall Ltd. in Permits 22 and 30; and\n(c) the remaining 49% of the interest retained by Ross Whittall Ltd. in Permits 22 and 30 subject, however, to a carried interest.\nThe background to the formation of the Wilson Syndicate which owned a one-tenth \u201ccarried\u201d interest in the lands covered by Permit 22 was as follows:\n(a) Both William Innes and Peace River Natural Gas Co. applied to the Province of British Columbia for a permit to prospect for petroleum and natural gas in a certain area of northern British Columbia.\n(b) By agreement dated September 20, 1949, Innes agreed to withdraw his application for a permit in consideration for Peace River Natural Gas Co.\u2019s undertaking that when the permit was issued, it would stand possessed in trust for Innes of an undivided one-tenth interest in the permit, in any leases issued pursuant to it, and in any petroleum or natural gas recovered therefrom, subject to the payment by Innes of one-tenth of the costs incurred by Peace River Natural Gas in exploring, developing and drilling on the land.\n(c) It was further agreed that Innes\u2019 interest would be a \u201ccarried\u201d interest, that is, that Innes would only be obligated to reimburse Peace River Gas for his portion of the drilling, developing and exploration costs out of his share of any proceeds of sale or production from the well.\nIn February 1952, George McMahon had acquired the opportunity of purchasing four units in the Wilson Syndicate, which units had been purchased at a price of $5,000 per unit for the following persons:\nGeorge McMahon .............................................................................\n1 unit\nFrank McMahon .................................................................................\n1 unit\nThe appellant .....................................................................................\n1\u00bd units\nRichard Whittall ..................................................................................\n\u00bc unit\nW.K. McGee ......................................................................................\n\u00bc unit\nTotal .........................................................................................\n4 units\nThe interests in Permits 22 and 30 which prior to their assignment to the trustee of the St. John\u2019s Trust were owned 51 per cent by the McMahon brothers and 49 per cent by Ross Whittall Ltd. subject to a carried interest, comprised the following:\n(a) a 4\u00bd% interest in a block of 10,000 acres of land carved out of Permit 22 and consolidated with the block of land mentioned in paragraph (b) subject to the 10% carried interest in favour of William Innes (which had been assigned to the Wilson Syndicate);\n(b) a 6% interest in a block of 10,000 acres of land, covered by Permit 30, subject to a 10% carried interest in favour of the following:\nCanadian Atlantic Oil Co. ........................................\n7%\nEmpire Petroleums Ltd.............................................\n1%\nYankee Princess Oils Ltd. .......................................\n.8%\nRoss Whittall Ltd. ......................................................\n1.2%\n(c) the 1.2% carried interest referred to in paragraph (b) above;\n(d) a 20% interest in those lands covered by Permit 30 other than the 10,000 acres referred to in paragraph (b) above, and subject to a 25% carried interest which was reserved by Ross Whittall Ltd.\nThe registered owner of Permit 22 was the Peace River Natural Gas Company, which company was controlled by Pacific Petroleums Ltd. Apart from the 10 per cent carried interest which had been granted to Innes by Peace River Natural Gas Co., the remaining 90 per cent interest in Permit 22 was owned by a group of companies of which Pacific Petroleums was a member. Pacific Petroleum held 50 per cent of the total interest in Permit 22, and had acquired the operating agreements. Peace River Natural Gas Co. also had an interest.\nThe appellant \u201chad a fair interest in Pacific Petroleums at its inception\u201d and both then and in February 1952, was an officer and director of that company. In February 1952, George and Frank McMahon ran Pacific Petroleums as operating executives. George McMahon was one of the senior officials of Pacific Petroleums and it was through him that the appellant became interested in purchasing the Wilson Syndicate units.\nThe appellant was likewise an officer and director of Peace River Natural Gas Co. Ltd. at the time of the issuing of Permit 22.\nPermit 30 had been acquired by McGee, the secretary of Ross Whittall Ltd. as trustee for certain persons (including Ross Whittall Ltd. which had a 20 per cent beneficial interest). The operating agreements in respect of Permit 30 had been acquired by Canadian Atlantic Oil Company. The appellant was a director of that company and George McMahon was both its president and a director.\nBefore the appellant acquired his interest in the Wilson Syndicate, he was aware in his capacity as an officer and director of Pacific Petroleums Ltd. that that company had drilled a first well, a \u201cteaser\u201d, on the lands covered by Permit 22, and that other wells were soon to be drilled.\nIn April 1952, Pacific Petroleums commenced drilling well No. 7 and in May 1952, well No. 9 on Permit 22; these wells revealed a large reservoir of natural gas, and \u201cit was quite obvious that profitable returns could be anticipated\u201d from them.\nThe appellant paid his portion of the St. John\u2019s Trust\u2019s drilling costs of each of these wells, which was 27\/164.5 of 4\u00bd per cent of $330,000.\nAfter the discovery of this gas \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of new drilling and more wells were brought in\u201d. \u201cThe burning problem with these people who had got gas was how were they going to sell it.\u201d Consequently, it was contemplated that Westcoast Transmission Company Limited, a corporation incorporated by an act of the Parliament of Canada, would construct a pipeline from Fort St. John to a point near Sumas, B.C., on the national border, whence it would cross into the United States. The appellant was a director of that company.\nBefore Westcoast could export gas to the United States, it had to obtain the consent of the Canadian Board of Transport Commissioners and the American Federal Power Commission to do so. The Board of Transport Commissioners made it clear that there would be no export of gas unless the various municipalities of British Columbia were first serviced. The British Columbia Hydro Electric Company agreed to undertake the distribution of gas in the lower part of British Columbia. In the upper part of British Columbia there was no company capable of distributing gas. Westcoast requested the appellant to incorporate a company to handle the distribution in the upper country. This he did, and caused Inland Natural Gas Company to be incorporated. The appellant became president of Inland Natural Gas. Westcoast then promised the exclusive distribution of its gas to Inland Natural Gas for the Okanagan, Cariboo and Prince George areas of British Columbia.\nInland Natural Gas after incorporation became interested in acquiring reserves of gas and gas bearing properties. To that end it caused to be incorporated a company known as St. John Gas and Oil Co., Ltd., which was a wholly-owned subsidiary and was formed for the purpose of acquiring the gas reserves and properties.\nOn October 15, 1952, St. John Gas and Oil Co., Ltd purchased the 164\u00bd units of the St. John\u2019s Trust for $710,000. The appellant\u2019s share of the proceeds was $116,500 and the gain realized by him was $109,000.\nThe various holders of the unit certificates under the St. John\u2019s Trust Agreement had, by a collateral agreement, agreed to purchase 710,000 treasury shares of Inland Natural Gas Company for a price of $1 per share. On October 7, 1952, the appellant purchased 116,500 shares of Inland Natural Gas.\nA few days later, Ross Whittall Ltd. conveyed to St. John Gas and Oil Co., Ltd., for $40,000, the 25 per cent carried interest which it still owned in the 20 per cent interest in Permit 30; Ross Whittall Ltd. used the proceeds of the sale to acquire 40,000 shares of Inland Natural Gas.\nOn October 16, 1952, pursuant to an underwriting agreement, Ross Whittall Ltd. and McMahon and Burns each agreed to purchase 250,000 treasury shares of Inland Natural Gas at 75\u00a2 per share and to offer them for sale to the public at $1 per share.\nBetween October 16, 1952, and September 4, 1953, the appellant sold 113,500 shares in Inland Natural Gas at the following prices per share:\n1952\nShares Sold\nPrice Per Share\n16 October.....................................\n1952\n56,000\n$0.97\n22 October.....................................\n1952\n5,000\n1.00\n7 November ..................................\n1952\n10,000\n1.12\n30 December ...............................\n1952\n5,000\n1.30\n76,000\n1953\n6 January.......................................\n1953\n5,000\n1.45\n9 January.......................................\n1953\n5,000\n1.55\n22 January.....................................\n1953\n4,000\n1.70\n18 February...................................\n1953\n3,500\n1.95\n20 March........................................\n1953\n5,000\n2.45\n20 March........................................\n1953\n5,000\n2.43\n30 March........................................\n1953\n5,000\n2.79\n4 September.................................\n1953\n3,000\n1.99\n4 September.................................\n1953\n2,000\n2.10\n37,500\n113,500\nOn October 29, 1953, Ross Whittall Ltd., pursuant to an underwriting agreement, purchased a further 75,000 treasury shares of Inland Natural Gas at $2 per share.\nOn November 24, 1953, the appellant received from Inland Natural Gas a further 18,000 shares in exchange for 36,000 shares of Canadian Northern Oil and Gas. The appellant had acquired the 36,000 shares of Canadian Northern Oil and Gas in August 1953, and they represented the appellant\u2019s portion of the shares which had been allotted by that company for the \u201cinitial money put up by the insiders of Canadian Northern Oil and Gas\u201d.\nThe appellant in his examination in chief stated that the reason that he sold 37,500 shares of Inland Natural Gas during 1953 was that:\nit became evident\u2026 that there was going to be a very serious delay in getting permits from the Board of Transport Commissioners and the Federal Power Commission to enable Westcoast to make its allowance to Inland of the distribution in the upper country worthwhile, it was only very shortly after that the Federal Power Commission turned down our Westcoast application and the stock did really go down then.\nThroughout 1954, the appellant purchased 18,000 shares of Inland Natural Gas and sold 34,000 shares. Particulars of the purchases and sales are as follows:\nDate\nNumber Purchased\nPrice Per Share\nNumber\nSold\nSales Price Per Share\n15 January 1954...............\n16,500\n2.48\/2.70\n13 May...............................\n500\n3.19\n21 May...............................\n2,100\n2.30\/2.50\n1 June................................\n2,000\n2.57\/2.62\n6 July..................................\n2,900\n0.91\/2.51\u00bd\n8 July..................................\n3,000\n1.31\/1.36\n19 July................................\n1,000\n1.16\n17 September...................\n2,000\n1.95\n27 September...................\n2,000\n2.02\n19 October........................\n2,500\n2.63\n12 November....................\n2,500\n2.01\u00bd\n23 November....................\n2,000\n2.75\/2.85\n3 December......................\n1,000\n2.68\u00bd\n6 December......................\n8,000\n2.78\u00bd\/2.83\n7 December......................\n4,000\n2.88\u00bd\nTotal........................\n18,000\n34,000\nOn March 31, 1955, the appellant purchased a further 2,500 shares of Inland Natural Gas at $2.70 per share and on June 19, 1955, sold 2,500 shares of Inland Natural Gas at $3.40\/3.50.\nThe gain realized by the appellant upon the sales in 1953 and 1954 of the 58,500 shares of Inland Natural Gas was $74,506.55.\nII THE ACQUISITION AND SALE OF SHARES IN YANKEE PRINCESS OILS LTD.\nThe second question for determination is whether the following gains realized on the sale of shares of Yankee Princess Oils Ltd. are part of the appellant\u2019s income for 1952. The re-assessment is as follows:\nProfit on sale of shares of Yankee Princess Oils Ltd. from 29th January, 1952, to 21st April, 1952, as per schedule filed with respondent\n105,250 shares..............................................................\n$110,157.34 Less:\nPurchase of 31st January, 1952, shown as sale in error\n500 share..............................................\n383.06\n109,774.28\nAdd:\nSale of 5th March, 1952, not included in schedule filed\n2,000 shares........................................\n2,135.00\n111,909.28\nLess:\nCost of shares sold\n92,800..................................................\n$6,750.00\n13,950 @ 7\u00bd\u00a2 ...................................\n1,046.25\n7,796.55\n$104,113.03\nThe 106,750 shares in Yankee Princess Oils material to this appeal were acquired by the appellant upon three occasions:\n(a) 20,250 shares were acquired upon the incorporation of Yankee Princess Oils on September 24, 1948;\n(b) 65,000 shares were acquired in August 1951;\n(c) 40,000 shares were acquired on December 21, 1951.\nIn 1944, one MacDonald, the owner of C.P.R. Oil Permit 257 (which covered 10,000 acres) approached McQueen, a friend of the appellant, to say that he was in arrears on the rentals due under Permit 257 and asked McQueen if he was interested in investing moneys in that Permit. McQueen approached the appellant and his then partner, Ross, and the three acquired a half interest in Permit 257 in the following portions:\nThe appellant ..................................................................................\n37\u00bd%\nMcQueen .........................................................................................\n37\u00bd%\nRoss .................................................................................................\n25 %\nBetween 1944 and September 24, 1948, the appellant, McQueen and Ross sold their interest in 838 acres of land covered by Permit 257.\nThe rent payable under the Permit was 10\u00a2 per acre, or $416.20 per annum, for the interest acquired and retained by the appellant, McQueen and Ross. In 1948, one Henry Tudor approached the appellant, McQueen and Ross with a proposal that they assign their interest in Permit 257 to a company which he was incorporating, Yankee Princess Oils Ltd., for cash and stock. Yankee Princess Oils Ltd. was incorporated on September 24, 1948, with an authorized capital of 150,000 shares.\nThe appellant, McQueen and Ross transferred their interest to Yankee Princess Oils Ltd. for:\n$20,700 cash\n18,000 in promissory notes\n54,000 shares in the stock of Yankee Princess Oils\nThe appellant\u2019s share of the proceeds of sale was:\n$7,652.50 cash\n6,750.00 in promissory notes\n20,250 shares in the stock of Yankee Princess Oils\nIn 1950 the appellant and Ross assigned the promissory notes which had been received from Yankee Princess Oils to Ross Whittall Ltd. for 80 per cent of their face value.\nIn 1951 Tudor felt that there had been sufficient development in the area of the lease to justify Yankee Princess Oils in acquiring further property. As a first step to this end, the authorized capital of Yankee Princess Oils was increased to 3,000,000 shares.\nSubsequently, the various holders of the promissory notes became entitled to surrender their notes to Yankee Princess Oils in return for shares of that company at the rate of 7\u00bd\u00a2 per share. The shares were purchased by Ross Whittall Ltd. which, in turn, sold to the appellant 65,000 shares at 8\u00a2 per share.\nOn December 21, 1951, Yankee Princess Oils acquired from the North West Syndicate (a syndicate of which the appellant was a member) 25 Crown Petroleum and Natural Gas Leases for the sum of $38,000. The North West Syndicate, on the sale of the leases to Yankee Princess Oils, gave an undertaking that $30,000 of the $38,000 purchase price would be used to purchase treasury shares of Yankee Princess Oils at 7\u00a2 per share. The result was that the appellant received $3,800 of which $3,000 was used to purchase 40,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils. The circumstances surrounding the formation of the North West Syndicate and the appellant\u2019s interest in it are as follows:\n(a) In March 1951, the appellant had acquired at a cost of $800.00, 4.0 per cent of a 25 per cent interest in 25 Crown Petroleum and Natural Gas Leases.\n(b) His son, Richard Whittall, had acquired 40 per cent of the 25 per cent interest in the leases and McGee had acquired 20 per cent of the 25 per cent interest in the leases.\n(c) On December 21, 1951, the registered owners of the leases formed a syndicate known as the North West Syndicate wherein\n(i) all of the leases were declared to be held in trust for the members of the syndicate;\n(ii) Richard Whittall, the appellant\u2019s son, was appointed as manager for a period of one year;\n(iii) Richard Whittall was authorized to sell the leases to Yankee Princess Oils for $38,000; and\n(iv) the proceeds from any sales were to be paid to Ross Whittall Ltd. as trustee and after the payment of expenses were to be disbursed to the members of the syndicate.\nOn January 2, 1952, Yankee Princess Oils acquired from Atlantic Oil Company (which company later changed its name to Canadian Atlantic Oil Company) a farm out agreement wherein Yankee Princess Oils agreed to drill on lands owned by Atlantic Oil Company at no cost to that company in consideration for acquiring a 50 per cent interest in an oil lease held by Atlantic Oil Company. The appellant was an officer of both Atlantic Oil Company and Yankee Princess Oils. This farm out agreement had been negotiated by Richard Whittall who at that time was a director of Yankee Princess Oils Ltd.\nOn January 8, 1952, at an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of Yankee Princess Oils, a resolution was passed converting it to a public company.\nIn the early part of January 1952, drilling rigs moved on to the farm out and commenced drilling. The stock of Yankee Princess Oils appreciated very substantially on the strength of the rumour that drilling was going to take place.\nOn January 29, 1952, shares of Yankee Princess Oils were being traded on the unlisted market at 58\u00a2 per share notwithstanding that no results had been obtained from the drilling on the Canadian Atlantic farm out. One of the reasons for the high price was that on nearby property a well had been brought into production, and there was \u201ca very wild oil market.\u201d The appellant, on January 29, 1952, sold 5,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at 58\u00a2 per share.\nThe appellant on January 31, 1952, purchased a further 500 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at 75\u00a2 per share.\nBy an agreement dated January 31, 1952, and executed in early February, Ross Whittall Ltd. agreed to underwrite the issue of certain shares of Yankee Princess Oils. Under the underwriting agreement:\n(a) Yankee Princess Oils agreed to file a prospectus with the appropriate Government authorities before February 9, 1952;\n(b) Yankee Princess Oils granted to Ross Whittall Ltd. an option to purchase prior to February 9, 1952, 350,000 shares at 48\u00a2 per share, which were to be offered to the public at 60\u00a2 per share;\n(c) in the event that Ross Whittall Ltd. exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (b), Yankee Princess Oils granted a further option to Ross Whittall Ltd. to purchase within sixty days from the filing of the prospectus a further 650,000 shares at the price of 48\u00a2\nAll of this stock was spoken for before Ross Whittall Ltd. offered it to the public.\nThe appellant, on February 1, 1952, sold 40,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at 85\u00a2 per share.\nBy February 5, 1952, Ross Whittall Ltd. had sold to the public the 1,000,000 shares which it had agreed to underwrite at 60\u00a2 per share and immediately thereafter the price went to 85\u00a2 per share.\nThe appellant, on February 5, 1952, sold 250 shares of Yankee Princess Oils for 60\u00a2 per share. On February 7, 1952, the appellant was advised that the well which Yankee Princess Oils was drilling under the farm out agreement was a successful well, and he sold 20,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at 95\u00a2 per share.\nDuring the months of March and April, the appellant sold 41,500 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at the following prices per share:\nNumber\nPrice Per Share\n5 March ..............................................................\n2,000\n1.07\n10 March ...........................................................\n3,000\n1.16\/1.20\n19 March ...........................................................\n1,500\n1.12\n1 April ................................................................\n5,000\n1.29\/1.30\n7 April ................................................................\n15,000\n1.20\/1.21\/1.40\n21 April ..............................................................\n15,000\n1.48\/1.55\n41,500\nThe appellant, on May 9, 1952, purchased a further 2,500 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at $1.42 per share.\nRoss Whittall Ltd., on May 12, 1952, underwrote a further 100,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils which were issued for $1 per share and offered for sale to the public at $1.40 per share.\nBy May of 1952 three more wells had been brought into production on the land subject to the farm out agreement with Atlantic Oil.\nDuring the months of May, September and October, the appellant purchased a further 19,500 shares of Yankee Princess Oils at prices ranging from a high of $1.42 to a low of 80\u00a2 per share.\nDuring the months of February and March 1953, the appellant sold a further 17,000 shares of Yankee Princess Oils.\nDuring 1953, it became obvious that the four wells which Yankee Princess Oils had drilled were not going to produce as much oil as was anticipated and the market for the shares of Yankee Princess Oils declined.\nOn October 9, 1953, the appellant bought a further 5,000 shares at 40\u00a2 a share, and on October 13, 1953, he sold these shares at from 51\u00a2 to 53\u00a2 per share.\nThe gain realized by the appellant in 1952 upon the disposition by him of 106,750 shares of Yankee Princess Oils was $104,113.03. III THE ACQUISITION AND SALE OF SHARES IN CANADIAN COLLIERIES (DUNSMUIR) LTD.\nThe third question for determination is whether there is to be included in the appellant\u2019s income the following gains. The re-assessment is as follows:\nfor 1953\nProceeds of sale of shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. purchased from Sunray Oils\n14,650 shares.................................................\n$93,203.75\nLess cost @ $3.50 per share........................\n51,275.00\n41,928.75\nLess reduction agreed on by respondent in the notification ................................................\n1,786.75\n$40,142.00\nfor 1954\nProceeds of sale of shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. purchased from Sunray Oils 10,350 shares............................\n$89,446.85\nLess cost @ $3.50 per share........................\n36,225.00\n$53,221.88\nThe 25,000 shares in Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. material to this appeal were acquired by the appellant on November 26, 1953, in the following circumstances:\nCanadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. had originally been in the business of mining and selling coal; the appellant had been the president and a shareholder of the company since 1945.\nIn 1952, Canadian Collieries having found the coal business to be declining and unprofitable, decided to acquire an interest in oil; to this end, in midsummer of 1952, it acquired the greater portion of the interests which Sunray Oil Corporation had in certain oil and natural gas leases in the Province of Alberta in exchange for issuing to Sunray Oil Corporation 243,000 of its treasury shares.\nIn August 1952, Ross Whittall Ltd. underwrote a sale to the public of 88,828 shares in Canadian Collieries, acquired at $3.60 per share.\nIn November 1953, a first well had been drilled on land covered by the company\u2019s permits, though it proved to be a disappointment. On November 20, 1953, Sunray Oil Corporation offered to sell to the appellant a block of 100,000 shares of Canadian Collieries at $3.50 per share. The appellant was unable to purchase the whole block, but by November 26 the appellant contacted the following persons who agreed to acquire the following shares:\nRoss Whittall Ltd.................................................................................\n20,000 shares\nRichard Whittall...................................................................................\n2,500 shares\nW.K. McGee.......................................................................................\n2,500 shares\nFrank and George McMahon............................................................\n50,000 shares\nThe appellant personally acquired 25,000 shares.\nDuring the months of December 1953, and January 1954, the price of the shares of Canadian Collieries \u201cappreciated quickly\u201d. This was because a second well had come in and had proved to be a commercial well.\nDuring 1953, the appellant acquired 28,000 shares and sold 24,000 shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. During 1954, he acquired 19,200 shares and sold 36,200 shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. During 1955 he bought 5,000 shares and sold 26,600 shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd.\nThe gain realized by the appellant upon the disposition, in 1953 and 1954, of 25,000 shares of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. was $93,363.88.\nThe learned trial judge stated the issue before him in the following terms:\nThe issue to be decided on these facts is whether or not all or any of these securities (the profit on the realization of which was taxed by the Minister as income of the appellant in the relevant years) were ordinary investments within the meaning of the jurisprudence in respect to the same, or whether the transactions entered into by the appellant in the acquisition, exchanging and realization of them were entered into as a scheme for profit making so that the profit gained, received, or derived therefrom by the appellant was profit gained, received or derived from a trade or business of the appellant constituting income within the meaning of sections 3, 4 and 139(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act.\nThe paragraph in the statute to which he last refers provides:\n(e) \u201cbusiness\u201d includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatsoever and includes an adventure or concern in the nature of trade but does not include an office or employment. He reached the following conclusions:\nOn the facts of this case, however, and irrespective of the fiduciary relationships to which I will refer, I am compelled to hold that this appellant in respect to the acquisition of all these securities was endeavouring to make a profit by a trade or business, and was actually engaged in this business at all material times and the profitable sales and exchanges of securities were not in law a substitution of one form of investment for another. During all the material times the appellant assisted materially in the marketing of these securities, which brought substantial gain to himself. The turning of these investments into profit was not merely incidental but instead was the essential feature of his personal trading operations or business speculations.\nThese investments, the realization of which produced the profit, in my opinion, were not \u201cordinary\u201d investments within the meaning of the Irrigation Industries case, (1962) S.C.R. 346, and the Californian Copper Syndicate case, (1904) 5 T.C. 159.\nIn addition, I am also of opinion that one of the outstanding facts which distinguishes this case from all the cases cited in support of the appellant\u2019s submission is the fact that the appellant was in a fiduciary relationship as a director, and in some cases also as an officer, of various companies at the material times as, e.g., Pacific Petroleums Ltd., Atlantic Oil Co. Ltd., Peace River Natural Gas Co. Ltd., Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd., St. John Oil & Gas Co. Ltd., Yankee Princess Oils, Ltd., Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd., Canadian Northern Oil & Gas Co. Ltd., Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd., and Ross Whittall Ltd.; and because of this fiduciary relationship was in a position to and did avail himself of the opportunity to make these trading profits.\nIt is basic equity law that directors are creatures of statute and occupy a position similar in varying respects to those of agents, trustees and managing partners, and their position is clearly of a fiduciary character. They are trustees of the powers which they possess as directors, as for example, the power of issuing and allotting shares. In accepting office as such, directors place themselves in a fiduciary position towards the company and its shareholders. And a director of two companies which deal with each other owes a fiduciary duty to each of them and to their respective shareholders. As directors they may not exercise their powers as directors in such a way as to benefit themselves at the expense of the remaining shareholders. They are precluded from dealing legally on behalf of the company with themselves when there is a personal conflicting interest. Directors may only take up shares in a company of which they are directors on the same terms as the general public.\nThese are only a few of the consequences in equity which flow from occupying the position of director of a company when various transactions are being completed; and they are all relevant in the various circumstances which obtained in the transactions under review in this appeal.\nIn this case, because of the various fiduciary relationships in which the appellant was at the material times, and the conflicts of interest which resulted, on this ground alone I am of opinion that none of these investments of the appellant (the acquisition and realization of which resulted in a profit) were \u201cordinary\u201d investments within the meaning of the Irrigation Industries case (supra).\nDealing first with the second, or additional ground stated, there is no evidence that, in any of the transactions in which he engaged, the appellant was in breach of the duty which he owed to the various companies of which he was a director. There is no suggestion that in any of the transactions under consideration he obtained for himself a personal profit at the expense of any of such companies, or that he had placed himself in a position where he should account for such profits as a trustee. That issue is not before the Court in this case.\nThe sole issue here is whether he, personally, was engaged in the business of trading in oil and gas rights and in corporate shares. The information which was available to him, qua director, and the actions which he took in the light of that information are relevant to that issue to the extent that they are of assistance in determining the intentions of the appellant in relation to the various rights and shares which he acquired and sold.\nI am of the opinion that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge in the first paragraph of the passage from his reasons quoted above. Counsel for the appellant took issue with the statement that \u201cthe appellant assisted materially in the marketing of these securities\u201d, contending that it was the investment company which had done the marketing and not the appellant. But the learned trial judge uses the word \u201cassisted\u201d, and the appellant was, at the material times, the majority shareholder, a director and officer of Ross Whittall Ltd. and the president of its successor. Undoubtedly he assisted in the marketing operations mentioned.\nIn my opinion, the appellant\u2019s personal transactions under review come within the latter part of the frequently cited statement of Lord Justice Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris[2], which case is cited by the learned trial judge:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. The simplest case is that of a person or association of persons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in order to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and thereby seeking to make profits.\nIn respect of the transactions involved in this case, there was sufficient evidence on which the learned trial judge could properly find that the appellant was engaged in the business of buying and selling rights to land and securities, and that he was not in the position of an owner of an \u201cordinary\u201d investment choosing to realize it.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell & Dumoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 342, [1964] C.T.C. 417, 64 D.T.C. 5266.\n[2] (1905), 5 T.C. 159 at 165-6.\n",

The order to abandon the siding had been obtained by the National Capital Commission as part of its program of redevelopment of the City of Ottawa. It was agreed between the National Capital Commission and the appellant that compensation for the loss of the siding would be fixed by the Exchequer Court of Canada pursuant to s. 18(1)(g) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98. If the Court determined that the appellant was required to relocate its business as a result of the removal of the railway services, the compensation to be paid would be an amount which the appellant, as a prudent owner, would pay rather than be forced to relocate. On the other hand, if the Court determined that the appellant was not required to relocate its business, then the compensation would be an amount which a prudent owner would pay rather than lose such rail services, it being agreed that the appellant would have had the use of the siding for a further ten years. The National Capital Commission also offered the appellant land in an industrial park it owned at 20 per cent less than the market price. The appellant carried on business without the siding at the old location for several months, but eventually took advantage of the offer of land and relocated its business.\nThe Exchequer Court, which was seized of the matter by a petition of right, found that if the appellant were forced to relocate, the prudent owner would have paid a sum of $152,802.63 rather than be forced to relocate and that, on the other hand, if it were not forced to relocate then the prudent man would have paid $91,300 rather than lose the rail services. It also found that if the appellant had closed down its business entirely its loss would have been $225,000. It also found that it was not physically impossible to carry on the enterprise without the railway siding services and concluded that the prudent owner would take the least costly of these three alternatives. He therefore fixed the compensation at $91,300, after having deducted a sum for income tax. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIn fixing the amount of compensation, the trial judge used a sound method and applied the proper principles. Moreover, the trial judge was right to reduce the compensation by an amount to cover the income tax. The prudent owner would calculate the income tax when determining the sum he would be prepared to pay rather than lose the railway siding services.\nAs found by the trial judge, the Crown was not estopped from alleging that the appellant was not required to relocate simply because it had offered land to relocate. This was not a case in which the 10 per cent allowance should be made. Section 47(b) of the Exchequer Court Act was a complete answer to the claim for interest.\nCouronne\u2014Promesse de payer une indemnit\u00e9 pour la fermeture d\u2019une ligne de chemin de\u2019 fer de service\u2014Calcul du montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9\u2014Doit-on d\u00e9duire un montant pour l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Terrain offert par la Couronne \u00e0 un bas prix pour d\u00e9m\u00e9nager l\u2019entreprise\u2014La Couronne est-ell\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9e de nier le besoin d\u2019un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1052, c. 98, arts. 18(1)(g), 47(b). Selon les termes d\u2019une ordonnance de la Commission des Transports du Canada, la compagnie appelante, qui exploitait une entreprise de papier de seconde main dans un \u00e9difice \u00e0 Ottawa qu\u2019elle louait d\u2019une compagnie parente, l\u2019autre appelante, a perdu l\u2019usage d\u2019une ligne de chemin de fer de service qui desservait son entreprise. Cette ordonnance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue par la Commission de la Capitale Nationale dans les termes de son programme de d\u00e9veloppement de la cit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa. Il fut entendu entre la Commission de la Capitale Nationale et l\u2019appelante que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte du chemin de fer serait fix\u00e9e par la Cour de l\u2019Echiquier du Canada en vertu de l\u2019art. 18(1)(g) de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98. Si la Cour en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019appelante serait oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager son entreprise \u00e0 la suite de la perte du chemin de fer, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9e serait un montant que l\u2019appelante, comme propri\u00e9taire prudent, serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 payer plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre forc\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, si la Cour en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019appelante ne serait pas oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager son entreprise, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 dans ce cas serait un montant qu\u2019un propri\u00e9taire prudent serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer plut\u00f4t que de perdre la ligne de chemin de fer de service. La Couronne et l\u2019appelante s\u2019accordent pour dire que l\u2019appelante aurait eu l\u2019usage du chemin de fer pour un autre dix ans. La Commission de la Capitale Nationale a aussi offert \u00e0 l\u2019appelante un terrain situ\u00e9 dans un parc industriel \u00e0 un prix de 20 pour-cent de moins que sa valeur marchande. L\u2019appelante a continu\u00e9 son entreprise pendant quelques mois sans le chemin de fer \u00e0 son ancien endroit, mais \u00e9ventuellement elle a accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre du terrain et a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 son entreprise.\nLa Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de cette affaire par une p\u00e9tition de droit, a jug\u00e9 que si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, le propri\u00e9taire prudent aurait pay\u00e9 une somme de $152,802.63 plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre forc\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager et que, d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, si l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas forc\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, l\u2019homme prudent alors aurait pay\u00e9 $91,300 plut\u00f4t que de perdre le chemin de fer. Elle a aussi jug\u00e9 que si l\u2019appelante avait mis fin \u00e0 son entreprise elle aurait accus\u00e9 une perte de $225,000. Elle a de plus jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas physiquement impossible de continuer l\u2019entreprise sans le chemin de fer, et a conclu que le propri\u00e9taire prudent aurait opt\u00e9 pour la moins on\u00e9reuse de ces trois alternatives. Il a donc fix\u00e9 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 $91,300, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9duit un montant pour l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. La compagnie en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nDans la d\u00e9termination du montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, le juge au proc\u00e8s s\u2019est servi d\u2019une bonne m\u00e9thode et a appliqu\u00e9 les principes appropri\u00e9s. De plus, le juge a eu raison de r\u00e9duire, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 par un montant repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Le propri\u00e9taire prudent aurait calcul\u00e9 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en \u00e9tablissant le montant qu\u2019il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer plut\u00f4t que de perdre le chemin de fer.\nTel que jug\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance, la Couronne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019all\u00e9guer que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager son entreprise pour la seule raison que la Couronne avait offert un terrain dans ce but. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 pour-cent doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e. L\u2019article 47(b) de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier est une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation des int\u00e9r\u00eats. APPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], sur une p\u00e9tition de droit. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on a petition of right. Appeal dismissed.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and W.I.C. Binnie, for the appellants.\nKeith E. Eaton, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada1 by which he fixed the compensation to be paid to the appellants at the sum of $91,300 and provided that the appellants should have their costs of the action up to February 21, 1966, on which date the respondent filed a Confession of Judgment in the amount of $100,000 pursuant to rule 104 of the Exchequer Court Rules, with a set-off in favour of the respondent of the costs of action subsequent to the said February 21, 1966.\nThe litigation in the Exchequer Court of Canada arose under the following circumstances.\nThe (suppliants) appellants Florence Realty Company Limited for very many years owned a building in the City of Ottawa with frontages on Boteler, Bolton and Dalhousie Streets, and had leased that building to its related company the Florence Paper Company Limited for the purpose of carrying on a used paper business. From 1918 on, the Florence Paper Company had leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company certain other lands contiguous to the said building which the company said was essential to its business operations, and the paper company was also serviced by a private railway siding under an agreement in writing with the C.P.R.\nAs an integral part of its programme of development of the Lower Town Ottawa area, and particularly the construction of the MacDonald-Cartier Bridge connecting Ottawa with Hull, the National Capital Commission and the C.P.R. determined that the railway siding should be abandoned. That abandonment could only be effected if the Board of Transport Commissioners gave an order permitting the same. The National Capital Commission obtained the consent of the suppliants-appellants to such order of the Board of Transport Commissioners by entering into an agreement with the suppliants-appellants and with others whose businesses would cease to have railway siding and rail service by reason of the abandonment.\nThe agreement between the appellants and the N.C.C. dated May 5, 1964, was produced at trial as exhibit P-29. By that agreement, the parties agreed upon principles to be applied in awarding the compensation for the loss of the railway siding services in the following terms:\n1. For the purposes of this agreement the Commission acknowledges that but for the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company dated the 17th day of October, A.D. 1963, the siding agreements or leases which the Company has with the Canadian Pacific Railway would have been renewed from time to time and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and\/or the National Capital Commission would not have made an application to the Board of Transport Commissioners to abandon the operation of that part of its Sussex Street Subdivision from mileage 1.2 to the end of the Subdivision at mileage 6.7, and\/or for abandonment of railway sidings used by the Company in connection therewith for ten years from the 24th day of March, A.D. 1964.\n2. The Commission on behalf of the Crown and the Company and the Landlord agree that the amount, if any, to be paid to the Company pursuant to the principles hereinafter mentioned shall be determined by the Exchequer Court of Canada pursuant to paragraph (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Exchequer Court Act.\n3: In the event that the Court determines that the Company is required to relocate its business as a result of the removal of the railway services, including the cancellation of the lease of land, if any, and other agreements with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company relating to railway services on the Sussex Street Subdivision, then the compensation to be paid shall be an amount which the Company, as a prudent owner, would pay rather than be forced to relocate and shall include all damages suffered by the owner by reason thereof.\n4. If the Court determines that the Company is not required to relocate its business then the compensation shall be an amount which a prudent owner would pay rather than lose such rail services and shall include business disturbance (which includes the cost of re\u2011adapting the plant) and the present value of any anticipated loss of profits.\n5. The parties agree that if the Company has no private siding agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company relating to rail- way services on the Sussex Street Subdivision, then no compensation shall be payable pursuant to the terms of this agreement unless:.\n(a) there is a team track located immediately adjacent to the lands and premises upon which the Company carries on its business operations; and\n(b) substantially all of the freight shipped or delivered by the Company is shipped or delivered by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and is loaded or unloaded at the team track referred to in subparagraph (a) hereof; and\n(c) the freight shipped or delivered to or from the Company\u2019s plant located on the said lands and premises is loaded or unloaded into and from the railway cars to the plant located on the said lands and premises without the necessity of loading or unloading into a truck or other vehicle;\nthen, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 hereof the amount of compensation payable pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be the amount which the Company, as a prudent owner, would pay rather than to lose the use of the team track and shall include increased costs of operating.\n6. The compensation, if any, shall be determined on the basis that the Company was the absolute owner of the lands and premises upon which the business operations are being carried on, and the amount of compensation so determined shall be apportioned by the Court as to the portion payable to the Company and the portion payable to the Landlord.\n7. The parties hereto agree that the compensation shall be determined as of the 24th day of March, A.D. 1964.\n8. The Commission on behalf of the Crown agrees to pay the Company and the Landlord the amount, if any, so determined.\n9. The parties hereto agree that costs, including those of expert witnesses, shall be at the discretion of the Court.\nIt will be noted that in para. 2 above, the parties agreed that the compensation should be determined by the Exchequer Court pursuant to para. (g) of s. 18(1) of the Exchequer Court Act. In order to obtain a fixation of such compensation the appellants issued a Petition of Right.\nThe agreement by which the appellants held the private railway siding rights was subject to cancellation on two months\u2019 notice if leave were granted by the Board of Transport Commissioners, and the lease of lands held by the appellants from the railway company provided for cancellation on one month\u2019s notice.\nThe learned Exchequer Court judge held, therefore, that the appellants\u2019 reasonable expectation of continuing possession of the said lands or of having siding agreement continued was not \u00e0 legal interest that could be considered in assessing compensation and, therefore, that clause 1 as recited above had the effect of creating such legal interest in both the siding agreement and the lease of lands, and fixing it with a duration of ten years, i.e., until March 24, 1974. Although it was submitted in argument that there was no basis for such a finding and that on the other hand the appellants might have continued to enjoy such siding rights and lease of lands for an indefinite period, I am of the opinion that, with respect, the learned Exchequer Court judge was correct and that it would be impossible to conceive of the appellants continuing their industry on the site which is the subject matter of this appeal for a period beyond March 1974. It would appear indeed that the provisions of the said para. 1 are generous.\nThe building is within 100 yards of Sussex Drive, a main driveway along the Ottawa River in this part of Ottawa There are very many public buildings in the area including the National Research Council and the new City Hall. It is proposed, and reference thereto was made in the evidence, to erect other prestige government buildings in the immediate area. The site is now covered by the provisions of By-law AZ-64 of the General Zoning By-laws of the City of Ottawa which restricts the use of the site to residential purposes and therefore the company was occupying it as a non-conforming use.\nIn all of the circumstances, therefore, the fixing of the ten-year period for the ascertainment of the compensation which would be due to the appellants was a proper decision.\nThe learned Exchequer Court judge conceived it as his task to determine whether the compensation would be payable under the provisions of para. 3 or of para. 4 aforesaid, and, with respect, correctly determined that in approaching the problem he should use the formula stated by this Court in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[2], as approved in Woods Mfg. Co. v. The King[3]. In the former case, Rand J., said at p. 715:\n\u2026the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nThe learned Exchequer Court judge, therefore, addressed himself to the task of determining whether compensation should be paid on the basis that the company was required to relocate its business as a result of the removal of the railway siding in which case such compensation would be the amount that a prudent man would pay rather than be forced to relocate, or whether the compensation would be payable the company not being required to relocate its business, in which latter case the amount would be what the prudent owner would pay rather than lose such rail service. The learned Exchequer Court judge found that if the company were forced to relocate the prudent owner would have paid rather than be forced to relocate the sum of $152,802.63 and that, on the other hand, if the appellants were not forced to relocate then the prudent man would have paid rather than lose the rail service the sum of $91,300. He also found that if the appellants had closed down their business entirely their loss would have been $225,000 which included goodwill and all other assets but no land and buildings. It was not physically impossible to carry on the enterprise without the railway siding services. Therefore, the learned Exchequer Court judge said the prudent owner would take the least costly of these three alternatives and the prudent owner not being required to relocate, the compensation would be payable in accordance with para. 4 of the agreement. Therefore, such compensation should be fixed at $91,300.\nIn argument on the appeal, it was submitted most forcefully that the learned Exchequer Court judge could not decide in this fashion whether or not the appellants were required to relocate but had to determine apart from the question of costs whether or not the appellants were required to relocate considering (a) the physical impossibility of carrying on their enterprise in the site without the siding, or equally (b) the additional cost of carrying on without the siding being such that the operating profit would be so reduced that no prudent owner would continue to operate its business under such circumstances.\nI am of the opinion that this criticism of the method used by the learned Exchequer Court judge is not sound. Certainly there was no physical impossibility in carrying on the business without the siding. It was, in fact, carried on without the siding for months after the abandonment of the same on June 15, 1964. If, as it was inevitable, the costs of operation of the business without the siding were increased then the present value of that increase in costs was the subject of the compensation which was to be fixed and was fixed by the Exchequer Court. Under such circumstances, the prudent owner, it is true, would receive a smaller net operating profit in each of the ten years between 1964 and 1974, but he would have to credit the net operating revenue with a portion of the compensation which he received. Therefore, the true return upon his investment would be not the $12,000 odd per year which the evidence accepted by the learned Exchequer Court judge proved it would be after the abandonment of the siding, but $12,000 odd per year plus the appropriate instalment from the compensation to make up the same net profit on the: investment which had accrued during the six years prior to the abandonment of the siding.\nIt is appropriate at this time to note that the learned Exchequer Court judge fixed this compensation after a lengthy trial at which he heard a very large number of witnesses who gave both factual and opinion evidence and that he was called upon to weigh and assess that evidence. The learned Exchequer Court judge, with respect, carried out that task and in his reasons for judgment, said:\nMr. Quayle\u2019s estimate was predicated in the main on two test railroad car unloadings done by Canadian Pacific Railway Company in 1964. These unloadings were obviously staged for the purpose of preparing for this hearing (see Exhibits P-2 to P-17). No care was taken to make either of them a representative sample of what might occur if the team track was regularly used for loading and unloading, and in my view, all the evidence predicated thereon is unreliable and I do not accept the conclusions from the calculations made thereon by Mr. Quayle. I also do not accept any conclusions from calculations made by Mr. Quayle from hearsay evidence of the operations of Florence Paper Company Limited given to him by officers of Florence Paper Company Limited. And in so far as the same is based on the evidence of Mr. Frank Florence given in the witness box, I say it is also unreliable, because he exaggerated the difficulties of the operation, and made extravagant and unconscionable claims for compensation, and minimized the obvious greater efficiency of the new plant on Sheffield Road.\nThis Court as long ago as 1890 in Vezina v. The Queen[4]said:\nIt must be an exceptional case in which, on a mere estimate of damage depending on appreciation of the evidence and the exercise of judgment, this court can be expected to interfere with the amount settled by the tribunal primarily charged with the inquiry, and which has facilities for arriving at a correct conclusion that are not possessed by the appellate court. Where the tribunal of first instance has proceeded on correct principles and does not appear to have overlooked or misapprehended any material fact, an appeal against the amount awarded will in most cases resemble an appeal against an assessment of damages in an action, which would be a hopeless proceeding unless some very special reason for the interference of the appellate court can be shown.\nThat statement was quoted with approval by Taschereau J., as he then was, in The King v. Elgin Realty Co. Ltd.[5].\nIn the decision of this Court delivered on January 24, 1967, in Robert A. Kramer v. The Wascana Centre Authority[6], I had occasion to say:\nIn my view, it is not the duty of this Court to engage in calculations or to exercise judgment as to land valuation in the Province of Saskatchewan. It is the duty of this Court to consider whether those calculations and assessment of land valuations were made in accordance with the proper and well recognized principle.\nIt is, therefore, my duty to consider the reasons of the learned Exchequer Court judge only for the purpose of determining whether he applied proper principles and not to attempt any recalculation of amounts, especially when the learned Exchequer Court judge\u2019s calculations depended on the weighing of the probative value of the evidence given before him.\nAs I have said, the learned Exchequer Court judge determined that the compensation which would be payable if the appellants were required to relocate was $152,802.63. If any of the submissions made in argument as to the appropriate costs had the appellants been required to relocate were successful they could only have the effect of increasing that amount and therefore making the discrepancy between that amount and the amount of compensation which the learned Exchequer Court judge found was payable, if the appellants were not required to relocate, the larger, and therefore make it even clearer that the appellants were not entitled to compensation on the basis of being required to relocate as outlined in para. 3 of the agreement. Therefore, it is my intention to consider the compensation which the learned Exchequer Court judge found to be payable on the basis of para. 4 of the said agreement the appellants not being required to relocate their business.\nThat amount was $91,300 which the learned Exchequer Court judge determined as follows. Upon consideration of the evidence adduced he accepted the estimate given by one James Ross, a chartered accountant called by the respondent who had been practising in the City of Ottawa and had been a chartered accountant since 1932. That evidence; was that the additional cost due to the loss of the railway siding services would be $16,100 per year including an amount of $5,000 per year for additional supervision, which amount would cover only incidental expenses not readily ascertainable in detail. He fixed the present value at 6 per cent of $16,100 annually for ten years at $118,500, and therefore found that the gross compensation would be that sum of $118,500. That compensation, however, had it come into the appellants\u2019 hands in the form of larger gross profits in each year would have been subject to income tax. Therefore, the learned Exchequer Court judge reduced the sum by an estimate of $27,200 so that he found the net compensation payable should be $91,300.\nIt was submitted by counsel for the appellants that this method of procedure was contrary to the decision of this Court in The Queen v. Jennings[7]. It is true that there Judson J., giving judgment for the Court upon the issue, expressly refused to follow the majority decision in British Transport Commission v. Gourlay[8], and held that in fixing compensation for physical injuries sustained by a plaintiff which affected his earning capacity there should not be any deduction made on account of income tax which the plaintiff might have been called upon to pay on the income which he might have received had he not sustained the injuries.\nI am not of the opinion that the decision of this Court in The Queen v. Jennings is applicable to exclude the deduction of income tax liability from the compensation payable to the appellants herein.\nHere, the task of the tribunal fixing the compensation was to place itself in the position of the prudent owner who would make a payment rather than lose the railway siding services. Any prudent company executive, in calculating the additional profits which his company would obtain if it continued to have the use of the railway siding, would immediately realize that such additional profits would be subject to income tax and therefore would be willing to pay, in order to continue to obtain those additional profits, only the net return to the company after allowing for such income tax as the company would have been required to pay. Otherwise, the prudent company executive would be making a payment of more than he can hope to recover by the additional profits, which would certainly not be prudent. I am, therefore, of the opinion the situation is not that in The Queen v. Jennings, and the course adopted by the learned Exchequer Court judge was a proper course.\nIn the Exchequer Court, counsel for the appellants advanced the argument that the Crown was estopped from alleging that the appellants were not required to relocate and that, therefore, the compensation must be calculated on the higher basis set out in para. 3 of the agreement. That argument was not advanced in this Court. If it were necessary to do so, I would simply adopt the reasons of the learned Exchequer Court judge who found that there was no representation within the meaning of that term as used in estoppel jurisprudence and that the appellants were free to make their decision to relocate or not and further that there was no intention on the part of the National Capital Commission to induce the appellants to relocate. The National Capital Commission offered to sell land to the appellants and to others who had lost their rail services at 20 per cent less than the market price. The appellants did take advantage of that offer and have relocated but I am in agreement with the view expressed by the learned Exchequer Court judge when he said:\nThere are many reasons why the suppliant, Florence Paper Company Limited, herein did not make this choice but, in my view, they are unrelated to the loss of the private railway siding and rail services. For example, they obviously were aware that they could not carry on forever relying on obtaining and using $1.05 to $1.65 labour. The evidence of Mr. Quayle was that there was only one person paid $1.65 and the others\u2019 wages ranged from $1.05 to $1.40 and that the wages paid by. Florence Paper Company Limited were 23.4% less than those paid in comparable industries in the Ottawa area. They obviously must have considered that they could not rely for too much longer on the \u201cbull gang\u201d as opposed to automation by using lift trucks, conveyor belts and other modern equipment. They knew that their Boteler Street plant could not be adapted to use this modern equipment. They knew that substantial functional depreciation, and economic depreciation had taken place. They also would consider that this cheaper site which they got at a most reasonable price from the National Capital Commission would in the long run effect further economies in rental alone. In addition, they knew that more economies would result because of the larger land area resulting in easier manoeuverability of incoming and outgoing trucks. They also knew that they could more efficiently handle paper in a new plant especially when they incorporated the new techniques carried out in other more modern plants in Canada and the United States in their new building and obtained the services of an architect to make certain that they had a modern efficient and more functional building. These are some, but there were undoubtedly many other reasons why they decided to relocate, which again are unrelated to the issue in this action.\nThe appellants also argue that they should be entitled to a 10 per cent increase of the compensation and that they should be allowed interest on the compensation from the date the appellants vacated the Boteler Street plant, i.e., December 1965. The question of 10 per cent increase of compensation was settled in this Court in Drew v. The Queen[9]. That percentage will only be allowed when there are special circumstances, i.e., when the loss suffered by the suppliants cannot be determined with complete accuracy. In this case, in my opinion, the learned Exchequer Court judge has determined the compensation with complete accuracy and therefore the situation in which the 10 per cent allowance may be made does not exist. In so far as the interest is concerned, in my view, s. 47(b) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, is a complete answer. That subsection provides:\n47. In adjudicating upon any claim arising out of any contract in writing the Court shall decide in accordance with the stipulations in such contract, and shall not allow\n* * *\n(b) interest on any sum of money that the court considers to be due to the claimant, in the absence of any contract in writing stipulating for payment of such interest or of a statute providing in such a case for the payment of interest by the Crown.\nThe appellants also submit that the Order of the Exchequer Court should have included a specific direction for the payment of the costs of obtaining the services of expert witnesses, and point out para. 9 of the agreement which reads as follows:\n9. The parties hereto agree that costs, including those of expert witnesses, shall be at the discretion of the Court.\nSuch a direction is not necessary. The Registrar of the Exchequer Court will tax the costs in accordance with the usual procedure and, in view of para. 9, will consider the appellants\u2019 claims for the costs of expert witnesses. In so far as the trial is concerned, the matter has been settled by the decision of the learned Exchequer Court judge as to set-off for costs since the trial occurred after the Confession of Judgment had been filed.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hughes, Laishley, Mullen & Touhey, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Cumyn, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, which dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal from re-assessments, for income tax purposes, of his income in the taxation years 1952, 1953 and 1954.\nThe appeal to this Court was heard jointly with the appeal of Norman R. Whittall, the father of the appellant.\nThe issue for determination in this case is the same as in the case of Norman R. Whittall[2], that is as to whether profits realized by the appellant, in this case, a total of $88,128.08, on the acquisition and sale of units of the St. John\u2019s Trust, and of shares of Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd., Yankee Princess Oils Ltd., and Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd., were income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3 and 4 and para. (e) of subs. (1) of s. 139 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, or represented a realization upon the disposition of an investment so as to constitute a capital gain.\nThe essential facts of this case are substantially similar to those of the case of Norman R. Whittall, but the amounts involved are less. Also the appellant in this case was a director and officer of St. John Oil & Gas Co. Ltd. and of Yankee Princess Oils Ltd., but was not a director of the other companies of which his father was a director and which are referred to in my reasons in the Norman R. Whittall case.\nThe appellant was a shareholder and officer of Ross Whittall Limited from 1950 to 1954, when it was wound up, and thereafter was an officer and director of Norman R. Whit-tall Limited, the successor company. He owned about 20 per cent of the equity capital of Ross Whittall Limited.\nThe development and acquisition of the appellant\u2019s interest in the St. John\u2019s Trust, Inland Natural Gas Co. Ltd., Yankee Princess Oils Ltd. and Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. were similar to those detailed in my reasons in the Norman R. Whittall case.\nThe conclusions of the learned trial judge in this case were as follows:\nFor the reasons given in the case of Norman R. Whittall v. The Minister of National Revenue, the general finding that these transactions were trading operations as part of the business is applicable in this case, and also because of the particular fiduciary relationships of the appellant with certain of these companies and their shareholders in his capacity as director thereof, I find that these transactions in these securities did not constitute \u201cordinary\u201d investments, and therefore, I am of opinion that the profits realized from the sales of the securities more particularly set out in the reassessment notices for 1952, 1953 and 1954 were profits from a business within the meaning of section 3 of the Income Tax Act, and that the Minister was right in including it in the assessment.\nWhat I said in the Norman R. Whittall[3] case regarding the ground based upon the appellant\u2019s fiduciary relationship to the companies of which he was a director applies also in this case. There is no evidence of any breach of the duty owed by the appellant as a director of those companies. There was, however, ample evidence to justify the conclusion that the transactions involved were trading operations as part of a business, within s. 139(1)(e) of the Act.\nFor that reason, in my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell & Dumoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

I960, c. 111, s. 1].\nThe respondents FW and MW sustained injuries in a collision between their automobile and an automobile driven by JD, who died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident. Letters of administration were granted in the estate of the deceased and some six months later the administrator was discharged after having administered the estate and passed his accounts. Subsequently, the respondents obtained an order under s. 33a of The Trustee Act of Alberta appointing the Public Trustee, who consented thereto, administrator ad litem of the estate of JD, for the purposes of a suit to be commenced by the respondents against the estate of JD. Following the making of this order an action was commenced by FW and MW against the. Public Trustee as administrator ad litem as aforesaid. On an application by the Public Trustee to discharge the said order, it was held that the application should be dismissed and this decision was affirmed, on appeal, by the Appellate Division. The Public Trustee then appealed to this Court. The appeal having come on for hearing the question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction was raised from the Bench and argument was heard on that question. Counsel for the appellant asked that, if the Court should come to the conclusion that it did not have jurisdiction, leave to appeal should be granted and the Court heard counsel on that question also.\nHeld: The appeal should be quashed and leave to appeal should be refused.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], affirming an order of Milvain J. Appeal quashed and leave to appeal refused.\nW.G. Chipman, Q.C., for the appellant.\nWilliam A. Stevenson, for the respondents.\nOn the conclusion of the argument, the following judgment was delivered.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1 pronounced on February 8, 1967, affirming the order of Milvain J., made on April 18, 1966, dismissing an application by the Public Trustee, Administrator ad litem of the estate of John Drozd, deceased, to discharge an order made by Cairns J., on December 10, 1964, appointing the Public Trustee Administrator ad litem of the estate of John Drozd, deceased, \u201cfor the purposes of a suit to be commenced by Frank Weisbrod and Mary Weisbrod against the estate of John Drozd, deceased\u201d.\nThe last-mentioned order of Cairns J. recites that counsel for the Public Trustee had consented to the making of the order.\nFollowing the making of the order of Cairns J. an action was commenced by Frank Weisbrod and Mary Weisbrod against the Public Trustee as Administrator ad litem as aforesaid. The notice of motion before Milvain J. to set aside the order of Cairns J. was styled in that action but Milvain J. gave leave to amend and did amend the style of cause to read as follows:\n\u201cIN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JOHN DROZD, DECEASED, AND IN THE MATTER OF THE TRUSTEE ACT, BEING CHAPTER 346 OF THE REVISED STATUTES OF ALBERTA, 1955, AND THE AMENDMENTS THERETO:\nBETWEEN:\nFRANK WEISBROD and MARY WEISBROD,\nAPPLICANTS\nAND\nTHE PUBLIC TRUSTEE, ADMINISTRATOR AD LITEM, OF THE ESTATE OF JOHN DROZD, DECEASED,\nRESPONDENT\u201d\nThis was the style of cause used in the application before Cairns J.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing the question of our jurisdiction was raised from the Bench and we had the benefit of full argument on that question. Mr. Chipman asked that, if we should come to the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction, leave to appeal should be granted and we heard counsel on that question also.\nWe have all reached the conclusion that we do not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nThe only question directly raised is whether the order of Cairns J. appointing the Public Trustee to be Administrator ad litem should stand. That order is not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as defined in s. 2(b) of the Supreme Court Act reading as follows:\n2. (b) \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means any judgment, rule, order or decision that determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding;\nThe order of Cairns J. does not determine in whole or in part any substantive right of the parties in the judicial proceeding which was before him. The question raised was as to a matter of procedure rather than one of substance.\nIt is difficult also to see how an order made on consent can be said to determine a matter \u201cin controversy\u201d. In view of the wording of s. 33a of The Trustee Act of Alberta it is at least arguable that the order of Cairns J. was a discretionary order and that consequently we are deprived of jurisdiction by subs. (1) of s. 44 of the Act.\nAssuming for the moment that, contrary to the views we have expressed, the order of Cairns J. was a final judgment within the meaning of the Act and was not discretionary, we are of opinion that we are without jurisdiction because there is no amount or value in controversy in this judicial proceeding. It is not sufficient that the judgment sought to be appealed will have an effect on the pending action against the Administrator ad litem. No amount is directly involved.\nFor all these reasons we conclude that we are without jurisdiction.\nAfter a careful consideration of all that was said by counsel on the application for leave to appeal we are unanimously of opinion that this is a case in which leave to appeal ought not to be granted. The appeal is quashed for lack of jurisdiction with costs as of a motion to quash.\nThe application for leave to appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs; application for leave to appeal refused without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Emery, Jamieson, Chipman, Sinclair, Agrios & Emery, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Agrios, Edmonton.\n[1] (1967), 59 W.W.R. 96.\n",

The land owner transferred to the appellant his interest in the mineral rights, including the benefits from his lease, in return for one share of the appellant\u2019s capital stock for each acre transferred and also a trust certificate as evidence that the appellant thereafter held in trust for the land owner one fifth of the mines and minerals and the benefits therefrom. When oil was discovered in 1955, many of the land owners instituted actions in the Courts for declarations that the agreements had been induced by fraudulent misrepresentations and were therefore void. About 250 such actions were begun. The appellant successfully defended these actions. A royal commission recommended that a Board be constituted for the purpose of achieving the renegotiation of the contracts, if possible. The appellant sought to deduct from its income for the years 1959 and 1960 the legal expenses it incurred in defence of its title to the minerals, as well as those involved in opposing legislation proposed by the royal commission and in making representations to the Board. The appellant argued that these legal expenses were deductible as having been incurred to protect a right to income. The trial judge confirmed the Minister\u2019s position that they were not deductible and held that they were a payment on account of capital.\nA second issue in this appeal involved an arrangement between the appellant and Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd., a major shareholder in the appellant company, which had acquired a beneficial interest in certain Crown petroleum and natural gas permits held jointly by other companies. The owners of these permits had covenanted that all drilling and exploration costs would be shared by them in proportion to their respective interests. By its agreement with Scurry-Rainbow Oil Co., the appellant agreed to pay all such costs incurred by the former company in return for a percentage of the joint permits. The question in issue was as to whether the moneys so paid by the appellant were deductible as being \u201cdrilling and exploration expenses\u201d incurred within the meaning of s. 83A(3) of the Act. The trial judge held that they were not deductible. The company appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the Legal Expenses.\nThe object and purpose of the lawsuits was to compel the restoration to the land owners of the mineral rights purchased by the appellant. Those rights were items of fixed capital and were so regarded by the appellant. The legal costs of the litigation were incurred to preserve capital assets and therefore s. 12(1) (b) of the Act prevented their deduction. This case could not be distinguished from the case of M.N.R. v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 19. The same consideration applied in respect to the legal expenses involved in opposing the proposed legislation and in appearing before the Board.\nAs to the Exploration Costs.\nThe payments made by the appellant were not in respect of expenses which it had incurred in respect of exploration or drilling. They were payments of expenses which had been incurred by another and were made, not to meet a liability of the appellant for the cost of exploration or drilling, but made for the acquisition of an interest in the lands. In these circumstances, the payments could not be deducted under s. 83A(3) of the Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales encourues pour d\u00e9fendre titre \u00e0 des droits min\u00e9raux\u2014Paiements en vertu d\u2019un contrat de d\u00e9penses de forage et d\u2019exploration\u2014Sont-ils d\u00e9ductibles-Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 12(1)(a), (b), 83A(3).\nA la suite de son incorporation en 1949, la compagnie appelante a acquis des droits miniers des propri\u00e9taires de terrains qui avaient ant\u00e9rieurement lou\u00e9 \u00e0 des compagnies d\u2019huile les droits au p\u00e9trole et au gaz naturel s\u2019y trouvant. Ces propri\u00e9taires ont transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats dans les droits miniers, ainsi que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices relevant de leurs baux, moyennant une action du capital de l\u2019appelante pour chaque acre c\u00e9d\u00e9 et aussi un certificat de fiducie comme preuve que l\u2019appelante d\u00e9tenait dor\u00e9navant en fiducie pour le propri\u00e9taire du terrain un cinqui\u00e8me des mines et des min\u00e9raux ainsi que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices en d\u00e9coulant. Lorsque l\u2019on fit la d\u00e9couverte d\u2019huile en 1955, plusieurs des propri\u00e9taires des terrains ont institu\u00e9 des actions devant les Cours pour faire d\u00e9clarer que les contrats pass\u00e9s avec l\u2019appelante avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus par des repr\u00e9sentations frauduleuses et \u00e9taient en cons\u00e9quence nuls. 250 de ces actions furent institu\u00e9es, et la compagnie appelante s\u2019est d\u00e9fendue avec succ\u00e8s. Une Commission royale a recommand\u00e9 la constitution d\u2019une R\u00e9gie dans le but de ren\u00e9gocier les contrats, si possible. La compagnie appelante a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire de son revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 1959 et 1960 les d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales encourues pour d\u00e9fendre son titre aux min\u00e9raux ainsi que celles encourues pour combattre la l\u00e9gislation propos\u00e9e par la commission royale et pour faire des repr\u00e9sentations devant la R\u00e9gie. L\u2019appelante a soutenu que ces d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales \u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues pour prot\u00e9ger un droit \u00e0 un revenu. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a confirm\u00e9 la position prise par le Ministre \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9ductibles et a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient un paiement \u00e0 compte de capital.\nUne deuxi\u00e8me question dans cet appel se rapportait \u00e0 une entente entre l\u2019appelante et Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd., un actionnaire principal de la\n[page 61]\ncompagnie appelante, qui avait acquis un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans certaines licences de p\u00e9trole et de gaz naturel d\u00e9tenues en commun par d\u2019autres compagnies. Les propri\u00e9taires, de ces licences avaient convenu que tous les frais de forage et d\u2019exploration seraient partag\u00e9s par eux en proportion de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats respectifs. En vertu de son entente avec Scurry-Rainbow Oil Co., la compagnie appelante a. convenu de payer tous les frais encourus par la premi\u00e8re compagnie moyennant un pourcentage dans les licences communes. La question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre \u00e9tait de savoir si les sommes pay\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles comme \u00e9tant des \u00abd\u00e9penses de forage et d\u2019exploration\u00bb d\u00e9bours\u00e9es dans le sens de l\u2019art. 83A(3) de la Loi. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9ductibles. La compagnie en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Quant aux d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales.\nL\u2019objet et le but des poursuites judiciaires \u00e9taient de forcer la restitution, en faveur des propri\u00e9taires des terrains, des droits min\u00e9raux que l\u2019appelante avait obtenus. Ces droits \u00e9taient un item de capital fixe et \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ainsi par l\u2019appelante. Les frais l\u00e9gaux des proc\u00e8s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus pour prot\u00e9ger des biens en capital et, en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019art. 12(1) (b) de la Loi en emp\u00eachait la d\u00e9duction. On ne peut pas distinguer cette cause de celle de M.N.R. v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd., [1941] R.C.S. 19. La m\u00eame r\u00e8gle devait s\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales encourues pour combattre la l\u00e9gislation propos\u00e9e et pour compara\u00eetre devant la R\u00e9gie.\nQuant aux frais d\u2019exploration.\nLes paiements faits par l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle avait encourues relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exploration ou le forage. Il s\u2019agissait de paiements de d\u00e9penses qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues par une autre compagnie et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, non pas pour rencontrer une obligation de l\u2019appelante de payer les frais de l\u2019exploration ou du forage, mais plut\u00f4t pour acqu\u00e9rir un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans un terrain. Dans ces circonstances, les paiements ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre d\u00e9duits sous l\u2019art. 83A(3) de la Loi.\nAPPELS de deux jugements du Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Appels rejet\u00e9s.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeals dismissed.\nJ.H. Laycraft, Q.C., and Sheldon Chumir, for the appellant,\nD.G.H. Bowman and J. London, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014These are appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court[2] which refused to permit the appellant, in computing its income, in the years 1959 and 1960, to deduct, in respect of legal expenses, the respective amounts of $80.10 and $10,623.43, and in respect of expenses claimed by the appellant as exploration and drilling expenses, the respective amounts of $53,273.38 and $143,-581.10.\nThe facts involved in respect of these two matters are distinct from each other, so I will deal with each of the items separately.\nLegal Expenses:\u2018\nThe appellant was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan on December 1, 1949, for the object, inter alia, of acquiring mineral rights and exploring for petroleum and natural gas.\nFollowing its incorporation the appellant began a vigorous and successful campaign to acquire mineral rights from land owners. The system followed by the appellant was to acquire the fee simple title to minerals from land owners who had previously granted leases of their petroleum and natural gas rights to major oil producing companies. Those leases were uniform and standard. They were for a period of ten years providing to the land owner an annual rent of ten cents per acre and reserving a royalty of 12\u00bd percent to the land owner in the event of a producing well or wells being brought into existence.\nThe land owner transferred to the appellant his entire estate and interest in the mineral rights, including all benefits from the existing lease. In return, he received one share of the capital stock of the appellant for each acre transferred and a trust certificate as evidence that the appellant thereafter held in trust for him one-fifth of the mines and minerals and the benefits therefrom.\nIn this manner the appellant acquired the mineral rights in approximately 750,000 acres in Saskatchewan and issued approximately 2,500 trust certificates. The appellant received as income four-fifths of the rentals payable thereon and four-fifths of any royalties from producing lands.\nIn 1955 when oil was discovered in south eastern Saskatchewan many of the land owners instituted actions in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Saskatchewan for declarations that the agreements between them and the appellant were induced by fraudulent misrepresentation and were accordingly void, and for orders revesting in the land owners the mineral rights and the interest in the leases which had been transferred and assigned to the appellant. In all about 250 such actions were begun, the pleadings being virtually identical in all cases.\nThe appellant successfully defended such of those actions as came to trial so that it remained possessed of the mineral rights and benefits under the contracts above described. None of the lands involved nor any of the actions commenced were lost by the appellant nor did the appellant lose any of the income which it was receiving from the lands. The legal expenses so incurred by the appellant constitute part of the amounts that were claimed by it as a deduction from income and that were disallowed by the Minister.\nAfter the appellant had succeeded in some cases in the courts, many of the land owners formed a mineral owners\u2019 protective association to advocate and obtain legislative relief. A \u201cRoyal Commission on Certain Mineral Transactions\u201d was appointed by the Saskatchewan Government to inquire into allegations that many owners of freehold mineral rights in Saskatchewan had been deprived of such rights by means of fraud or misrepresentation. This Commission recommended that a Board be constituted for the purpose of achieving, if possible, the voluntary re-negotiation of contracts whereby the owners were deprived of their freehold mineral rights through misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent.\nThe Mineral Contracts Re-negotiation Act, 1959, was enacted to implement the recommendations of the Commission. Further legislation of a similar tenor was proposed in 1960.\nThe appellant employed counsel to make representations on its behalf opposing the proposed legislation, suggesting variations in the terms thereof and making representations to the Board later established pursuant to legislation enacted with respect to contracts entered into by it which were sought to be re-negotiated.\nThe learned trial judge confirmed the Minister\u2019s position and held that the legal expenses incurred were a \u201cpayment on account of capital\u201d made \u201cwith a view of preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade\u201d.\nThe decision of the learned trial judge was based upon the judgment of this Court in Minister of National Revevenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited[3]. Counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish the Dominion case and also contended, in the alternative, that that case would have been decided differently today on the same facts in view of changes which have since occurred in the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act.\nThe relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, are as follows:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaming or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part,\n\u2026\nSection 12(1) (a) and (b) were derived from s. 6(1) (a) and (b) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, which provided as follows:\n6. (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nCounsel for the appellant advanced the proposition that legal expenses incurred to protect a right to income are deductible regardless of whether the protection of that right also involves preserving a capital asset. The appellant, he said, immediately upon its acquisition of title to the mineral rights from a land owner had the right to receive and retain as its income four-fifths of the acreage rental payable by the lessee of the mineral rights. The legal expenses incurred were to protect that income. In the Dominion case, that which was protected was a franchise which, in itself, did not produce income.\nIn my opinion, this proposition is not valid, because it is directly contrary to the intent of paras. (a) and (b) of s. 12 when read together. To be deductible for tax purposes an outlay must satisfy at least two basic tests:\n(1) It must be made for the purpose of gaining or producing income (s. 12(1)(a)).\n(2) It must not be a payment on account of capital (S.12(1)(b)).\nBoth of these tests must be satisfied concurrently to justify deductibility. In British Columbia Electric Railway Company v. Minister of National Revenue[4], Abbott J. said at p. 137:\nSince the main purpose of every business undertaking is presumably to make a profit, any expenditure made \u201cfor the purpose of gaining or producing income\u201d comes within the terms of s. 12(1) (a) whether it be classified as an income expense or a capital outlay.\nOnce it is determined that a particular expenditure is one made for the purpose of gaining or producing income, in order to compute income tax liability it must next be determined whether such disbursement is an income expense or a capital outlay.\nIt can certainly be said that the appellant, in resisting the lawsuits launched against it, was seeking to protect its income, because it was seeking to protect the assets from which its income was derived. It can, therefore, be argued that the expenses were properly deductible under s. 12(1)(a). This is not contested by the respondent. The object and purpose of the lawsuits, however, was to compel the restoration to the land owners of the mineral rights which the appellant had purchased. The learned trial judge has found, and the evidence establishes, that those rights were items of fixed capital, and were so regarded by the appellant. At the time the litigation occurred, the sum total of the mineral rights acquired by the appellant, all of which were of the kind involved in the litigation, represented all of the appellant\u2019s capital assets. The appellant did not trade in them, but intended to retain them perpetually.\nIt was to protect those capital assets from attack that the legal costs of the litigation were incurred, and, to quote the words of Dixon J. (later Chief Justice) in Hallstroms Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[5], referring to the costs of defending title to land:\nNext to the outlay of purchase money and conveyancing expense in acquiring the title to land, it would be hard to find a form of expenditure in relation to property more characteristically of a capital nature.\nThe fact that the leases acquired by the appellant, along with the mineral rights, were more immediately connected with the production of income than was the franchise involved in the Dominion case does not affect the matter in principle. It is relevant in relation to the application of s. 12(1) (a), but in relation to s. 12(1) (b) we must ask the question, was this outlay for the purpose of preserving a capital asset? In my opinion it clearly was and, if that is so, s. 12(1) (b) prevents its deduction.\nWith respect to the second submission respecting the Dominion case, while s. 12(1) (a) of the present Act is less restrictive than was s. 6(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, s. 12(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act is essentially the same as was s. 6(1) (b) of the Income War Tax Act. In my opinion, for the reasons which I gave in the recent case of British Columbia Power Corporation Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[6], the Dominion case has established the proposition that legal expense incurred with a view of preserving an asset of advantage for the enduring benefit of the trade is a capital expenditure and is not deductible.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the legal expenses involved in opposing the proposed legislation and in appearing before the Board created by such legislation are subject to the same considerations. They are not different in kind from the costs of the litigation in the courts. Exploration and Drilling Expense\nScurry-Rainbow Oil Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cScurry\u201d, became a major shareholder in the appellant. Scurry was the successor in title to Canadian Pipe Line Producers Ltd. in respect of an agreement, dated May 19, 1954, to which the latter company was a party along with Canada Southern Petroleum Ltd., West Canadian Petroleum Ltd., Trans Empire Oils Ltd. and British Empire Oil Co. Ltd. Under the terms of that agreement the entire legal and beneficial interest in certain Crown petroleum and natural gas permits covering approximately 1,500,000 acres in British Columbia would be held jointly by the parties. The beneficial interest acquired by Scurry was 22 percent of the reservations covered by the agreement.\nCanada Southern Petroleum Ltd. had been named as manager-operator under the terms of the agreement, but it was succeeded by Phillips Petroleum Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cPhillips\u201d. Under the agreement the parties agreed to conduct a seismic program, and, contingent upon its results, to drill a well for the joint account and at the joint expense of the parties in proportion to their interests. The manager-operator was given sole and exclusive management and control of the exploration, drilling and production operations on the land.\nThe parties had the right to receive progress information and to inspect and examine the books and records of the manager-operator. There was also provision for meetings and consultation and for surrender, sale or assignment of all or part of a party\u2019s interest in the lands.\nParagraph 11 of the agreement governed the matter of costs and expenses:\n11. COSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe parties hereto mutually covenant and agree with one another that all exploration costs, drilling costs, completion costs, abandonment costs, production costs, and all other costs and expenses of every nature and kind chargeable to the joint account hereunder incurred in respect to any and all operations carried on hereunder in respect to any of the lands described in the Permits set out in Schedule \u201cA\u201d shall be borne and paid by the parties hereto in proportion to their respective interest in the lands and Permits upon which such exploration, drilling or producing operations are carried on, as such interests appear in Schedule \u201cB\u201d hereof. Subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, Manager-Operator shall initially advance and pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the said lands and shall charge the Joint-Operators with their proportionate share thereof upon the cost and expense basis provided for in the attached Accounting Procedure. Joint-Operators agree that they will promptly reimburse the Manager-Operator for Joint-Operators\u2019 proportionate share of all such costs and expenses within the time limited by the said Accounting Procedure.\nOn January 2, 1959, Scurry and the appellant entered into an agreement, which, after certain preliminary recitals referring to the agreement of May 19, 1954, read as follows:\nAND WHEREAS the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement whereby Farmers Mutual shall have the right to acquire certain interests in the said lands subject to the terms and conditions as hereinafter provided.\nNOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that Farmers Mutual hereby agreed to pay all costs which may be incurred by Scurry-Rainbow in the performance of its obligations with respect to the seismic program referred to herein. Scurry-Rainbow agrees that upon the completion of the said seismic program on the said lands and the payment by Farmers Mutual of all costs which would have been incurred by Scurry\u2011Rainbow on this seismic program, Farmers Mutual shall have earned an undivided Three (3%) Percent interest in the said lands and the interests owned by Scurry-Rainbow and Farmers Mutual shall thereafter be:\nSCURRY-RAINBOW OIL LIMITED\n9% interest\nFARMERS MUTUAL PETROLEUMS LTD\n3% interest\nScurry-Rainbow agrees to execute any and all further documents required in order to vest the interest aforesaid in Farmers Mutual in the event that the seismic program herein is completed. After Farmers Mutual shall have earned the Three (3%) Percent interest referred to herein, Scurry-Rainbow agrees to grant and hereby grants to Farmers Mutual the option to earn an additional Eight (8%) Percent interest in the said lands on the condition that Farmers Mutual agrees to pay and pays Scurry-Rainbow\u2019s entire cost of drilling the well referred to herein. After the said well shall have been drilled and Scurry-Rainbow\u2019s share of the costs paid by Farmers Mutual, Scurry-Rainbow agrees to execute any and all further documents required in order to vest the Eight (8%) Percent interest in Farmers Mutual.\nUnder the terms of the 1954 agreement, Phillips, as manager-operator, conducted a seismic program and carried on a drilling program. Phillips invoiced Scurry for its proportionate share of these expenses. On receipt of an invoice, Scurry would usually send an invoice to the appellant for the amount Scurry was required to pay to Phillips, and Scurry would pay Phillips. On two occasions Scurry sent the Phillips\u2019 invoice to the appellant, which paid Phillips directly.\nOn October 5, 1959, the appellant elected to exercise its option, under its agreement with Scurry, to earn the additional 8 per cent interest in the lands by paying Scurry\u2019s entire cost of drilling the Well. Section 83A(3) of the Income Tax Act, at the relevant times, provided as follows:\n83A. (3) A corporation whose principal business is\n(a) production, refining or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas, or exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas, or\n(b) mining or exploring for minerals, may deduct, in computing its income under this Part for a taxation year, the lesser of\n(c) the aggregate of such of\n(i) the drilling and exploration expenses, including all general geological and geophysical expenses, incurred by it on or in respect of exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in Canada, and\n(ii) the prospecting, exploration and development expenses incurred by it in searching for minerals in Canada, as were incurred after the calendar year 1952 and before the end of the taxation year, to the extent that they were not deductible in computing income for a previous taxation year, or\n(d) of that aggregate, an amount equal to its income for the taxation year\n(i) if no deduction were allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 11, and\n(ii) if no deduction were allowed under this section, minus the deductions allowed for the year by subsections (1), (2) and (8a) of this section and by section 28.\nThe question in issue is as to whether the moneys paid by the appellant pursuant to its agreement with Scurry were deductible in computing the appellant\u2019s income tax, as being \u201cdrilling and exploration expenses\u2026 incurred by-it on or in respect of exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in Canada\u201d. The learned trial judge held that they were not deductible by the appellant. His reasons for so holding are summarized in his judgment as follows:\nThe submission on behalf of the appellant, as I understand it, is that by the agreement between Scurry and the appellant dated January 2, 1959 the appellant reimbursed Scurry for its outlay for exploration and drilling expenses. Since an expense cannot be incurred by a party who is truly reimbursed, therefore it cannot be said that the expenses were incurred by Scurry but rather they must have been incurred by the appellant which was out of pocket in the precise amount of the expenses and that Scurry was merely the conduit between the appellant and the manager-operator.\nIn my opinion the agreement between Scurry and the appellant is not susceptible of such interpretation. The substance of that transaction, as I see it, was that the appellant purchased an interest in lands from Scurry and that the price to be paid therefor was determined and measured by the cost of the exploration and drilling expenses incurred by Scurry. It was a condition precedent to any payment to Scurry by the appellant that Scurry should have incurred exploration and drilling expenses and I can entertain no doubt that the money paid by the appellant to Scurry was in consideration for a transfer of an interest in land from Scurry to the appellant although that consideration was measured by the yardstick of the costs incurred by Scurry. What Scurry received was payment for an asset sold by it to the appellant and accordingly Scurry was not reimbursed for the exploration expenses incurred by it. Conversely what the appellant paid for and received was the transfer of an interest in lands and therefore did not pay for exploration and drilling expenses.\nI am in agreement with these conclusions. Exploration and drilling expenses were incurred in respect of the work carried on by Phillips as manager-operator under the 1954 agreement. This work was done by Phillips on behalf of all the parties to that agreement as well as on behalf of itself, and a portion of the expense was incurred by Phillips, as agent for Scurry.\nThe 1954 agreement contained provision for an assignment of interest by the parties to it, but there was no assignment of interest effected by Scurry in favour of the appellant. The appellant did not acquire any contractual rights under that agreement, and Phillips had no right to require the appellant to assume any obligation to pay any part of the exploration and drilling expenses which, as manager-operator, Phillips had incurred.\nThe 1959 agreement between Scurry and the appellant, after referring to the 1954 agreement, recites that the parties \u201cdesire to enter this agreement whereby Farmers Mutual shall have the right to acquire certain interests in the said lands\u201d. The obligation of the appellant was to pay \u201call costs which may be incurred by Scurry in the performance of its obligations with respect to the seismic program referred to herein\u201d. The appellant was thereby to acquire a 3 percent interest in the lands. It also obtained an option to earn an additional 8 percent interest by paying Scurry\u2019s entire cost of drilling the well.\nThe position is, therefore, that the appellant did not itself incur exploration or drilling costs in respect of land in which it had an interest. What it did do was to pay for a contractual right to acquire an interest in lands on which exploration and drilling had taken place by paying expenses already incurred by Scurry in connection therewith. The payments made by the appellant were not in respect of expenses which it had incurred in respect of exploration or drilling. They were payments of expenses which had been incurred by another and were made, not to meet a liability of the appellant for the cost of exploration or drilling, but made for the acquisition of an interest in the lands.\nIn these circumstances, in my opinion, the payments made by the appellant cannot be deducted, under s. 83A(3), in computing its income for tax purposes.\nIn my opinion, both appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chambers, Saucier, Jones, Peacock, Black, Gain & Stratton, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Tosta et al., [1968] S.C.R. 71\nDate: 1967-11-27\nGeorge Vana (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nStanley Tosta and Boleslaw Laxarewicz (Defendants) Respondents.\n1967: March 20; 1967: November 27.\nPresent: Cartwright, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nDamages\u2014Motor vehicle accident\u2014Wife killed and husband and children injured\u2014Defendants liable\u2014Assessment of damages\u2014Factors considered\u2014The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138.\nAs a result of a collision between the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle and that of the defendant T, the plaintiff\u2019s wife, aged 37, was killed; their children (\u00e0 daughter, aged 12, and a son, aged 9) sustained comparatively slight injuries and the plaintiff himself, aged 47, was seriously injured. In an action arising out of the accident, the trial judge found that at the time of the collision T\u2019s car was being driven by the defendant L in a wanton and reckless manner. He awarded the plaintiff on his own behalf and as next friend for his children a total sum of $49,720. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was confined entirely to the quantum of damages. That Court reduced the damages awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, from $20,000 to $10,000 for the plaintiff; from $10,000 to $2,000 for his daughter and from $5,000 to $1,500 for his son, and also reduced the award for personal injuries of the plaintiff from $10,000 to $8,500. An appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed. Per curiam: The trial judge had not acted on any wrong principle of law when he took the element of \u201cnervous shock\u201d into consideration in awarding damages for the appellant\u2019s personal injuries and there was evidence to support his view in this regard. As the only ground upon which the Court of Appeal interfered with the general damage award was the inclusion of \u201cnervous shock\u201d as a factor for which the appellant was entitled to be compensated, this was a case in which the proper course was to restore the award of $10,000 made by the trial judge.\nPer Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ.: With respect to the award to the appellant under The Fatal Accidents Act, the award of the trial judge was excessive and not justified by the evidence. In reducing the award by $10,000 the Court of Appeal erred in placing too much emphasis on the possibility of remarriage and in taking into account any services the appellant\u2019s mother and mother-in-law might contribute to maintaining the home. Also, the case could not be considered as one where the earnings of the wife which she retained for herself were quite apart from any contribution made by her husband for her support, but rather as one where her earnings in part contributed to her support as well as to that of the balance of the family and the loss of those earnings was, therefore, a pecuniary loss to the husband. After reviewing the evidence as a whole, and giving due weight to the possible remarriage, remote as it might be, and what it would cost to hire a housekeeper and the other factors involved, the conclusion was reached that an award of $14,000 should be made.\nThe case of St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett (1885), 11 S.C.R. 422, established that the children under the circumstances suffered the pecuniary loss from their mother\u2019s early death without the care, education and training (and also the guidance, example and encouragement) which only a mother can give. To allow damages under these circumstances attributable to such pecuniary loss of only $1,000 to a girl of 12 years of age and $500 to a boy of 9 years of age (these amounts being the net result of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment) was a \u201cpurely conventional assessment\u201d and was, therefore, an error in principle. The amount of the award for this loss to the daughter should be increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and to the son from $500 to $1,000, resulting in the total award to the daughter under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act being fixed at $3,000 and the total award to the son under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act being fixed at $2,000. The award of the trial judge in the sums of $10,000 and $5,000 was unreasonable in that it was so \u201cinordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d.\nPer Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal\u2019s reduction of the trial judge\u2019s award for the appellant\u2019s damages under The Fatal Accidents Act from $20,000 to $10,000 should not be interfered with. The trial judge erred in principle in including factors which could not properly be classified as pecuniary loss and he failed to allow for certain contingencies of life, including the possibility that the appellant might remarry.\nWith regard to the damages awarded to the children, the Court of Appeal appeared to have concluded that the trial judge erred in principle by failing to confine himself to the actual evidence of pecuniary loss suffered by the children in the loss of their mother when he made his award to them for that loss. There was no, error in principle in the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal and the award it suggested in respect of the loss of the care and guidance of the mother was appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.\n[St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v.

(unreported), referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], varying a judgment of Haines J. Appeal allowed, Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part.\nR.G. Phelan, Q.C., and E.A. Sabol, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., R.J. Rolls and J.F. Evans, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have read the reasons for judgment of Ritchie J. and I am in complete agreement therewith in so far as they concern the restoration of the trial judge\u2019s award to the appellant which was attributable to nervous shock.\nThe Court of Appeal reduced by $10,000 the amount awarded the appellant under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138. The learned trial judge had awarded $20,000. The Court found that Haines J. did not take into account the possibility that the appellant might remarry and that he had no intention of hiring a housekeeper excepting his own mother to whom he had promised $30 a week as and when he could afford it. He was in debt due to the accident and unable then to pay anything. The mother was 75 years of age. On any basis, her usefulness as a housekeeper would be limited and of short duration. The Court also took into account that the appellant\u2019s mother-in-law who lived nearby and was then 62 years of age could be of assistance.\nThe possibility of remarriage is a limited one and should not be overemphasized in arriving at the amount to be awarded. There are many eventualities to be taken into consideration. Speaking of the appellant, the learned trial judge said:\n\u2026In the accident he suffered extensive injuries to his spine. The eleventh thoracic vertebra was moved forward on the twelfth thoracic vertebra and remains in this position. The first lumbar vertebra (which is immediately below the twelfth thoracic vertebra) was crushed to the extent of 20 to 25%. The second lumbar vertebra was driven downwards into the third lumbar vertebra, leaving a permanent dent or depression in the third lumbar vertebra. This is seen readily in the x\u2011rays. The intervertebral space between the second and third vertebrae was damaged and narrowed.\nHe also held, and the evidence fully supports the finding, that the appellant will eventually require a spinal fusion\u2014surgery in which he must accept a failure rate of 5 to 15 per cent and, pending this surgery, will undergo back pain. This pain in time will become unbearable to be relieved only by the spinal fusion which when done will incapacitate him for seven months. The likelihood of remarriage seems very remote in these circumstances. It was of this man that the trial judge said:\nFinally, I must consider the matter of remarriage. I have seen the plaintiff and have studied him closely throughout the trial. I think remarriage unlikely.\nMacKay J.A. said:\nThe learned trial Judge refused to take into consideration the possibility of the remarriage of the Plaintiff husband. I can find nothing in the evidence that would warrant this conclusion.\n(The italics are mine.)\nHaines J. did not, as the record shows, refuse to take into consideration the possibility of remarriage. He said, \u201cI think remarriage unlikely\u201d and in the circumstances outlined above I agree with him. The appellant was not questioned as to his intentions in this regard either in chief or on cross-examination. At the time of the trial he was going on 48 years of age with two young children, a girl thirteen and a boy eleven. The accident happened August 18, 1963. The appeal was heard on April 23, 1965. The appellant had not remarried nor is it suggested that he has done so to date.\nIn my view, the respect accorded to the assessment made by the trial judge extends considerably beyond the question of credibility and his observation of the plaintiff during the course of the trial which he would apply to the evidence given as to the plaintiff\u2019s physical injuries should be considered as forming the basis for his conclusion that the plaintiff would not remarry which, therefore, in my view, is more than a personal opinion but rather is a conclusion which should be accepted by an appellate court.\nIn reducing the award by $10,000 the Court of Appeal erred in placing far too much emphasis on the possibility of remarriage and in taking into account any services the appellant\u2019s mother and mother\u2011in-law might contribute to maintaining the home. It is trite law that a wrongdoer cannot claim the benefit of services donated to the injured party. In the present case it amounts in my judgment to conscripting the mother and mother-in-law to the services of the appellant and his children for the benefit of the tortfeasor and any reduction of the award on this basis is and was an error in principle. There being error in principle, the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal is reviewable in this Court: Widrig v. Strazer et al[2].\nThe next question is whether the $20,000 awarded by the learned trial judge should be restored or varied and whether the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal should stand. I am of opinion that the $20,000 awarded was excessive and not justified by the evidence. I am also of opinion that the Court of Appeal erred in cutting the award in two for the reasons given in the judgment of MacKay J.A., Mr. Justice MacKay pointed out that the evidence is indefinite as to how much of the wife\u2019s earnings were used for herself and how much might reasonably be expected to enure to the benefit of the husband and children. It is significant to observe that the wife\u2019s earnings only totalled about $1,500 per year and that the husband was a man in moderate circumstances. Out of the sum of $1,500 a year, the mother put aside about $200 a year for the future benefit of the two children. It must be realized that what she expended out of the balance for her own maintenance was, under the circumstances of a moderate income family, a contribution to what would ordinarily have been provided by her husband. The husband was under the duty of supporting his wife in accordance with their circumstances in life, and the case cannot be considered as one where the earnings of the wife which she retained for herself were quite apart from any contribution made by her husband for her support, but rather as one where her earnings in part contributed to her support as well as to that of the balance of the family and the loss of those earnings was, therefore, a pecuniary loss to the husband. The situation resembles somewhat that dealt with by Ritchie J. in Corrie v. Gilbert[3]. In that case he said at p. 464:\nIt is unusual in this Court on an appeal such as this to reject both the award of the jury and that of the Court of Appeal, but there is no doubt that under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act it is empowered to give the judgment that the Court whose decision is appealed against should have given, and for the reasons which I have stated, I do not think the award made by either of the Courts below should be affirmed.\nHowever, after reviewing the evidence as a whole and giving due weight to the possible remarriage, remote as it may be, and what it will cost to hire a housekeeper and the other factors involved, I have reached the conclusion that an award of $14,000 should be made and I would vary the judgment appealed from accordingly.\nI deal next with that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which would reduce the award under The Fatal Accidents Act to the daughter Nancy Vana from $10,000 to $2,000 and the award under the said Fatal Accidents Act to the son Steven Vana from $5,000 to $1,500.\nBefore setting these amounts, the learned judges in appeal said:\nThe conclusion I have reached is that the learned trial judge erred in principle in that he took into consideration matters that cannot be classed as pecuniary loss; that he failed to allow for the contingencies of life to which I have referred; that he made assumptions in the absence of evidence and disregarded evidence that would tend to mitigate or lower the damages.\nThis statement followed immediately the consideration of the damages awarded to the two children under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act. If the initial words which I have quoted are taken to mean that the judgment of Ritchie C.J. in this Court in St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett[4] is no longer law, then I must, with respect, express disagreement. It would seem from the addendum which MacKay J.A. added to his reasons in which he discusses the cases of Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Jennings[5], Marsh v. Absolum[6] and Hine v. O\u2019Connor and Chambers and Fire Brigades Board[7], that such an interpretation might be justified. Despite anything that was said in Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Jennings or comments made in the Australian and New Zealand cases, the decision of this Court in St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett is unaffected and remains good law in Canada. I am, therefore, in agreement with my brother Ritchie when he expresses that view in his reasons for judgment.\nEven if it is not proper to interpret the judgment of MacKay J.A. as having disregarded the Lett case, the learned justice in appeal did comment:\nI am also of the view that in assessing damages to the children for the loss of the care and guidance of their mother that the principle applied in the case of Benham v. Gambling, [1941] A.C. 157, is to some extent applicable. In that case, damages of \u00a31,200 had been awarded for the shortening of life of an infant 2\u00bd years of age. The House of Lords reduced the amount to \u00a3200. At p. 168 Viscount Simon L.C. said:\nThe truth, of course, is that in putting a money value on the prospective balance of happiness in years that the deceased might otherwise have lived, the jury or judge of fact is attempting to equate incommensurables. Damages which would be proper for a disabling injury may well be much greater than for deprivation of life. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that in assessing damages under this head, whether in the case of a child or an adult, very moderate figures should be chosen. My noble and learned friend Lord Roche was well advised when he pointed out in Rose v. Ford, [1937] A.C. 826, the danger of this head of claim becoming unduly prominent and leading to inflation of damages in cases which do not really justify a large award.\nMy brother Ritchie has referred to the criticism made of Benham v. Gambling, particularly by Danckwerts L.J. in Naylor v. Yorkshire Electricity Board[8], and expressed a disinclination to approve the formulation of any conventional figure by way of compensation for the loss of a mother\u2019s care and guidance. He was, however, of the opinion that MacKay J.A. had not intended to adopt any such conventional figure in his reasons but rather was indicating the desirability for moderation and for guarding against \u201cthis head of claim becoming unduly prominent and leading to inflation of damages in cases which do not really justify a large award\u201d.\nWith respect, I must disagree with this conclusion of my brother Ritchie. As he pointed out in his reasons, the net result of MacKay J.A.\u2019s judgment is that he awarded Nancy Vana only $1,000 on account of the loss of her mother\u2019s care and guidance and that he awarded Steven Vana only $500 for such loss. Nancy Vana was 12\u00bd years of age at the time of the accident in which her mother died, and Steven Vana was a little less than 10 years of age. In my view, awards of $1,000 and $500, respectively, to those two children for the loss of the care and guidance of their mother made as of the year 1963 were, to use the words of Danckwerts L.J. in Naylor v. Yorkshire Electricity Board, \u201ca purely conventional assessment\u201d and therefore were in error of principle. In such circumstances as I have already pointed out, it becomes the duty of this Court to assess what would be an amount awarded upon a proper principle.\nI am of the opinion that the award of the learned trial judge in the sums of $10,000 and $5,000 was unreasonable in that it was so \u201cinordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d: Davies et al. v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd.[9] The award should be based upon a realistic assessment of the evidence of the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. It would not be proper to be guided by any criterion such as the necessity of finding \u201ca very moderate figure\u201d as recommended by Viscount Simon L.C. in Benham v. Gambling. The allowance of a proper amount for damages, in view of all the circumstances, would avoid the danger pointed out by Lord Roche in Rose v. Ford[10] of this head of claim becoming unduly prominent and leading to inflation of damages in cases which do not really justify a large award. That danger should be avoided not by the use of what Danckwerts L.J. termed \u201ca purely conventional assessment\u201d but by the trial judge making a careful charge to the jury or to himself if, as in the present case, he is trying the issue without the assistance of a jury, that the award must be based upon a reasonable assessment of all the circumstances and evidence in the case. What is that evidence in the present case? Without going into detail, I shall summarize it. The deceased woman was a good wife and industrious helpmate to her husband, and was a good mother to her children. No attempt was made by her husband to show that she was any extraordinary paragon but he gave such evidence without elaboration as would justify the aforesaid conclusion. In my view, to require the establishment of any different situation by the plaintiff would only encourage the gross exaggeration of evidence in an attempt to bolster claims and result in the exaggeration of the verdict to which Lord Roche referred. The St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett case established that these two children under these circumstances suffered the pecuniary loss from their mother\u2019s early death without the care, education and training (and I would also add the guidance, example and encouragement) which only a mother can give. I have already expressed the view that to allow damages under these circumstances attributable to such pecuniary loss of only $1,000 to a girl of 12 years of age and $500 to a boy of 9 years of age is a \u201cpurely conventional assessment\u201d and is, therefore, an error in principle. I would increase the amount of the award for this loss to the daughter Nancy Vana from $1,000 to $2,000 and to the son Steven Vana from $500 to $1,000. This would result in the total award to Nancy Vana under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act being fixed at $3,000 and the total award to Steven Vana under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act being fixed at $2,000.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal to the extent of increasing the award under The Fatal Accidents Act to the appellant from $10,000 to $14,000, to Nancy Vana under The Fatal Accidents Act from $2,000 to $3,000, and to Steven Vana under The Fatal Accidents Act from $1,500 to $2,000.\nAs I have already stated, I agree with Ritchie J. in increasing the award to the appellant George Vana for his own personal injuries from $8,500 to $10,000. The appellant should have his costs at trial and in this Court. There should be no costs in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe judgment of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[11] varying the judgment of Mr. Justice Haines by reducing the damages which he had awarded to the appellant George Vana for personal injuries and to the children and himself under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, in respect of, the death of Mrs. Vana.\nThe damages in question were claimed as the result of a collision between the appellant\u2019s motor vehicle and that of the respondent Tosta, which the learned trial judge found to have been driven by the respondent Laxarewicz in a wanton and reckless manner. This appeal is confined entirely to the quantum of damages; the liability of the respondents is not questioned. The effect of the collision was that Mrs. Vana, who was occupying the front seat with her husband, was thrown from the car and sustained multiple injuries as a result of which she died; Vana himself was seriously injured and comparatively slight injuries were sustained by both children.\nThe learned trial judge awarded the plaintiff on his own behalf and as next friend for his children a total sum of $49,720, and the Court of Appeal varied this judgment by reducing the award for personal injuries to Mr. Vana from $10,000 to $8,500 on the ground that the trial judge had wrongly taken into consideration as an item of damage the fact that Vana had suffered nervous shock, and further varied the judgment at trial by reducing the amounts awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act on the ground, inter alia, that the trial judge had wrongly assessed the damages claimed on behalf of the children for loss of their mother\u2019s care and guidance as being \u201ca pecuniary loss\u201d within the meaning of that statute.\nIn dealing with the claim of the appellant Vana for nervous shock, the Courir of Appeal made the following finding:\nThere is no allegation of claim in the Statement of Claim that the Plaintiff, George Vana, suffered or is suffering from nervous shock as a consequence of his wife\u2019s death; neither he nor the medical witnesses gave any evidence that he did or was suffering from nervous shock from this cause. There was evidence that Mrs. Vana was bleeding from the mouth, nose and ears, but no evidence that her body was mangled or torn.\nI must therefore conclude that the learned trial Judge was in error in holding that this was a matter that he was entitled to take into consideration in assessing this Plaintiff\u2019s damages for personal injuries. Had it not been for this error I would not be disposed to interfere with the general damages awarded, although I think they were perhaps too high, but because of this error I would reduce them to $8,500.00. With the greatest respect for the views thus expressed by Mr. Justice MacKay on behalf of the Court of Appeal, I am unable to agree with this finding.\nThe claim for personal injuries caused to the plaintiff is expressed in para. 10 of the statement of claim in the following terms:\nThe personal injuries caused to the Plaintiff, George Vana, were compound fractures of the first and third lumbar vertebrae and of the 12th thoracic vertebra with severe shock, hospitalization, pain and a tendency to arthritic changes in the area of the fractures\u2026\nIt is true that the claim thus made for \u201csevere shock\u201d is capable of being construed as being limited to the shock which Vana sustained as a result of his injuries, but when this claim is considered in conjunction with the circumstances of his wife\u2019s death, I do not think that it is to be read as excluding the nervous shock which he sustained from this cause as an element of damage.\nThe uncontradicted evidence of the appellant was to the effect that after the accident, injured as he was, he got out of his car to find his wife in a condition which he described as follows:\n\u2026then I crawled to the window and I looked out the window because my wife wasn\u2019t in the seat. She was lying on the ground. She was on her stomach and her feet were under the car and I don\u2019t remember how I got out of the car but I went to her and I saw that she was badly hurt. She was bleeding from her nose and her mouth and her ears and some people had started to try to breathe through her mouth for resuscitation and I remember one fellow says, \u201cDon\u2019t let the blood choke her, turn her head to the side\u201d and they made me sit down.\nAs to there being no evidence of Vana suffering nervous shock from this cause, reference should be had to the following answer made by him in his examination-in-chief:\nQ. Yes, and what was your condition when you got to the Brant Hospital?\nA. Well, I was in shock and I laid in the Emergency Room there and Dr. DeJong came and said that I should lay on the stretcher till he takes me up for X-rays\u2026\nIn considering the validity of the inclusion of nervous shock as an element of damage in such cases reference may usefully be had to what was said by Sellers L.J. in the Court of Appeal in England in the case of Shaw v. Mills which appears to be unreported except in Kemp and Kemp on The Quantum of Damages\u2014Fatal Injuries Claims, 2nd ed. at p. 178. That was a case in which a man and his wife and three daughters were standing on a footpath when they were run into by a motorcycle with the result that the wife and youngest daughter were killed and the husband and the two other children (Jean and Barbara) were injured. Lord Justice Sellers is quoted as saying:\nIn addition to their physical injuries the husband and Jean and Barbara saw the distressing sight before them. This circumstance, one would have thought would have resulted, in anyone of maturity in a shock which would have an effect upon their health quite apart from any other factors whatsoever. It is that element in these cases which has given rise to these appeals in respect of the personal injuries to the husband and to the elder daughter.\nThe appeal was dismissed.\nThe development of the law in this Court with respect to the function of a provincial court of appeal in reviewing an award of damages made at trial has recently been thoroughly reviewed by Spence J. in Gorman v. Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et al.[12], at pages 18 to 20 and I would also adopt the following language taken from the reasons for judgment of Lord Wright in Davies et al. v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Limited[13], at p. 617 where he said:\nIn effect the court, before it interferes with an award of damages, should be satisfied that the judge has acted on a wrong principle of law, or has misrepresented the facts, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered.\nI do not think that the learned trial judge in the present case acted on any wrong principle of law when he took the element of \u201cnervous shock\u201d into consideration in awarding damages for the appellant\u2019s personal injuries and I am, as I have indicated, of opinion that there was evidence to support his view in this regard. As the only ground upon which the Court of Appeal interfered with the general damage award was the inclusion of \u201cnervous shock\u201d as a factor for which the appellant was entitled to be compensated, I am with the greatest respect of opinion that this is a case in which the proper course is to restore the award of $10,000 made by the trial judge.\nIn considering the damages to be awarded to George Vana under The Fatal Accidents Act, the Court of Appeal observed that the learned trial judge had failed to take into consideration many of the hazards and uncertainties of life which should have been weighed before reaching a conclusion as to the pecuniary loss which he suffered by reason of his wife\u2019s death.\nOne of the matters which must always be considered in determining the amount to be awarded to a husband under The Fatal Accidents Act for the loss of his wife is the possibility of his remarriage and in this regard the learned trial judge found:\nFinally, I must consider the matter of remarriage. I have seen the plaintiff and have studied him closely throughout the trial. I think remarriage unlikely.\nAs Mr. Justice MacKay has said, there is nothing in the evidence that would warrant this conclusion and it appears to me that it must be based entirely from the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the bearing and manner of the appellant on the witness stand.\nIt must, of course, be accepted that the trial judge is in a better position to assess the quality of a witness whom he has studied closely throughout the trial than any court of appeal; the respect accorded to such an assessment is, however, normally limited to the question of credibility and I do not think that the same considerations apply to the trial judge\u2019s finding that remarriage was unlikely. His observations in this regard can, I think, only be treated as an expression of personal opinion based upon his observation of the appellant for a part of one day on the witness stand during which no one asked him whether he contemplated the possibility of remarriage or not. This does not appear to me to constitute a sufficient foundation for excluding such a possibility in the case of a 47-year old man, as the trial judge appears to have done, and I agree with Mr. Justice MacKay that the trial judge erred in disregarding this factor in making his award under The Fatal Accidents Act.\nAt the time of her death Mrs. Vana was engaged as a part-time waitress earning an average of $30 per week which the learned trial judge found she contributed to the household, and from which she also managed to create \u00e0 bank account of $600 in three years which was to be used for the college education of the children. In considering this phase of the matter as an element of pecuniary loss recoverable by the husband under The Fatal Accidents Act, the trial judge described it as follows:\nLoss of the wife\u2019s contribution of $1,500 a year to the household for a period which I estimate at least ten years. It may well be that she would have worked much longer. She was in good health.\nAs Mr. Justice MacKay has pointed out, the learned trial judge did not appear to take into consideration the fact that any compensation awarded for the loss of these earnings would be paid in advance and that in the ordinary course of living the wife might, by reason of illness or for other reasons not have continued to work. Mr. Justice MacKay also pointed out that the evidence is indefinite as to how much of the wife\u2019s earnings were used for herself and how much might reasonably be expected to enure to the benefit of the husband and children. I agree with these observations made on behalf of the Court of Appeal and I also agree that part of the wife\u2019s estimated future earnings would be properly allocated to the damages awarded to the children.\nOther factors which the trial judge took into consideration in making his award of $20,000 to George Vana under The Fatal Accidents Act were the expense of employing a housekeeper and perhaps another part-time assistant to train and guide the children, the expense of providing board and lodging for those employed to replace the wife\u2019s services, the expense of furnishing rooms and providing amenities for such employees and the further extra, expense which might from time to time be incurred in providing those countless little services that would have been provided by the wife which will not be provided by employees. With respect to these items Mr. Justice MacKay points out that the uncontradicted evidence is to the effect that Mr. Vana had no intention of hiring any housekeeper except his own mother whom he had promised to pay at the rate of $30 a week. It must be remembered that the mother was 75 years of age and might well not be able to perform these duties for very long but it is also worthy of note that the other grandmother who lives across the street from them was only 62 and in Mr. Vana\u2019s own language, \u201cshe could more or less give guidance to Nancy and in her dealings with school work and so forth.\u201d Mr. Justice MacKay has also pointed out that there is no evidence that the expense of providing board and lodging for a housekeeper would be any greater than the cost of maintaining a wife and that the husband would not be responsible for paying for the clothing and personal effects of a housekeeper. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge erred in principle in including in his award to Mr. Vana under The Fatal Accidents Act factors which cannot properly be classified as pecuniary loss and that he failed to allow for the contingencies of life to which reference has been made. I think, with the greatest respect for the learned trial judge, that it is also fair to say that in certain respects he erred in the manner in which he interpreted the evidence.\nFor these reasons and for those stated by Mr. Justice MacKay, I would not interfere with the Court of Appeal\u2019s reduction of the trial judge\u2019s award for George Vana\u2019s damages under The Fatal Accidents Act from $20,000 to $10,000.\nIt has been established since the earliest times that the damages to be awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act are confined to actual or expected pecuniary loss suffered by the claimant. The effect of the unbroken line of authority to this effect has not been materially changed since the principle was stated by Pollock C.B., in Franklin v. South Eastern Railway Company[14], where he said:\nNow it is clear that damage must be shown, for the jury are to \u201cgive such damages as they think proportioned to the injury.\u201d It has been held that these damages are not to be given as a solatium; but are to be given in reference to a pecuniary loss.\nThe damages to be awarded to the two Vana children under The Fatal Accidents Act must be considered in light of this principle, and the main question to be determined in this regard is whether the loss which the children suffered in being deprived of the mother\u2019s care and moral training can be said to be \u201ca pecuniary loss\u201d for which damages are recoverable under the statute.\nThe learned trial judge, following the decision of this Court in St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett[15], held that such damages were recoverable and that they should be substantial and he accordingly awarded $10,000 to the 12-year old daughter and $5,000 to the 9 year old boy. The Court of Appeal reduced these damages to $2,000 and $1,500 respectively.\nIn St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett, (hereinafter referred to as the Lett case) the Chief Justice, speaking for a narrow majority of this Court (3 to 2), made the following statements at p. 426:\nI cannot think the injury contemplated by. the legislature ought to be confined to a pecuniary interest in a sense so limited as only to embrace loss of money or property, but that, as in the case of a husband in reference to the loss of a wife, so, in the case of children, the loss of a mother may involve many things which may be regarded as of a pecuniary character.\nAnd again at p. 432:\nI think the statute intended that where there was a substantial loss or injury there should be substantial relief. I cannot think that in giving compensation to a child for the loss of its parent the legislature intended so to limit the remedy as to deprive the child of compensation for the greatest injury it is possible to conceive a child can sustain, namely, in being deprived of the care, education and training of a mother, unless it could be shown that the loss was a pecuniary loss of so many dollars or so much property, a construction which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, would simply amount to saying that though there was an almost irreparable injury, affecting the present and future interests of the child, no compensation was to be awarded; in other words, it would be, in effect, to deny to a child compensation for the death of a mother by negligence in almost every conceivable case.\nIt is apparent that this decision of the Chief Justice constituted a clear recognition of the fact that the loss to children of the care and guidance of their mother is to be regarded as a loss of a pecuniary character which is to be assessed as a separate head of damage.\nLeave to appeal from this decision to the Privy Council was refused but three years later the case of Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Jennings[16], (hereinafter referred to as the Jennings case) which involved the death of a father, was decided by the Privy Council and in that case Lord Watson had occasion to say:\nWhen a man has no means of his own and earns nothing, it is obvious that his wife or children cannot be pecuniary losers by his decease.\nIt is argued that the decision in this case was inconsistent with the view of the majority in the Lett case and that it stands as authority for the proposition that the lack of a mother\u2019s care and guidance is not to be treated as a pecuniary loss for the purpose of assessing damages under The Fatal Accidents Act. This argument was based on the premise that there is no difference in principle between the moral and practical training of a mother and that of a father and that, as the Privy Council found no pecuniary loss to have been occasioned by the father\u2019s death in the Jennings case, it must follow that their Lordships did not agree with the reasoning in the Lett case.\nThe cases in Australia and New Zealand\u2014to which Mr. Justice MacKay referred support this proposition as is indicated by the language employed by Mr. Justice Kennedy in Marsh v. Absolum[17], where he said at p. 475:\nI think that the lack of a mother\u2019s care and moral training is a great loss to a child but it is not a pecuniary loss.\nThe view adopted by the Australian and New Zealand courts has not been shared by the courts in Canada where the Lett case has been widely followed in different provinces ever since it was decided. I do not think that Mr. Justice Ruttan of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was overstating the matter when he said in DeBrincat v. Mitchell[18]:\nThe guiding principle as contained in the judgment of Chief Justice Ritchie in the Supreme Court decision of Lett v. St. Lawrence and Ottawa Elec. Ry. (1885) 11 S.C.R. 422, keeps re-appearing in extensive quotation in many of the cases that have been decided in the succeeding 70 years. Pecuniary loss is the loss of some benefit or advantage which is capable of being estimated in terms of money, as distinct from mere sentimental loss. Here we must value the loss of the services of a young wife to a young husband, their respective ages being 30 and 32 at the time of the accident; and the loss of a mother of two small children, aged three and five years.\nMore recently Mr. Justice Patterson of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the case of Walter et al. v. Muise[19] referred at length to the Lett case and made a small allowance to the infant children for loss \u201cof the care of a mother for something over a year\u201d notwithstanding the fact that the evidence indicated that they had become adjusted to life with their step-mother. It is contended that the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice MacKay on behalf of the Court of Appeal are predicated on acceptance of the proposition that the loss of a mother\u2019s care and training is not a pecuniary loss and that in this regard the Court of Appeal were accepting the views expressed in the Australian and New Zealand cases. That the Court of Appeal recognized the loss of a mother as being a loss of a pecuniary character for which her surviving children were entitled to recover damage is made plain by Mr. Justice MacKay where he says:\nIn my view there is little evidence aside from that as to the amounts being saved by the mother for their education to justify an award of any substantial amount to the children.\nIn the present case the mother had put aside $200 a year for three years for the future benefit of the two children and assuming, as the trial judge did, that she would continue to do this for ten years, this would amount to a fund of $1,000 for each child; but the Court of Appeal has awarded $2,000 to the girl and $1,500 to the boy and it accordingly appears to me that this must include an award of $1,000 to the girl and $500 to the boy as a separate item of damage in compensation for the deprivation of their mother\u2019s care and training. In my view the recognition of this separate head of damage is in conformity with the principle invoked by the Chief Justice in the Lett case and clearly indicates that the Court of Appeal rejected the interpretation placed on the Jennings case by the Australian and New Zealand authorities.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice MacKay refers to four Ontario cases, in which awards were made to children under The Fatal Accidents Act in respect of the death of their mother and he quotes from Mr. Justice Laidlaw in Wannamaker v. Terry[20], where he said at p. 589:\nAll members of this Court agree that the service performed by a mother for her infant children is a very important matter of consideration and the continuance of her life is an important thing to them, but what the jury have to decide is how much this service was worth in dollars and cents. How much in dollars and cents were they deprived of by her death.\nAs I have indicated, I do not read the decision of the Court of Appeal as excluding the loss of their mother as an element in assessing the damages to be awarded to the children under The Fatal Accidents Act. Mr. Justice MacKay did, however, express the following view:\nI am also of the view that in assessing damages to the children for the loss of the care and guidance of their mother that the principle applied in the case of Benham v. Gambling, [1941] A.C. 157, is to some extent applicable.\nIn Benham v. Gambling damages of \u00a31,200 had been awarded at trial in respect of the shortening, and therefore the loss of prospective enjoyment, of the life of a child of 2\u00bd years. The House of Lords reduced the award to \u00a3200 and the portion of the decision of Viscount Simon L.C., which Mr. Justice MacKay considered \u201cto be to some extent applicable\u201d in assessing damages to the children for the loss of the care and guidance of their mother, was that passage in which the Lord Chancellor pointed out that where the jury or judge of fact was faced with \u201cattempting to equate incommensurables\u201d, in terms of damages, \u201cvery moderate figures should be chosen\u201d.\nThe case of Benham v. Gambling has not been without its critics and in the recent case of Naylor v. Yorkshire Electricity Board[21] the Court of Appeal deviated from it to the extent of taking the reduced value of the pound into consideration. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Danckwerts L.J. said:\nAccordingly, in Benham v. Gambling the House of Lords, under the compelling influence of Viscount Simon L.C., evolved by a process of judicial legislation a theory that the damages should be a strictly moderate figure, somewhere between a minimum of \u00a3200 and a maximum of \u00a3500. This, of course, was a purely conventional assessment which paid no regard to the real facts or, perhaps I should say, the difficulties of the case\u2026 Since then the value of money has fallen two and a half times, and, conventional or not, the figure of \u00a3200 or \u00a3500 must be even more unrealistic than it was in 1941.\nHaving regard to this decision and to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Skelton v. Collins[22], I would deprecate the formulation of any \u201cconventional figure\u201d by way of compensation for the loss of a mother\u2019s care and guidance. I do not, however, think that Mr. Justice MacKay intended to adopt any such figure but rather that he was indicating the desirability for guarding against \u201cthis head of claim becoming unduly prominent and leading to inflation of damages in cases which do not really justify a large award\u201d.\nIn my opinion, the decision of the Chief Justice of this Court in the Lett case goes no further than deciding that children may be entitled to compensation under The Fatal Accidents Act in respect of the loss of their mother\u2019s care and guidance and that where they have thereby sustained \u201csubstantial injury\u201d, the damages should be commensurate with that injury. In this context the words \u201csubstantial injury\u201d are used in contradistinction to \u201cmere sentimental\u201d injury, but in order to justify anything more than a moderate award under this head, there must, in my view, be evidence to support a reasonable inference that the future of the children has been adversely affected by their mother\u2019s death and that they will suffer a resultant pecuniary loss which is capable of being expressed in terms of \u201csuch damages as will afford a reasonable\u2026compensation for the substantial loss sustained\u201d, to employ the phrase used by the Chief Justice in the Lett case.\nIn the Lett case damages were awarded to five of the deceased mother\u2019s children. The two youngest, a girl of 14 and a boy of 11, were awarded $1,200 and $1,300 respectively and the Chief Justice was able to affirm this award as representing compensation for the loss of the mother\u2019s educational and moral training. It is difficult, more than 80 years later, to understand all the factors which influenced the Court in affirming this award, although I think it can safely be said that children at that time were much more dependent on the education which was received in the home than they are today when education at the public expense is available to all. In any event, it is quite clear that the Chief Justice considered himself bound by the English authorities decided under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and that he applied the principle that such damages were not to be awarded as a solatium but rather in reference to a loss which he regarded \u201cas of a pecuniary character\u201d.\nIn the present case, aside from the fact that she was putting aside $200 a year for her children and was in good health, the evidence of Mrs. Vana\u2019s activities in the home is to be found in the following excerpt from the appellant\u2019s examination-in-chief:\nQ. What activities did your wife follow?\nA. Well, she was a den mother as for the young boy about three months out of the year she conducted meetings for the cub scouts and my daughter she used to take my daughter to piano lessons and my wife did her own cooking and baking and\u2026\nAnd later:\nQ. Well then, what were her relations with her children?\nA. Well she was a very faithful housewife as far as mother, schooling, she did her job excellently, she did her own ironing, washing, cleaning and took care of the children and she did she loved roses, she had her own little rose garden in the back lot there.\nThis evidence indicates that Mrs. Vana was an excellent mother but the task of translating the loss of her influence and character on the lives of her children into terms of a damage award is so beset with uncertainties and lends itself so readily to being inflated in the eyes of the trial court in terms of sympathy, speculation and conjecture, that as I have indicated, I adopt the suggestion which I take to be implicit in the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the proper course by which a trial judge should be guided in such cases is to instruct himself or the jury as the case may be that the amount to be awarded should bear a realistic relationship to the evidence, if any, which makes it reasonably probable that the children will actually suffer a pecuniary loss as a result of their mother\u2019s death.\nI think that this is the basis of the decision of the Chief Justice in the Lett case, supra, and the fact that in 1885, in light of the evidence which was before him, the Chief Justice considered awards of $1,200 and $1,300 to be appropriate for the loss of a mother to children who were 14 and 11 years old respectively, does not appear to me to be inconsistent with the award made by the Court of Appeal in the present case nor in my view does it necessarily follow from Mr. Justice MacKay\u2019s reference to the case of Benham v. Gambling, supra, that the assessment made by the Court of Appeal was \u201ca purely conventional\u201d one. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal, like the Chief Justice in the Lett case, took the view that any award of damages under The Fatal Accidents Act must be supported by evidence of actual pecuniary damage or damage \u201cof a pecuniary character\u201d and that the element of solatium is to be excluded in mak- ing such an award. In awarding damages to children for the death of their mother there must be, as I have indicated, evidence which makes it reasonably probable that the children will actually suffer a pecuniary loss as a result of their mother\u2019s death.\nThere may be cases where the evidence would only justify a very small amount and others in which a very substantial award would be appropriate. The result of each case must, of course, depend on its own facts and the circumstances affecting the measure of the damages to be awarded to children by reason of their mother\u2019s death may range from a case where, before her death, the mother was so physically or mentally incapacitated as to be unable to play any useful part in her children\u2019s lives in which case the children cannot be said to have suffered any resultant pecuniary injury, to the case of the death of a widowed mother who was the sole support of her infant children and whose death, leaving them without guidance, to adjust to life entirely on their own, would obviously constitute a substantial loss. In each case the question is one for the trial tribunal to decide subject to review by the Court of Appeal in cases where the trial court has erred in principle or has awarded an amount which is so inordinately high or so inordinately low as to make it an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage. In the present case the Court of Appeal appears to have concluded that the trial judge erred in principle by failing to confine himself to the actual evidence of pecuniary loss suffered by the children in the loss of their mother when he made his award to them for that loss.\nThe considerations which should govern this Court in reviewing an award such as the one here made by the Court of Appeal are, in my opinion, those to which Judson J. referred in Hossack et al. v. Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et al.[23], at p. 34 where he said:\n\u2026the volume of litigation in personal injury cases and under The Fatal Accidents Act demonstrates the need for an experienced reviewing tribunal with reasonably wide powers. The Court of Appeal has this experience. They know better than anyone else what an award should be both in the interests of justice to the particular litigants and interest of some principle of uniformity, to the extent that this is attainable. Any further reviewing tribunal should be slow to interfere unless it is convinced that there is error in principle. I see no error in principle in the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal and as I think that the award suggested by Mr. Justice MacKay in respect of the loss of the care and guidance of Mrs. Vana is appropriate having regard to all the circumstances, I would not interfere with it.\nIn the result, I would allow this appeal in part by restoring the award of $10,000 made by the learned trial judge in respect of George Vana\u2019s personal injuries and would affirm the assessments made by the Court of Appeal under The Fatal Accidents Act.\nThe appellant has succeeded in part and under all the circumstances I think he should have the costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Phelan, O\u2019Brien, Rutherford, Lawer & Shannon, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Evans, Philp & Gordon, Hamilton.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 394, 54 D.L.R.

The price was $6,521,946 to be paid by instalments over a period of two years. A sum of $323,763 was made payable to individual Indians on the execution of the contract, as well as a sum of $750,000 to the Crown. So long as the appellant was not in default, it was entitled to obtain grants of portions of the land on making certain additional payments calculated on the property to be conveyed. The last payment required under the agreement was not paid. The contract contained a clause stipulating that time was of the essence and that upon default the Crown could terminate the contract and retain \u201cany moneys paid under this agreement as liquidated damages and not as a penalty\u201d. The Crown having terminated the contract, the appellant, by its petition of right, sought to recover the moneys which it had paid in excess of what it had been required to pay for land which it had been granted. The trial judge reached the conclusion that but for s. 48 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, the appellant would have been entitled to relief from forfeiture in respect of the moneys which remained in the hands of the Crown at the time of the presentation of the petition of right. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 48 of the Exchequer Court Act afforded a complete defence to the Crown. That section provides that a clause in a contract with the Crown in which a drawback or a penalty is stipulated on account of non performance of any condition or neglect to complete any public work shall be construed as importing an assessment of damages by mutual consent.\nWhether a provision in a contract is penal or not depends upon the construction of the contract but the question of unconscionability depends upon the circumstances of each case at the time when the clause is invoked. There was no evidence as to the value of the lands retained by the Crown and it therefore did not appear to be possible to say with any degree of certainty that the appellant\u2019s breach would not result in damage to the Crown to the approximate amount which it had retained.\nCouronne\u2014Vente de terres\u2014Terres des Indiens\u2014Contrat pour la vente par la Couronne de terres des Indiens\u2014Le temps \u00e9tant de l\u2019essence du contrat\u2014Clause pr\u00e9voyant la terminaison du contrat et la forfaiture des argents dans le cas de d\u00e9faut\u2014La clause impose-t-elle une peine ou est-elle une \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9alable des dommages\u2014La peine est-elle d\u00e9raisonnable\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, art. 48\u2014Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149, arts. 37 et seq.\nEn vertu d\u2019un contrat en date du 14 mars 1959, la compagnie appelante a convenu d\u2019acheter des terres d\u2019Indiens qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 la Couronne pour \u00eatre vendues au profit des Indiens, conform\u00e9ment aux arts. 37 \u00e0 41 de la Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on a petition of right. Appeal dismissed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.J. Rolls, for the appellant.\nD.S. Maxwell, Q.C., and N.A. Chalmers, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Thurlow of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 by which he ordered that the present appellant was not entitled to any of the relief which it had claimed in its petition of right. The appellant is a company which was created solely for the purpose of entering into the transaction which is the subject matter of the present litigation. The appellant\u2019s principals were land speculators and had arranged for the purchase of certain Indian lands which had been surrendered to Her Majesty for sale on behalf of the Sarnia Band of Indians in accordance with ss. 37 to 41 of the Indian Act. This arrangement was made the subject of an agreement dated March 14, 1959, which was executed on behalf of the Crown and the appellant and each page of which was signed by the solicitor for the Indian Band. The provisions of this agreement have been thoroughly analyzed by Mr. Justice Thurlow and it is only necessary for me to say that it provided for the total purchase price of $6,521,946 to be paid by instalments over a period of two years. The sum of $323,763.63 was made payable to individual Indians on the execution of the agreement and so long as the appellant was not in default under the agreement, it was entitled to obtain grants of portions of the land on making certain additional payments calculated on the area and location of the property to be conveyed. The last payment required under the agreement, which amounted to $4,198,549.15, together with interest in the amount of $107,408.28, fell due on March 15, 1961, and was not paid within 30 days after notice had been given to the appellant by the Minister in accordance with para. 10 of the agreement which reads as follows:\nThe Purchaser convenants and agrees that if default be made in payment of the said purchase price and interest, or any part thereof, upon the days and times hereinbefore provided, or if default be made in the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements and stipulations to be performed and observed by the Purchaser, the Minister shall be entitled to give the Purchaser thirty days\u2019 notice in writing requiring it to remedy such default, and upon such notice having been given and such default not having been remedied, this agreement shall, at the option of the Minister, be terminated and all rights and interest hereby created or then existing in favour of the Purchaser or derived by it under this agreement with respect to the lands not already granted to the Purchaser shall cease and determine and the Minister shall be entitled to retain any moneys paid under this agreement as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.\nThis paragraph must be read in conjunction with para. 13 which provides:\nIt is agreed by and between the parties hereto that time shall be of the essence of this agreement, and that no extension of time for any payment by the Purchaser or for rectification of any breach of any covenant, agreement or stipulation herein contained shall operate as a waiver of this provision with respect to any other payment or rectification or extension of time, except as specifically granted in writing by the Minister.\nIt seems to me to be important to note that in dealing with the appellant the Crown was from the outset dealing with a company which never at any time had assets which were equivalent to the balance required at the end of the term of the agreement, and that at least from August 1959, it ceased to have backers who had any such assets. In view of this situation, it is not surprising that the appellant never at any time sought specific performance of the agreement, and that six months after default it was still not prepared to seek this remedy unless it was given a further two years in which to raise the money.\nThe position at the time of the default was that the appellant had paid $2,323,396.85 which, it is agreed, was $1,350,000 in excess of what it was required to pay for land which had been granted to it or its nominees. Of this $1,350,000 however, $375,000 had been paid out by the Crown to individual members of the Indian Band in accordance with the provisions for surrender and the learned trial judge has found that at the time of the commencement of these proceedings, at least $975,000 of the amount paid by the appellant remained in the hands of the Crown as trustee for the Indian Band.\nThe appellant\u2019s case is that in spite of the express language contained in the last line of the above paragraph, the provisions entitling the Minister \u201cto retain any moneys paid under this agreement as liquidated damages\u201d did not constitute an agreement for a genuine pre\u2011estimate or assessment of the damages which were likely to result from breach of the agreement, but that it was in the nature of a penalty and that in the circumstances of the case it was unconscionable for the Crown to terminate the suppliant\u2019s rights in the land and also to retain the money which remained in its hands and which had been paid by the appellant. The appellant sought the return of the money by way of relief against the forfeiture which it contended had been wrongly imposed upon it by the terms of para. 10 of the agreement.\nIn dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim, the learned trial judge found s. 48 of the Exchequer Court Act to be applicable to the circumstances. That section, which applies to claims over which the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction which arise out of \u201cany contract in writing\u201d reads as follows:\n48. No clause in any such contract in which a drawback or penalty is stipulated for on account of the non-performance of any condition thereof, or on account of any neglect to complete any public work or to fulfil any covenant in the contract, shall be considered as comminatory, but it shall be construed as importing an assessment by mutual consent of the damages caused by such non-performance or neglect.\nI am in full agreement with Mr. Justice Thurlow in holding, for the reasons which he has stated, that this section applies to the contract here in question and affords a complete defence to the respondent. It accordingly follows that I would dismiss this appeal and it would be unnecessary to deal with the matter further were it not for the fact that Mr. Justice Thurlow in his most thoughtful judgment, has considered the question of whether the appellant would have been entitled to relief if s. 48 did not apply to the agreement here in question, and has reached the conclusion that but for s. 48, the appellant would have been entitled to relief from forfeiture in respect of the $975,000 which remained in the hands of the Crown at the time of the presentation of the petition of right. In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Justice Thurlow has rested his reasoning primarily on the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Stockloser v. Johnson[2] (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cStockloser\u201d case) in which case Denning L.J. summarized the view of the majority at page 489 in the following terms:\nBut when there is a forfeiture clause or the money is expressly paid as a deposit (which is equivalent to a forfeiture clause), then the buyer who is in default cannot recover the money at law at all. He may, however, have a remedy in equity, for, despite the express stipulation in the contract, equity can relieve the buyer from forfeiture of the money and order the seller to repay it on such terms as the court thinks fit. That is, \u00cf think, shown clearly by the decision of the Privy Council in Steedman v. Drinkle (1916) 1 A.C. 275, where the Board consisted of a strong three, Viscount Haldane, Lord Parker and Lord Sumner.\nThe difficulty is to know what are the circumstances which give rise to this equity, but I must say that I agree with all that Somervell L.J. has said about it, differing herein from the view of Romer L.J. Two things are necessary: first, the forfeiture clause must be of a penal nature, in this sense, that the sum forfeited must be out of all proportion to the damage, and, secondly, it must be unconscionable for the seller to retain the money. Although he does not expressly say so, it is clear to me from Mr. Justice Thurlow\u2019s reasons for judgment that he was of opinion that the Crown\u2019s retention of the moneys as well as the lands in the present case was \u201cunconscionable\u201d and that it is for this reason that he would have granted relief from forfeiture had it not been for the provisions of s. 48 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe Stockloser case, supra, is characterized by a sharp difference of opinion between Romer L.J., who spoke for himself alone, and Somervell L.J. with whom Denning L.J. agreed. Lord Justice Romer concluded that \u201cin the absence of some special circumstances, such as fraud, sharp practice or other unconscionable conduct of the vendor\u201d no intervention was permissible except to allow an extension of time for payment. Somervell and Denning L.JJ. on the other hand, thought that the province of equity was not so circumscribed and that it permitted more general relief whenever the forfeiture clause was of a penal nature\u2014where, that is, the sum forfeited was wholly disproportionate to the damage suffered\u2014provided that in the circumstances it was unconscionable for the money to be retained. The opinion of the majority, which was adopted by Thurlow J., is set forth at length elsewhere in these reasons, but I do not find it necessary for the purposes of this case to adopt either view because even if the opinion of the majority were to prevail, it would not, in my opinion, entitle the appellant to succeed in the circumstances of the present case.\nThe portion of Lord Somervell\u2019s judgment which is italicized and expressly adopted by Mr. Justice Thurlow occurs at page 487 and reads as follows:\nI think that the statements of the law in the cases to which I will refer indicate a wider jurisdiction. I think that they indicate that the court would have power to give relief against the enforcement of the forfeiture provisions, although there was no sharp practice by the vendor, and although the purchaser was not able to find the balance. It would, of course, have to be shown that the retention of the instalments was unconscionable, in all the circumstances.\nMr. Justice Thurlow expresses the opinion that this view follows logically from what was said by Mr. Justice Duff in this Court in Snell v. Brickles[3], and in this regard I think it should be noted that the latter case was one in which specific performance was sought and granted and was not one in which \u201cthe purchaser was not able to find the balance\u201d. This distinction appears to me to be fundamental.\nIt was strongly urged by counsel on behalf of the appellant that the last line of para. 10 of the agreement made provision for a penalty and that it could not be treated as providing for a genuine pre-estimate of damages. In this regard it is perhaps desirable to refer to the difference between \u201ca penalty\u201d and \u201cliquidated damages\u201d as it was succinctly expressed by Lord Dunedin in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd.[4], where he said:\nThe essence of a penalty is a payment of money stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party; the essence of liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre\u2011estimate of damage.\nIn considering the agreement at issue in the present appeal, it must, as I have said, be remembered that the appellant was a land speculator and the Crown was exposed to a very real commercial danger which it would have suffered had the appellant failed to make its payment after having drawn down and sold the more valuable lands leaving the respondent with less commercially attractive and possibly closed in lands and thereby seriously reducing such assets as remained. Under these circumstances, any exact determination of the damage flowing from a breach of the agreement was almost an impossibility and it appears to me to be not at all unreasonable to view the provisions of para. 10 of the agreement as reflecting a genuine pre-estimate of the damage to which both parties had agreed.\nAs has been indicated, even if para. 10 had been found to impose a penalty rather than a genuine pre-estimate of damage, it does not follow from the Stockloser case, supra, that this would have constituted a ground for granting the relief claimed. It is clear that the majority of the Court of Appeal in the Stockloser case subscribed to the view that in order to afford such relief it must also be found to \u201cbe unconscionable for the seller to retain the money\u201d. As this was the view adopted by Mr. Justice Thurlow, it appears to me to be desirable to take note of what was said by Lord Radcliffe in this connection in Campbell Discount Co. Ltd. v. Bridge[5]. In that case the members of the House of Lords were unanimous in holding that a provision in a hire purchase agreement for a second-hand car constituted a penalty from which the purchaser should be relieved. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord Radcliffe, however, had occasion to say, at page 626:\nEven such masters of equity as Lord Eldon and Sir George Jessel, it must be remembered, were highly sceptical of the court\u2019s duty to apply the epithet \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or its consequences to contracts made between persons of full age in circumstances that did not fall within the familiar categories of fraud, surprise, accident, etc., even though such contracts involved the payment of a larger sum of money on breach of an obligation to pay a smaller sum (see the latter\u2019s judgment in Wallis v. Smith 21 Chancery Division 243).\nIn the same case and at the same page, Lord Radcliffe said:\n\u2018Unconscionable\u2019 must not be taken to be a panacea for adjusting any contract between competent persons when it shows a rough edge to one side or the other, and equity lawyers are, I notice, sometimes both surprised and discomfited by the plentitude of jurisdiction, and the imprecision of rules that are attributed to \u2018equity\u2019 by their more enthusiastic colleagues.\nWhether a provision in a contract is penal or not depends upon the construction of the contract but the question of unconscionability must depend upon the circumstances of each case at the time when the clause is invoked. In the present case I do not think that the invoking of the provisions of para. 10 of the agreement was unconscionable. There is no evidence as to the value of the lands retained by the Crown and it therefore does not appear to me to be possible to say with any degree of certainty that the appellant\u2019s breach would not result in damage to the respondent to the approximate amount which it retained.\nIn this Court Mr. Williston raised an argument which had not been mentioned in the Court below to the effect that the notice of termination of the agreement was defective in that it was dated March 15, 1961, and the appellant could not be said to have been in default under the provisions of para. 1(c) of the agreement until the end of that day.\nThe carbon copy of the notice in question which was produced by the appellant bears the notation \u201csigned and mailed on March 16th, 1961\u201d and it is to be noted that para. 14 of the agreement reads as follows:\nWherever in this agreement it is required or permitted that notice or demand be given or served by either party to this agreement to or on the other, such notice or demand shall be given or served in writing and forwarded by registered mail addressed as follows:\u2026\nI take it from these provisions that the date of mailing is to be treated as the date of the giving of the notice and that the notice in question is accordingly to be taken as having been given on March 16, 1961.\nQuite apart from the fact that until the argument in this Court the appellant\u2019s case was conducted on the basis that the Crown had terminated the contract in accordance with its strict legal right and that the appellant was seeking equitable relief, I am in any event of opinion that the notice was in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Starr, Allen & Weekes, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The fatal accident occurred when the victim, the police cars having left the scene, commenced to cross the road to return to his own car which had been parked on the other side of the road. The driver Bernard who was driving his car with the lights on low beam reduced his speed when he saw at about 2,000 feet the flashing lights of the police cars. Suddenly, at a distance from 15 to 20 feet in front of him, he saw a person standing directly in front of him.\nRelying on the provisions of s. 3 of the Highway Victims Indemnity Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 232, the trial judge found that the defendants alone were at fault. This judgment was affirmed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal; the dissenting judgment would have attributed one half of the blame to the victim. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part.\nPer Curiam: Section 3 of the Highway Victims Indemnity Act did not have the effect of depriving the owner or driver of an automobile which struck a pedestrian of the defence of contributory negligence.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux and Spence JJ.: The driver and the victim were both equally at fault. The Highway Code determines the priorities and the reciprocal rights and obligations of pedestrians and drivers on a highway. Section 48(2) provides that the pedestrians should yield passage to the vehicles proceeding on the highways and that drivers should use care to avoid injury to pedestrians. In the present case, the victim did not give the right of way to the vehicle, and the driver did not exercise the care required to avoid hitting the victim.\nPer Cartwright and Abbott JJ., dissenting: In the present case, there were concurrent findings of fact not only that the driver had been negligent but also that the victim had not been guilty of contributory negligence which was a direct cause of the accident. These concurrent findings of fact were not wrong and should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Puddicombe J.

Lefebvre est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 accidentellement dans la soir\u00e9e du 22 septembre 1962 alors que, sur la route transcanadienne, entre Bel\u0153il et St-Basile, il fut frapp\u00e9 par une automobile conduite par Jean Bernard et appartenant au gendre d\u2019icelui, Paul Yvon Nadeau, tous deux appelants en cette cause.\nAu soutien de son action, la demanderesse a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9claration que Bernard \u00e9tait inattentif, qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb, dans les circonstances, r\u00e9duire sa vitesse, signaler sa venue et appliquer les freins. D\u2019autre part, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont plaid\u00e9 que Lefebvre fut l\u2019artisan de son propre malheur, qu\u2019\u00e9tant sur la route, il n\u2019a pr\u00eat\u00e9 aucune attention quelconque \u00e0 la circulation des automobiles et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait sous l\u2019influence des spiritueux.\nLa preuve au dossier \u00e9tablit, en substance, les faits ci-apr\u00e8s:\u2014Cet accident eut lieu en rase campagne et dans une r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 la route transcanadienne est droite, de niveau et divis\u00e9e en deux par un terre-plein. Deux voies d\u2019une largeur totale d\u2019environ vingt-cinq pieds assurent du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de ce terre-plein respectivement la circulation est-ouest, vers Montr\u00e9al, et ouest-est, vers Bel\u0153il et St-Hyacinthe. Ce soir-l\u00e0, un samedi, un peu apr\u00e8s sept heures, Lefebvre partit seul en automobile de St-Hyacinthe pour se rendre \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al par la route transcanadienne. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit m\u00eame o\u00f9 une heure plus tard, \u00e0 huit heures et trente p.m., il devait \u00eatre fatalement frapp\u00e9 par l\u2019automobile de Bernard, Lefebvre eut un premier accident dans lequel, outre son automobile, deux autres voitures furent impliqu\u00e9es. Deux agents de la S\u00fbret\u00e9, patrouillant s\u00e9par\u00e9ment la route, furent alors d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9s sur les lieux. A leur arriv\u00e9e, ils stationn\u00e8rent leurs v\u00e9hicules, avec feux clignotants allum\u00e9s, sur le terre-plein, face \u00e0 Bel\u0153il. Ils proc\u00e9d\u00e8rent d\u00e8s lors aux constatations et autres devoirs d\u2019usage, ce qui leur prit une heure. Durant ce temps, l\u2019agent Vary nota que Lefebvre \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s nerveux et qu\u2019il sentait la boisson. Vary fut importun\u00e9 par ses agissements; non seulement Lefebvre leur nuisait, mais il s\u2019exposait et les exposait eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 d\u2019autres accidents de circulation. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, cet agent de la S\u00fbret\u00e9 d\u00e9clare:\nJe lui disais \u00f4tez-vous de sur la route, enlevez-vous, vous allez vous faire frapper, vous nous nuisez, on va avoir un accident nous autres aussi et puis il ne semblait pas comprendre \u00e7a, il \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 me r\u00e9p\u00e9ter mon char a un accident, mon char a un accident.\nDans un autre passage, Vary, r\u00e9f\u00e9rant toujours \u00e0 Lefebvre, ajoute:\nIl \u00e9tait autour de nous autres, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au ras nos automobiles; nous autres on allait sur la route, il y avait un char de travers sur la route, nous l\u2019avons fait remorquer pour l\u2019\u00f4ter de l\u00e0, et puis monsieur Lefebvre \u00e9tait souvent sur la route. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 souvent de s\u2019\u00f4ter de sur la route, que c\u2019\u00e9tait dangereux. Je lui ai dit ne restez pas ici, \u00e7a va vite, il y a beaucoup de traffic.\nAu moins une dizaine de fois, Vary dut intervenir pour enjoindre \u00e0 Lefebvre de s\u2019enlever et d\u2019\u00e9couter, de s\u2019\u00f4ter de sur la route. Au moment o\u00f9, leur travail termin\u00e9, les agents s\u2019appr\u00eataient \u00e0 quitter les lieux, il n\u2019y restait que Lefebvre qui devait y attendre la venue d\u2019un garagiste de St-Hyacinthe pour faire remorquer son automobile qui se trouvait dans le champ au nord de la route. Vary venait \u00e0 peine de partir et B\u00e9cotte, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9 que Lefebvre s\u2019en allait en direction de sa voiture endommag\u00e9e, venait \u00e0 peine de monter ou montait dans la sienne lorsqu\u2019il entendit un bruit sourd, venant des lieux m\u00eames qu\u2019il s\u2019appr\u00eatait \u00e0 quitter. Il en pr\u00e9vint Vary par radio et celui-ci, qui n\u2019avait parcouru qu\u2019un demi-mille, revint sur les lieux. C\u2019est alors que Bernard, qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et stationn\u00e9 sa voiture sur le bord de la route, vint au devant des agents et leur dit qu\u2019il venait de frapper quelque chose. On trouva le corps de Lefebvre \u00e0 quelque quatorze pieds au nord du pav\u00e9.\nBernard est le seul t\u00e9moin oculaire du fait imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019accident et il n\u2019est pas sans \u00e0-propos de noter imm\u00e9diatement le commentaire suivant fait \u00e0 son sujet par le juge au proc\u00e8s:\n\u2026in giving his evidence Bernard impressed the Court as being completely objective reserving nothing and doing his best to describe exactly what happened.\nAu moment de ce second accident, la nuit \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e et le temps \u00e9tait sombre. Bernard relate qu\u2019accompagn\u00e9 de son \u00e9pouse et une autre personne, toutes deux alors occup\u00e9es \u00e0 causer, il conduisait son automobile vers Montr\u00e9al sur la voie extr\u00eame nord, \u00e0 une vitesse d\u2019environ cinquante milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure et avec un \u00e9clairage diminu\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il vit, \u00e0 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s deux mille pieds devant lui, les feux clignotants des voitures de la S\u00fbret\u00e9; il r\u00e9duisit sa vitesse sans freiner et lorsqu\u2019il passa vis-\u00e0-vis ces voitures, il allait \u00e0 une vitesse d\u2019environ quarante-cinq milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure quand, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, il aper\u00e7ut \u00e0 quinze ou vingt-cinq pieds devant lui une personne immobilis\u00e9e sur la route \u00e0 trois pieds \u00e0 droite de la ligne blanche s\u00e9parant les deux voies du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord du terre-plein; n\u2019ayant pas le temps d\u2019appliquer utilement les freins, il obvia vers sa gauche mais ne put \u00e9viter de frapper Lefebvre avec l\u2019avant droit de son automobile qu\u2019il arr\u00eata imm\u00e9diatement pr\u00e8s de l\u2019accotement.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s d\u00e9clara les appelants responsables, en s\u2019appuyant exclusivement sur les dispositions de l\u2019art. 3 de la Loi d\u2019indemnisation des victimes d\u2019accidents d\u2019automobile, 1960\u201161 (Qu\u00e9.), 9-10 Eliz. II, c. 65, dont les alin\u00e9as pertinents aux questions soulev\u00e9es en cette cause se lisent comme suit:\n3. Le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une automobile est responsable de tout dommage caus\u00e9 par cette automobile ou par son usage, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne prouve\na) que le dommage n\u2019est imputable \u00e0 aucune faute de sa part ou de la part de la personne dans l\u2019automobile ou du conducteur de celle-ci, ou\nb) que lors de l\u2019accident l\u2019automobile \u00e9tait conduite par un tiers en ayant obtenu la possession par vol, ou\nc) que lors d\u2019un accident survenu en dehors d\u2019un chemin public l\u2019automobile \u00e9tait en la possession d\u2019un tiers pour remisage, r\u00e9paration ou transport.\nLe conducteur d\u2019une automobile est pareillement responsable \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne prouve que le dommage n\u2019est imputable \u00e0 aucune faute de sa part.\nLe juge a d\u2019abord consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le cas du conducteur, puis celui du pi\u00e9ton. En ce qui concerne la conduite de Bernard, l\u2019unique fait qu\u2019il a mentionn\u00e9 et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en son jugement n\u2019est pas celui de la vitesse, mais celui d\u2019avoir conduit avec un \u00e9clairage diminu\u00e9. L\u2019opinion qu\u2019il s\u2019est form\u00e9e sur cette question et la conclusion qu\u2019il en a tir\u00e9e apparaissent des extraits suivants du jugement:\nNow, I do not say that the circumstances of the headlights of the automobile driven by defendant, Bernard, i.e. on low and not on bright is a fault. What I do say is that it is up to the defendant to demonstrate that this was not a fault. And that, in my opinion, he has failed to do. Plus loin, il ajoute:\nTo repeat, in my view, the fact that the defendant, Bernard, was driving with his lights low, and not full, may or may not be a fault, but the law exacts that he must demonstrate not only that such a circumstance is not a fault but also that the damage was not imputable to such fault.\nEt il conclut finalement:\nIn the present case the driver, Bernard, has not proved that which the law requires and, therefore, must be held responsible for the damage. The same, of course, applies to the other defendant, the owner of the automobile, following the same provisions of the law.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019on voit que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019avoir conduit avec un \u00e9clairage diminu\u00e9 constituait une faute et une faute ayant caus\u00e9 ou ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 causer directement l\u2019accident, mais que Bernard n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli, comme il en avait le fardeau, que le fait d\u2019avoir ainsi conduit ne constituait pas une faute ayant ce caract\u00e8re et c\u2019est l\u00e0 la raison d\u00e9terminante du jugement. En somme, le jugement ne se fonde aucunement sur une faute prouv\u00e9e,\u2014\u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, aucune faute n\u2019y est m\u00eame mentionn\u00e9e,\u2014mais, et ce qui est bien diff\u00e9rent, sur le d\u00e9faut de Bernard de satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019onus probandi. Cette distinction, non sans pertinence en cet appel, est clairement formul\u00e9e par le vicomte Dunedin dans Robins v. National Trust Co.[2]:\nNow, in conducting any inquiry, the determining tribunal, be it judge or jury, will often find that the onus is sometimes on the side of one contending party, sometimes on the side of the other, or as it is often expressed, that in certain circumstances the onus shifts. But onus as a determining factor of the whole case can only arise if the tribunal finds the evidence pro and con so evenly balanced that it can come to no such conclusion. Then the onus will determine the matter. But if the tribunal, after hearing and weighing the evidence, comes to a determinate conclusion, the onus has nothing to do with it, and need not be further considered.\nD\u2019autre part et en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la conduite de Lefebvre, le juge fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019il avait pris des boissons alcooliques et que le degr\u00e9 d\u2019intoxication, dont il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au temps du second accident, n\u2019avait gu\u00e8re d\u2019importance\n\u2026except in so far as it explains why anyone would be so foolish as to cross a main highway at night in the face of an approaching automobile\u2026\nLe juge a retenu, comme \u00e9tabli, le fait que lorsque Bernard aper\u00e7ut Lefebvre, ce dernier \u00e9tait immobile au centre de la route et appr\u00e9cia ainsi cette circonstance:\nBut given that, in the present case, the victim, Lefebvre, was imprudent as demonstrated by his presence on the highway when it was evident, from the headlights, that traffic was approaching, it still must be shown that such imprudence contributed to the damages\u2026 In the present case, I find it impossible to do so\u2026 His imprudence, if any, was the remote not the proximate cause of the accident.\nL\u2019action de la demanderesse fut ainsi maintenue et les d\u00e9fendeurs condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019indemniser, ainsi que ses enfants, de tous les dommages leur r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Lefebvre.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine[3], constitu\u00e9e de MM. les juges Casey, Taschereau et Brossard. M. le juge Casey jugea que Lefebvre avait droit d\u2019\u00eatre sur la route, et que Bernard \u00e9tait en faute et le seul en faute parce que, ayant r\u00e9alis\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de mille pieds qu\u2019il y avait quelque chose d\u2019inusit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avant sur son chemin, il avait conduit \u00e0 une vitesse imprudente l\u2019emp\u00eachant de contr\u00f4ler sa voiture. Partageant ces vues, M. le juge Taschereau y ajouta que Bernard avait commis une imprudence en conduisant avec un \u00e9clairage diminu\u00e9. M. le juge Brossard jugea que cet accident \u00e9tait aussi imputable \u00e0 la conduite fautive de Lefebvre qu\u2019\u00e0 celle de Bernard et que celle du premier \u00e9tait au moins aussi grave que celle du second. Quant \u00e0 Bernard, il nota que les d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019avaient nullement expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas aper\u00e7u la victime \u00e0 au moins soixante-quinze pieds, ajoutant que s\u2019il l\u2019avait vue, comme il e\u00fbt pu la voir \u00e0 cette distance, il lui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de mieux tenter de l\u2019\u00e9viter. Quant \u00e0 Lefebvre, l\u2019opinion du savant juge appert de l\u2019extrait suivant de ses raisons de jugement:\nDans le cas sous \u00e9tude, il ne me para\u00eet pas que la pr\u00e9sence de Lefebvre sur la route, au moment o\u00f9 la collision s\u2019est produite, n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019occasion de la collision pour n\u2019avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat imm\u00e9diat d\u2019une faute de Lefebvre. Bien au contraire, il me para\u00eet que ce dernier, qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 immobile sur la route ou qu\u2019il s\u2019y soit trouv\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il la traversait, \u00e9tait en faute de s\u2019y trouver; on ne s\u2019aventure pas ou on ne se tient pas ainsi, la nuit, sur une route, sans s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elle est libre et, lorsque l\u2019on peut apercevoir les feux d\u2019une automobile qui s\u2019approche, si l\u2019on ne prend garde \u00e0 la distance \u00e0 laquelle elle se trouve et \u00e0 la rapidit\u00e9 avec laquelle elle s\u2019approche, sans commettre une imprudence d\u2019une exceptionnelle gravit\u00e9; avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019opinion qu\u2019un pi\u00e9ton a le droit de traverser la route ou de s\u2019y tenir dans de telles circonstances; l\u2019imprudencequ\u2019il commet et qui est ainsi reli\u00e9e directement \u00e0 l\u2019accident qui se produit ne perd ni son caract\u00e8re fautif ni son caract\u00e8re de cause de l\u2019accident pour l\u2019unique motif que l\u2019automobiliste e\u00fbt pu, s\u2019il n\u2019e\u00fbt pas lui-m\u00eame commis une faute, \u00e9viter l\u2019accident, la possibilit\u00e9 de cette faute de l\u2019automobiliste \u00e9tant pr\u00e9visible par le pi\u00e9ton, c\u2019est ainsi, du moins, que je comprends la jurisprudence constante de nos tribunaux dans leur application des principes de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile.\nEnfin, M. le juge Brossard rejeta, comme mal fond\u00e9e, l\u2019opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, voulant que la victime d\u2019un accident d\u2019automobile ou ceux \u00e0 qui la loi conf\u00e8re un droit d\u2019action en cas de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ne peuvent \u00eatre tenus, en raison de, l\u2019art. 3, supra, de la nouvelle loi, de supporter la partie des dommages attribuable \u00e0 la faute de la victime. Dans ces vues, M. le juge Brossard aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et modifi\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en r\u00e9duisant de moiti\u00e9 la condamnation aux dommages. De l\u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui entretiennent l\u2019opinion contraire, je dirais, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de M. le juge Brossard, que ce malheureux accident est imputable \u00e0 la faute de Bernard et \u00e0 celle de Lefebvre. Aux raisons qu\u2019il apporta au soutien de ses vues, j\u2019ajouterais une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces dispositions du Code de la Route, o\u00f9 la l\u00e9gislature a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les priorit\u00e9s, les droits et les obligations r\u00e9ciproques du pi\u00e9ton et du conducteur d\u2019automobile, sur un chemin public. En vigueur au temps de cet accident, ces dispositions sont reproduites aux Statuts Refondus du Qu\u00e9bec (1964), c. 231, art. 48, dont il suffira de citer ici le troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me alin\u00e9as de l\u2019art. 48(2):\nTout pi\u00e9ton qui traverse un chemin public ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 une intersection ou une zone de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 doit c\u00e9der la priorit\u00e9 de passage \u00e0 tous les v\u00e9hicules circulant sur le chemin public.\nNonobstant les dispositions ci-dessus, tout conducteur de v\u00e9hicule doit user de prudence pour \u00e9viter de heurter un pi\u00e9ton et doit redoubler de prudence quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019un enfant ou d\u2019une personne \u00e2g\u00e9e ou infirme.\nTel que d\u00e9finit \u00e0 l\u2019article 1 (17)\nles mots chemin public signifient la partie de tout pont, chemin, rue, place, carr\u00e9 ou autre terrain destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la circulation publique des v\u00e9hicules.\nCes dispositions statutaires de l\u2019art. 48(2) sanctionnent la justesse des observations faites par M. le juge Brossard, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne la faute contributive qu\u2019il attribua \u00e0 Lefebvre. Ce sont l\u00e0 les dispositions de la loi qui r\u00e9gissaient les droits et obligations de Lefebvre et de Bernard au moment, o\u00f9 cet accident allait incessamment se produire, et qui se produisit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce que Lefebvre ne s\u2019est pas plus souci\u00e9 de la priorit\u00e9 de passage du v\u00e9hicule de Bernard qu\u2019il ne para\u00eet s\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 de sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et parce que, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Bernard n\u2019a pas us\u00e9 de toute la prudence \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait tenu, pour \u00eatre en position d\u2019\u00e9viter de heurter Lefebvre.

(dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side)[4] affirming by a majority a judgment of Puddicombe J. in favour of the respondent for $38,746. Brossard J., dissenting in part, would have attributed one-half of the blame for the accident out of which the appeal arises to the deceased Nestor Lefebvre, who was the husband of the respondent, and would have reduced the amount of the judgment accordingly.\nNo question was raised in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or in this Court as to the amount at which the learned trial judge assessed the total damages. Counsel for the appellant argues that it should be held that the accident was caused solely by the fault of the deceased and that the action should be dismissed or, alternatively, that at least 75 per cent of the blame should be attributed to the deceased.\nThe facts are not complicated. The action arises out of an accident which occurred on the highway between Bel\u0153il and Montreal on September 22, 1962, at about 8.30 P.M. (daylight saving time). The appellant Bernard, who had borrowed the automobile of his son-in-law, the appellant Nadeau, was proceeding in open country along the highway from Bel\u0153il to Montreal. This is a divided highway, there being two lanes for traffic proceeding towards Montreal and two lanes for traffic proceeding in the other direction. The east-west and the west-east lanes are separated by a grass strip. The combined width of the two east-west lanes is about 25 feet. The night was dark but clear, the highway straight and level.\nWhile so proceeding, Bernard suddenly saw at a distance of from 15 to 20 feet in front of him the legs of a man who appeared to be standing directly in his path about 3 feet north of the broken line dividing the northerly and southerly lanes of the east-west half of the highway. He immediately swerved to his left, but did not have time to apply the brakes before the right front of his car struck the man, killing him and throwing his body to a point about 14 feet north of the northerly edge of the highway. Bernard after bringing his automobile to a stop on the north shoulder of the highway went back to look for the victim who was eventually found. He was the deceased Lefebvre.\nEarlier on the same evening Lefebvre had been involved in another accident with two other automobiles on the same highway. At the time of the accident which is in issue in this appeal, everyone concerned in the earlier accident except Lefebvre had left the scene. Lefebvre\u2019s automobile was in a roadway off the highway to the north. One of the police cars was about half a mile up the highway and the other police car had just left the scene. Lefebvre was last seen by the constable on the grass strip separating the eastbound and westbound sections of the highway.\nThe only eye-witness of the accident was the appellant Bernard. The learned trial judge accepted him as a credible witness telling the facts honestly as he recollected them. Bernard said that when about 2,000 feet from the point at which the accident occurred he was proceeding at a speed of about 52 miles per hour which he reduced to about 45 miles per hour because of seeing the flashing lights on the cars of the constable, that his eye-sight was good, that the brakes of the car he was driving were in excellent condition, that his lights were on low-beam and that he could give no reason for not having them on high-beam. He said that when on low-beam his light would illuminate for a distance of about 75 feet in front of his car. As the constable B\u00e9cotte had left Lefebvre on the grass strip between the two halves of the highway it would seem probable that prior to being struck the latter had been proceeding from the grass strip towards the north side of the highway. If so he would have been in Bernard\u2019s vision while walking somewhat more than 15 feet. Equally he would have been in Bernard\u2019s vision if, for some unexplained reason, he was standing still at the point where he was struck.\nIt is not necessary to expatiate on the negligence of Bernard. No judge in the courts below or in this court doubts that he was properly found to be at fault and that his fault was a direct cause of the fatality. Quite apart from the statutory onus cast upon him his failure to see the victim in ample time to avoid striking him is neither explained nor to be excused.\nThe only question of difficulty is whether it should be held that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. The onus of establishing an affirmative answer to that question was, of course, upon Bernard. It was for him to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that Lefebvre was negligent and that his negligence was a direct cause of the accident.\nIn my opinion he failed to do this, unless it can be asserted that an inference of negligence should be drawn against any pedestrian who is struck in or near the centre of a travelled highway at night-time by a car the lights of which are burning, a proposition which I am unable to accept.\nWhether it has been shown that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence which was a direct cause of the fatality is a question of fact and upon it there are concurrent findings in the courts below. I respectfully agree with the view of Brossard J. that s. 3 of the Highway Victims Indemnity Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 232, does not have the effect of depriving the owner or driver of an automobile which has struck a pedestrian of the benefit of the defence of contributory negligence; but the contrary view on this question of law expressed by Puddicombe J. does not invalidate his finding of fact expressed as follows:\nPer se, it is not negligent to be on a highway even on a dark night, it may be imprudent. But given that, in the present case the victim, Lefebvre, was imprudent as demonstrated by his presence on the highway when it was evident, from the headlights, that traffic was approaching, it still must be shown that such imprudence contributed to the damages before the victim, or his heirs, can be assessed to bear part of the award. In the present instance I find it impossible to do so. This was not the familiar example of the child, or for that matter, adult, unexpectedly and unforeseeably darting out onto the highway. All the evidence before the Court is that when the defendant, Bernard, first saw Lefebvre the latter was standing, motionless, about half-way across. His imprudence, if any, was the remote, not the proximate cause of the accident.\nIn the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench Casey J., after briefly reviewing the facts, said:\nOn these facts and without the help of any presumption I am of the opinion that Bernard alone was at fault.\nTaschereau J., after stating and leaving open the question of law on which Brossard J. had differed from Puddicombe J., summarized his view of the facts in the following sentence:\nToutefois, la question ne se pose pas dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce car, pour les motifs que j\u2019exposerai ci-apr\u00e8s, la preuve ne me justifierait pas de retenir une part de responsabilit\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9funt.\nIf Casey J. and Taschereau J. had not reached this conclusion on the facts it would, of course, have been necessary for them to deal with the question of law which they found it unnecessary to consider.\nThere is no need to re-examine the authorities formulating the rule which should guide a second appellate court when asked to reverse concurrent findings of fact in the courts below; stated in the terms least favourable to the respondent, those authorities establish that such findings should be accepted unless the second appellate court is satisfied that they are clearly wrong. It is of no importance that in the case at bar the learned judges in the courts below may have reached and expressed their findings in slightly differing ways; as was pointed out by Lord Dunedin giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Robins v. The National Trust Co.[5], \u201cthe rule is a rule as to concurrent findings, and not a rule as to concurrent reasons\u201d. Had I been charged with the task of deciding from the written record whether the defence had satisfied the onus of shewing that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence which was a direct cause of the accident I would have reached the same conclusion as have the courts below; but that is of little importance, I am certainly not satisfied that the concurrent findings of fact made by those courts were wrong.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppel maintenu en partie avec d\u00e9pens, si demand\u00e9s, les Juges CARTWRIGHT et ABBOTT \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fendeurs, appelants: Brais, Campbell, Pepper & Durand, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e: M.

Le devoir dont parle l\u2019article est celui \u00e9tabli par la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui est commun \u00e0 toute personne qui a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un bien.

Act, 1867, s. 125. The plaintiff sustained injuries when she fell on the sidewalk adjoining a property in Quebec City belonging to the government of Canada. She brought a petition of right against the Crown, and the parties agreed to submit to the Exchequer Court the following question of law: Is the Crown in right of Canada subject to the provisions of s. 417 of the Quebec City Charter which imposes on the proprietor of each immovable or property fronting on such sidewalk the obligation to maintain and repair the same? The question was answered in the affirmative by the Exchequer Court. The Crown appealed to this Court. It is argued for the plaintiff that s. 3(1)(b) of the Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 30, which imposes a liability for a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property, shows the intention of Parliament to submit the Crown to s. 417 of the Charter.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, and the question answered in the negative.\nSection 3(1)(b) of the Crown Liability Act does not apply. That section contemplates only the general duty arising out of the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property. It does not contemplate all duties which a legislature could impose on the owners of properties with respect to other properties\u2014such as in this case a sidewalk\u2014of which these have neither the ownership, nor the occupation, nor the possession, nor the control within the meaning of s.3(1)(b).\nFurthermore, since s. 417 of the Charter imposes a tax on the owner of the premises adjoining the sidewalk for the cost of its maintenance and repair, it is incompatible with the provisions of s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act which enacts that no lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], on a petition of right.

Si tel propri\u00e9taire n\u00e9glige de faire, refaire, entretenir ou r\u00e9parer, selon le cas, les trottoirs, le chef de police lui donnera avis, par \u00e9crit, de faire ce qui est prescrit au sujet de ces trottoirs\u2026 Si, dans les huit jours suivant l\u2019avis, les travaux requis auxdits trottoirs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, alors ces travaux seront faits par la corporation, qui peut s\u2019en faire rembourser le co\u00fbt par le propri\u00e9taire\u2026\nL\u2019intention qui ressort de cette r\u00e9daction assez fruste est que, dans le territoire municipal de Qu\u00e9bec, l\u2019entretien des trottoirs est une charge de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 riveraine. Corollairement, la conclusion non moins nette d\u00e9coulant du texte plus limpide de l\u2019art. 3(1)(b) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, est que la Couronne assume en tout point cette responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire qu\u00e9becois dans les limites de la Cit\u00e9.\nLa Cour doit donc r\u00e9pondre affirmativement \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e et d\u00e9cider que Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine aux droits du Canada est assujettie aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec qui impose au propri\u00e9taire de chaque immeuble ou terrain vis-\u00e0-vis un trottoir, l\u2019obligation de l\u2019entretenir et de le r\u00e9parer.\nEt le savant juge d\u2019ajouter en terminant:\nCette loi, assez r\u00e9cente, sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne (S.C. 1952-53, 1-2 Elizabeth II, c. 30) dont le contexte \u00e9limine toute disparit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale entre la Couronne et le sujet, a \u00e9t\u00e9 savamment \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge No\u00ebl de notre Cour dans la cause Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Deslauriers-Drago et Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine (1963) Ex. C.R. 289 \u00e0 la page 290, o\u00f9 il fut \u00e9crit, inter alia, que:\n3. L\u2019article 3(1)(b) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne pr\u00e9voit, par contre, une responsabilit\u00e9 directe \u00ab\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un manquement au devoir aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession, ou le contr\u00f4le des biens\u00bb. Une r\u00e9clamation non recevable contre la Couronne sous l\u2019article 3(1)(a) pourrait l\u2019\u00eatre sous l\u2019article 3(1)(b) par suite d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 directe du ma\u00eetre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9\u2026\nDe l\u00e0 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour.\nIl est admis \u00e9videmment que les dispositions de l\u2019art. 417 ne peuvent, proprio vigore, atteindre la Couronne aux droits du Canada. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9tention contraire viendrait en conflit avec des principes reconnus, tel celui qui, fond\u00e9 sur le caract\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ratif de notre syst\u00e8me de gouvernement, veut que la Couronne aux droits du Canada ne peut \u00eatre li\u00e9e par une loi \u00e9manant d\u2019une l\u00e9gislature provinciale et tel aussi ce principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui, gouver- nant dans toute juridiction l\u00e9gislative, veut qu\u2019aucune loi n\u2019affecte les droits ou pr\u00e9rogatives de la Couronne, que ce soit la Couronne aux droits du Canada ou la Couronne aux droits d\u2019une province, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne contienne une disposition expresse \u00e0 cet effet, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas de l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nAussi bien invoque-t-on, de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce statut f\u00e9d\u00e9ral: La Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne, o\u00f9 appara\u00eet, dit-on, dans les termes suivants de l\u2019art. 3(1)(b), la manifestation d\u2019une intention du Parlement de soumettre la Couronne aux droits du Canada aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec:\n3. (1) La Couronne est responsable \u00abin tort\u00bb des dommages dont elle serait responsable si elle \u00e9tait un particulier en \u00e9tat de majorit\u00e9 et de capacit\u00e9,\n(a) \u2026\n(b) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un manquement au devoir aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le des biens.\nDans la consid\u00e9ration de cette pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il importe, d\u2019une part, de pr\u00e9ciser le sens strict qu\u2019il convient de donner \u00e0 ces dispositions particuli\u00e8res de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en raison du fait qu\u2019elles affectent les droits et pr\u00e9rogatives de la Couronne et de d\u00e9terminer, d\u2019autre part, la nature exacte des prescriptions de l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 dont parle l\u2019art. 3(1)(b) est la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un manquement au devoir aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le des biens. Le texte, notons-le, dit au devoir et non aux devoirs. A mon avis, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un devoir bien identifi\u00e9, de ce devoir connu, \u00e9tabli par la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et commun, en toutes juridictions territoriales, \u00e0 toute personne qui a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un bien. C\u2019est un manquement \u00e0 ce devoir qui donna lieu au maintien de la p\u00e9tition de droit dans la cause de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Deslauriers-Drago et Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine[3], d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par M. le Juge No\u00ebl et cit\u00e9e au jugement a quo. Je ne crois pas que ce texte de l\u2019art. 3(1)(b) vise tous devoirs que, pr\u00e9sentement ou \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, par disposition sp\u00e9ciale et d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, toute l\u00e9gislature provinciale peut imposer, dans certaines localit\u00e9s, \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie particuli\u00e8re de propri\u00e9taires d\u2019immeubles ou de terrains, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains autres biens\u2014en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un trottoir\u2014dont ils n\u2019ont, au sens de l\u2019art. 3(1)(b) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ni la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le. Aussi bien, si cette interpr\u00e9tation est valide, cela suffit pour disposer de la question soumise et y r\u00e9pondre n\u00e9gativement.\nAssumant, par ailleurs, le mal fond\u00e9 de cette interpr\u00e9tation, je suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019il nous faut quand m\u00eame arriver \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion en raison des immunit\u00e9s aff\u00e9rentes au statut r\u00e9el des biens de la Couronne et de la nature particuli\u00e8re des prescriptions de l\u2019art. 417 dont il convient de reproduire le texte en entier:\n417. Dans toutes les rues de la cit\u00e9, les trottoirs doivent \u00eatre faits, entretenus et r\u00e9par\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire de chaque immeuble ou terrain vis-\u00e0-vis duquel ils doivent \u00eatre. Si tel propri\u00e9taire n\u00e9glige de faire, refaire, entretenir ou r\u00e9parer, selon le cas, les trottoirs, le chef de police lui donne avis, par \u00e9crit, de faire ce qui est requis au sujet de ces trottoirs. Cet avis doit \u00eatre adress\u00e9 ou laiss\u00e9 au domicile du propri\u00e9taire, s\u2019il est r\u00e9sident dans la cit\u00e9, ou chez l\u2019occupant de l\u2019immeuble, si tel propri\u00e9taire ne r\u00e9side pas dans la cit\u00e9; et si cet immeuble n\u2019a pas d\u2019occupant, l\u2019avis n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nSi, dans les huit jours suivant l\u2019avis, les travaux requis auxdits trottoirs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, alors ces travaux seront faits par la corporation, qui peut s\u2019en faire rembourser le co\u00fbt par le propri\u00e9taire. Cette somme est recouvrable comme une taxe, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et avec les m\u00eames privil\u00e8ges que toute autre taxe impos\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re dans la cit\u00e9; mais, le propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 moins de convention expresse contraire, n\u2019a pas le droit de s\u2019en faire rembourser une partie quelconque par son locataire.\nCes prescriptions imposent, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 au jugement a quo, une charge \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble riverain. Elles autorisent la Cit\u00e9, qui doit satisfaire \u00e0 cette charge \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du propri\u00e9taire de s\u2019en acquitter, \u00e0 recouvrer toute somme, alors d\u00e9bours\u00e9e par elle \u00e0 ces fins, comme une taxe, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et avec les m\u00eames privil\u00e8ges que toute autre taxe impos\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re dans la cit\u00e9. En somme, paraphrasant le langage de Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux dans la cause de Dame Coleman v. Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[4], ou bien le propri\u00e9taire riverain fera volontairement, \u00e0 m\u00eame ses deniers, les travaux prescrits, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un imp\u00f4t, ou bien, refusant ou n\u00e9gligeant d\u2019y proc\u00e9der, la Cit\u00e9 le fera \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens et pr\u00e9l\u00e8vera le montant par ex\u00e9cution, ce qui constitue encore un imp\u00f4t. Grevant l\u2019immeuble riverain d\u2019une charge d\u2019ordre p\u00e9cunier dont l\u2019ac- quittement est \u00e9ventuellement garanti par l\u2019imposition virtuelle d\u2019une taxe fonci\u00e8re, les dispositions de l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec sont incompatibles avec les immunit\u00e9s aff\u00e9rentes au statut r\u00e9el des biens de la Couronne. Impuissantes, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, \u00e0 atteindre, proprio vigore, la Couronne aux droits du Canada, ces dispositions de la l\u00e9gislature provinciale ne sauraient s\u2019y appliquer que par l\u2019intervention d\u2019une autre l\u00e9gislature dont la l\u00e9gislation, \u00e0 cet effet, serait explicite ou n\u00e9cessairement implicite et apte \u00e0 validement d\u00e9roger aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 125 du statut imp\u00e9rial, l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique, 1867 , prescrivant que:\n125. No Lands, or Property belonging to Canada, or any Province shall be liable to Taxation.\nLa l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, invoqu\u00e9e, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, n\u2019a pas ce caract\u00e8re. On peut noter particuli\u00e8rement que si les dispositions de l\u2019art. 3(1)(b) affectent, dans les cas et la mesure indiqu\u00e9s, les immunit\u00e9s aff\u00e9rentes au statut personnel de la Couronne, elles ne touchent aucunement les immunit\u00e9s aff\u00e9rentes au statut r\u00e9el de ses biens et ne sugg\u00e8rent aucune intention ou volont\u00e9 du Parlement d\u2019assujettir la Couronne aux droits du Canada \u00e0 des prescriptions ou impositions de la nature de celles \u00e9dict\u00e9es par l\u2019art. 417 de la Charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nAussi bien, je dirais, avec le plus grand respect pour l\u2019opinion du savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que je ne puis, pour les raisons ci-dessus, adopter la fa\u00e7on dont il a pos\u00e9 et solutionn\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me et donnerais \u00e0 la question soumise par les parties, une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative.\nJe maintiendrais l\u2019appel, infirmerais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et r\u00e9serverais l\u2019adjudication quant aux frais \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge de l\u2019instance principale, auquel le dossier sera retourn\u00e9.\nAppel maintenu.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: E.A.

Ce dernier contesta cet avis pour le motif que les formalit\u00e9s prescrites par la loi n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta cette contestation, et sa d\u00e9cision fut confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019Appel. L\u2019appelant en appela devant cette Cour et la municipalit\u00e9 a produit une requ\u00eate pour faire rejeter l\u2019appel.\nArr\u00eat: La requ\u00eate pour rejet de l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\nDans un langage clair et pr\u00e9cis, l\u2019article 1066e du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile d\u00e9clare que l\u2019expropri\u00e9 peut, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation, plaider que l\u2019expropriant n\u2019a pas le droit statutaire de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019expropriation, mais il ne peut pas plaider les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s ou ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s dans la proc\u00e9dure suivie pour exercer le droit \u00e0 ce recours. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le droit de la municipalit\u00e9 au recours de l\u2019expropriation n\u2019est pas et ne saurait \u00eatre contest\u00e9. Si l\u2019appel \u00e9tait actuellement entendu au m\u00e9rite suivant le cours ordinaire de la proc\u00e9dure, il serait rejet\u00e9.\nDe plus, cette Cour n\u2019a pas juridiction pour entendre l\u2019appel puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun montant en question et qu\u2019aucune permission d\u2019appeler n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e.\nAppeals\u2014Motion to quash\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Notice of expropriation\u2014Contestation\u2014Procedural irregularities\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 1066e.\nThe municipality served a notice of expropriation on the appellant. The latter contested this notice on the ground that the formalities prescribed by the law had not been observed. The Superior Court dismissed this contestation, and its decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to this Court and the municipality moved to quash the appeal.\nHeld: The motion to quash the appeal should be granted.\nIn a clear and precise language, art. 1066e of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the party being expropriated can oppose a notice of expropriation contesting the statutory right of the expropriating party to have recourse to expropriation, but cannot plead the irregularities or illegalities in the procedure followed. The municipality\u2019s statutory right was admitted. In view of this, if the appeal came on for hearing in the regular and ordinary way, it would be dismissed.\nFurthermore, this Court was without jurisdiction since there was no amount in controversy at this stage and leave to appeal was not asked.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Desmarais J.

Louis Langlais, c.r., pour la requ\u00e9rante-intim\u00e9e.\nGilles Geoffroy, pour l\u2019appelant.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une motion faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Corporation de la ville d\u2019Asbestos, pour obtenir le rejet du pr\u00e9sent appel log\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant sans permission pr\u00e9alable.\nLes faits et proc\u00e9dures conduisant \u00e0 cet appel sont tr\u00e8s simples. Au cours du mois de mars 1965, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fit signifier \u00e0 l\u2019appelant un avis d\u2019expropriation relativement \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui appartenant. L\u2019appelant contesta cet avis en Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Il plaida que les formalit\u00e9s prescrites par la loi n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es par la Corporation de la ville d\u2019Asbestos et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, que la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e le 19 janvier 1965 par son Conseil pour autoriser l\u2019expropriation de l\u2019immeuble en question, \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, nulle et de nul effet. En conclusion, il demanda \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gales, nulles et de nul effet la r\u00e9solution et l\u2019assembl\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, et de d\u00e9clarer aussi que l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta cette contestation. Elle consid\u00e9ra qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019art. 1066e du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, l\u2019expropri\u00e9 ne peut produire un plaidoyer, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation, que pour contester le droit de l\u2019expropriant au recours de l\u2019expropriation et qu\u2019au surplus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait, suivant la preuve, observ\u00e9, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, toutes les formalit\u00e9s prescrites par la loi pour l\u2019exercice du droit \u00e0 ce recours. La Cour d\u00e9clara que l\u2019avis \u00e9tait valide et d\u00e9f\u00e9ra le dossier \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie des services publics pour arbitrer le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nPort\u00e9e en appel, cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure fut confirm\u00e9e par un jugement unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine[2]. La ratio decidendi de ce jugement appara\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019extrait suivant des raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le juge Owen, avec le concours de ses coll\u00e8gues:\nIn my opinion Article 1066(e) C.P. (as amended by 1-2 Eliz. II Chap. 20) clearly provided that the notice of expropriation could only be opposed by contesting the right of the expropriating party to have recourse to expropriation and that this was the sole question that could be tried and adjudged on in virtue of such contestation. In the present litigation Hamel does not contest the right of the Town of Asbestos to have recourse to expropriation with respect to his property. Hamel contends that there were irregularities and illegalities in the procedure followed by the Town of Asbestos in exercising its right of expropriation. Such objections to procedure cannot in my opinion be raised on a contestation of the notice of expropriation.\nDe l\u00e0 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour.\nAu soutien de sa motion pour rejet d\u2019appel, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soumet que cet appel est frivole, qu\u2019il constitue une mesure dilatoire et pr\u00e9judiciable et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, cette Cour n\u2019a aucune juridiction vu que le prix ou la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant ou l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il peut avoir droit, sont ici nullement en question \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures d\u2019expropriation.\nSur le m\u00e9rite de la motion:\u2014Le droit de la Corporation intim\u00e9e au recours de l\u2019expropriation n\u2019est pas et ne saurait \u00eatre contest\u00e9. L\u2019article 1 de la Loi 21 George V, c. 134, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9e par la Loi 12-13 Elizabeth II, c. 88, y pourvoit. L\u2019article 4 de cette loi indique la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre:\n4. Au cas d\u2019expropriation, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sera fix\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie des services publics de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 laquelle juridiction sp\u00e9ciale est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente loi. L\u2019expropriation se fera suivant les articles 1066(a) et suivants du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nL\u2019article 1066d du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile d\u00e9clare que l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation est introductif d\u2019instance et l\u2019art. 1066e limite, dans les termes ci-apr\u00e8s de la version fran\u00e7aise et de la version anglaise, les moyens que l\u2019expropri\u00e9 peut opposer \u00e0 cet avis.\n1066e. L\u2019expropri\u00e9 ne peut produire un plaidoyer \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis que pour contester le droit de l\u2019expropriant au recours de l\u2019expropriation; dans ce cas, la cause est instruite et jug\u00e9e sur cette seule question et elle est soumise aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure applicables en mati\u00e8res sommaires.\n1066e. No party being expropriated may file any plea against the notice save to contest the right of the expropriating party to have recourse to expropriation; in such case, the case is tried and adjudged on that sole question and shall be subject to the rules of procedure applicable to summary matters.\nCette prohibition relative aux moyens de contestation est exprim\u00e9e dans un langage clair et pr\u00e9cis. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de recourir aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Donnant effet \u00e0 cette prohibition, je dirais, comme la Cour d\u2019appel en cette cause et, ant\u00e9rieurement, dans celle de Ministre de la Voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec v. Melcar Inc. et autre[3], qu\u2019au regard des termes de l\u2019article 1066e, l\u2019expropri\u00e9 peut, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis, plaider que l\u2019expropriant n\u2019a pas le droit statutaire de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019expropriation, mais non les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s ou ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s dans la proc\u00e9dure suivie pour exercer le droit \u00e0 ce recours. J\u2019ajouterais que si cet appel \u00e9tait actuellement entendu au m\u00e9rite suivant le cours ordinaire de la proc\u00e9dure, il me para\u00eet certain que cette Cour adopterait sur la question les m\u00eames vues que celles qui sont exprim\u00e9es aux raisons de jugement de M. le juge Owen. En pr\u00e9sence de cette situation, il convient, je crois, de suivre la r\u00e8gle de conduite adopt\u00e9e par cette Cour en pareil cas et ainsi formul\u00e9e par Sir Lyman P. Duff dans Laing v. The Toronto General Trusts Corporation[4]:\nIt is the settled course of this Court that when on a motion to quash it plainly appears to the Court that the appeal is one which, if it came on in the regular and ordinary way, must be dismissed, the Court will on that ground quash the appeal.\nAssumant m\u00eame le mal fond\u00e9 des vues qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je dirais que, pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s, cette Cour n\u2019a pas juridiction. Le droit statutaire de la Corporation au recours de l\u2019expropriation est admis par l\u2019appelant; le prix ou la valeur de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou le montant \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il peut avoir droit, sont, \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures, nullement en question et \u00e9trangers \u00e0 la mati\u00e8re en litige dans cet appel o\u00f9 la seule question pos\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant est de savoir s\u2019il a droit de plaider, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation, les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure. Il n\u2019y a donc aucun montant ou valeur en jeu et, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une permission d\u2019appeler qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e, cette Cour n\u2019a pas juridiction pour entendre cet appel.\nJe maintiendrais la motion pour rejet d\u2019appel, avec d\u00e9pens.\nRequ\u00eate accord\u00e9e.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant: J.G.

Les appelants bl\u00e2ment le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie qui, ayant modifi\u00e9 le trac\u00e9 de la route, a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer que la position des madriers, plac\u00e9s entre les rails pour faciliter le passage des v\u00e9hicules, soit elle-m\u00eame modifi\u00e9e pour correspondre \u00e0 ce changement; ce qui eut pour r\u00e9sultat de laisser un espace vide entre les rails. Une des roues du camion tomba dans cet espace et le camion fut immobilis\u00e9. Il est plaid\u00e9 contre les appelants que non seulement ils \u00e9taient au courant de la situation, mais qu\u2019aux termes m\u00eames du contrat qu\u2019ils avaient pass\u00e9 avec le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie et en vertu duquel ils avaient assum\u00e9 l\u2019entretien des chemins d\u2019hiver, l\u2019obligation de rem\u00e9dier au danger retombait sur leurs \u00e9paules. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu que les appelants n\u2019avaient commis aucune faute et que le minist\u00e8re devait payer tous les dommages. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel qui rejeta la p\u00e9tition de droit. Les demandeurs en appel\u00e8rent devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et la responsabilit\u00e9 partag\u00e9e, le Juge Abbott \u00e9tant dissident.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Cartwright, Fauteux et Martland: La faute du minist\u00e8re qui avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette condition dangereuse est manifeste. Cependant, les appelants doivent supporter en partie la responsabilit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maladroits sinon imprudents et que leur conduite, avec la faute du minist\u00e8re, a concouru \u00e0 l\u2019accident. La d\u00e9fense du minist\u00e8re, fond\u00e9e sur le contrat, ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. Il en r\u00e9sulte que les dommages doivent \u00eatre support\u00e9s dans une proportion d\u2019un tiers par les appelants et de deux tiers par le minist\u00e8re.\nLe Juge Abbott, dissident: Les conclusions de faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019Appel n\u2019\u00e9taient pas erron\u00e9es.\nNegligence\u2014Roads Department\u2014Contract for snow clearance\u2014Dangerous level crossing\u2014Knowledge and acceptance of risk\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Civil Code, art. 1053.\nBy their petition of right, the appellants claimed the damages they suffered when their truck, which they were using to clear the snow pursuant to a contract with the Roads Department, became stuck in a hole at a level crossing and was hit by a train. They argued that when the Roads Department altered the location of the road at that point it failed to move the planks between the rails and thereby left a space between them. One of the wheels of the truck fell in that space and the truck was immobilized. It is argued against the appellants that not only were they aware of the situation but that by the very terms of their contract with the Department under which they assumed the maintenance of the winter roads, the obligation to remedy the danger fell on their shoulders. The trial judge came to the conclusion that the appellants had committed no fault and that the Department should pay all damages. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal which rejected the petition of right. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the liability apportioned between the appellants and the Department.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux and Martland JJ.: The fault of the Department which had created this dangerous situation was manifest. However, the appellants must support part of the liability because they were clumsy if not imprudent and because their conduct, together with the Department\u2019s fault, combined to cause the accident. The defence of the Department, based on the contract, could not be accepted. In the result, the damages must be apportioned, one third to be borne by the appellants and two thirds by the Department.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: The conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal were not erroneous.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Lizotte J.

Lorsque le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie effectua ce changement au trac\u00e9 de la route, il n\u00e9gligea de faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer que la position des madriers, plac\u00e9s entre les rails pour faciliter le passage des v\u00e9hicules, soit elle-m\u00eame modifi\u00e9e pour correspondre \u00e0 ce changement. Il en r\u00e9sulta que les madriers ne couvraient plus toute la crois\u00e9e et que, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est, on laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert entre les rails, \u00e0 un niveau d\u2019environ huit pouces plus bas que le reste, un quadrilat\u00e8re d\u2019une longueur \u00e9gale \u00e0 la largeur de la voie ferr\u00e9e et d\u2019une largeur variant de deux \u00e0 environ six pieds. En largeur, la route mesurait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s trente-six pieds et le pavage de la traverse, vis-\u00e0-vis la route, mesurait environ dix-huit pieds. Telle \u00e9tait la situation lorsque, \u00e0 l\u2019approche de l\u2019hiver, on suspendit les travaux et telle demeura la situation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une quinzaine de jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, alors qu\u2019on y rem\u00e9dia en adaptant la position des madriers au changement du trac\u00e9 de la route et en fixant sur celle-ci des oteaux de fer pour diriger la circulation.\nAu moment de l\u2019accident, les appelants, G\u00e9rard Hudon et son fr\u00e8re Fernand, proc\u00e9daient \u00e0 l\u2019enl\u00e8vement de la neige, pour le compte du minist\u00e8re de la Voirie, avec leur camion muni d\u2019une charrue \u00e0 l\u2019avant et d\u2019une aile \u00e0 la droite. Il avait vent\u00e9 toute la journ\u00e9e et la neige s\u2019\u00e9tait accumul\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la crois\u00e9e, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est de la voie ferr\u00e9e. Au cours de cette op\u00e9ration de d\u00e9neigement, la roue arri\u00e8re droite du camion s\u2019est prise dans ce trou de huit pouces de profondeur qu\u2019il y avait de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9. Notons incidemment que maintes fois avant ce jour-l\u00e0, Hudon \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit, avec son camion, sans que jamais tel incident se produise, une neige durcie entre les rails comblait ce trou. Hudon fit plusieurs tentatives pour sortir le camion de cette impasse et y travaillait encore lorsque apercevant soudainement la venue d\u2019un train, il dut abandonner son camion sur la voie ferr\u00e9e, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l\u2019on sait. De l\u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation en dommages.\nVoici, en substance, les reproches que se font mutuellement les parties. Les appelants, d\u2019une part, reprochent au minist\u00e8re de n\u2019avoir pas pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer que ce vide entre les rails soit combl\u00e9 et que cette traverse \u00e0 niveau ne soit pas dangereuse pour la circulation et de n\u2019avoir plac\u00e9 aucune indication pour signaler cette absence de pav\u00e9 entre les rails sur une certaine partie de la traverse. Le minist\u00e8re, d\u2019autre part, apr\u00e8s avoir ni\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les pr\u00e9tentions des appelants, plaida sp\u00e9cialement que, lors de la suspension des travaux en novembre, on avait plac\u00e9 sur le chemin, au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud-est du passage, un tr\u00e9teau mobile ray\u00e9 noir et blanc et ayant douze pieds de longueur, que ce tr\u00e9teau constituait une indication appropri\u00e9e pour mettre en garde les usagers de la route contre les risques possibles et qu\u2019au surplus, les appelants qui avaient, par contrat avec le minist\u00e8re, en date du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1960, assum\u00e9 l\u2019entretien des chemins d\u2019hiver, \u00e9taient non seulement au courant de la situation mais avaient, aux termes de ce contrat, l\u2019obligation de voir \u00e0 ce que ce tr\u00e9teau demeure l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 \u00e0 la suspension des travaux. En somme, dit l\u2019intim\u00e9, cet accident et les dommages en r\u00e9sultant sont dus \u00e0 la faute, l\u2019imprudence, la n\u00e9gligence ou la maladresse des appelants.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e9ra que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, le minist\u00e8re pouvait bien avoir plac\u00e9 un tr\u00e9teau, \u00e0 la suspension des travaux, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y en avait plus depuis l\u2019hiver; qu\u2019ant\u00e9rieurement aux tomb\u00e9es de neige, Hudon avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer aux ing\u00e9nieurs de la Voirie le danger que pr\u00e9sentait cette traverse \u00e0 niveau, qu\u2019on en avait rien fait, sauf de dire que la situation serait corrig\u00e9e; que les ing\u00e9nieurs semblaient dire qu\u2019ils attendaient apr\u00e8s ceux qui avaient autorit\u00e9 sur la question, soit la Compagnie des chemins de fer ou la Commission des transports, alors qu\u2019en fait, on n\u2019a m\u00eame pas prouv\u00e9 que ceux-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s du changement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 ce passage \u00e0 niveau par suite de la modification du trac\u00e9 de la route. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance exprima aussi l\u2019avis que le contrat d\u2019entretien des chemins d\u2019hiver n\u2019avait pas pour objet ou effet d\u2019obliger les appelants \u00e0 faire les changements qui s\u2019imposaient \u00e0 la traverse ou \u00e0 aviser la Compagnie des chemins de fer, ou \u00e0 faire \u00e9mettre une ordonnance par la Commission des transports; c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 l\u2019obligation du minist\u00e8re. Le juge conclut que les appelants n\u2019ont commis aucune faute et que le minist\u00e8re, qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame cet \u00e9tat dangereux auquel l\u2019accident doit \u00eatre attribuable, doit, en cons\u00e9quence, payer tous les dommages en r\u00e9sultant.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9, la Cour du banc de la reine[3] se fondant sur les raisons qui apparaissent aux deux paragraphes ci-apr\u00e8s des notes donn\u00e9es par M. Le juge en chef Tremblay, avec l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues:\nAvec respect, je crois que le premier juge a fait erreur en ignorant compl\u00e8tement le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 G\u00e9rard Hudon connaissait parfaitement l\u2019existence du danger \u2026\n* * * Le seul fait d\u2019effectuer des r\u00e9parations sur une route et d\u2019y cr\u00e9er un danger n\u2019est pas en soi une faute. Ce qui constitue une faute, c\u2019est d\u2019y permettre la circulation sans aviser les usagers du danger. On porte \u00e0 leur connaissance ce danger et il est raisonnable de penser qu\u2019ils l\u2019\u00e9viteront. Mais si celui qui circule conna\u00eet d\u00e9j\u00e0 parfaitement le danger, le d\u00e9faut d\u2019avis ne saurait \u00eatre la cause de l\u2019accident. Il en serait tout autrement s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une personne ne passant qu\u2019occasionnellement sur cette route. Il ne faut pas oublier que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019une des personnes ayant assum\u00e9 l\u2019obligation d\u2019enlever la neige sur cette route. Elle connaissait parfaitement l\u2019existence du danger. Elle conduisait une machine dont elle connaissait ou devait conna\u00eetre la puissance. Elle a cru pouvoir surmonter l\u2019obstacle comme elle l\u2019avait fait plusieurs fois auparavant. Malheureusement, elle a fait erreur. Elle est seule \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer.\nDe l\u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nAvec le plus grand respect pour ceux qui entretiennent l\u2019opinion contraire, je ne puis concourir dans le jugement rendu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nExcluant de la consid\u00e9ration, pour l\u2019instant, la d\u00e9fense qu\u2019on entend fonder sur le contrat, je dirais que Hudon, d\u2019une part, connaissait la condition dangereuse dans laquelle le minist\u00e8re avait laiss\u00e9 le passage \u00e0 niveau lors de la suspension des travaux; en fait, il en avait averti les ing\u00e9nieurs. Et je dirais que le minist\u00e8re, d\u2019autre part, connaissait aussi cette condition dangereuse; c\u2019est lui qui l\u2019avait cr\u00e9\u00e9e et c\u2019est lui qui avait fait placer un tr\u00e9teau, \u00e0 la suspension des travaux. Ce soir-l\u00e0, G\u00e9rard Hudon, appr\u00e9cia-t-il dans toute son \u00e9tendue le risque qu\u2019il allait courir et qui en fait s\u2019est r\u00e9alis\u00e9, et en accepta-t-il toutes les cons\u00e9quences? L\u2019erreur qu\u2019il a commise en croyant qu\u2019il pouvait, comme avant, passer sans difficult\u00e9, doit\u2011elle \u00eatre retenue comme faute causale de cet accident et cette faute doit-elle, en quelque sorte, absorber la n\u00e9gligence manifeste du minist\u00e8re \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier au danger qu\u2019il cr\u00e9a \u00e0 cette traverse, au point de dire que cette faute de n\u00e9gligence n\u2019a pas concouru \u00e0 l\u2019accident? Les faits de cette cause ne manquent pas d\u2019analogie avec ceux qui se pr\u00e9sentaient dans celle de Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada v. St-Jacquess[4]. St-Jacques \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada comme gardien de nuit d\u2019un \u00e9difice. Outre la surveillance qu\u2019il devait en faire, Tun de ses devoirs \u00e9tait de voir au chauffage, l\u2019enl\u00e8vement et le transport des cendres. Pour le transport des cendres, il utilisait une brouette et avait \u00e0 gravir une passerelle inclin\u00e9e et large de dix\u2011huit pouces, afin d\u2019atteindre la plate-forme d\u2019o\u00f9 les cendres \u00e9taient d\u00e9vers\u00e9es. A la date de l\u2019accident, et d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis quelques jours, la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique qui devait \u00e9clairer cette passerelle ne fonctionnait plus. St-Jacques en avait inform\u00e9 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, un nomm\u00e9 Lamothe, qui n\u00e9gligea d\u2019y voir, de sorte que, dans cette situation, St-Jacques utilisait un fanal \u00e0 l\u2019huile dont l\u2019\u00e9clairage \u00e9tait insuffisant. Cette nuit-l\u00e0, jugeant mal sa position dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 et croyant avoir atteint la plate-forme alors qu\u2019en fait, il \u00e9tait encore sur la passerelle, il y d\u00e9posa sa brouette avec le r\u00e9sultat que celle-ci chavira dans le vide et l\u2019entra\u00eena dans sa chute. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance jugea que l\u2019accident \u00e9tait exclusivement d\u00fb au non fonctionnement de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique et que la n\u00e9gligence du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier rendait celui-ci responsable des dommages subis. Ce jugement fut maintenu par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel, alors compos\u00e9e de MM. les juges Galipeault, Tellier, L\u00e9tourneau, Howard et Hall, ces deux derniers \u00e9tant dissidents. R\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la conduite de St-Jacques, M. le juge Galipeault note, \u00e0 la page 22:\nIl a cru qu\u2019il pouvait en toute s\u00fbret\u00e9 accomplir son travail, mais il a fait erreur.\net Sir Mathias Tellier, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, dit, \u00e0 la page 23:\nLe demandeur a cru qu\u2019il pourrait s\u2019acquitter de cette t\u00e2che, en s\u2019\u00e9clairant de son fanal \u00e0 l\u2019huile. L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement a prouv\u00e9 que cet \u00e9clairage \u00e9tait insuffisant.\nCes deux juges n\u2019en ont pas moins tenu le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada seul responsable de cet accident en raison de la n\u00e9gligence de Lamothe. Pour sa part, M. le juge L\u00e9tourneau jugea que c\u2019\u00e9tait sciemment et volontairement que St-Jacques s\u2019\u00e9tait aventur\u00e9 nonobstant l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 dans un endroit dangereux et, pour cette raison, il aurait partag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019eut-il pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait emp\u00each\u00e9 par les plaidoiries \u00e9crites. Dissident, M. le juge Howard, avec l\u2019accord de M. le juge Hall, trouva que la doctrine volenti non fit injuria devait recevoir son application et que Taction de St-Jacques aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada en appela \u00e0 cette Cour[5] qui rejeta l\u2019appel, tout en exprimant l\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une cause o\u00f9 la responsabilit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre partag\u00e9e et o\u00f9 les dommages devaient \u00eatre support\u00e9s dans une proportion de un cinqui\u00e8me par St-Jacques et de quatre cinqui\u00e8mes par le Trust G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, je suis d\u2019opinion, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que la faute du minist\u00e8re est manifeste. Je ne crois pas, cependant, que G\u00e9rard Hudon soit exempt de tout reproche. A mon avis, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maladroit sinon imprudent et sa conduite, avec la faute du minist\u00e8re, a concouru \u00e0 l\u2019accident. Il en r\u00e9sulte que, \u00e0 moins que la d\u00e9fense que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fonde sur le contrat ne soit accept\u00e9e, la responsabilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre partag\u00e9e et les dommages doivent \u00eatre support\u00e9s selon la gravit\u00e9 des fautes respectives, soit dans une proportion d\u2019un tiers par les appelants et deux tiers par l\u2019intim\u00e9, du montant total estim\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance et non contest\u00e9 en cet appel.\nTel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense qu\u2019on a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 fonder sur le contrat. La Cour d\u2019appel, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, n\u2019a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au contrat que pour d\u00e9montrer le fait que G\u00e9rard Hudon connaissait l\u2019\u00e9tat dangereux de la traverse. L\u2019objet de ce contrat est l\u2019entretien des chemins d\u2019hiver et, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, il m\u2019est impossible de voir, dans les dispositions invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019expression d\u2019une intention commune aux parties, suivant laquelle les fr\u00e8res Hudon auraient fait leur l\u2019obligation qu\u2019avait le minist\u00e8re de prendre les mesures pour rem\u00e9dier au danger qu\u2019il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 ou auraient accept\u00e9 comme leur la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de la n\u00e9gligence du minist\u00e8re \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 cette obligation.\nPour ces raisons, je maintiendrais l\u2019appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine et, modifiant le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance pour partager la responsabilit\u00e9 dans la proportion ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9e, condamnerais l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 payer aux appelants une somme de $8,533.34, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter de la signification de la requ\u00eate demandant l\u2019autorisation d\u2019exercer le pr\u00e9sent recours en dommages; et recommanderais \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer les d\u00e9pens d\u2019une action de ce montant, dans toutes les Cours.\nLE JUGE ABBOTT (dissident):\u2014Les appelants interjettent appel d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine[6] rejetant avec d\u00e9pens leur p\u00e9tition de droit. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure du district de Kamouraska, par un jugement en date du 4 juillet 1963, avait maintenu la p\u00e9tition de droit et recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer aux appelants la somme de $12,800 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens.\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 1960, par un contrat conclu entre le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et les appelants, ceux-ci s\u2019engageaient \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter \u00abl\u2019entreprise qui a pour objet le d\u00e9neigement, l\u2019enl\u00e8vement de neige durcie et de glace, etc.\u00bb sur la route num\u00e9ro 2A, comprenant le passage \u00e0 niveau o\u00f9 eut lieu l\u2019accident dont se plaignent les appelants.\nAvant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1960, la route reliant St-Pac\u00f4me \u00e0 Ste-Anne de la Pocati\u00e8re \u00e9tait oblique par rapport \u00e0 la voie ferr\u00e9e qu\u2019elle croisait. Pour permettre le passage des v\u00e9hicules, on avait dispos\u00e9 des madriers entre les rails sur toute la largeur de la route. Vers la fin de 1960, le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie modifiait le trac\u00e9 de la route de fa\u00e7on que celle-ci soit perpendiculaire \u00e0 la voie ferr\u00e9e. Il en r\u00e9sulta que les madriers ne couvraient plus toute la crois\u00e9e et laissaient \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert \u00e0 un niveau d\u2019environ 8 pouces plus bas que le reste de la crois\u00e9e un quadrilat\u00e8re d\u2019une largeur variant de deux pieds \u00e0 environ six pieds.\nLe 11 janvier 1961, vers 8 h. 30 du soir, l\u2019appelant G\u00e9rard Hudon effectuait des travaux d\u2019enl\u00e8vement de la neige avec un camion muni d\u2019une charrue. Alors qu\u2019il traversait la voie ferr\u00e9e, la roue droite arri\u00e8re du camion passa \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des madriers et tomba dans la d\u00e9pression d\u00e9crite ci-dessus. Un train survint et l\u2019appelant G\u00e9rard Hudon dut abandonner sur la voie le camion qui fut d\u00e9truit.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu la p\u00e9tition de droit des appelants pour le motif que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 un \u00e9tat dangereux qui fut la cause de l\u2019accident subi par les appelants.\nLe jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure fut cass\u00e9 par un jugement unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine pour le motif que les appelants, et plus particuli\u00e8rement G\u00e9rard Hudon, connaissaient parfaitement l\u2019existence du danger et par cons\u00e9quent G\u00e9rard Hudon est seul \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer. La Cour ajoute que G\u00e9rard Hudon qui conduisait le camion a cru pouvoir surmonter l\u2019obstacle, comme il l\u2019avait fait plusieurs fois auparavant.\nLes appelants ne m\u2019ont pas satisfait que ces conclusions de faits sont erron\u00e9es et par cons\u00e9quent je rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel maintenu, LE JUGE ABBOTT \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, appelants: Letarte, St-Hilaire, De Blois, De Ban\u00e9, Proulx & Parent, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9: Louis Dugal, Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.\n[1] [1965] B.R. 886.\n[2] [1965] B.R. 886.\n[3] [1965] B.R. 886.\n[4] (1931), 50 B.R. 18.\n[5] [1931] R.C.S. 711.\n[6] [1965] B.R. 886.",

L\u2019appelant a alors obtenu la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref de prohibition par un jugement d\u00e9clarant simplement que \u00able tribunal se croit justifi\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de prohibition\u00bb.

Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait d\u2019avoir, contrairement au Code du travail, accord\u00e9 pour un motif susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 mal fond\u00e9 en droit, une indemnit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle que le Code prescrit, constitue une cause de revision, les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission \u00e9tant sans appel.\nLabour\u2014Jurisdiction of the Quebec Labour Relations Board\u2014Employee illegally dismissed\u2014Order to reinstate\u2014Indemnity lower than that prescribed by the statute\u2014Error in law\u2014Jurisdiction to revise\u2014Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, ss. 14, 117.\nThe Quebec Labour Relations Board found that the mis-en-cause had been illegally dismissed, that he should be reinstated in his employ but that the indemnity payable under s. 14 of the Labour Code should be reduced. Subsequently, the Board decided, on a petition for revision, that it had jurisdiction to hear the parties on the petition for revision. The appellant company then obtained the issuance of a writ of prohibition by a judgment which merely declared that the tribunal believed it was justified in authorizing the issuance of a writ of prohibition. The writ was set aside by the Court of Appeal, and the appellant company was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAn error in law committed by the Quebec Labour Relations Board can constitute, under s. 117 of the Labour Code, a valid cause for revision of one of its decisions. In the present case, the fact that the Board had, contrary to the Labour Code, awarded on a ground susceptible of being adjudged ill-founded in law, an indemnity lower than that prescribed by the Code, constituted a cause for revision, the decisions of the Board not being subject to appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, setting aside a writ of prohibition.

Le 2 mai 1966, la Commission rendait une d\u00e9cision \u00e9labo- r\u00e9e en conclusion de laquelle l\u2019objection pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e, et il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Commission a juridiction pour entendre les parties sur la requ\u00eate en revision.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision que l\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref de prohibition. Cette demande lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par un jugement du 26 mai 1966 dans lequel il est seulement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00abque le Tribunal se croit justifi\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de prohibition\u00bb. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 sommairement par deux juges de la Cour du banc de la reine sur requ\u00eate \u00abVu les articles 117, 121 et 122 du Code du Travail\u00bb. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ce dernier jugement que l\u2019appelante s\u2019est pourvue devant cette Cour.\nIl convient tout d\u2019abord de faire observer que par l\u2019art. 847 du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, on a consacr\u00e9 l\u00e9gislativement la r\u00e8gle formul\u00e9e dans Ville de Montr\u00e9al c. Benjamin News[1], \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019avant d\u2019autoriser la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref de prohibition le juge doit statuer sur le droit. Il ne suffit pas qu\u2019il lui paraisse que les pr\u00e9tentions du requ\u00e9rant sont soutenables, il faut qu\u2019il en vienne \u00e0 la conclusion ferme qu\u2019elles sont, \u00e0 son avis, bien fond\u00e9es en droit en regard des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Et pour qu\u2019on ne puisse obtenir la d\u00e9livrance du bref par des all\u00e9gations fantaisistes, le nouveau Code a permis de contre-interroger le requ\u00e9rant sur son affidavit (art. 93). C\u2019est en regard de ces r\u00e8gles-relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance du bref qu\u2019il faut examiner l\u2019arr\u00eat qui l\u2019a annul\u00e9.\nPour rendre la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e, la Commission des relations de travail du Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 117 du Code du travail:\n117. La Commission peut, pour cause, reviser ou r\u00e9voquer toute d\u00e9cision et tout ordre rendus par elle et tout certificat qu\u2019elle a \u00e9mis.\nLa premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 examiner est la suivante: le fait d\u2019avoir, contrairement au Code du \u2018 travail, accord\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant pour un motif susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 mal fond\u00e9 en droit, une indemnit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle que ce Code prescrit, peut-il constituer une \u00abcause\u00bb de revision?\nPour soutenir qu\u2019il n\u2019en est pas ainsi l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que le pouvoir de revision accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le pouvoir de revision accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de faillite (Loi sur la faillite, art. 144, para. 5) et elle cite les arr\u00eats o\u00f9 l\u2019on a jug\u00e9 que celui-ci ne peut s\u2019exercer que lorsque des faits nouveaux sont invoqu\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9faut de cet argument c\u2019est que l\u2019analogie entre la Cour de faillite et la Commission des relations de travail est inexacte: dans le premier cas il y a droit d\u2019appel et non dans le second. En mati\u00e8re de faillite la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir de revision d\u00e9coule du principe qu\u2019un tel pouvoir ne doit pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019appel est le recours appropri\u00e9. Or, l\u2019appel est le recours tout indiqu\u00e9 au cas d\u2019erreur de droit. Dans le cas de la Commission des relations de travail, comme ses d\u00e9cisions sont sans appel, rien ne permet de soutenir que l\u2019erreur de droit ne saurait constituer une \u00abcause\u00bb de revision. Il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019observer que dans un cas o\u00f9 aucun pouvoir de revision n\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu par la loi, cette Cour a cependant reconnu \u00e0 un organisme investi du pouvoir d\u2019attribuer un prix, le droit de rectifier la d\u00e9cision du jury d\u2019un concours afin de la rendre conforme au v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9sultat au lieu de laisser substituer une injustice fond\u00e9e sur des erreurs de calcul. (L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Musique c. Payment[2]).\nEn \u00e9tant venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une erreur de droit peut constituer une cause valable de revision d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission des relations de travail, il n\u2019est pas indispensable d\u2019examiner les autres questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues. Cependant, il para\u00eet utile de pr\u00e9ciser que cela ne signifie pas que chaque fois que l\u2019on voudra pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas erreur de droit ou autre cause suffisante en droit pour motiver la revision d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission, l\u2019on pourra soutenir devant les tribunaux qu\u2019elle a, en le faisant, exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le pouvoir qui lui est attribu\u00e9 comprend le droit d\u2019appliquer toutes les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives touchant des mati\u00e8res de sa comp\u00e9tence.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: Gagn\u00e9, Trottier, Letarte, Larue & Royer, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Turgeon, Amyot, Choquette & Lesage, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1965] B.R. 376.\n[2] [1936] R.C.S. 323, 4 D.L.R. 279.",

La compagnie a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa Commission des relations de travail du Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a pas outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative avait \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e. Une interpr\u00e9tation contraire irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un principe fondamental du Code du travail qui est de confier exclusivement \u00e0 la Commission le soin de statuer sur les demandes d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation, ce qui implique que c\u2019est \u00e0 elle qu\u2019il appartient de juger dans chaque cas si l\u2019on s\u2019est conform\u00e9 aux prescriptions du Code du travail.

The Board granted the certification, without a hearing, on the ground, inter alia, that the applicant had satisfied the conditions provided in the Labour Code and in the rules of the Board. The appellant company then applied for the issuance of a writ of prohibition and invoked (1) the failure to file with the application the documents mentioned in s. 23 of the Labour Code, and (2) the breach of the rule audi alteram partem. The writ was issued by the Superior Court, but was subsequently set aside by the Court of Appeal. The appellant company was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Quebec Labour Relations Board did not exceed its jurisdiction when it decided that a legislative provision had been observed. A contrary interpretation would be against one of the fundamental principles of the Labour Code which is to clothe the Board with the exclusive jurisdiction to pass on applications for certification. This implies that it is part of the Board\u2019s functions to decide in each case whether the provisions of the Labour Code have been complied with. In the present case, the application of s. 23 fell within the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe obligation imposed by the rule audi alteram partem is to give to the party the opportunity to present its case. In the present case, faced with a contestation raising a question of law only, the Board did not misuse its discretion in deciding that it did not need to hear further submissions before rendering its decision.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, setting aside a writ of prohibition.

A l\u2019encontre de cette demande dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment pr\u00e9venue par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019appelante lui a transmis une contestation intitul\u00e9e \u00abinscription en droit\u00bb et par laquelle elle conclut au rejet pour l\u2019unique motif que la requ\u00eate de la mise-en-cause \u00abn\u2019\u00e9tait pas accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une copie certifi\u00e9e de sa constitution et de ses r\u00e8glements ni d\u2019un \u00e9tat des conditions d\u2019admission, droits d\u2019entr\u00e9e et cotisations exig\u00e9s de ses membres\u00bb. L\u00e0-dessus l\u2019intim\u00e9e a accord\u00e9 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation sans audition par les motifs suivants.\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la Commission a pris connaissance de la contestation soumise par les procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en date du 22 mars 1966;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la Commission a constat\u00e9 que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans ladite contestation sont contredits par le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de son service d\u2019inspection;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que l\u2019association requ\u00e9rante a satisfait aux conditions pr\u00e9vues par le Code du Travail et par les r\u00e8glements de la Commission pour avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation.\nA l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision, l\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 un bref de prohibition en invoquant deux moyens:\n1\u00b0 inex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation impos\u00e9e par le Code du travail de produire avec la requ\u00eate les pi\u00e8ces sus-mentionn\u00e9es;\n2\u00b0 violation de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem.\nL\u00e0 Cour sup\u00e9rieure a ordonn\u00e9 la d\u00e9livrance du bref de prohibition comme suit:\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les faits mentionn\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate, le Tribunal se croit justifi\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de prohibition.\nEn vertue de l\u2019art. 122 du Code du travail, deux juges de la Cour du banc de la reine ont annul\u00e9 le bref par les motifs suivants.\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la Commission avait seule le pouvoir de prononcer sur le point soulev\u00e9 par la K S L;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que m\u00eame si les affirmations contenues dans les consid\u00e9rants attaqu\u00e9s par la K S L \u00e9taient fausses,\u2014ce qui n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli,\u2014la d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019en resterait pas moins un acte se rapportant \u00e0 \u00abl\u2019exercice de ses fonctions\u00bb (art. 121).\nLes motifs de cet arr\u00eat sont inattaquables. A moins de voir dans chacune des prescriptions, l\u00e9gislatives \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de la Commisssion des relations de travail une restriction \u00e0 sa juridiction, on ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019elle a outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e. Une pareille interpr\u00e9tation irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un principe fondamental du Code du travail qui est de confier exclusivement \u00e0 la Commission le soin de statuer sur les demandes d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation ce qui implique que c\u2019est \u00e0 elle qu\u2019il appartient de juger dans chaque cas si l\u2019on s\u2019est conform\u00e9 aux prescriptions du Code du travail \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLe principe qu\u2019il faut appliquer est celui de l\u2019arr\u00eat Bakery and Confectionery Workers v. White Lunch[1], cette Cour y a refus\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir de reviser ou annuler toute d\u00e9cision accord\u00e9e par la loi \u00e0 la Commission des relations de travail de la Colombie\u2011Britannique. En son nom, M. le Juge Hall a dit:\nNothing shows that it lost jurisdiction for any of the reasons which the law recognizes as ousting jurisdiction, i.e., bias, interest, fraud, denial of natural justice or want of qualification.\nUn organisme comme la Commission ne perd pas sa comp\u00e9tence parce qu\u2019il applique mal une disposition l\u00e9gislative mais seulement lorsqu\u2019il sort de son champ d\u2019activit\u00e9 ou omet de se conformer aux conditions essentielles \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de sa juridiction. Il est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident que l\u2019article du Code du travail invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 circonscrire le champ d\u2019activit\u00e9 de la Commission mais au contraire une disposition qu\u2019elle est charg\u00e9e d\u2019appliquer par des d\u00e9cisions finales et sans appel. Comme cette Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Galloway Lumber c. La Commission des Relations de travail de la Colombie-Britannique[2], l\u2019exercice valable de la juridiction d\u2019une telle commission ne d\u00e9pend pas du bien ou mal fond\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9cision. La seule question \u00e0 examiner est de savoir si elle entre dans le domaine de sa comp\u00e9tence (\u00abthe assigned area of the exercise of the power\u00bb).\nPour ce qui est de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem, il importe de noter qu\u2019elle n\u2019implique pas qu\u2019il doit toujours \u00eatre accord\u00e9 une audition. L\u2019obligation est de fournir \u00e0 la partie l\u2019occasion de faire valoir ses moyens. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, en face d\u2019une contestation qui soul\u00e8ve uniquement un moyen de droit, la Commission n\u2019abusa pas de sa discr\u00e9tion en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019en entendre davantage avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision. Comme cette Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Forest Industrial Relations Ltd. c. International Union of Operating Engineers[3], une commission n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9e d\u2019accorder une audition sur toutes les pr\u00e9tentions soulev\u00e9es dans une affaire dont elle est saisie. Lorsqu\u2019elle a eu un expos\u00e9 qu\u2019elle juge suffisant, elle a le pouvoir de statuer sans plus tarder. Il ne faut pas oublier que la Commission exerce sa juridiction dans une mati\u00e8re o\u00f9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tout retard est susceptible de causer un pr\u00e9judice grave et irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable. Tout en maintenant le principe que les r\u00e8gles fondamentales de justice doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es, il faut se garder d\u2019imposer un code de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 un organisme que la loi a voulu rendre ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure.\nVu les conclusions ci-dessus sur les deux motifs invoqu\u00e9s par rappelante, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019article qui interdit les recours aux tribunaux \u00aben raison d\u2019actes, proc\u00e9dures ou d\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019exercice\u00bb des fonctions de la Commission. Lorsqu\u2019il y aura lieu de le faire, on devra tenir compte non seulement de l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu dans Jarvis c. Associated Medical Services[4] et les autres causes qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es, mais aussi de ce que dans Board of Health of Saltfleet c. Knapman[5] cette Cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019annuler pour violation de la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem une d\u00e9cision rendue en ex\u00e9cution du Public Health Act d\u2019Ontario (R.S.O. 1950, c. 306) par une disposition (art. 143) se lisant comme suit:\nNo order or other proceeding, matter or thing, done or transacted in or relating to the execution of this Act, shall be vacated, quashed or set aside for want of form, or be removed or removable by certiorari or otherwise into the Supreme Court.\nJ\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 les mots \u00abrelating to\u00bb parce qu\u2019ils sont ceux-l\u00e0 m\u00eames que l\u2019on trouve dans la version anglaise de l\u2019art. 121 du Code du travail.\nJe suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des appelantes: Gagn\u00e9, Trottier, Letarte, Larue & Rioux, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: R.

The accident occurred at nightfall. After he had passed by a parking lot in front of a small store, the plaintiff\u2019s husband stopped his car and backed up in zigzags. The defendant admitted seeing the tail lights of the other vehicle in front of him at some 500 feet. He said that he looked away towards a pedestrian on his left whose attention he tried unsuccessfully to catch. When he looked again in front, it was too late to avoid the collision. The trial judge held that the defendant was solely to blame. The Court of Appeal assessed at one-third the share of liability attributable to the fault committed by the plaintiff\u2019s husband and also reduced the amounts awarded to the plaintiff as tutrix to her son and daughter. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part.\nAs to the liability. The Court of Appeal did not err in modifying the judgment of the Superior Court on the question of liability. The accident was caused by the combination of the plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s imprudent action with the defendant\u2019s inattention.\nAs to the damages. The Court of Appeal erred in substituting its own. appreciation of the damages to the estimate made by the trial judge. It cannot be said that the amount awarded by the trial judge was so excessive as to constitute an entirely erroneous estimate.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], setting aside a judgment of Lalibert\u00e9 J.

Le mari de l\u2019appelante circulait en direction ouest dans une familiale de dimensions r\u00e9duites (Envoy 1961). Il venait de d\u00e9passer un terrain destin\u00e9 au stationnement en face d\u2019un petit magasin lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9 et s\u2019est mis \u00e0 reculer en zigzaguant. Sa voiture a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 heurt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re par celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Celui-ci a admis qu\u2019il avait aper\u00e7u les feux arri\u00e8re de l\u2019autre voiture devant lui \u00e0 une assez bonne distance (400-500 pieds) et qu\u2019ensuite il avait d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 son regard vers un pi\u00e9ton qui se trouvait au bord du chemin du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche et dont il a vainement tent\u00e9 d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention. Lorsqu\u2019il a regard\u00e9 de nouveau devant lui, il n\u2019a pas eu le temps d\u2019\u00e9viter la collision dans laquelle le mari de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 sur le coup, En Cour sup\u00e9rieure le Juge Lalibert\u00e9 a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019accident \u00e9tait uniquement d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute de l\u2019intim\u00e9. La Cour du banc de la reine[2] a, au contraire, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le mari de l\u2019appelante avait \u00e9galement commis une faute qui avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accident, en reculant sans s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il pouvait le faire sans risque. Elle a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers la part de responsabilit\u00e9 imputable \u00e0 cette faute et r\u00e9duit en cons\u00e9quence de $30,107.94 \u00e0 $20,172.32 le montant payable \u00e0 l\u2019appelante personnellement. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 payable \u00e0 l\u2019appelante en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice de son fils et d\u00e9 sa fille, elle a en outre r\u00e9duit l\u2019estimation du pr\u00e9judice en ramenant de ce chef la condamnation de $23,713.04 \u00e0 $8,710.\nSur la responsabilit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste ni la faute qui lui est reproch\u00e9e ni son importance relative. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, elle invoque certaines erreurs dans les motifs par lesquels la Cour d\u2019appel en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y avait faute commune.\nElle signale en premier lieu que le terrain de stationnement n\u2019a pas les dimensions consid\u00e9rables qu\u2019on lui attribue. C\u2019est exact, mais on ne voit pas quelle influence ce d\u00e9tail a pu avoir sur la d\u00e9cision. Ensuite, on rel\u00e8ve qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas exact de dire qu\u2019une bo\u00eete \u00e0 claire\u2011voie qui se trouvait dans la familiale, g\u00eanait la vue du conducteur vers l\u2019arri\u00e8re. Cette affirmation est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur l\u2019examen d\u2019une photographie prise apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident o\u00f9 l\u2019on voit cette bo\u00eete sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9. On a s\u00fbrement eu tort de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans cette position lors de l\u2019accident alors que tout indique qu\u2019elle devait \u00eatre \u00e0 plat; dans cette position, elle ne g\u00eanait pas la vue du conducteur \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re. Cette erreur \u00e9galement ne tire pas \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence parce que le conducteur est aussi fautif de ne pas avoir tenu compte de la pr\u00e9sence de la voiture qu\u2019il pouvait voir que de celle d\u2019une voiture qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de voir.\nEnfin, on signale \u00e9galement que c\u2019est une erreur de droit que de dire \u00abL\u2019accident prouve certainement qu\u2019il y avait risque\u00bb. Au sens statistique, cette affirmation est vraie, mais non au sens juridique. Quand le Code de la route prescrit, au para. 11 de l\u2019art. 40, qu\u2019on ne doit pas faire une man\u0153uvre sans s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elle \u00abpeut s\u2019effectuer sans risque\u00bb, il ne faut pas prendre cette expression dans un sens absolu. Il est clair qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter cette expression de fa\u00e7on analogue \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de c\u00e9der le passage \u00e0 une intersection munie d\u2019un signal d\u2019arr\u00eat. Comme cette Cour l\u2019a jug\u00e9 dans Provincial Transport Co. c. Dozois[3], il faut s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 ce qui peut raisonnablement \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu dans les circonstances.\nIci, cependant, on ne peut pas dire que, voyant ou pouvant voir dans son r\u00e9troviseur une voiture qui le suivait, le conducteur de la familiale ne devait pas pr\u00e9voir un risque de collision s\u2019il reculait. En effet, tout automobiliste doit savoir combien il est difficile dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la distance \u00e0 laquelle se trouve un autre v\u00e9hicule. Sa voiture n\u2019\u00e9tant pas munie de feux de recul, le conducteur devait savoir que sa man\u0153uvre risquait fort de n\u2019\u00eatre pas per\u00e7ue en temps utile par le conducteur du v\u00e9hicule qui le suivait. Sa voiture \u00e9tant au surplus de dimensions r\u00e9duites, l\u2019autre conducteur \u00e9tait encore plus expos\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre induit en erreur sur la distance l\u2019en s\u00e9parant.\n\u00c9videmment, l\u2019infortun\u00e9 conducteur ne pouvait pas \u00eatre tenu de pr\u00e9voir l\u2019inattention de l\u2019autre et c\u2019est pourquoi sa responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas totale. Cependant, il n\u2019est pas possible de dire que la man\u0153uvre imprudente de recul n\u2019a jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans l\u2019accident. Au contraire, c\u2019est la combinaison de cette man\u0153uvre avec l\u2019inattention qui l\u2019a provoqu\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit en erreur par la marche arri\u00e8re. Il a cru que la distance entre les deux v\u00e9hicules lui permettait de tourner la t\u00eate comme il l\u2019a fait. La man\u0153uvre de recul a aggrav\u00e9 son imprudence en r\u00e9duisant consid\u00e9rablement le temps disponible pour \u00e9viter la collision alors que normalement, comme il ne venait pas de v\u00e9hicules en sens inverse et que la familiale d\u00e9passait d\u2019au plus deux pieds la ligne centrale, il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre facile pour celui qui la suivait de la d\u00e9passer en prenant la gauche du chemin.\nPour ces raisons, je conclus que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas fait erreur en modifiant le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure sur la responsabilit\u00e9. Elle \u00e9tait d\u2019autant plus justifi\u00e9e de le faire que la d\u00e9cision ne portait pas sur une question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 mais sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 tirer de faits prouv\u00e9s sans contradiction. Quant \u00e0 la liquidation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 de quelle mani\u00e8re il a calcul\u00e9 le montant tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis auquel il s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas davantage r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s quel principe il a fait le partage entre la veuve et chacun de ses enfants mineurs. Il est regrettable que le jugement ne fournisse pas ces renseignements. On devrait les consid\u00e9rer comme une partie essentielle des motifs que l\u2019art. 471 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile prescrit d\u2019ins\u00e9rer dans tout jugement quand il y a eu contestation et qu\u2019il est rendu apr\u00e8s d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nEn Cour d\u2019appel, on s\u2019est content\u00e9 de dire que les \u00abmontants accord\u00e9s aux enfants d\u00e9passent ce \u00e0 quoi en justice l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre condamn\u00e9\u00bb. Apr\u00e8s avoir not\u00e9 que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne laissait aucunement \u00abdeviner sa fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der\u00bb, on d\u00e9clare que \u00abces montants d\u00e9passent tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9\u2026 par les tribunaux dans des circonstances semblables\u00bb. On cite apr\u00e8s cela les sommes accord\u00e9es dans certaines autres causes et l\u2019on finit par r\u00e9duire le montant payable \u00e0 la tutrice \u00e0 $4,690 pour son fils et $4,020 pour sa fille. L\u00e0 encore on ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas les bases du calcul et il est clair que la Cour d\u2019appel a substitu\u00e9 son appr\u00e9ciation \u00e0 celle du juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nEn face de ces jugements, devons-nous proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle estimation pour en appr\u00e9cier le bien-fond\u00e9. Je n\u00e9 le crois pas. A mon avis, nous devons nous demander si la Cour d\u2019appel a appliqu\u00e9 le principe qu\u2019un tribunal d\u2019appel doit suivre en l\u2019occurrence. Ce principe n\u2019est pas de se demander si, si\u00e9geant en premi\u00e8re instance on aurait accord\u00e9 le m\u00eame montant, ce qui est au fond la m\u00eame chose que de se demander si ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 d\u00e9passe ce qui est d\u00fb en justice. Ce qu\u2019il faut rechercher c\u2019est si le montant accord\u00e9 est tellement excessif ou tellement insuffisant qu\u2019il constitue une estimation enti\u00e8rement erron\u00e9e.\nAppliquant ce crit\u00e8re, il faut constater, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit en Cour d\u2019appel, que le revenu annuel du d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait de $5,677.20. Le fils, lors de l\u2019accident, avait pr\u00e8s de 4 ans et la petite fille 7 ans. Le p\u00e8re avait 38 ans. Le montant accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse personnellement pour dommages d\u00e9coulant de la mort de son \u00e9poux s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $28,146.34 et avec l\u2019addition des $23,713.04 accord\u00e9s aux enfants, cela fait un total de $51,859.38. C\u2019est environ neuf fois le revenu annuel du d\u00e9funt. Si Ton consid\u00e8re que Ton peut pr\u00e9sumer que la moiti\u00e9 du revenu annuel d\u2019un p\u00e8re de famille est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 faire vivre sa femme et ses enfants puisque son salaire est saisissable \u00e0 cette fin dans cette proportion (C.P.C. art. 553, dernier alin\u00e9a), peut-on dire qu\u2019en accordant environ dix-huit fois cette partie du revenu annuel du d\u00e9funt comme compensation pour son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 un montant tellement excessif, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une estimation enti\u00e8rement erron\u00e9e du pr\u00e9judice? Quoique l\u2019on se trouve \u00e9videmment \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame limite de ce qui est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre justifi\u00e9, je ne pense pas que Ton puisse dire qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un montant manifestement excessif.\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e de substituer sa propre appr\u00e9ciation des dommages \u00e0 celle du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel aux fins de modifier le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 fixer \u00e0 $8,156.87 la somme accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente appelante en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice de son fils James et \u00e0 $7,651.16 la somme accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente appelante en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice de sa fille Susan Joy. Je ne modifierais pas le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel en ce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit des d\u00e9pens et, comme l\u2019appelante ne r\u00e9ussit pas devant cette Cour sur le principal objet de son appel, je ne lui en accorderais que la moiti\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens.\nAppel maintenu en partie.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: L.

Cependant, dans l\u2019acte de donation l\u2019immeuble fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous son ancien num\u00e9ro 17-A, et, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour enregistrement, fut inscrit au livre de pr\u00e9sentation et \u00e0 l\u2019index des noms, mais ne put l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019index des immeubles puisque le lot 17-A n\u2019existait plus. Telle \u00e9tait la situation lorsque le lot portant le num\u00e9ro 17-A-2 fut saisi et vendu par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement obtenu contre la m\u00e8re des deux appelantes. L\u2019opposition que firent les appelantes, en s\u2019appuyant sur leur acte de donation, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019un ordre de sursis, et il fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la vente. Les appelantes demand\u00e8rent alors l\u2019annulation du d\u00e9cret. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure annula la vente. La Cour d\u2019appel, rejetant les deux moyens invoqu\u00e9s au soutien de la demande en annulation, \u00e0 savoir, que la saisie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e super non domino et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, renversa le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et maintint le d\u00e9cret. D\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019appel devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl est impossible, en face de la rigueur des dispositions de la loi visant les actes de donation d\u2019immeubles, l\u2019enregistrement des actes, leur inscription \u00e0 l\u2019index des immeubles, la revision du cadastre et les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une telle revision, de conclure que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9tait erron\u00e9. Quant aux irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la saisie, rien ne justifie cette Cour d\u2019adopter sur cette question de proc\u00e9dure une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nSheriff\u2019s sale\u2014Petition to vacate\u2014Titles to the immoveable sold\u2014Deed of donation not registered\u2014Irregularities in the seizure of the immoveable\u2014Cadastre Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 320, ss. 14, 15\u2014Act respect- ing title-deeds in the Gaspesian area, 1948 (Que.), c. 37, as amended\u2014Civil Code, arts. 806, 2132, 2168, 2176a\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 651, 699, 704, 784.\nFollowing the revision of the official cadastre in the area, a parcel of land belonging to the mother of the two appellants and designated as lot 17-A became lot 17-A-2, and was entered as such in the name of the mother in the revised cadastre. Subsequently, the mother executed before notary a deed of donation by which she gave this parcel of land to the two appellants. However, the immoveable was designated in the deed of donation under its old designation of lot 17-A, and, having been presented for registration, was entered in the entry\u2011book and in the index of names, but could not be entered in the index of immoveables, since lot 17-A no longer existed. Such was the situation when lot 17-A-2 was seized and sold by the sheriff at the instance of the respondent, in the execution of a judgment obtained against the mother of the two appellants. The opposition made by the appellants to the sale, based upon their deed of donation, was not accompanied by an order to stay the proceedings, and the sheriff proceeded with the sale. The appellants petitioned to vacate the sale. The Superior Court annulled the sale. The Court of Appeal, setting aside the two grounds upon which the petition to vacate was based, i.e., that the seizure had not been made super non domino and had been made in an irregular manner, reversed the judgment of first instance and maintained the sale. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nFaced with the strictness of the provisions relating to the deeds of donation of immoveables, the registration of deeds, their entry in the index of immoveables, the revision of the cadastre and the consequences of such a revision, it was impossible to conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was wrong. As to the irregularities involved against the seizure, there was nothing to justify this Court to adopt on this question of procedure a different conclusion than the one reached by the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Puddicombe J. Appeal dismissed.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement du Juge Puddicombe. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nClaude Picard, pour les appelantes.\nRichard J. Riendeau, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Les appelantes se pourvoient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine[2] qui infirme un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en ce que ce dernier faisait droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret, et qui rejette cette requ\u00eate avec d\u00e9pens des deux Cours. Pour l\u2019audition de cet appel, la Cour du banc de la reine \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de M. le Juge en chef Tremblay et de MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Pratte, Casey et Choquette. Pr\u00e9sent lors de l\u2019audition, M. le Juge Bissonnette d\u00e9c\u00e9da avant le prononc\u00e9 du jugement.\nLes faits donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige apparaissent aux raisons de jugement de M. le juge Pratte, auxquelles ses coll\u00e8gues ont donn\u00e9 leur accord:\u2014En 1947, dame Aurore St-Gelais, m\u00e8re des appelantes, Hedwidge et Hauviette St-Gelais, fit l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un terrain d\u00e9crit par ses tenants et aboutissants, et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme faisant partie du lot 17A au Plan et Livre de Renvoi du cadastre officiel pour le fief de Ste-Anne-des-Monts Notre-Dame. Quatre ans apr\u00e8s, soit en 1951, le cadastre de cette localit\u00e9 fut revis\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi relative aux titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la Gasp\u00e9sie, 12 George VI, c. 37, modifi\u00e9e par 14-15 George VI, c. 39. Par l\u2019effet de cette revision (proclam\u00e9e dans la Gazette officielle de Qu\u00e9bec du 27 octobre 1951), l\u2019immeuble, acquis par dame Aurore St-Gelais, est devenu le lot 17-A-2 et port\u00e9 au nom de celle-ci au Livre de Renvoi du cadastre revis\u00e9. Le 25 janvier 1957, par acte pass\u00e9 devant Me Charles Gauthier, notaire, dame Aurore St-Gelais donnait l\u2019immeuble en question \u00e0 ses deux filles, les appelantes. Mais voil\u00e0 que, plut\u00f4t que de d\u00e9signer cet immeuble dans l\u2019acte de donation par le num\u00e9ro 17-A-2, comme il e\u00fbt d\u00fb le faire pour se conformer \u00e0 une disposition de l\u2019art. 2168 du Code civil, le notaire ne fit que reproduire la d\u00e9signation et la description contenues dans l\u2019acte d\u2019acquisition de dame Aurore St-Gelais, la donatrice, tout comme si le cadastre n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 revis\u00e9. Cet acte fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour enregistrement; mais comme, d\u2019une part, il n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas question du lot 17-A-2 et que, d\u2019autre part, le num\u00e9ro 17A (dont l\u2019immeuble donn\u00e9 faisait partie avant la revision du cadastre) n\u2019existait plus, l\u2019acte fut inscrit au livre de pr\u00e9sentation et \u00e0 l\u2019index des noms, mais ne put l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019index des immeubles. Telle \u00e9tait la situation lorsque le lot portant le num\u00e9ro 17-A-2 fut saisi et vendu par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement que celle-ci avait obtenu contr\u00e9 dame Aurore St-Gelais. Les appelantes, d\u2019une part, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019acte de donation, form\u00e8rent une opposition \u00e0 la saisie et la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, d\u2019autre part, all\u00e9guant que cette proc\u00e9dure n\u2019\u00e9tait pas faite dans les conditions voulues pour arr\u00eater la vente, fit motion pour en obtenir le rejet. En fait, l\u2019opposition n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019un ordre de sursis et il fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la vente. Sit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s celle-ci, les appelantes form\u00e8rent une demande en annulation de d\u00e9cret, demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9e contesta.\nSaisie et disposant \u00e0 la fois par un seul jugement et de la motion pour faire rejeter l\u2019opposition et de la demande en annulation de d\u00e9cret, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta la premi\u00e8re, accorda la seconde et annula le d\u00e9cret.\nLa Banque de Montr\u00e9al appela de cette partie du jugement qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019annulation du d\u00e9cret.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel jugea que la d\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance en ce qu\u2019elle refusait de faire droit \u00e0 la motion pour rejet d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la saisie, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas frapp\u00e9e d\u2019appel et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019ailleurs une d\u00e9cision susceptible d\u2019appel. La Cour consid\u00e9ra ensuite les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par les appelantes au soutien de leur demande pour annulation du d\u00e9cret, savoir (i) que la saisie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e super non domino, que l\u2019immeuble saisi leur appartenait en vertu de l\u2019acte de donation du 25 janvier 1957 et (ii) que la saisie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re.\nS\u2019appuyant sur les dispositions des arts. 806, 2132, 2168 et 2176 (a) du Code civil et les articles 14 et 15 de la Loi concernant la confection du cadastre, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 320, la Cour d\u2019appel jugea que l\u2019immeuble saisi\u2014qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les inscriptions au Bureau d\u2019enregistrement, appartenait \u00e0 dame Aurore St-Gelais,\u2014n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par l\u2019acte de donation invoqu\u00e9 et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement par les appelantes, qu\u2019il leur r\u00e9sultait de cet acte aucun droit opposable \u00e0 la Banque et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il ne pouvait \u00eatre question, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019une vente super non domino. Ce premier moyen fut donc rejet\u00e9. La Cour \u00e9carta aussi le second moyen, jugeant, en somme, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu dans la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019ex\u00e9cution aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de l\u2019art. 784 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, pouvait justifier d\u2019annuler le d\u00e9cret.\nApr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents points soulev\u00e9s par les appelantes, il m\u2019est impossible de conclure, comme nous y avons \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s, que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel est erron\u00e9. En somme, je dirais que ces points, qui ne diff\u00e8rent gu\u00e8re de ceux qu\u2019on a soulev\u00e9s en Cour d\u2019appel ou en premi\u00e8re instance, ne tiennent pas compte de la rigueur des dispositions de la loi, mentionn\u00e9es au jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, visant les actes de donation d\u2019immeubles, l\u2019enregistrement des actes, leur inscription \u00e0 l\u2019index des immeubles, la revision du cadastre et les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une telle revision. Quant aux irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9es en ce qui concerne la saisie, je ne vois rien justifiant cette Cour d\u2019adopter sur cette question de proc\u00e9dure, une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nJe renverrais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur des appelantes: C.

Ce solde ne portait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 moins de retard dans les versements. Le Ministre a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les versements re\u00e7us en 1958 et 1959 comme \u00e9tant une fusion du capital et des int\u00e9r\u00eats dans le sens de l\u2019art. 7(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148.

Le juge au proc\u00e8s a donc conclu que les dispositions de l\u2019art. 7(1) de la Loi devaient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es aux versements. Le contribuable en appela devant cette Cour.

These instalments did not bear any interests except in the case of default. The Minister considered the instalments received in 1958 and 1959 as being combined payments of capital and interests within the meaning of s. 7(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. The Exchequer Court held\u2014the question being admitted\u2014that it went against the general rule not to stipulate for interests in such a case, and also that the evidence showed that the property had been sold at a price beyond its fair market value. The trial judge concluded, therefore, that the provisions of s. 7(1) of the Act applied to these instalments.

La seule question en litige dans cet appel est celle de savoir si les sommes de $15,000 et de $19,136.20 re\u00e7ues par l\u2019appelant en 1958 et 1959 respectivement, suivant les termes d\u2019un contrat de vente peuvent raisonnablement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 titre d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 7(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148.\nL\u2019appelant \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une ferme, situ\u00e9e dans la paroisse de St-Laurent, depuis une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Il a habit\u00e9, et habitait encore au moment de la vente, une maison situ\u00e9e sur la ferme, et il a exploit\u00e9 cette ferme pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es et ce jusqu\u2019en 1952.\nDe 1950 \u00e0 1956, l\u2019appelant fut approch\u00e9 par diff\u00e9rentes personnes pour vendre sa ferme mais refusa toutes ces offres car il ne voulait pas aux conditions qui lui \u00e9taient faites se d\u00e9partir de cette ferme qu\u2019il avait exploit\u00e9e si longtemps. Or, vers le 20 juillet 1956, alors que la valeur des terres \u00e9tait \u00e0 la hausse, l\u2019appelant fut approch\u00e9 par une compagnie du nom de Thorndale Investment Corporation avec laquelle il traitait \u00e0 distance, qui lui pr\u00e9senta une offre d\u2019achat au montant de $350,000. Il refusa l\u2019offre encore une fois, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il voulait $450,000 pour sa ferme.\nDans les deux jours qui suivirent, des n\u00e9gociations intenses eurent lieu entre l\u2019appelant et Thorndale Investment Corporation. En effet, l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 par demander $450,000 alors que Thorndale Investment Corporation offrait $350,000. Apr\u00e8s discussion, l\u2019appelant diminua alors son prix \u00e0 $400,000; mais ce prix fut jug\u00e9 trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 par l\u2019acheteur. L\u2019appelant consentit enfin une r\u00e9duction additionnelle de $5,000 qui ne fut pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme suffisante par la compagnie acheteuse. L\u2019appelant a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de laisser tomber l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat afin de conclure la vente.\nUn contrat notari\u00e9 fut sign\u00e9 le 19 juillet 1956 par lequel M. Groulx vendit une grande partie de sa ferme soit une superficie totale de 2,256,859 pieds carr\u00e9s \u00e0 Thorndale Investment Corporation pour un prix de $395,000 soit $0.17742 le pied carr\u00e9, dont $85,000 comptant et le solde de $310,000 payable avant le 1er juin 1964, par versements annuels commen\u00e7ant en 1958. Le solde ne portait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 moins de retard dans les versements et alors l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tait de 6 pour cent. Les principales clauses du contrat de vente pertinentes au litige sont les suivantes:\n(a) The present Sale is thus made for the price or sum of Three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars ($395,000), on account whereof the Vendor acknowledges to have received from the Purchaser the sum of Eighty-five thousand dollars ($85,000) whereof quit for so much.\nThe balance of price, namely the sum of Three hundred and ten thousand dollars ($310,000) the Purchaser obliges itself to pay to the Vendor as follows:\u2014\nFifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and fifty-eight;\nTwenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine;\nFifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and sixty;\nFifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and sixty\u2011one;\nFifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and sixty\u2011two;\nFifty thousand dollars ($50,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and sixty\u2011three; and\nSeventy thousand dollars ($70,000) on the first day of June, nineteen hundred and sixty\u2011four.\n(b) The purchaser shall have the right to increase the amount of any payment or to make payments on account or pay the entire balance at any time.\n(c) The said balance of price shall not bear any interest if the said instalments are paid on or before their due dates, but any instalment not paid on its due date shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum (6%) per annum from such due date and compounded half-yearly but not in advance until paid.\n(d) Should however, the Purchaser pay any instalment above set forth before its due date, it will be entitled to a discount calculated at the rate of five per cent (5%) per annum from the date upon which payment is made to the respective due date.\nDans ses motifs de jugement, le savant juge de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a dit:\n\u2026nous avons ici \u00e0 traiter plus particuli\u00e8rement de deux questions de faits. Premi\u00e8rement, le Ministre \u00e9tait-il justifiable de pr\u00e9tendre que, si le contribuable avait suivi en l\u2019occurrence une pratique bien reconnue dans le monde des affaires, la balance de $310,000, payable par versements, aurait port\u00e9 int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 5% ou 6% jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que cette dette fut enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e?\nLa r\u00e9ponse affirmative \u00e0 cette question ne fait aucun doute, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e. Au surplus, je suis d\u2019opinion que la preuve \u00e9tablie par l\u2019appelant d\u00e9montre que c\u2019est presque toujours la pratique dans les cas analogues pour toute balance de prix garantie par hypoth\u00e8que, de porter int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5%. Par voie de d\u00e9fense, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que, nonobstant l\u2019admission qu\u2019en, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale les taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s s\u2019imposent, il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce comportant une circonstance sp\u00e9ciale et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle m\u00e9rite consid\u00e9ration exceptionnelle. A l\u2019appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas suivi la coutume de charger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat parce que sa ferme ne produisait rien.\nLa seconde question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est celle de savoir si la preuve laisse croire que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 un prix sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 sa valeur marchande.\nLe procureur de l\u2019appelant a admis que la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e par M. Lemire pour \u00e9tablir que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 une valeur sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 sa valeur marchande lui para\u00eet peut-\u00eatre boiteuse \u00e0 certains points de vue, parce qu\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur la base de son exp\u00e9rience et ne connaissait pas la d\u00e9finition \u00abvaleur marchande\u00bb donn\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame. Toutefois, il a soumis que ceci ne voulait pas dire que ses \u00e9valuations \u00e9taient erron\u00e9es. En tout cas, les directives indiqu\u00e9es par la Cour Supr\u00eame ne m\u2019interdisent pas d\u2019analyser, au meilleur de mes capacit\u00e9s, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lemire afin d\u2019en d\u00e9duire des indices valabi\u00e9s de la valeur r\u00e9elle de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. De plus, je consid\u00e8re dans les circonstances, que c\u2019est notre devoir d\u2019agir ainsi.\nEn appel d\u2019un jugement rendu par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick dans The King vs Jones, (1950) S.C.R. 220, 289, o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait de taxation et du principe applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de certaines terres bois\u00e9es, dans les notes de l\u2019honorable Juge Rand, parlant pour la Cour, on trouve, entre autres, les observations suivantes:\n\u00abThe figure of $5 an acre was the average price estimated by the assessors from their local knowledge of sales of small holdings, such as 100 acre lots. It was said that these sales ran from $3 to $8 an acre, and that $5 was, therefore a fair valuation. In this the assessors were undoubtedly wrong. Each taxpayer is entitled to have the value of his property separately ascertained. The difference in the prices used might possibly have arisen from differences in time and market conditions rather than in real marketable worth, in which case the propriety of the amount would depend upon equivalence in value, in the absence of which throughout the parish an average figure could not be used. But such a figure is obviously to be distinguished from an average valuation of a large tract of land belonging to one taxpayer and exhibiting wide variations in the value of its several parts.\nBut the Judge in appeal considered the assessment de novo in all its aspects. Rejecting the principle in the inadequate form urged by the company, he properly construed the Statute to provide for valuation on a market basis, as between a willing seller and a willing purchaser, each exercising a reasonable judgment, having regard to all elements and potentialities of value as well as of all risks, and reducing them all to a present worth: Montreal Island Power Co. vs The Town of Laval des Rapides, (1935) S.C.R. 304.\n* * *\nHe found that $5 was not in excess of the fair value of the land.\u00bb\nIl n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la question qui se pose est celle de d\u00e9terminer la valeur marchande ou r\u00e9elle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n* * * Je suis d\u2019abord d\u2019opinion que l\u2019appelant a au moins \u00e9tabli une cause prima facie que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 un prix sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 sa valeur marchande et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi, comme il lui incombait, \u00e0 prouver le contraire.\n* * *\nA mon avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un fermier ordinaire. Comme il appert de ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus imposables transmises \u00e0 cette Cour, son revenu taxable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1958 exc\u00e9dait $12,500, alors que pour 1959 il \u00e9tait de $15,000. Il recevait une partie de ces montants \u00e0 titre de salaire d\u2019une compagnie dont il \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident, mais la majeure partie venait de ses investissements. Son t\u00e9moignage r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les transactions immobili\u00e8res ne lui \u00e9taient pas \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration de n\u2019avoir jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 la taxe \u00e9vit\u00e9e en renon\u00e7ant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, un enfant pourrait calculer que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5% sur une balance de prix de $310,000 exc\u00e9dait $15,000 par ann\u00e9e.\nUn contribuable aussi entra\u00een\u00e9 aux affaires que l\u2019intim\u00e9, devrait appr\u00e9cier d\u2019embl\u00e9e l\u2019avantage p\u00e9cuniaire de ne pas majorer du double son revenu taxable.\nLa loi sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, S.R. 1952, vol. III, c. 156, s. 2, \u00e9dicte que:\n\u00abSauf disposition contraire de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou de toute autre loi du Parlement du Canada, une personne peut stipuler, allouer et exiger, dans tout contrat ou convention quelconque, le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou d\u2019escompte qui est arr\u00eat\u00e9 d\u2019un commun accord.\u00bb\nL\u2019intim\u00e9, je crois, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019en sacrifiant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat son intention avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de s\u2019assurer un prix de $395,000 en capital\u2014et son t\u00e9moignage ne pouvait gu\u00e8re cr\u00e9er un \u00e9tat de choses caract\u00e9risant mieux une capitalisation des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nOn peut ajouter que des circonstances suppl\u00e9mentaires\u2014nomm\u00e9ment le fait que c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame qui a propos\u00e9 le non paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, la faiblesse des raisons pouvant motiver ce geste et les r\u00e9ponses ind\u00e9finies donn\u00e9es par M. Feinstein \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il aurait pay\u00e9 le prix de $395,000 n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il se trouvait dispens\u00e9 de payer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat\u2014militent contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. Je crois devoir conclure alors qu\u2019il y a suffisament de preuve pour justifier les cotisations dont il s\u2019agit.\nLa preuve justifie pleinement les conclusions auxquelles l\u2019honorable Juge Kearney en est arriv\u00e9 quant aux faits. L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 et le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier est confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens contre l\u2019appelant.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant: Lemay, Poulin & Corbeil, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9: E.S.
