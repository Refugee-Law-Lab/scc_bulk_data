During a meeting of the society a fire occurred in the building and plaintiff, whose egress by the stairway was cut off by the fire, was injured. The building was not provided with fire escapes. Plaintiff sued defendant for damages.\nHeld: Plaintiff could not succeed. There was nothing to show that he was an invitee of defendant. Defendant\u2019s obligation was not higher or more extensive than that of lessor under the lease, and, assuming, the most advantageous position for plaintiff, that he and defendant stood in the relation of tenant and landlord under it, they were governed by the law as stated in Lane v. Cox, [1897] 1 Q.B. 415, Cavalier v. Pope, [1906] A.C. 428, Fairman v. Perpetual Invt. Bldg. Soc. [1923] A.C. 74, at pp. 95-96, Scythes & Co. Ltd. v. Gibson\u2019s Ltd., [1927] S.C.R. 352, at p. 358; the landlord does not, in the absence of a provision to that effect, become liable to the tenant for defective construction or maintenance of the leased premises, or for damages resulting from any such cause. As to certain clauses of a city by-law, requiring fire escapes to be provided after notice by the building inspector, and requiring a building considered dangerous to be made safe, upon notice by the inspector, these had no application because (whatever the effect might otherwise have been) no such notice had been given as to the building in question. Whether or not a certain printing business carried on by a tenant in rooms on the lower two storeys of the building operated, as to such rooms, to create a \u201cfactory\u201d within the Factory, Shop and Office Building Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 229, it afforded no reason for regarding the fourth storey as a \u201cfactory,\u201d and therefore (apart from other considerations standing in plaintiff\u2019s way of recovery under that Act) the provisions of that Act invoked by plaintiff were inapplicable.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 63 Ont. L.R. 202, in its result affirmed. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, reversing the judgment of Raney J.[2], held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover from the defendant damages claimed for personal injuries to the plaintiff caused through a fire which occurred in the defendant\u2019s building, premises in the top storey of which had been leased by defendant to a fraternal unincorporated society, of which the plaintiff, at the time of the fire, was a member, and a meeting of which he was attending when the fire occurred. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.W.G. Winnett K.C. for the appellant.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and T.N. Phelan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014On the night of 22nd January, 1927, a building of four storeys, belonging to the defendant company, situate on Richmond street, London, Ontario, was destroyed, or seriously damaged, by fire. Parts of the building had been leased, and were in the possession of tenants. Among others, the space on the fourth floor, described as \u201cthe top flat of the building known as No. 426 Richmond street,\u201d was, by indenture of 1st April, 1923, in form and as thereby expressed, leased by the defendant company to \u201cCourt Eclipse, No. 1036, Canadian Order of Foresters of the said city of London,\u201d a fraternal, unincorporated society.\nThe lease was by indenture in duplicate, in pursuance of the Act Respecting Short Forms of Leases; it was executed, on behalf of the defendant company, by its President and Secretary\u2011Treasurer, who affixed the company\u2019s corporate seal; and, on behalf of the Court Eclipse, by the Chief and Financial Secretary of the Court, who attached a seal. The lease was to run for one year from its date, and there is a memorandum endorsed of 26th April, 1924, extending the term for one year from the first of that month. It would appear that the society continued to occupy the premises described down to the time of the fire, although there is no further written extension in evidence.\nOn the night of the fire, the members of the Court, or society, were entertaining themselves and their friends at a social assembly held in the flat, and the plaintiff, who had joined the society subsequently to the lease, was present. The party was broken up by the fire, which started on one of the lower floors while the festivities were in progress, and, most unfortunately, had, before it was discovered, gathered such headway that egress by the stairway was cut off for several of the members and their guests, including the plaintiff. The building was not provided with fire escapes, and so it was necessary for these unfortunate people to jump from the windows, in order to save themselves.\nThe plaintiff, who raised an alarm, and remained at a window until the firemen arrived, landed in one of the nets, and his hands proved to be so severely burned as permanently to destroy their usefulness. He claimed $15,000 damages, and that amount was found at the trial, and not questioned before us. The Appellate Division[3] reversed the trial judge, holding that there was no liability, and from that judgment the plaintiff appeals.\nThe learned trial judge[4] was of opinion that the defendant company was liable both at common law and by the legislation of Ontario. He held that, although there was no contract between the parties, the plaintiff was not a trespasser nor a mere licensee, but, in the language of the judgment, that he was\nan \u201cinvitee,\u201d just as much as he would have been if he had paid an admission fee to the defendant company.\nI do not, however, find any material with which to construct an invitation by the defendant; its obligation cannot, in my view, be any higher, or more extensive, than that of lessor under the lease of 1st April, 1923; and, to assume the most advantageous position for the plaintiff, if he and the defendant stand in the relation of tenant and landlord under that instrument, they are governed by the law as stated in Lane v. Cox[5]; Cavalier v. Pope[6]; Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society[7]; Scythes & Company Limited v. Gibson\u2019s Limited[8]. The landlord does not, in the absence of a provision to that effect, become liable to the tenant for defective construction or maintenance of the leased premises, or for damages resulting from any such cause.\nThere is a municipal by-law of the City of London, no. 5430, of 4th December, 1916, as amended, requiring, by clause 40, \u201cthe owner, lessee or agent of every building (except private dwellings) three storeys or more in height,\u201d to provide fire escapes within one month after notice by the Inspector of Buildings; but in this case there was no notice, and so the clause does not apply, whatever its effect might otherwise have been. For the like reason the provisions of clause 10 of the by-law do not apply; that clause requiring the owner or his agent, of a building which, in the opinion of the Inspector, is in a dangerous condition, to proceed at once, upon notice in writing of the Inspector, to make the building safe.\nThe judge expresses his view with regard to the legislation as follows:\nBut did the failure of the building inspector to take his duties seriously absolve the defendant company from responsibility? I think not. Its officers certainly knew of the condition of the building and the absence of fire escapes, and their duty was to comply with the law irrespective of official notice or absence of official notice.\nBut I do not think that this is an admissible interpretation. There is no common law liability; and as to the by-law, to mention one reason only, the requisite of notice was not satisfied.\nChapter 229, R.S.O., 1914, An Act for the Protection of Persons Employed in Factories, Shops and Office Buildings, is also invoked on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, and the trial judge considered that the plaintiff, as an invitee of the owner, was entitled to the benefit of s. 59, subs. 3, which provides that\nThe owner of every factory, shop or office building over two storeys in height, and, where deemed necessary by the Inspector, the owner of every factory, shop or office building over one storey in height, shall provide one or more systems of fire escape, and shall keep the same in good repair and to the satisfaction of the Chief Inspector, as follows: and directions follow as to the structure, position and character of the stairways or ladders, shewing clearly enough, in addition to what may be inferred from the title of the statute, that it is for the protection of the employees that the fire escapes are required.\nIt appears that Langford and Company occupied rooms on the two lower flats for printing purposes, and it was for that reason that the learned judge considered that the building was a factory, and subject to factory regulations, even on the fourth floor, where the Court Eclipse was located. There seems to be some doubt as to whether the business of Langford and Company operated to create a factory within the meaning of the Act, even as to the space which they occupied; the learned judge suggests that the place was \u201cbarely within the statutory definition of the word.\u201d But, however that may be, and apart from other considerations which stand in the plaintiff\u2019s way of recovery under the Factory, Shop and Office Building Act, I see no reason why the fourth floor should be regarded as a factory, and I do not consider that this Act applies, any more than the other enactments which have been cited.\nMy conclusion is thus in conformity with that unanimously reached by the Appellate Division.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Winnett, Morehead & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Murphy, Gunn & Murphy.\n[1] (1928) 63 Ont.

The King, [1930] S.C.R. 194\nDate: 1930-02-12\nAmedee Baron Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1930: February 12.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nCriminal law\u2014Practice and procedure\u2014Jury trial\u2014Charge of the trial judge\u2014Misdirection\u2014Sworn statement by stenographer conflicting with report of the judge\u2014Section 1020 Cr. C.\nThe appellant, having been convicted of the crime of rape and condemned to fifteen years imprisonment and lashes, appealed to the court of appeal principally on the ground that the trial judge had erred in his instructions given to the jury. In the record were the notes of the stenographer at the trial who certified, under oath, to the delivery of a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him, contained a clear misdirection. The appellate court, having determined that, on the stenographic transcription, the appeal should be allowed, directed that a report be furnished by the trial judge in accordance with section 1020 Cr. C. The trial judge then prepared, two or three months after the trial, a certificate containing a number of statements made by him in answer to a corresponding number of objections to his charge which formed the grounds of appeal and stating, according to his recollection, that in fact his direction was precisely the contrary of that reported.\nHeld that such certificate of the trial judge was not a report within section 1020 Cr. C.: it did not contain the judge\u2019s \u201cnotes of the trial\u201d nor was it a \u201creport giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case\u201d; and, therefore, the court being left with nothing authentic and regularly before the court to establish that the charge was not as reported, the appellant was clearly entitled to a new trial. Section 1020 Cr. C. apparently contemplates that the judge or the magistrate should furnish \u201chis notes of the trial\u201d or his report immediately after the trial, or at least, so soon as an appeal is lodged; and it was never intended by this section to enable the trial judge, after an appeal had been argued, to put before the court of appeal, by way of certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or by direction of the court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken upon the appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant for the crime of rape.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nC. Bourgeois K.C. for the appellant.\nP. Bigu\u00e9 K.C. and Laetare Roy K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the close of the arguments by counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We regard this as a case of the utmost importance. A conviction for the crime of rape is always a serious matter. In the present case it is more than ordinarily so because the penalty imposed is fifteen years imprisonment and lashes. It is the aim of this court, as of all courts of law, to do justice,\u2014not abstract justice, but justice according to law. Elementary justice seems to require that a conviction for a serious crime should not stand if it may have been based on illegal evidence.\nIn criminal matters, under s. 1014 of the Code, the court of appeal may set aside a conviction, if of the opinion \u201cthat on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.\u201d This power might well have been exercised here having regard to the charge as a whole. But, our jurisdiction is much more restricted. Under s. 1023 we can entertain an appeal only\nagainst the affirmance of (a) conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nThe present case has some most unpleasant aspects. A stenographer of repute has certified, under oath, to the delivery of a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him, contains a clear misdirection. The learned trial judge, as reported, told the jury that a statement of the complainant to her aunt, which was admissible only to show the consistency of her conduct, in itself amounted to distinct evidence of the guilt of the accused.\nOn the other hand, we have also before us a statement or certificate, furnished by the trial judge under direction of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in which he says his direction was not as so reported, but precisely the contrary. This is relied upon by the Crown as a report under s. 1020 of the Criminal Code, and it is contended that effect must be given to it and the stenographer\u2019s transcription ignored.\nWere the certificate of the trial judge before us really a report made in conformity with s. 1020 of the Criminal Code, the case would present greater difficulty and it may be that effect would have to be given to it. But, as we read s. 1020, the certificate of the trial judge now before us, which consists in a number of statements made by him in answer to a corresponding number of objections to his charge, which formed the grounds of appeal, and was prepared by him some two or three months after the trial and after the argument of the appeal in the Court of King\u2019s Bench\u2014indeed, counsel assure us, after that court had determined that, on the stenographic transcription, the appeal before it must be allowed,\u2014is not such a report as s. 1020 contemplates. It certainly does not contain the learned judge\u2019s \u201cnotes of the trial\u201d; nor is it a \u201creport giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case.\u201d\nS. 1020 provides that, as part of the material to be put before the court of appeal, the trial judge or magistrate shall furnish to the court \u201chis notes of the trial\u201d and shall also send \u201ca report giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case\u201d and apparently contemplates this being done immediately after the trial, or at least, so soon as an appeal is lodged. It was never intended by this section to enable the trial judge, after an appeal had been argued, to put before the court of appeal by way of certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or by direction of the court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken upon the appeal. That, in substance, is what has been done in this case. We cannot regard such a certificate of the trial judge as having been properly given, nor as a report within s. 1020. That being so, we are left with nothing authentic and regularly before the court to establish that the charge was not what the stenographic transcription shews; and upon that, as already stated, the misdirection is so plain and so fatal in its consequences that a new trial is inevitable. Justice requires that a conviction where there is such grave uncertainty as to the propriety of the direction under which it was made should not be allowed to stand.\nThat such uncertainty exists in this case is obvious, since, against the accuracy of the note made at the moment of utterance by a careful, sworn stenographer, acting in the discharge of his usual functions, there is nothing but the recollection by a judge, however eminent and careful, of the precise language used by him some two or three months before.\nThis case is most exceptional. We trust such circumstances will not again arise; and the present decision can be relied upon only in a case which is on all fours with that before us.\nThe conviction will accordingly be set aside and a new trial had.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] (1928) Q.R. 47 K.B. 371.\n",

A cette fin,\ntout h\u00e9ritier, l\u00e9gataire universel, l\u00e9gataire \u00e0 titre universel ou l\u00e9gataire \u00e0 titre particulier, donataire en vertu d\u2019une disposition mention-n\u00e9e dans l\u2019article 1376 (a), ex\u00e9cuteur, fid\u00e9icommissaire ou administrateur, ou notaire qui a re\u00e7u un testament ou codicille, doit, dans les trente jours qui suivent le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur ou du de cujus, transmettre au percepteur du revenu de la province du district o\u00f9 le testateur est mort, ou dans lequel la succession est ouverte, une copie dudit testament ou codicille du testateur ou dudit acte de donation (art. 1381-1),\net chacun d\u2019eux, sauf le notaire, doit, dans les trois mois qui suivent le d\u00e9c\u00e8s, transmettre \u00e0 ce percepteur une d\u00e9claration sous serment contenant diverses indications et, entre autres,\n1381-2.\nc. La description, la situation et la valeur r\u00e9elle de tous les biens transmis par le d\u00e9funt;\nf. La nature et la valeur de la part du d\u00e9clarant dans la succession, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction faite des dettes et charges par lui payables ou grevant les biens qui composent cette part et d\u2019apr\u00e8s la connaissance qu\u2019il en a, la nature et la valeur des parts de chacun des autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, apr\u00e8s avoir fait une semblable d\u00e9duction pour chacun d\u2019eux.\nUne d\u00e9claration d\u00fbment faite par l\u2019une des personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans le paragraphe 2 du pr\u00e9sent article, si elle contient tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir les montants de tous les droits payables au sujet de ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s, lib\u00e8re toutes les autres de l\u2019obligation de faire cette d\u00e9claration.\nOr, voici maintenant la question qui est soumise. Elle est bien pos\u00e9e par M. le juge Tellier, dans son jugement en Cour du Banc du Roi:\nMais, quand les droits sont payables par l\u2019usufruitier, est-il tenu de les payer \u00e0 m\u00eame ses propres biens, ou \u00e0 m\u00eame les biens de la succession dont il a l\u2019usufruit? En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019usufruitier qui paie, quand les droits sont exigibles de lui, acquitte-t-il sa propre dette, ou celle de la succession dont les biens sont sujets \u00e0 son usufruit? Voil\u00e0 La question d\u00e9battue dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLa r\u00e9ponse n\u2019est pas facile. Nous allons donner les raisons qui nous conduisent \u00e0 la solution que nous adoptons.\nLes droits de succession sont impos\u00e9s uniquement par l\u2019article 1375 du statut:\nTout bien mobilier ou immobilier, dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019usufruit ou la jouissance est transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, est frapp\u00e9 des droits suivants, sur la valeur du bien transmis, etc.\nIl n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre article qui impose la taxe.\nSi l\u2019on analyse cet article, on constate que la taxe est impos\u00e9e sur les biens. En son essence, ce n\u2019est pas une taxe personnelle. Les droits \u201cfrappent\u201d les biens. Et ils les \u201cfrappent\u201d sur la valeur du bien transmis. Cela veut dire: sur la valeur du bien lui-m\u00eame et non sur la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019usufruit ou de la jouissance de ce bien. C\u2019est le bien qui, par le fait de sa transmission, est \u201cfrapp\u00e9\u201d. La loi, pour imposer la taxe ou en d\u00e9terminer le taux, ne s\u2019occupe pas du caract\u00e8re du droit (propri\u00e9t\u00e9, usufruit ou jouissance) de celui auquel le bien sera remis par suite de sa transmission.\nTelle est, suivant nous, la nature de la taxe impos\u00e9e par cette loi de Qu\u00e9bec relative aux droits sur les successions (4 Geo. V, c. 9).\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que c\u2019est une taxe qui frappe le capital. Elle impose des droits qui doivent provenir du bien transmis.\nCela est confirm\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019elle comporte sur ce bien un privil\u00e8ge, \u201cprenant rang imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s les frais de justice\u201d (art. 1385 de 4 Geo. V) et encore par la d\u00e9finition du mot \u201cbien\u201d qui, pour les fins de cette loi, ne comprend que le \u201cmeuble ou immeuble r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9 dans les limites de la province, etc.\u201d, que\nla personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e ait ou n\u2019ait pas son domicile dans * * * la province, ou que la transmission ait lieu dans la province ou hors de ses limites (art. 1370).\nC\u2019est le bien dans la province que l\u2019on veut atteindre.\nSi, maintenant, l\u2019on passe aux articles 1380 et 1381, l\u2019on s\u2019aper\u00e7oit qu\u2019ils n\u2019imposent pas de taxe. Ils d\u00e9signent \u201cles personnes qui sont appel\u00e9es \u00e0 la payer\u201d (comparer avec le pr\u00e9ambule du chapitre 11 (onze) du statut 4 Geo. V, neuvi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a); et ils indiquent la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre dans ce but.\nLe testament et une d\u00e9claration doivent \u00eatre transmis au percepteur du revenu par l\u2019une de certaines personnes mentionn\u00e9es. Notons, en passant, que l\u2019usufruit ou le grev\u00e9 de substitution ne figure pas nomm\u00e9ment dans l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration de ces personnes. Ils sont englob\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9signation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale: h\u00e9ritier, l\u00e9gataire ou donataire.\nUne seule d\u00e9claration d\u00fbment faite suffit et lib\u00e8re toutes les autres personnes de l\u2019obligation de transmettre leur d\u00e9claration. Cette d\u00e9claration sp\u00e9cifie \u201cla nature et la valeur de la part du d\u00e9clarant dans la succession\u201d et celles \u201cdes parts de chacun des autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires\u201d.\nSur r\u00e9ception de ces documents, et apr\u00e8s que les informations qu\u2019ils contiennent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9es (art. 1381-9 et amendements), le percepteur pr\u00e9pare un \u00e9tat des droits qui doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s par chacun des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et adresse \u00e0 chacun deux \u201cl\u2019\u00e9tat qui le concerne\u201d. Sur d\u00e9faut du paiement des droits dans les trente jours, il peut en poursuivre le recouvrement devant toute cour de juridiction comp\u00e9tente.\nEt l\u2019article 1380 sp\u00e9cifie les personnes \u00e0 qui le percepteur du revenu doit s\u2019adresser pour le paiement. Ce sont: l\u2019h\u00e9ritier, le l\u00e9gataire universel, le l\u00e9gataire \u00e0 titre universel, le l\u00e9gataire \u00e0 titre particulier, le donataire en vertu d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort (ou en vertu d\u2019une disposition mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019article 1376a).\nChacun d\u2019eux est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u201cpersonnellement responsable des droits dus\u201d. Mais l\u2019article ajoute: \u201cpour sa part dans la succession et de rien de plus\u201d.\nOn voit que, de nouveau, l\u2019usufruitier et le grev\u00e9 de substitution ne sont pas sp\u00e9cialement nomm\u00e9s dans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que nous venons de faire, en nous basant sur le premier paragraphe de l\u2019art. 1380. Cette remarque n\u2019est pas sans importance, parce que ce premier paragraphe est le seul qui \u00e9dicte express\u00e9ment une responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle. Sans doute, l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 de substitution tomberait dans la cat\u00e9gorie des l\u00e9gataires ou des donataires, mais \u00e0 ce titre et comme tel, il ne serait personnellement responsable que \u201cpour sa part dans la succession et de rien de plus\u201d.\nCependant l\u2019article poursuit:\nDans le cas de transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec usufruit ou substitution, les droits sont payables par l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9, et ne sont exigibles d\u2019aucun autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nCe deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article est ambigu. Il dit bien que le percepteur du revenu, \u201cdans le cas de transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec usufruit ou substitution\u201d devra percevoir les droits de l\u2019usufruitier ou du grev\u00e9 (selon le cas) et qu\u2019il ne pourra les exiger \u201cd\u2019aucun autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire\u201d. Mais il ne dit pas, comme dans le paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, que l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 en est personnellement responsable. Or, cette cons\u00e9quence ne suit pas n\u00e9cessairement de l\u2019emploi du seul mot \u201cpayables\u201d dans la phrase: \u201cles droits sont payables par l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9\u201d. La preuve en est dans le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe du m\u00eame article 1380, en vertu duquel l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur, le fid\u00e9icommissaire ou l\u2019administrateur peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer ces droits,\nmais il n\u2019en est pas \u201cpersonnellement responsable\u201d.\nD\u2019autre part, le premier paragraphe de l\u2019article \u00e9num\u00e8re les personnes qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es personnellement responsables et nous venons de voir que l\u2019usufruitier et le grev\u00e9 n\u2019y sont pas nomm\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s.\nDe cette premi\u00e8re analyse nous pouvons tirer les constatations suivantes:\n1\u00b0 Le l\u00e9gislateur ne nomme pas l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 parmi les personnes qu\u2019il rend personnellement responsables des droits sur les successions.\n2\u00b0 Il se peut que l\u2019usufruitier et le grev\u00e9 soient compris dans les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u00e9gataire ou donataire, employ\u00e9s dans le premier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1380, mais alors ils ne seraient, suivant les termes de cet article, personnellement responsables que chacun \u201cpour sa part dans la succession et de rien de plus\u201d.\n3\u00b0 Si, au contraire, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas voulu inclure l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 dans les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u00e9gataire ou de donataire, \u201cdans le cas de transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec usufruit ou substitution\u201d, et s\u2019il a entendu faire pour ce cas une r\u00e8gle \u00e0 part, contenue uniquement dans le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 1380, il faudrait alors dire, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles ordinaires d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, que ni l\u2019usufruitier, ni le grev\u00e9 (dans le cas pr\u00e9vu par ce paragraphe) ne sont personnellement responsables des droits. En effet:\n(a) Ils seraient exclus du paragraphe qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les personnes personnellement responsables; et, en les mentionnant \u00e0 part, dans un autre paragraphe qui vient imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, l\u2019intention semblerait \u00eatre de les mettre sur un pied diff\u00e9rent.\n(b) La pr\u00e9somption est que, si le l\u00e9gislateur e\u00fbt voulu les tenir personnellement responsables, il e\u00fbt exprim\u00e9 cette intention dans les m\u00eames termes qu\u2019il venait d\u2019employer \u00e0 cette fin dans la clause pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du m\u00eame article.\nIl existe toutefois une interpr\u00e9tation alternative. Ce serait que l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 f\u00fbt \u201cpersonnellement responsable\u201d, \u00e0 titre de l\u00e9gataire ou de donataire, \u201cpour sa part dans la succession\u201d, en vertu du paragraphe 1er de l\u2019article 1380, et qu\u2019il f\u00fbt en outre tenu de payer la balance des droits \u201cen qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers leur appartenant\u201d (suivant l\u2019expression contenue dans le 10e alin\u00e9a du chapitre 11 du statut 4 Geo. V).\nNous ne voulons pas dire par l\u00e0 que les droits devraient \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s en deux montants repr\u00e9sentant respectivement la valeur de l\u2019usufruit ou de la substitution d\u2019une part et la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019autre part. Nous avons vu que l\u2019article 1375 ne comporte pas cette interpr\u00e9tation. Les droits doivent \u00eatre bas\u00e9s sur la valeur du bien qui a fait l\u2019objet de la transmission. Mais, le montant des droits \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 ne devrait personnellement que la partie de ce montant proportionnelle \u00e0 \u201csa part dans la succession\u201d (suivant le premier paragraphe de 1380), tout en \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9 de payer la balance du montant global des droits (suivant le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de 1380) \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers de la succession qu\u2019il a en sa possession.\nOn peut concevoir que le l\u00e9gislateur ait voulu ainsi \u00e9viter au percepteur du revenu les ennuis d\u2019une collection de droits contre des nu-propri\u00e9taires ou des appel\u00e9s nombreux, dispers\u00e9s, et dont quelques-uns pouvaient n\u2019\u00eatre pas n\u00e9s ou avoir seulement des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9ventuels. Il existait d\u2019excellentes raisons pour que le parlement facilit\u00e2t la t\u00e2che en ordonnant que, pour le paiement de la taxe, le percepteur ne serait tenu de s\u2019adresser qu\u2019\u00e0 celui qui, au moment o\u00f9 cette taxe devenait due, se trouvait en possession des biens de la succession. (Nous renvoyons sur ce point au jugement de M. le juge de Lorimier dans la cause de Blache v. L\u00e9vesque[2], reproduit dans le rapport de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi en cette cause).\nMais l\u2019article 1380 contient un troisi\u00e8me paragraphe qui, nous l\u2019avouons, affaiblit notre raisonnement. Il pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, le fid\u00e9icommissaire ou l\u2019administrateur peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les droits de succession. Et il d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que, dans ce cas, il n\u2019est pas personnellement responsable de ces droits, qu\u2019il paiera seulement \u201c\u00e0 m\u00eame les biens ou les deniers qu\u2019il a en sa possession appartenant ou revenant aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires\", qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre poursuivi seulement \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 et que le \u201cjugement rendu contre lui en cette qualit\u00e9 ne doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 que sur (les) biens ou (les) deniers\u201d qu\u2019il a ainsi en sa possession.\nSi maintenant l\u2019on a recours \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9j\u00e0 suivie pour les paragraphes 1 et 2, il est \u00e9vident que la pr\u00e9sence du paragraphe 3 y jette une certaine confusion. Il serait logique de se demander pourquoi un l\u00e9gislateur, ayant l\u2019intention (que nous avons pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e) de ne pas rendre l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 personnellement responsable au moins de la balance des droits en exc\u00e8s de \u201csa part dans la succession\", n\u2019aurait pas exprim\u00e9 cette intention dans les termes si clairs qu\u2019il emploie lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur, du fid\u00e9icommissaire ou de l\u2019administrateur.\nIl y a bien une explication.\nLa Loi de Qu\u00e9bec relative aux droits sur les successions de 1914 a voulu rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019arr\u00eat du Conseil priv\u00e9 re Cotton v. The King[3] rendu le 11 novembre 1913 et d\u00e9clarant la loi ant\u00e9rieure inconstitutionnelle parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait suppos\u00e9e imposer une taxe indirecte, contrairement aux prescriptions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord. L\u2019article 1380 est un des articles adopt\u00e9s dans ce but. Le premier et le troisi\u00e8me paragraphes sont nouveaux; le deuxi\u00e8me ne l\u2019est pas. Il remonte \u00e0 la loi 55-56 Victoria, chapitre 17, sanctionn\u00e9e en 1892, o\u00f9 il se trouvait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les m\u00eames termes. Il fut conserv\u00e9 dans la loi 6 Edouard VII, chapitre 11; puis reproduit, comme article 1379, dans les Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1909. On le retrouve maintenant, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement modifi\u00e9\u2014mais ces modifications n\u2019affectent pas le droit que nous discutons\u2014et il est intercal\u00e9, en conservant textuellement sa partie essentielle, entre les paragraphes 1 et 3 de l\u2019article 1380 de la loi de 1914.\nIl ne faut donc pas perdre de vue que ce texte est ant\u00e9rieur au jugement dans Cotton v. The King3 et date d\u2019une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019on n\u2019\u00e9tait pas hant\u00e9 par l\u2019objection du Conseil priv\u00e9. Pour cette raison, sans doute, ce texte ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00e9viter l\u2019obstacle de la taxe indirecte avec une pr\u00e9cision dans les termes aussi minutieuse que celle que l\u2019on trouve dans les paragraphes 1 et 3, qui sont nouveaux.\nMais ce qu\u2019il est important de retenir, c\u2019est que le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 1380 est un texte de loi ant\u00e9rieur au jugement rendu par le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil priv\u00e9 re Cotton v. The King[4].\nOr, le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1914, la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a adopt\u00e9 une Loi concernant certains droits impos\u00e9s sur les successions (Statuts de Qu\u00e9bec, 4 Geo. V, chapitre 11). C\u2019est une loi interpr\u00e9tative et d\u00e9claratoire. Le pr\u00e9ambule r\u00e9f\u00e8re d\u2019abord au jugement Cotton4 et dit que, par suite de ce jugement,\ndes doutes se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur la question de d\u00e9terminer si les taxes impos\u00e9es par la loi * * * 6 Edouard VII, chapitre II (alors les articles 1374 \u00e0 1387 des Statuts Refondus de 1909) \u00e9taient des taxes directes;\nque ces doutes provenaient de ce que le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire aurait compris que la loi imposait la totalit\u00e9 des droits \u00e0 percevoir sur certaines personnes dans l\u2019expectative qu\u2019elles recouvrent ensuite le montant ainsi pay\u00e9 de ceux qui \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s dans la succession; puis le pr\u00e9ambule affirme: Aucune des lois ant\u00e9rieures ou post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la loi 6 Edouard VII, chapitre 11, concernant les droits sur les successions, n\u2019avait pour objet d\u2019imposer ou n\u2019a impos\u00e9 des droits sur la personne faisant la d\u00e9claration, mais, au contraire, elles ont eu pour objet de taxer et ont tax\u00e9 directement, et sans recours en faveur de qui que ce soit, tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la succession.\nLe pr\u00e9ambule parle ensuite du passage suivant de la loi ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1914:\nLa d\u00e9claration d\u00fbment faite par une des personnes ci-dessus lib\u00e8re les autres en ce qui regarde cette d\u00e9claration,\nlequel, rapproch\u00e9 des autres parties de la loi autorisant une demande de paiement au \u201cd\u00e9clarant\u201d, semble avoir servi de base au jugement du Conseil priv\u00e9. Mais il fait remarquer que ce membre de phrase n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans la loi originaire relative aux droits sur les successions et n\u2019y a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 que par la section 2 de la loi 58 Victoria, chapitre 16. Avant cette derni\u00e8re loi,\nchacune des personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans une succession \u00e9tait tenue de faire la d\u00e9claration, et tenue seule de payer les taxes impos\u00e9es sur sa part dans la succession, et * * * ces taxes \u00e9taient en cons\u00e9quence des taxes directes. Et nous reproduisons textuellement les deux alin\u00e9as suivants du pr\u00e9ambule parce qu\u2019ils ont une importance sp\u00e9ciale:\nAttendu que la section 2 de la loi 58 Victoria, chapitre 16, n\u2019avait pas pour objet de changer et ne changeait pas la nature de la taxe ou les personnes appel\u00e9es \u00e0 la payer; son seul objet et son seul effet \u00e9tant d\u2019emp\u00eacher la production inutile de plusieurs documents contenant les m\u00eames renseignements;\nAttendu que, m\u00eame si un d\u00e9clarant, faisant la d\u00e9claration dont il s\u2019agit, pouvait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la totalit\u00e9 des taxes dues \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 m\u00eame l\u2019actif de la succession, ce paiement ne serait pas un paiement fait par une seule personne dans l\u2019expectative de se faire indemniser par d\u2019autres personnes, mais serait un paiement fait par une personne en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers leur appartenant;\nPuis vient la loi proprement dite:\n1. L\u2019objet et le sens de toutes les lois de la L\u00e9gislature imposant des droits sur les successions, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et sont que toute personne \u00e0 laquelle des biens ou quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat s\u2019y rattachant, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, devait payer au gouvernement directement, et sans aucun recours contre qui que ce soit, une taxe calcul\u00e9e sur la valeur des biens ainsi transmis.\nNous avons donc l\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Parlement lui-m\u00eame sur les lois ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1914 et sur la Loi de Qu\u00e9bec relative aux droits sur les successions (4 Geo. V, chapitre 9).\nLeur objet est de\ntaxer * * * directement, et sans recours en faveur de qui que ce soit, tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la succession.\nAvant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi 58 Victoria, chapitre 16,\nchacune des personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans une succession \u00e9tait * * * tenue seule de payer les taxes impos\u00e9es sur sa part dans la succession.\nLa loi 58 Victoria\nn\u2019avait pas pour objet de changer et ne changeait pas la nature de la taxe ou les personnes appel\u00e9es \u00e0 la payer.\nM\u00eame si un seul d\u00e9clarant\npouvait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la totalit\u00e9 des taxes dues \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 m\u00eame l\u2019actif de la succession, ce paiement * * * serait un paiement fait par une personne en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers leur appartenant.\nL\u2019objet et le sens (de la loi est que) toute personne, \u00e0 laquelle des biens ou quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat s\u2019y rattachant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, devait payer au gouvernement directement * * * une taxe calcul\u00e9e sur la valeur des biens ainsi transmis.\nNous omettons \u00e0 dessein, pour y revenir plus tard, la phrase: \u201cet sans aucun recours contre qui que ce soit\u201d, qui n\u2019est qu\u2019une incidente. Il reste maintenant \u00e0 tirer nos conclusions sur la loi telle que nous la trouvons en 1921, lors de l\u2019ouverture de la succession de M. Bleau.\nLes droits frappent les biens et non les personnes. Ils doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s sur la valeur du bien transmis, et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur est de les pr\u00e9lever de\ntous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la succession * * * de toute personne \u00e0 laquelle des biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nCette intention, manifest\u00e9e clairement dans la loi interpr\u00e9tative (4 Geo. V, chapitre 11), trouve son expression dans le paragraphe 1 de l\u2019article 1380 qui rend tout h\u00e9ritier, l\u00e9gataire ou donataire personnellement responsable des droits dus. L\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 de substitution est un l\u00e9gataire ou un donataire et il tombe donc sous le coup du paragraphe 1. Quand il y a transmission par d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la fois de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l\u2019usufruit, ou quand il y a substitution, rendre l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 seul d\u00e9biteur de la taxe, serait lib\u00e9rer le nu-propri\u00e9taire ou l\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution et serait donc contraire \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi qui veut que \u201ctous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la succession\u201d soient atteints. C\u2019est pourquoi le paragraphe 2 de l\u2019article 1380 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans un langage diff\u00e9rent du paragraphe 1. Ce langage est voulu et il exprime exactement le principe qui est \u00e0 la base de toute la loi. Ce paragraphe 2 ne taxe pas l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement. Nulle part dans cette loi l\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9 ne sont tax\u00e9s nomm\u00e9ment comme tels. Leur responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle n\u2019existe que de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les autres l\u00e9gataires ou donataires, en vertu du paragraphe 1 de l\u2019article 1380, pour leur \u201cpart dans la succession\u201d et \u201crien de plus\u201d. Cette interpr\u00e9tation s\u2019impose a fortiori lorsque l\u2019usufruit n\u2019est transmis qu\u2019\u00e0 titre universel ou \u00e0 titre particulier.\nLes paragraphes 2 et 3 de l\u2019article 1380 ne sont l\u00e0 que pour \u00e9tablir le m\u00e9canisme de la collection.\nDans le cas de transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avec usufruit ou substitution, le percepteur du revenu doit r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019usufruitier ou du grev\u00e9, de m\u00eame que, lorsqu\u2019il y a un ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, un fid\u00e9icommissaire ou un administrateur, il peut la r\u00e9clamer de l\u2019un d\u2019eux, suivant le cas. L\u2019usufruitier ou le grev\u00e9, en acquittant la totalit\u00e9 des droits, en paie une partie dont il est responsable personnellement \u201cpour sa part dans la succession \u201d et il paie l\u2019autre partie comme repr\u00e9sentant le nu-propri\u00e9taire ou l\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers appartenant \u00e0 ce dernier. L\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur, le fid\u00e9icommissaire ou l\u2019administrateur, appel\u00e9 \u00e0 solder les droits, les paie \u00e0 m\u00eame les biens ou les deniers qu\u2019il a en sa possession appartenant ou revenant aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires.\nL\u2019usufruitier est relev\u00e9 pour autant de son obligation de \u201cconserver la substance\u201d (art. 443 C.C.) de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le grev\u00e9 de substitution est \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 pro tanto de celle de \u201crendre\u201d la chose (art. 944 C.C.) par la force m\u00eame de cette loi, qui est pour chacun d\u2019eux une justification suffisante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du nu-propri\u00e9taire ou de l\u2019appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution. On peut m\u00eame dire que le corpus de la succession, qui fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019usufruit ou de la substitution, est d\u00e9finitivement constitu\u00e9 seulement apr\u00e8s le paiement des droits de succession.\nIl y a une difficult\u00e9: si l\u2019usufruitier trouve dans la succession les deniers suffisants pour acquitter les droits comme repr\u00e9sentant le nu-propri\u00e9taire, il n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 payer \u00e0 m\u00eame ces deniers. S\u2019il ne les trouve pas, comme il n\u2019a pas en vertu du Code le pouvoir d\u2019ali\u00e9ner les biens, il faudrait dire que la loi relative aux droits sur les successions lui conf\u00e8re ce pouvoir. Elle ne le fait pas en termes expr\u00e8s. On ne peut supposer qu\u2019elle ait voulu apporter au droit commun une modification aussi profonde sans le dire d\u2019une fa\u00e7on explicite. Il resterait donc que, dans ce cas, pour la part du nu-propri\u00e9taire, l\u2019usufruitier devrait se laisser poursuivre. Mais cela n\u2019est pas un obstacle \u00e0 notre interpr\u00e9tation, puisque alors l\u2019usufruitier se trouvera dans la m\u00eame position que l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur, le fid\u00e9icommissaire ou l\u2019administrateur, qui ne trouverait pas dans la succession des deniers suffisants pour acquitter les droits et qui n\u2019aurait pas le pouvoir de vendre pour se les procurer. La \u201cdette privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e\u201d de la Couronne, pour la somme ainsi due (art. 1385), serait alors recouvr\u00e9e par voie de saisie-conservatoire sur les biens mobiliers ou par voie d\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire contre les biens immobiliers frapp\u00e9s par les droits (art. 1375). Les articles 2059 et 2060 du Code civil pourvoient \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re action; sauf que, pour ce cas particulier, l\u2019action ne devrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e que contre l\u2019usufruitier et serait seulement d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e au nu-propri\u00e9taire comme mis-en-cause. Nous sommes donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante comme usufruiti\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait personnellement responsable que des droits dus \u201cpour sa part dans la succession et de rien de plus\u201d. Elle devait payer la totalit\u00e9 des droits pour se conformer au paragraphe 2 de l\u2019article 1380, mais quant \u00e0 la balance au del\u00e0 de sa part il lui fallait payer seulement \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers appartenant aux intim\u00e9s nu-propri\u00e9taires. Elle a pay\u00e9 avec son propre argent et elle a le droit d\u2019en \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e.\nL\u2019article 474 C.C. ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 ce cas parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une dette du de cujus; mais sa fa\u00e7on de fixer la contribution de chaque partie nous para\u00eet indiquer la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der. Le principe que pose cet article est que le nu-propri\u00e9taire supporte la dette quant au capital, et l\u2019usufruitier quant aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, pendant la dur\u00e9e de la jouissance. (Laurent, Droit civil, 3e \u00e9d. t. 7, n\u00b0 19).\nAinsi, dit M. Mignault (Droit civil canadien, vol. 2, page 618) ), le legs de l\u2019usufruit porte-t-il sur l\u2019universabilit\u00e9 des biens: l\u2019usufruitier, qui a tous les revenus actifs, supporte tous les revenus passifs de la succession, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la totalit\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats, des dettes et des charges, lesquelles sont support\u00e9es pour le capital par les successeurs universels ou \u00e0 titre universel de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Porte-t-il seulement sur une fraction, par exemple, sur un tiers ou sur un quart des biens: l\u2019usufruitier supporte une fraction correspondante, un tiers ou un quart, des int\u00e9r\u00eats des dettes et des charges de la succession.\nDe cette fa\u00e7on, l\u2019usufruitier perd alors la jouissance et le propri\u00e9taire la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens qui servent \u00e0 acquitter les droits de succession; et chacun se trouve \u00e0 y contribuer suivant l\u2019esprit du droit commun dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ici, il n\u2019y a lieu \u00e0 aucune estimation entre l\u2019appelante et les intim\u00e9s, puisque la donation d\u2019usufruit est universelle; l\u2019usufruiti\u00e8re ayant tous les revenus actifs doit supporter l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des droits pour la totalit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019elle a l\u2019enti\u00e8re jouissance des biens qui sont soumis \u00e0 ces droits (Laurent, Droit civil, 3e \u00e9d., t. 7, n\u00b0 29; Mignault, Droit civil canadien, vol. 2, p. 619).\nNous atteindrons ce r\u00e9sultat en d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019appelante a droit de se faire payer, \u00e0 m\u00eame les capitaux composant la succession de feu Eug\u00e8ne Bleau, la somme de $1,530.80 pay\u00e9e par elle pour droits sur la succession de son mari, et en ordonnant aux d\u00e9fendeurs de lui payer ce montant, mais sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. Cette solution concilie la loi des droits de succession avec les principes du droit civil, en vertu duquel l\u2019usufruitier n\u2019est tenu que des charges ordinaires et des rentes ou contributions annuelles (art. 471 C.C.) et qui ne le fait contribuer aux dettes que dans la proportion de son int\u00e9r\u00eat (art. 474 C.C.). Le droit de mutation par d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u00fb \u00e0 raison de la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est une charge du capital. L\u2019usufruitier qui l\u2019a acquitt\u00e9e de ses propres deniers a le droit d\u2019en demander le remboursement imm\u00e9diat, sans attendre la fin de son usufruit. En lui reconnaissant ce droit, nous n\u2019allons pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la prescription: \u201cet sans aucun recours contre qui que ce soit\u201d contenue dans l\u2019article 1 de la loi 4 Geo. V, chapitre 11. Cette phrase incidente a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment ins\u00e9r\u00e9e par surcro\u00eet de prudence, pour se pr\u00e9munir contre le danger de la taxe indirecte; mais elle ne sert pas \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la nature du droit impos\u00e9, non plus que l\u2019objet et le sens de la loi. Elle est surabondante, puisque celui qui paie des droits de succession conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi, le fait de ses propres deniers lorsqu\u2019il est personnellement responsable, ou des deniers de la succession lorsqu\u2019il agit comme repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019h\u00e9ritier, du l\u00e9gataire ou du donataire, que ce dernier soit propri\u00e9taire, nu-propri\u00e9taire ou appel\u00e9 de substitution; dans l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre alternative, il ne saurait y avoir de \u201crecours contre qui que ce soit\u201d ni en fait, ni en droit.\nL\u2019appel est maintenu de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens contre les intim\u00e9s dans toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, McDougall & Demers.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Laflamme, Mitchell & Kearney.\n[1] [1929] Q.R. 46 K.B. 450.\n[2] Q.R. 35 K.B. 30, at pp. 32, 33.\n[3] [1914] A.C. 176.\n3 [1914] A.C. 176.\n[4] [1914] A.C. 176.\n4 [1914] A.C. 176.\n",

On July 11, 1926, the wife of the appellant O\u2019Connor and the appellant Boyd, while walking on a highway called Montreal Road, near the city of Ottawa, in the province of Ontario, were both struck by the motor car driven by Cochrane in a reckless manner and at an excessive rate of speed. Mrs. O\u2019Connor was instantly killed and the other appellant suffered permanent injuries. Actions in damages were brought against the respondent, owner of the car, in the Superior Court of the province of Quebec.\nHeld, that, in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act of Quebec as well as with the weight of judicial opinion in the courts of that province, the respondent cannot be held responsible for loss or damage sustained by the appellants by reason of his motor vehicle, negligence or improper conduct imputable to the respondent having been disproven. Anglin C.J.C. dissenting.\nPer Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014Article 53 (1) of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35, respecting the liability of the owner of a motor vehicle, now reads: \u201c53 (1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be held responsible for any violation of this Act committed with such motor vehicle, or of any regulation made thereunder by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\u201d But a similar clause, when enacted by the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, Art. 1406, contained at the end the following words \u201cand shall be responsible for all accidents or damages caused by his motor vehicle upon a highway or public square.\u201d These words disappeared when the article was replaced by the amending Act, chapter 19, of 1912. By the article as formerly enacted, the liability which is imposed to compensate for accidents or damages, as distinguished from that incurred for any violation of the statute or regulations, was founded upon the concluding sentence. Of these two clauses the first did not expressly, or with any degree of certainty, declare liability for damages; the second did. The charging clause having been repealed, there remains no provision upon which to hold that the owner is bound to compensate when he has committed no fault. Moreover, this interpretation is made conclusive by the implication of subsection 2 of article 53, which establishes the materiality of negligence or improper conduct by the owner. Anglin C.J.C. contra.\nQuaere, per Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ., whether the respondent ever became subject to the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario.\nPer Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014Under the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario (1923), the respondent would not have been liable, as the loss or damage claimed was sustained \u201cby reason of a motor vehicle on a highway\u201d and not \u201cin case of a collision between motor vehicles.\u201d Section 42 of that statute does not apply; and the present cases fall within the purview of the special case described by section 43, which section must be considered as a modification of section 42.\nPer Anglin C.J.C, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The respondent, had he been resident in the province of Ontario, would have been liable under the Ontario statute as it stood at the time the damages were sustained.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014The accident occurred because of Cochrane having driven at an excessive rate of speed and while under the influence of intoxication; and these were violations both of the Ontario and Quebec statutes. The respondent, in lending his car to Cochrane with the intention that it should be used by him in Ontario, subjected himself to the Highway Traffic Act of that province and he was so subject when the accident occurred. That fact also establishes that the driving of the car by Cochrane was with the consent of the respondent within the meaning of the Ontario statute, and of the Quebec statute if, under that Act, consent be material. Under section 42 (1) of the Ontario statute of 1923, where any violation of the Act has been shown and an accident resulting in damage to another has ensued, unless the motor vehicle which caused the accident was at the time in the possession of some person, other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, the latter is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the acts of the driver, just as he would have been had the car been driven by himself. The respondent must therefore be held liable under the Ontario law for the consequences of Cochrane\u2019s violations of the statute. Section 53 (1) of the Motor Vehicle Act of Quebec must receive the same construction as that already given to section 42 (1) of the Ontario statute of 1923 and it carries with it the civil responsibility which the latter has been held to impose. (Curley v. Latreille (60 Can. S.C.R. 131) discussed.) Therefore the respondent must be held to have incurred civil liability under the Ontario statute, and he would have incurred a like liability under the Quebec Act had the situs of the accident been in that province.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. (dissenting)\u2014As a matter of international law, in order to establish liability of the respondent, it would seem necessary that he be answerable under the law of Quebec, as well as under that of Ontario, because, while the locus delicti commissi was in Ontario, the actions were brought in Quebec. But it is not essential that the remedy for the tort in question should be identical in both provinces, i.e., that, in this case, it should be civilly actionable in each. It will suffice if the tort actually committed was actionable against the respondent, or if he was punishable therefore as a delict in Ontario, and if a like tort committed in Quebec would be civilly actionable there. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent ([1917] A.C. 195) discussed.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 46 K.B. 199) affirmed, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Boyer J. and dismissing appellants\u2019 actions in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and P. Brais K.C. for the respondent. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014(dissenting) A motor car, owned by the respondent and used in his undertaker\u2019s business in Montreal, was loaned by him to his manager, one Cochrane, for the express purpose of enabling the latter to visit his mother at Arnprior, Ont. With one Tedley, likewise in the employ of the respondent, Cochrane took the car on this trip. Cochrane\u2019s wife also accompanied him. The car was in perfect order.\nCochrane, who was driving the car at the time of the accident, was reputed to be \u201ca sober, industrious, careful and prudent man,\u201d and was familiar with motor cars and their mechanism; he held a driver\u2019s licence. The respondent has been acquitted of any fault in lending the car to Cochrane; and I accept the correctness of this finding.\nThe accident, out of which these actions arose, happened, however, because Cochrane was, on the occasion of it, neither sober, careful nor prudent; it occurred on July 11, 1926, in Ontario, near the city of Ottawa. Cochrane, as has been properly found, was intoxicated at the time and was driving in a reckless manner and at an excessive rate of speed, and it was through his negligence and violation of the provisions of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923 (0.) that the respondent\u2019s car struck and killed Margaret Butler, wife of the appellant, Walter O\u2019Connor, and severely injured the other appellant, Gertrude Boyd.\nCochrane\u2019s personal liability for damages seems to be admitted; but he is in the penitentiary and appears to have little or no property. The respondent Wray, in lending the car to Cochrane with the intention that it should be used by him in Ontario, subjected himself to The Highway Traffic Act, 1923 (0.); and he was so subject when the accident occurred. The fact that the car was loaned by Wray to Cochrane for the purpose of the visit to his mother in Ontario, also establishes that the driving of the car, at the time of the accident, by Cochrane, was with the consent of Wray, the owner, within the meaning of s. 42 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923, (0), and also of s. 53 (1) of the Motor Vehicle Act R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35, if under the latter Act such consent be material.\nThe application of the original Acts, both of Ontario and Quebec, respectively, was restricted to motor vehicles \u201cfor which a permit is issued under the provisions of the Act\u201d; (6 Edw. VIII, (O.), c. 46, s. 13) and \u201cfor which a certificate is issued under this section,\u201d (art. 1406, s. XXI, R.S.Q., 1909). Both in Ontario and Quebec this restriction has been done away with and the Acts, as they now stand in both provinces, apply equally to all motor vehicles, wherever registered and wherever owned, while being driven upon the highways of the respective provinces, Hess v. Pawlosk[2]; Stapleton v. Independent Brewing Co.[3]; Kane v. New Jersey[4]; Pizzati v. Wuchter[5].\nAs a matter of private international law, in order to establish liability of the respondent in these actions, it would seem necessary that he be answerable under the law of Quebec, as well as under that of Ontario, because, while the locus delicti comissi was in Ontario, the actions were brought in the Superior Court of Quebec, in which province the defendant resides: But it is not essential that the remedy for the tort in question should be identical in both provinces, i.e., that, in this case, it should be civilly actionable in each. It will suffice if the tort actually committed was actionable against the defendant, or if he was punishable therefore as a delict in Ontario, and if a tort committed in Quebec would be civilly actionable there. Phillips v. Eyre[6]; Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. v. Henry Benham et al (The Hadley)[7]; The Moxham[8]; Livesley v. Horst Co.[9]; Carr v. Fracis, Times & Co.[10]; Isaacs & Sons, Ltd. v. Cook[11].\nIf the implication in the language used at p. 205 of the judgment of the Privy Council, delivered by Haldane L.C., in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent[12], be that, because liability of the defendant in the jurisdiction where the wrong was committed is vicarious only (whether it arise, as in the case of master and servant, by an application of the common law maxim, respondeat superior, or, as in the case at bar, by virtue of a statutory provision, viz., s. 42 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923), the principles of private international law preclude its enforcement in the courts of another country\u2014I cannot accept that suggestion. But, on the other hand, if, as I think, all that was meant in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent[13] was that, in the absence of some statutory provision such as that found in ss. 3 of s. 53 of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35), a purely vicarious, civil liability does not per se entail penal or criminal responsibility, there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of that statement. Nor do I know of any reason for thinking that the law enforced by the courts of Quebec in these matters differs from that which obtains where the English common law prevails. (Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent[14]. Of course, I agree with the contention of the respondent, that, \u201caccording to the general principles applicable under the title of private international law,\u201d liability imposed by the law of Ontario will be enforced in the province of Quebec only in so far as it may not conflict with the policy of the law as administered in that local forum.\nBy The Highway Traffic Act, 1923 (0.), which was in force in 1926, it was enacted that,\n42. (1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of this Act or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner shall also be responsible for any such violation.\n(2) If the employer of a chauffeur is present in the motor vehicle at the time of the committing of any offence against this Act, such employer as well as the driver, shall be liable to conviction for such offence.\nThese provisions are to be found in the R.S.O. (1927), c. 251, a. 41 (1) and (2). (S.v.n. 19 Geo. V. (1929) (0) c. 68, s. 8) (a).\nNoteworthy features of s. 42 (1) are that it applies only to violations of the statute itself, or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; but that,\n(a) Section 42 of the Highway Traffic Act (Ontario) of 1923 was re-enacted as section 41 in R.S.O., 1927, c. 251; and this last section was repealed by 19 Geo. V (1929) c. 68, s. 9, and the following substituted therefor:\u2014\n41. The owner of a motor vehicle shall incur the penalties provided for any violation of this Act or of any regulation made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner shall also incur the penalties provided for any such such violation. where any such violation has been shewn and an accident resulting in damage to another has ensued, unless the motor vehicle which caused the accident was at the time in the possession of some person, other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, the latter is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the acts of the driver, just as he would have been had the car been driven by himself. That it was intended by this provision to create a new civil liability on the part of the owner in the interest of the victim of a violation of the statute by the driver or person in possession of the car, wherever such driver or person in possession was acting with the owner\u2019s consent, is, I think, manifest. The owner would be liable at common law had he, or his praepositus, been driving when the violation which caused the accident occurred. The provision of ss. 2 making the employer of a chauffeur, when present in the motor vehicle at the time of the committing of the offence, liable to conviction for such offence as well as the driver, in the opinion of Boyd C., and Latchford and Middleton JJ., and Verral v. Dominion Automobile Co.[15], made this certain. It is not improbable that in 1914 (c. 36, s. 3), 1917 (c. 49, s. 14) and 1918 (c. 37, s. 8), the legislature of Ontario, aware of the decision of a Divisional Court in 1911 (1), thought that, in most instances, civil responsibility of the driver alone would be illusory and that, in the public interest, it was essential that the owner of such a dangerous thing as an automobile should be made vicariously responsible for the civil consequences of any violation of the statute committed with his motor car, whenever possession of the car by the driver (not being the owner\u2019s chauffeur) was had with the owner\u2019s consent. Hirshman v. Beal[16]; Driscoll v. Colletti[17]; Gray v. Peterborough Radial Ry. Co.[18].\nUnder the Ontario law, therefore, there is, in my opinion, no room for doubt that the respondent became civilly liable for the consequences of Cochran\u2019s violations of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923, which resulted in the death of the plaintiff O\u2019Connor\u2019s wife and in personal injury to the plaintiff Boyd. Indeed, it is not open in this court to contend otherwise since the decision in Hall v. Toronto, Guelph Express Co.[19].\nBut it is said that while that may be so, a delict committed under like circumstances in Quebec, although it entails penal consequences for the owner, is not civilly actionable against him, and, in support of this position, reference is made to the construction to that effect, placed by the Quebec courts in several cases upon s. 53 (1) of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35), which reads,\nThe owner of a motor vehicle shall be held responsible for any violation of this Act committed with such motor vehicle, or of any regulation made thereunder by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe earlier part of s. 53 (3) contains a provision similar in import to s. 42 (2) of the Ontario Act above quoted.\nFormerly, the provision, now set forth in s. 53 (1) was found in Section XXI, art. 1406, of the revision of 1909, and read as follows:\nThe owner of a motor vehicle for which a certificate is issued under this section, shall be held responsible for any violation thereof or of any regulation provided thereunder by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; and shall be responsible for all accidents or damages caused by his motor vehicle upon a highway or public square.\nThe latter words, \u201cand shall be responsible, etc.,\u201d were struck out in 1912 (3 Geo. V. c. 19, s. 3). Under the former article (1406), while the liability imposed by the concluding part of it (now struck out) extended to all accidents or damages caused by motor vehicles on the highway, etc., whether they were or were not due to violations of the statute, \u201cresponsibility\u201d under the earlier portion (which still remains) was confined (as it now is) to \u201cviolations of this section,\u201d i.e., of the statute as it then stood, or \u201cof any regulation provided thereunder.\u201d\nAlthough it may have been quite arguable, as the article formerly stood, that, because civil liability was completely covered by its concluding clause, the application of the earlier part of the article might be restricted to responsibility for penalties imposed by the statute itself, we have now to deal with a different situation; and, unless there be some inherent ambiguity in the language of s. 53 (1) as it now stands, we cannot look to the past history of that provision in order to determine its present scope and effect. Finding no ambiguity in the language of the subsection itself, the fact that the words, \u201cand shall be responsible for all accidents, etc.,\u201d formerly appended to it, were struck out by the legislature, in 1912, may not be taken into account in construing it.\nSuch appears to be the result of the decision of the Privy Council in Ouellette v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[20]. Their Lordships intimated that a reference to previous legislation can properly be made only where it\n* * * may be forced upon a court by reason of the ambiguity employed in the use of terms which the mind could not readily grasp without a previous preliminary interpretation.\nIt may well be that the change was made in 1912 because the Quebec legislature thought it desirable to restrict civil liability of the owner of a motor vehicle, not driven by himself or his praepositus, but by another person, to cases where damages had been caused by a violation of some provision of the statute itself. This would sufficiently account for the striking out of the concluding clause of the section as it formerly stood. It is also quite probable that the legislature knew of the construction that had already been placed by the courts upon the corresponding provision of the Ontario statute in 1906 (6 Edw. VII, c. 46, s. 13), later embodied in s. 42 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923, (O.), viz., that its terms imposed civil responsibility as well as subjecting the owner to the penalties provided by the statute (Verral v. Dominion Automobile Co.[21], and, therefore, regarded the concluding clause of article 1406 (s. XXI of the R.S.Q., 1909) as superfluous in cases of damages caused by violations of the statute.\nLord Shaw, writing on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Ouellette case[22], quotes with approval, at p. 575, the following observation of the late Mr. Justice Idington:\nAnd, a remarkable feature of the contention is that the plain meaning of the words are to be given another meaning because some words used in an old Act were dropped out, when such changes as made were obviously part of a revision of the entire legislation * * * and intended to make clearer the law and improve in many respects by eliminating useless verbiage.\nHis Lordship proceeds to say:\n* * * The danger of error would become acute if once presumption were to be made that because there was a difference of expression, therefore it must necessarily follow that there was meant to be a difference of the law. The words actually employed must stand for interpretation as they are found unaffected by any such presumption. In the present case their Lordships\u2019 reference to previous legislation was not required, there being no confusion or ambiguity to remove.\nHe had observed earlier:\nIt is important that the results of the labours in Canada of bringing the law compendiously up to date, whether these be characterized by the term \u201crevision\u201d or \u201ccodification,\u201d should be not impaired by the danger alluded to,\ni.e., the danger of a reference to previous legislation. The following words of Malouin J., are also quoted approvingly, (p. 575),\nLe l\u00e9gislateur est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir voulu dire ce qu\u2019il exprime et le juge ne peut chercher en dehors du texte de la loi son intention quand le texte est clair et ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucun doute.\nThe terms of s. 53 (1) of the R.S.Q., c. 35, are, I think, quite free from ambiguity. \u201cResponsibility\u201d prima facie includes civil liability as well as penal consequences. Notwithstanding the inclusion of s. 53 in a fasciculus headed, \u201cOffences and Penalties\u201d (compare the location in the revision of 1909 under the heading \u201cOffences\u201d of former art. 1406, which admittedly bore upon civil liability) and the absence from the present subsection (1) of any provision expressly restricting its application to cases where the motor vehicle causing damage was possessed and driven with the consent of the owner, such as has been in the present Ontario statute since 1917, I am unable to distinguish s. 53 (1) of the Quebec Act, in substance or in principle, from the early part of s. 42 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923, (0.), which comes down from the original enactment. Both must bear the same construction. Moreover, the presence in s. 53 of ss. 2, the application of which to civil liability is undoubted, Marcus v. Browman[23]; Robillard v. B\u00e9langer[24], in immediate collocation with ss. 1 and followed by ss. 3, which ex facie deals with penal consequences, affords practically conclusive proof that the \u201cresponsibility\u201d dealt with in ss. 1 is civil as well as penal. Again, if penal responsibility alone is contemplated by s. 53 (1), s. 54 would seem to be impertinent.\nHaving regard to the decision of this court in Curley v. Latreille[25], and other Quebec cases, I think some restriction, such as that expressed in the latter part of s. 42 (1) of the Ontario statute, must be implied, whether upon a proper construction s. 53 (1) extends to civil liability or merely covers penal responsibility, since otherwise the owner would be \u201cresponsible\u201d for any violation of the Act, although his motor vehicle was being used by a stranger\u2014even by a thief\u2014entirely without his knowledge or consent. There can be no doubt that common law liability of the owner is restricted to cases where the motor vehicle is being driven by himself or by his pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u201cau cours de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jonctions auxquelles ce dernier est employ\u00e9.\u201d An extension of such liability by the statute to cases where the motor vehicle was being used neither by the owner nor by his pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, but, without his knowledge or consent, by some stranger, would appear to be so contrary to the principles of responsibility underlying the common law, on which exclusively Curley v. Latreille[26] was decided, that it may be presumed not to have been intended. In that case the motor car had been driven by the owner\u2019s chauffeur, but without his knowledge or consent. Hence the statute (3 Geo. V, c. 14, s. 3) was treated en passant as inapplicable[27]. The liability asserted was based on art. 1054 C.C., the statute being invoked merely in aid thereof. On the other hand, where the owner consents to, or acquiesces in, the use of his automobile by a person to whom he lends it, it can at least be said that he had the option of granting or refusing such use, as well as the choice of the person to whom he entrusted the car; and it may well be that this would, in the view of the legislature, afford a sufficient basis for making him civilly responsible, not generally, but for violations of the statute itself\u2014just as the master is civilly responsible for his servant\u2019s acts in the course of employment, even though done in violation of his master\u2019s orders, partly because he selected the servant. (Smith on Master and Servant, 7th ed. 208). Indeed, s. 11 imposes a similar vicarious civil liability on the owner of a registered car who has sold it, but has neglected to have the transfer recorded. The principle underlying the responsibility of the owner, as such, is the same in both cases. It depends on his own voluntary action or inaction. Vicarious liability of the owner of a car, qua owner, imposed by s. 53 (1) would not seem at all extraordinary to the legislature which had enacted a like liability by section 11.\nAccordingly I think s. 53 (1) of the Quebec Act must receive the construction already given to s. 42 (1) of the Ontario statute and that it carries with it the civil responsibility which the latter has been held to impose. Indeed, its terms are not distinguishable from those of the original Ontario provision, 6 Edw. VII, c. 46, s. 13, except for the omission, above referred to, of the restriction to motor vehicles \u201cfor which a certificate is issued under this section.\u201d\nThe accident in question occurred because of Cochrane having driven at an excessive rate of speed and while under the influence of intoxication. No suggestion has been advanced that it happened through any other cause. These were both violations of the statute which, in my opinion, would have entailed civil responsibility of the owner, as well as of the driver, had the accident occurred in the province of Quebec. I am, therefore, of the view that civil liability was actually imposed on the respondent by the Ontario statute and that he would have incurred a like liability under the Quebec Act had the situs of the accident been in that province. Subject to the question of the sufficiency of the pleadings, now to be considered, this conclusion involves allowing this appeal.\nThe accident complained of in these actions happened on the 26th of July, 1926. The plaintiffs\u2019 original declarations were delivered on the 9th of November, 1926, i.e., within six months after the accident, and alleged, amongst other things, that Margaret Butler and Gertrude Boyd, had been, the former killed, and the latter injured, \u201cby a motor car belonging to the defendant\u201d (par. 3); that the driver, Cochrane, was in the employ of the defendant, (par 5); that the accident occurred in the province of Ontario near the city of Ottawa, (par. 4); that it was due to the fault of Cochrane who was driving at an excessive speed, and while intoxicated, and had lost control of his car, (pars. 7, 8, 12, 13); that the defendant is liable and responsible as being the owner of the said car and the registered owner of the licence issued for the said car, (par. 18). There is no allegation that Cochrane was driving for the defendant or in the course of his employment, and the declarations would probably have been demurrable had vicarious liability of the defendant been rested solely on the common law either of Ontario or Quebec. Paragraph 14 of the original declaration in each action is as follows:\nThat the law of the province of Ontario is substantially the same as the law of the province of Quebec, regarding the manner of driving motor vehicles on the public roads, and that the car in question on the occasion in question was driven contrary to the laws and rules of the said provinces of Quebec and Ontario, to wit, in the manner above mentioned, and that moreover the maximum rate of speed allowed by the law of Ontario at the place in question was 25 miles per hour, with stipulation of lower speed when necessary to avoid accidents and according to circumstances, and that more particularly before reaching the place of the accident, the said car met with a curve in the road, which should have called the attention of the driver to reduce the speed of his car, instead of maintaining it or accelerating it, in such manner as to drive the said car over the edge of the ditch for a long distance as the said Cochrane did before the said car struck the two women (after which the said car was violently overturned).\nI regard this paragraph, read with par. 18, as not intended to do aught else than to assert civil liability of the defendant under the statutory laws both of Ontario and Quebec.\nBy paragraph 22 of the defendant\u2019s amended plea in the O\u2019Connor case (paragraph 24 in the Boyd case) to plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration, it is stated that Ronald Cochrane intending to visit his parents in Ontario,\nborrowed the Cadillac car of the defendant and on the day in question left with his wife and friend on the projected visit.\nBy paragraph 2, in each case, of the answer to the amended plea of the defendant, the plaintiff\nprays acte of the admission that the said Ronald Cochrane was using the car in question with the permission and consent of the defendant * * *.\nOn the 3rd of November, 1927, more than one year after the date of the accident, Mr. Justice Bruneau made an order allowing the plaintiffs to amend their declarations by adding to each the following paragraph, which appears as par 18a in the declaration in O\u2019Connor v. Wray, and as par. 22 in that in Boyd v. Wray:\nThat the law of the province of Ontario which concerns the manner of driving motor vehicles on the public roads in the province of Ontario is The Highway Traffic Act, 13-14 Geo. V, 1923, c. 38, statutes of Ontario and more particularly sections 42 and 43 of the said Act, which have their application in the present case, read as follows: \u201cSection 42. The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of this Act or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner shall also be responsible for any such violation. Sec. 43. When loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver;\u201d\nSection 54 of The Highway Traffic Act, 1923, (0.), requires that an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle shall be brought within six months from the time the damage was sustained (in Quebec within one year under art. 2262 (2) C. C.) and section 6 of the Fatal Accidents Act (0.) requires that an action to recover damages where the death of a person has been caused by wrongful act, neglect or default of the defendant, shall be brought within one year of such death: (See art. 1056 C. C). If, therefore, the amendment, made in November, 1927, (a year and a half after the accident occurred) should be regarded as asserting, for the first time, a cause of action under the Ontario statute, the allowance of such amendment would probably have been refused, as the statutory claim would then have been barred. (Naud v. Marcotte[28]; Croysdill v. Crescent Turkish Bath Co.[29]; Weldon v. Neal[30]; Hudson v. Fernyhough[31]; Lancaster v. Moss et all[32]. But, having regard to the terms of paragraphs 14 and 18 in each of the declarations, I think the view must have been taken (and, in my opinion, properly taken) by the learned judge who allowed the amendments in the Practice Court, that they did not amount to the preferring of new causes of action, but were tantamount to the giving of particulars under ss. 14 and 18 of the original declarations, and that, so regarded, they might be allowed to be added thereto without in any way prejudicing the rights of the defendant. Barone v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[33]. No appeal was taken from the allowance of these amendments and there is no adverse comment upon them in the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, such as would have been expected had they been open to exception. Under all the circumstances, therefore, I think the declarations should be regarded as having been originally (i.e. on the 9th of November, 1926, and, therefore, within the prescribed delay) based upon the statutory liability imposed by s. 42 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, 1923, of Ontario. I am accordingly of the opinion that these appeals should be allowed and that judgment should be entered declaring the defendant liable to the plaintiff in each action for the damages caused by his motor vehicle through the fault of the driver Cochrane. The appellant in each case is entitled to costs throughout to be paid by the respondent. As, however, the quanta of the damages have not been determined, the proper course would seem to be to remit the actions to the Superior Court\u2014merely to have the damages assessed by that court in each case.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The wife of the plaintiff, Walter O\u2019Connor, and Mrs. Gertrude Boyd, the plaintiff of that name, were on Sunday afternoon, 11th July, 1926, walking together on the Montreal Road, in the province of Ontario, when they were both struck by an overtaking automobile, belonging to the defendant, and negligently driven by Ronald Cochrane. Mrs. O\u2019Connor was instantly killed and Mrs. Boyd suffered painful and permanent injuries.\nThe defendant lives and carries on business at Montreal, in the province of Quebec; and, at the time of the accident, Cochrane, was and has been for about three years, in the defendant\u2019s employ in the capacity of manager. I extract the following from the defendant\u2019s evidence:\nQ. As your manager, what kind of work was he called upon to perform?\nA. Well, he had complete authority over everything and had all my interest to look after. When I was not there myself he acted just the same as I would myself if I was not there during my business time.\nCochrane had been granted a few holidays, and the use of one of the defendant\u2019s automobiles, in order to visit his mother who lived at Arnprior, in the province of Ontario; and, when the accident occurred, he was on his way thither, driving the car, and accompanied by his wife and one Tedley, an employee in the defendant\u2019s establishment, who had been permitted also to have leave of absence for the occasion. Both Cochrane and Tedley were qualified and experienced chauffeurs, though neither one of them, it appears, was employed exclusively in that capacity.\nThe actions were brought in the province of Quebec, not against Cochrane, who was at the time in charge of and driving the car, but against the defendant as the owner, though not in possession, who was alleged to be responsible for the damages by the law of Ontario. It was established by the proof, and found at the trial and upon appeal, that the defendant was not guilty of any negligence. The evidence in support of that seems to be perfectly clear, and the findings cannot, I think, be brought successfully into question. But the plaintiffs rely upon the Highway Traffic Act, 1923, of Ontario, chapter 48, and especially sections 42 and 43, which make the following provisions:\n42. (1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of this Act or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner shall also be responsible for any such violation.\n(2) If the employer of a chauffeur is present in the motor vehicle at the time of the committing of any offence against this Act, such employer as well as the driver shall be liable to conviction for such offence.\n43. (1) When loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver.\n(2) This section shall not apply in case of a collision between motor vehicles on the highway.\nNow it will be perceived that if it were intended that the owner, although not authorizing or participating in any violation of the Act, should, in cases to which section 43 applies, incur responsibility for damages caused by wilful or negligent conduct which constituted a violation, there would be no apparent reason for enacting, as it is enacted by section 43 for the cases to which it applies, that the onus of proof should be upon the owner to establish that the damage did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct. If it be meant that the owner, whether negligent or not, shall be responsible for the damages in all cases not within the exceptions, why should it be supposed that the legislature thought it worth while to make an utterly immaterial provision to affect the owner with relation to the burden of proof? Section 43 is evidently a modification of section 42 for the special case which section 43 describes, subject to the exception stated in the subsection. The cases now in question are within the purview of the latter section, and in my view it is difficult to find liability of the owner when it is realized that the loss or damage claimed was sustained by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, and not \u201cin case of a collision between motor vehicles,\u201d and when it is abundantly proved that there was no negligence or improper conduct on the part of the owner.\nMoreover I am not satisfied that the defendant ever became subject to the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. According to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, that Act imposes upon the defendant a liability unknown to the common law of either province, although he was neither personally nor by his agent within the province of Ontario; and it is not easy to perceive that he had any point of contact with the Ontario law, unless it be by the lending of his car to Cochrane for a journey to Ontario; and, for myself, I confess it is difficult to understand why the defendant, by consenting to lend his motor vehicle to Cochrane for the latter\u2019s journey to Arnprior thereby became subject to the local legislation of Ontario, and personally responsible for the offences and faults of the borrower in Ontario. In this connection it may be useful to contrast the judgment of the House of Lords in the leading case of Castrique v. Imrie[34], as to the jurisdiction which a state may exercise over property within its lawful control, and Lord Selborne\u2019s judgment in the Privy Council in Sirdar Gurdal Sing v. Rajah of Faridkote[35], in which effect is given, as to personal actions, to the maxim extra territoriam jus dicenti non paretur. Professor Westlake says, in his book on Private International Law, 7th edition, page 281,\nThe truth is that by entering a country or acting in it you submit yourself to its special laws only so far as legal science selects them as the rule of decision in each case. Or more truly still, you give to its special laws the opportunity of working on you to that extent. The operation of the law depends on the conditions, and where the conditions exist the law operates as well on its born subjects as on those who have brought themselves under it.\nIt is, I think, questionable that the conditions ever existed to bring the local law into operation with respect to the defendant; that question was not, however, fully discussed at the hearing, and I do not find it necessary to decide it.\nBut whatever be the interpretation of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, if it affects the case at all, it will not, according to the principles known as appertaining to private international law, be enforced by the courts of Quebec, except in so far as it does not conflict with the policy of the local forum.\nIn the Liverpool Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Henry Benham, et al. (The Halley),[36], Selwyn, L.J., pronouncing the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said:\nIt is true that in many cases the Courts of England inquire into and act upon the law of Foreign countries, as in the case of a contract entered into in a Foreign country, where, by express reference or by necessary implication, the Foreign law is incorporated with the contract, and proof and consideration of the Foreign law therefore become necessary to the construction of the contract itself. And as in the case of a collision on an ordinary road in a Foreign country, where the rule of the road in force at the place of collision may be a necessary ingredient in the determination of the question by whose fault or negligence the alleged tort was committed. But in these and similar cases the English Court admits the proof of the foreign law as part of the circumstances attending the execution of the contract, or as one of the facts upon which the existence of the tort, or the right to damages, may depend, and it then applies and enforces its own law so far as it is applicable to the case thus established; but it is, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, alike contrary to principle and to authority to hold, that an English Court of Justice will enforce a Foreign Municipal law, and will give a remedy in the shape of damages in respect of an act which, according to its own principles, imposes no liability on the person from whom the damages are claimed.\nSee also the famous judgment of Willes, J., in Phillips v. Eyre[37]; The Moxham[38], where, at page 111, Mellish, L.J., says:\nA great many cases were cited in the argument, but they almost all relate to actions respecting either wrongs to personal property or actual personal injuries. Now the law respecting personal injuries and respecting wrongs to personal property appears to me to be perfectly settled that no action can be maintained in the courts of this country on account of a wrongful act either to a person or to personal property, committed within the jurisdiction of a foreign country, unless the act is wrongful by the law of the country where it is committed and also wrongful by the law of this country. The cases of The Halley[39], and Phillips v. Eyre[40], together with the other cases in conformity with them, seem to be conclusive upon the subject.\nMachado v. Fontes[41]; Carr v. Fracias, Times & Co.[42]; Isaacs & Sons Ltd. v. Cook[43]; Livesley v. Horst Co.[44].\nThe law of England and of the Canadian provinces, where the common law of England prevails, is thus clearly established, and rests upon the highest authority, and Willes J. made the remark in his judgment in Phillips v. Eyre (1), that\nOur courts are said to be more open to admit actions founded upon foreign transactions than those of any other European country.\nNo sufficient authority has been cited for the proposition that a more generous rule prevails in the province of Quebec than that sanctioned by the common law of England, and a decision that the courts of that province are to administer the lex loci delicti commissi, irrespective of the law of the forum, would introduce a distinction which might be attended with inconvenient results.\nUpon the question as to whether the lex fori and lex loci delicti commissi must concur in order that an act or an omission may be deemed tortious, it is said in Westlake\u2019s Private International Law, 7th edition, at page 28.\nOn the continent there is no general agreement. Savigny maintains, the exclusive authority of the lex fori \u201cboth positively and negatively, that is, for and against the application of a law which recognizes an obligation arising out of a delit.\u201d His reason is that all laws relating to delits have such a close connection with public order as to be entitled to the benefit of what I have called the reservation in favour of a stringent domestic policy. Mr. Charles Brocher, on the contrary, maintains the authority of the lex loci delicti commissi in terms which would appear to be exclusive, were it not that he goes on to claim for the judge the right of taking considerations of public order into account; and the result at which he would practically arrive would probably not be very different from that which prevails in England.\nThe judgments below proceed upon a view from which it may be inferred that the Quebec rule and the English rule, as expounded above, are in accord, and this, I think, may be accepted as a reasonable and just conclusion.\nTurning now to the Quebec legislation, it will be found, in the last revision, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 35, articles 53 and 54, which provide as follows:\n53. 1. The owner of a motor vehicle shall be held responsible for any violation of this Act committed with such motor vehicle, or of any regulation made thereunder by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n2. Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver.\n3. If the employer of a person, driving a motor vehicle for hire, pay or gain, is present in the motor vehicle at the time of the commission of any offence against this Act or any regulation made thereunder, such (1) Q.R. 6 Q.B. 28. employer, as well as the operator or chauffeur, shall be liable to conviction for such offence, and it shall be in the discretion of the court to impose the penalty either upon the one or the other, or upon both, according to the circumstances of the case; but if the vehicle is being driven by the chauffeur, and not by the owner, at the time of the offence, then,\u2014whether the owner be present in the vehicle or not at the time,\u2014both the chauffeur and the owner shall be personally liable to conviction for the offence, and it shall be in the discretion of the court to impose the penalty either upon the one or the other or upon both, according to the circumstances of the case.\n54. Nothing contained in this Act shall be interpreted as limiting or diminishing the right of any person to take civil proceedings for damages.\nNow it is in accordance with the natural interpretation, as well as with the weight of judicial opinion in the local courts, that where there is no negligence or improper conduct imputable to the owner, he is not responsible for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of his motor vehicle. This seems to be clearly the intention of the Legislature, having regard to the text and the history of the legislation. The respondent points out that formerly, by section XXI, article 1406, of the Revision of 1909, it was enacted, among the clauses regulating motor vehicles, that\nThe owner of a motor vehicle for which a certificate is issued under this section, shall be held responsible for any violation thereof or of any regulation provided thereunder by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; and shall be responsible for all accidents or damages caused by his motor vehicle upon a highway or public square.\nThe last clause, which I have underlined above, disappeared when the article was replaced by the amending Act, chapter 19, of 1912. And, by the article as formerly enacted, it is clear that the liability which is imposed to compensate for accidents or damages, as distinguished from that incurred for any violation of the statute or regulations, was founded upon the concluding sentence, which was repealed by the Act of 1912, and not upon the earlier provision of the article, which still remains. Of these two clauses comprised in the article, the first did not expressly, or with any degree of certainty, declare liability for damages; the second did. The latter was therefore the effective provision for the purpose which it expressed, and this seems to result from the proper appreciation of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, or expression facit cessare taciturn. And so, the charging clause having been repealed, there remains no provision upon which to base a reasonable pretension that the owner is bound to compensate when he has committed no fault; and, if any possible question could otherwise have been raised about it, that is concluded by the implication of subsection 2 of article 53, which establishes the materiality of negligence or improper conduct by the owner.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nLamont, J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Smith.\nSmith J.\u2014 I agree with my brother Newcombe, for the reasons stated by him, that the respondent Wray was not liable for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs under the law of Quebec. The case of Latreille v. Curley[45], seems to me to be decisive on this point so far as this Court is concerned.\nOn this view it is not really necessary to determine whether or not the respondent would have been liable in an action in Ontario, but in view of the decisions, I am of opinion that, had he been resident in Ontario, he would have been liable under the Ontario statute as it stood at the time the damages were sustained.\nThe respondent was not, however, a resident of Ontario, and, with my brother Newcombe, I doubt if the Ontario legislation is effective to impose personal liability, under the circumstances, on the respondent, in view of the authorities cited in my brother Newcombe\u2019s reasons. This important point is raised in the respondent\u2019s factum, but my brother Newcombe says it was not fully argued before us, and therefore refrains from expressing a final opinion on it. There being no necessity for doing so, in view of the opinion expressed above as to the Quebec law, I also express no final opinion with regard to it, though, if well taken, this point sustains the judgment below.\nI concur in dismissing these appeals with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dorais & Dorais.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brais & Garneau.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 199.\n[2] (1926) 274 U.S. 352.\n[3] (1917) L.R.A. 916.\n[4] (1916) 242 U.S. 160.\n[5] (1926) 134 Atl.

L.R. 43, holding that the alleged will in question should not be admitted to probate, was reversed.\nThere was evidence as to the making of a will by the alleged testator in November, 1923, and of its contents, and of correction of the testator\u2019s name as written therein, either by a new will or by correction and re-execution of the old one, in February, 1924, the contents, except for said correction, being unchanged. The alleged will was deposited in a bank in Vancouver, B.C., for safe keeping. Later the testator came to reside in Ontario. In May, 1925, in response to a letter from the testator, the bank in Vancouver sent the will to him and got his receipt for it. The testator died in May, 1928. Upon a search made after his death no will was found.\nHeld (1) As to execution of the will of 1923, while the evidence failed to shew fully observance of the statutory formalities, it was a reasonable assumption from the evidence that they had been duly observed, having regard to all the circumstances and especially to the fact that the will was prepared by a competent solicitor and executed in his office (Harris v. Knight, 15 P.D. 170, at pp. 179-180; In re Thomas, 1 Sw. & Tr. 255, cited); and its due execution should be held to have been established. As to the will of 1924, the question of its due execution was not very material, as, its contents being proved to be the same as those of the earlier will, it did not matter which document was admitted to probate. If its due execution should be held to be established, the will of 1924 was the one to be admitted to probate; if not, the will of 1923 would remain effective, even though it had been physically destroyed on the assumption that it had been duly replaced by the later will; the doctrine of dependent relative revocation applied. The contents were clearly established.\n(2) The presumption of destruction of the will by the testator animo revocandi, arising from its being traced to his possession and not being forthcoming after his death, must be held, on all the facts and circumstances, to have been rebutted, taking into consideration that the will as made was eminently reasonable in view of the testator\u2019s affectionate feelings towards the beneficiary (his only surviving sister), that there was no change in those feelings (as held established on the evidence), statements by the testator shortly before his death to independent and trustworthy witnesses (Whitely v. King, 17 C.B.N.S. 756), the simple character of the testator, the fact (to be inferred from the evidence) that he regarded his will as of the highest importance, and (there being no evidence of its deposit for safe keeping elsewhere) would likely have kept it near his person, and the fact that after his death certain of his clothing and bedding were burned without any search thereof and before any search for a will was made.\nSugden v.

The appeal was allowed with costs.\nO. Sauv\u00e9 and J. Sauv\u00e9 for the appellants.\nH.H. Davis K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This issue in this case is as to the admissibility to probate of an alleged will made by the late Alexander Zotique (Peter) Pigeon who died, at the town of Alexandria in the county of Glengarry, between the 15th and 29th of May, 1928. The facts as disclosed by the evidence are very fully stated in the judgment of Latchford C.J. in the Appellate Divisional Court[2]. That court, by a majority of three to two, reversed the decision of the late Judge O\u2019Reilly, Surrogate Judge of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry (who admitted the will to probate), holding that the presumption of revocation, arising from the will having been traced to the testator\u2019s possession and not having been found amongst his papers after his death, had not been rebutted by the evidence adduced at the trial on behalf of the executors propounding it for probate.\nThree questions are presented on the present appeal:\nFirst\u2014Was due execution of the alleged will established;\nSecond\u2014Were its contents satisfactorily proved; and\nThird\u2014Does the evidence rebut the presumption of destruction by the testator animo revocandi?\nThe trial judge found that the evidence sufficiently established the due execution of the will; and upon this point the Appellate Division unanimously assumed the correctness of his conclusion, although the majority of the judges of that court did not pass upon it. At bar in this court, however, this was made a principal subject of contest.\nThe evidence established that the deceased, Alexander Zotique Pigeon, owned some property in British Columbia, which was acquired by the British Columbia Electric Company. Being desirous of investing the money derived from the property, he consulted a banker in Vancouver upon whose advice he invested most of it in Dominion bonds. This banker at the same time urged him to have a will made, and suggested that he should consult for that purpose, Messrs. Bourne & DesBrisay, a well-known and reputable firm of solicitors in Vancouver. Acting on this advice he called on Mr. Bourne and had a will drawn by him. He was accompanied at the banker\u2019s and at Mr. Bourne\u2019s by one Zoel Cyr, who appears to have been an intimate friend and who remained with him throughout the proceedings in the solicitor\u2019s office.\nThe will, having been drawn, was read to the testator in Cyr\u2019s presence and he tells us what its. contents were. Then, according to Cyr\u2019s evidence, Mr. DesBrisay, the partner of Mr. Bourne, was called in to act, with Mr. Cyr, as a witness to the will and, as Cyr says, Pigeon signed the will and he and DesBrisay witnessed it. He is not asked where Pigeon placed his signature on the paper, nor whether DesBrisay was present and saw him sign it as well as himself, nor whether he and DesBrisay actually signed the will as witnesses, nor whether, if they signed it, they did so in the presence of the testator. In ordinary parlance, however, a man who says he witnessed the execution of a document means that he attested such execution by his signature; and that, I think, is a fair inference from this evidence. As to the observance of the statutory formalities, to which Cyr\u2019s attention was not specifically called, it is, I think, a reasonable assumption that they were duly observed, having regard to all the circumstances and especially to the fact that the will was carefully prepared by a competent solicitor and was executed in his office. Harris v. Knight[3]; In re Thomas[4]. While neither Mr. Bourne nor Mr. DesBrisay had any recollection of the circumstances, a charge is made in the books of the solicitors for the drawing of a will of Mr. Pigeon on the 22nd of November, 1923. We have no hesitation in finding the due execution of the will of November 22, 1923, to have been established.\nAfter this will was executed it was taken by Pigeon, accompanied by Cyr, to the banker\u2019s office and left with him for safekeeping. The banker corroborates Cyr\u2019s story both as to the sending of Pigeon to Bourne and DesBrisay and as to the return of the will to him for safekeeping.\nIt would appear that Pigeon advised his sister, resident in Williamstown, Glengarry county, Ontario, by letter of December, 1923, of the making of this will and that she then noticed that he had described himself as \u201cPeter Pigeon,\u201d whereas his correct name was Alexander Zotique Pigeon, \u201cPeter\u201d being a nickname which he had acquired in the West. She replied informing him of this error. Having some doubt as to the sufficiency of the will containing, this misnomer, it would seem (although there is no direct evidence to that effect) that Pigeon went back to the banker and withdrew the will temporarily for the purpose of having the correction made. At all events, as Cyr deposes, he attended for that purpose at the office of Mr. Bourne in the month of February; and in the latter\u2019s books there occurs an entry of February 21, 1924, where a charge is made for drawing (or re-drawing) the will of Pigeon. Whether the will was re-drawn on that date, or the existing will was merely corrected and the changes initialled and republication made in due form (Hindmarsh Charlton[5]) does not appear. Once more Mr. Bourne has no recollection of the circumstances except that derived from his books; nor is there any evidence given by Cyr as to what occurred on the occasion of the second visit except that it took place and that the contents of the will as \u201cre-drawn\u201d on that date were precisely the same as those of the earlier will, the name of the testator only being changed from \u201cPeter Pigeon\u201d to \u201cAlexander Zotique Pigeon, better known as Peter Pigeon.\u201d The new will, or re-executed (?) will, was again taken and deposited in the bank for safekeeping. There is no evidence whatever as to who witnessed the new will or as to the formalities prescribed by the statute having been complied with.\nShortly afterwards, Cyr, by direction of the testator, who could not do more than write his name, wrote a letter to Mrs. Lefebvre, the testator\u2019s sister, informing her of the alteration of his name in the will and stating the substance of its contents and that he had re-deposited his will in the bank at Vancouver. Cyr says he wrote this letter exactly as dictated by Pigeon. The letter itself was produced and is in evidence.\nWhile it would be more satisfactory had the circumstances of the making of the will of February 21, 1924, been adequately probed, it would seem to be not very material whether due execution of that will should or should not be regarded as having been established. Either it was or it was not duly executed. If it was, its contents, having been proved to be the same as those of the earlier will, are sufficiently established by proof of the contents of that will and the document to be admitted to probate would in that case be the will of February 21, 1924. If, on the other hand, the due execution and attestation of that document should be held not to have been sufficiently established, the will of November 22, 1923, would remain effective, even though it had been physically destroyed on the assumption that it had been duly replaced by the later will. Under such circumstances the doctrine of dependent relative revocation applies. Jarman on Wills, 6th Ed., pp. 148 et seq.\nIt, therefore, seems to us not vital which document should be regarded as the last will of the testator. Either that of the 22nd of November, 1923, or that of the 21st of February, 1924, was a duly executed will; or perhaps both were so executed; and, the contents being identical except for the change in the testator\u2019s name, it does not seem to be very material which document should be admitted to probate.\nAs to the proof of contents, the evidence is absolutely clear and dependable. Not only are the contents stated by Zoel Cyr, who heard the will read, but they are also set forth in the testator\u2019s letter of the 2nd of March, 1924, to his sister; and this evidence is corroborated by the statements made by him to the witnesses Pelletier and Lalonde shortly before his death. Barkwell v. Barkwell[6]\nThere remains, therefore, only the difficulty presented by the presumption of revocation arising from the will, traced to the possession of the testator, not being forthcoming. Welch v. Phillips[7]. This is said by Cockburn C.J., in Sugden v. Lord St. Leonards[8] to be \u201cpresumptio juris, but not de jure, more or less strong\u201d according to circumstances such as the character of the testator and his relation to the beneficiaries, the contents of the instrument, and the possibility of its loss being accounted for otherwise than by intentional destruction on the part of the testator. The material circumstances on those points are the following:\nThe testator, a simple and uneducated man, left Vancouver and went to Williamstown to reside with his sister in the month of August, 1924. He remained with her until the following March, when he went to the hospital for some treatment, and after a few weeks\u2019 absence, returned to her house. About the end of April or beginning of May, 1925, having acquired a property in Alexandria, a nearby town, he went there to live. In November, 1925, his sister also moved to Alexandria with her family; and the evidence discloses an exchange of visits there, from time to time, between the testator and his sister. There is no suggestion whatever that the testator at any time ceased to entertain for his sister the same affectionate feelings which he appears to have had for her when making his will in Vancouver. On the contrary, the only evidence in the record is that he remained on good terms with her throughout.\nTowards the end of April, 1928, about three or four weeks before his death, he had a conversation with an intimate friend named Lalonde, to whom he said that all his money had been willed to his sister; and, between the first and fifth of May following, probably about a fortnight before his death, he also had a conversation to the like effect with Louis Pelletier, a contractor, who resides in Ottawa and who knew Pigeon well. This contractor, having business in Alexandria, saw Pigeon there about the beginning of May at his (Pigeon\u2019s) house where he had called for a friendly chat and smoke. Pigeon then said to him, \u201cI don\u2019t have to work any more. I have money to live on the interest.\u201d Upon Pelletier asking him, \u201cWhat are you going to do with that money,\u201d he said, \u201cI got my affairs fixed up when I die. I only have one sister living\u201d * * * \u201che told, if he die, if anything happen to him all his papers was made,\u201d and again, \u201call my papers is fixed up so if anything happen to me, I have only one sister, everything goes to her.\u201d (Whitely v. King et al[9]). This was between the first and fifth of May, 1928, and that was the last this witness saw of the testator.\nWhat is mainly relied upon as casting doubt upon the sufficiency of this evidence to rebut the presumption of revocation is a letter written by the testator from Alexandria to the bank manager at Vancouver, from which it is sought to draw the inference that there had been some friction between the testator and his sister, sufficient to afford a reason for his wishing to destroy the will in her favour. This letter bears date the 3rd of May, 1925, and was written immedi- ately upon, or shortly after, his arrival at Alexandria. It is in the following terms:\nALEXANDRIA, ONT.,\nMay 3, 1925.\nBANK OF MONTREAL,\nCarrel Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014Any paper that comes to the name Mr. Lefebvre and Peter Pigeon don\u2019t give any money. Any paper that come to the Bank Except Peter Pigeon alone no other name is no good. Will you send my testament that is in your safe to Mr. Peter Pigeon,\nAlexandria,\nOntario.\nActing upon this letter, the bank manager, on May 11, 1925, sent what had been deposited with the bank as the testator\u2019s will, to Alexandria, enclosed in the following letter:\nMay 11, 1925.\nRegistered.\nPETER PIGEON, Esq.,\nAlexandria, Ont.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to your letter of the 2nd inst., we beg to enclose herewith one sealed envelope said to contain your last will and testament and shall be obliged if you will kindly sign the enclosed receipt and return it at your earliest convenience.\nYours faithfully,\nManager.\nThe receipt is also produced, signed by Peter Pigeon as of the 21st of May.\nThere can be no question upon this evidence that the document deposited with the bank in Vancouver in February, 1924, was forwarded to and was received by Peter Pigeon at Alexandria in May, 1925. It is this fact, coupled with the other fact that the will was not found amongst his papers, that gives rise to the presumption of destruction by the testator animo revocandi.\nReverting for a moment to the letter of the 3rd of May, 1925, the prohibition which it contains to the banker to pay money upon any paper bearing the signature of Mr. Lefebvre as well as Mr. Pigeon, is relied upon as suggestive of unpleasantness having arisen between him and the Lefebvre family. Whether any such inference would be open upon the document if standing alone, or whether the proper view is that taken by the learned trial judge, viz., that the testator, an ignorant and unlearned man, feared that the fact that he had named Lefebvre as one of his executors might give that gentleman some present control of, or voice in, the disposition of moneys left by him with the bank and that he wished to guard against anything of the kind happening, is, perhaps, doubtful. But, however that may be, any inference that could otherwise be drawn adverse to Mrs. Lefebvre, the testator\u2019s sister, is entirely overcome by the direct evidence in the record that there was at no time any interruption whatever of the friendly and affectionate relations subsisting between her and the testator. Moreover, to infer from this letter that the testator had destroyed his will animo revocandi at any time after its receipt by him on the 21st of May, 1925, is so utterly inconsistent with his statements made in April and May of 1928 to the independent witnesses, Lalonde and Pelletier, that it may safely be disregarded.\nWhile the view taken by the learned trial judge of the interpretation proper to be placed upon the testator\u2019s letter of the 3rd of May to the banker may not be entirely correct, having regard to all the evidence it is at least less improbable than that suggested on behalf of the respondents.\nAs already stated, the testator died somewhere between the 15th and the 29th of May. He was last seen alive by his sister on the 15th or 16th of May (she is not sure on which day), when he complained of not feeling well. No witness deposes to having seen him alive subsequently. His body was found in his residence on the 29th of May, 1928, by his nephew, Palma Lefebvre. Putrefaction had set in and the body was considerably decomposed, indicating that death had occurred some time before. He was lying upstairs in his bed.\nNo search for papers was made immediately; but, soon afterwards, by instructions of the undertaker, who had warned them to be very careful and to wear mittens for that purpose, a mattress, a feather bed and blankets, two coats, a pair of overalls, pants and socks, which had been in the testator\u2019s room, were thrown out and burned by his two nephews, Josephat and Alcide Lefebvre. No search had been made of the clothing or effects so burned, but, subsequently and for the first time, a search was made of the house by the nephew Palma Lefebvre, who found a number of documents in different places, but did not find a will.\nThat the testator regarded his will as of the highest importance and, there being no evidence of its deposit for safekeeping in the bank, or with a solicitor, or trust company, that he would quite likely have kept it near his person, not improbably in the pocket of his coat, or in his bed, is a fair inference from the testimony of the witness Zoel Cyr, who deposes to the great care he took of it in carrying it from the office of the solicitor to that of the banker and adds, very significantly, that he (Pigeon) thought the will a very important document and that it was not likely that he would be careless with it when it came into his possession; that \u201che wanted the will to be in a safe place.\u201d It is obvious that the will may have been inadvertently burned when the testator\u2019s personal effects were destroyed after his death. Having regard to this circumstance, and also to the facts that the will, as made, was eminently reasonable in view of the testator\u2019s affectionate feelings towards his only surviving sister, that there was no change in those feelings, as the evidence establishes, that the testator\u2019s intention to benefit his sister subsisted until within a few weeks of his death, as he declared to two independent and trustworthy witnesses, and lastly, to the simple character of the man himself, it seems highly improbable that he intentionally destroyed his will animo revocandi.\nThe situation in Allan v. Morrison[10], was entirely different, the facts there affording reason to believe that the testator was dissatisfied with his will and meant to change it, and there being no circumstance, such as the burning of the personal effects of the testator in the present case, to account for a probable inadvertent destruction of the will. The affirmance of that decision in the Privy Council proceeded largely on the fact that the two courts below had concurred in their view of what was regarded as a question of fact[11]. Eckersley v. Platt[12] is likewise clearly distinguishable on the facts and on the nature of the testimony there relied on to rebut the presumption of revocation. The case of Stewart v. Walker[13], where probate was granted, is much more closely in point. On the whole case we are convinced that the presumption of destruction by the testator animo revocandi is sufficiently rebutted and that the trial judge reached the correct conclusion when he directed that probate should be granted in accordance with the prayer of the petition of the executors. The observations of Sir James Hannon in the Sugden case[14] are much in point.\nFor these reasons, which do not materially differ from those of Latchford C.J., and Ode J.A., in the Divisional Court, we would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the late learned judge of the Surrogate Court of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Osias Sauv\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macdonell & Costello.\n[1] (1929) 64 Ont.

N. Tilley K.C. and J. F. Boland K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. Wilkie K.C. and J. Edward Hill for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The question on this appeal can be very briefly stated. The claim is made under subs. 4 of s. 19BBB of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and the amendments thereto. And the whole point for discussion is whether or not a certain booklet printed by the defendants for the Canadian Kodak Co. Ltd., having attached to it the name \u201cKodakery\u201d, falls within one of the exceptions to that subsection which is expressed in these words: \u201cNewspapers and quarterly, monthly and semi-monthly magazines and weekly literary papers unbound.\u201d\nOne preliminary observation. No doubt, for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of any given word in a statute, the usage of that word in other statutes may be looked at, especially if the other statutes happen to be in pari materia, but it is altogether a fallacy to suppose that because two statutes are in pari materia, a definition clause in one can be bodily transferred to the other.\nThe word \u201cmagazine\u201d in the exception under consideration is used in its ordinary sense, and must be construed and applied in that sense. No doubt a publication, containing nothing but puffings and praising of the goods of the publishers, and invitations to purchase those goods, would not in accordance with ordinary usage come under the denomination \u201cmagazine.\u201d On the other hand, the fact that a magazine was published by a firm of publishers with the deliberate intention of encouraging an interest in literature and incidentally in books published by themselves, would not be a ground for saying that it was not a magazine according to ordinary parlance. Nor could I conceive, if a firm engaged in publishing and selling, as its sole business, books dealing with various subjects of applied science, were to publish a periodical devoted exclusively to such subjects, and very largely to the reviews of books upon them, that it could successfully be argued that such a periodical would not fall within the category of \u201cmagazine\u201d according to the ordinary notions of men. The same may be said with regard to what are called \u201ctrade journals\u201d which are media for information in relation to their respective trades.\n\u201cKodakery\u201d is stated in the evidence to be a journal, having for its subject matter technical information as regards photography; \u201chow to make better pictures.\u201d One copy only is put in. The learned trial judge seemed to object to more than one copy being produced, which I think is rather unfortunate. However, I have looked through the copy produced and I have found it to be very far from a mere advertising production. I should hesitate to set limits to the skill or the subtlety of the commercial advertiser, and it may be that in this case he has succeeded in deluding me. But I think we must look at, for the purpose of this statute, which is a taxing statute, the thing we have to deal with as a thing in fact. If we attempt for the purpose of applying this Act to penetrate the designs of the writers, we shall set before ourselves a task, in which we are much more likely to be misled than if we are content not to be too perspicacious and to look at the real thing as it reveals itself. I think this booklet is just what Mr. Best describes it to be in his evidence; and I do not think a magazine ceases to be a magazine because the publisher, or somebody who pays the publisher, or some number of persons paying the publisher, is or are using it for the purpose of advertisement.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonell & Boland.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wilkie, Delamere & Hill.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

The contract provided for payment on a \u201ccost plus\u201d basis and also for rental, fixed at a percentage per annum on value of the plant (the units whereof, with value of each, were set out), to be paid to respondent \u201con plant used in the work * * * to be payable only when each individual piece of plant commences operation and to cease when determined by the Engineer.\u201d It was agreed that \u201cno rental on any unit of plant shall exceed [said percentage] and rental charged for plant used for a lesser time than the full rental season in any year shall be calculated in the proportion that the days the plant be retained or used bear to the full rental season of 150 days.\u201d At the commencement of a season\u2019s work the Crown\u2019s engineer would instruct respondent to put on the work the plant that he considered necessary, and that plant, with few exceptions, remained on the work and was employed constantly or intermittently throughout the season. The dispute was as to whether units which became unnecessary for substantial periods during the season should be struck off the rental sheet while idle.\nHeld: Having regard to the nature of the work and the nature of the plant required, the proper construction of the contract was that respondent was entitled to rental for all the plant while it remained on the work, notwithstanding idleness of some units as aforesaid, until the engineer determined that some unit or units were no longer required on the work and released them. (Judgment of Maclean J., [1929] Ex. C.R. 136, on this point affirmed.)\nHeld, also, that respondent was not entitled to interest on delayed payments (claimed on the ground that by reason of delay in payment respondent had to borrow at interest, and such interest should be included as part of the cost of the work); it was merely a case of moneys due respondent being withheld beyond due dates, in which case the Crown is not liable for interest except under special circumstances such as existence of statutory provision or contractual obligation. (Judgment of Maclean J., supra, in so far as he allowed interest, reversed.)\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], upon a reference to that Court under s. 37 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe claimant (the present respondent) entered into a contract with His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Public Works of Canada, for the construction and completion of certain public works in the harbour at Toronto. The claimant was to furnish the labour, material, tools, machinery, equipment, facilities and supplies necessary for the completion of the work, and was to be paid the net cost plus 7\u00bd% thereof, and, in addition, a rental for machinery or plant described in the contract, at certain stipulated rates. The present appeal was taken against the allowance to the claimant, by the judgment of the Exchequer Court, of a sum of $47,298.21 for rental of plant in excess of what the Crown claimed to be the proper amount, and of a sum of $10,937.71 for interest on payments delayed, the claim to this interest being based upon the ground that the claimant, by reason of the delays in payment, had to borrow money at interest, and that such interest should be included as part of the cost of the work.\nThe appeal was dismissed as to the rental item of $47,298.21, but allowed as to the interest item of $10,937.71.\nM. H. Ludwig K.C. for the appellant.\nA. C. McMaster K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The respondents entered into a contract with the Department of Public Works on the 10th of March, 1919, to do certain work in connection with Toronto Harbour improvements, and to furnish the labour, materials, machinery, equipment facilities and supplies necessary for the completion of the work, for which they were to be paid the net cost plus 7\u00bd%, in addition to a rental for machinery or plant described in the contract, at the rates therein stipulated.\nThe respondents proceeded with the work in 1919 under the directions of the Department Engineer, pursuant to the contract, but at the beginning of the following season the Department commenced negotiations to secure better terms of contract with the respondents, and in the meantime suspended operations. These negotiations resulted in a new contract, dated 12th August, 1920, under which the work proceeded, and which provided that respondents were to be paid as therein provided, both for the work already done and for the work to be done, so that the terms of the original contract are not material to the matters in question here.\nThe main dispute is as to an item of $47,298.21 allowed the respondents by the learned trial judge for rental of plant in excess of what the appellant claims to be the proper amount. The agreement of 12th August, 1920, has the following provisions in reference to rental of plant:\n(c) Rental, to be paid to the Contractor on plant used in the work as hereinafter provided; said rental to be payable only when each individual piece of plant commences operation and to cease when determined by the Engineer on the following basis, namely:\u2014\nTwenty per cent. per annum on the value of the plant as set forth in the schedule attached hereto and forming part of this contract in respect of all work performed in the year 1919, and 15 per cent. per annum on said evaluation after necessary additions, deductions or other amendments in respect of all work performed thereafter under this contract.\n* * * * *\nThe payment for rental of plant shall be calculated on the basis of 150 days of elapsed time in each calendar year.\nNo rental on any unit of plant shall exceed 20% of the value for 1919, or 15% for the years or portions of years following, and rental charged for plant used for a lesser time than the full rental season in any year shall be calculated in the proportion that the days the plant be retained or used bear to the full rental season of 150 days.\nF. Hands, the Department engineer in charge of the work, says that his practice was at the commencement of the season\u2019s work to instruct the contractors to put on the work the plant that he considered necessary for the operations, and that plant remained on the work, with few exceptions, continuously throughout the working season. This plant, he says, would all be employed constantly or intermittently throughout the season, and when a unit was put to work and then ceased to work for a month or so and then was put to work again, he did not strike it off the rental sheet, but when a unit became unnecessary for a substantial period during the season, he struck it off the rental sheet while idle. The amount of rental that the Department claims to be the correct amount is arrived at on this basis.\nThe respondents claim that they are entitled to rental for the full season for all the plant while it remained on the work until the engineer determined that some unit or units were no longer required on the work, and released them, so that respondents would be entitled to take them away and employ them elsewhere, and that until the engineer so determined, the plant was \u201cretained\u201d by the Department within the meaning of the terms of the contract quoted above.\nHaving regard to the nature of the work to be done and its requirements as to plant described in the contract, the respondents\u2019 interpretation of the meaning of the language used in the clauses quoted above seems to be correct.\nUnits of the plant described, such as dredges with their attendant tugs and scows, derrick scows with air compressor and electric plant, diving scow with air compressor equipment and electric light plant, concrete mixer with boiler, sand and gravel bins, travelling derricks, pile drivers, etc., could not with any degree of practicability be moved about for short periods from this particular work to some other similar work and then brought back again when required. The words of the contract, \u201ccease when determined by the Engineer on the following basis, namely,\u201d and \u201cthe plant be retained or used,\u201d employed in connection with such an undertaking and the plant to be used in carrying it out are significant of what was intended. The plant that remained on the work throughout was kept there because it was required for the undertaking, and was therefore \u201cretained,\u201d and the engineer accordingly did not \u201cdetermine\u201d that it should be released so that rental should cease. A time did arrive when certain small units, such as motor boats, were not further required, and the engineer as to these did \u201cdetermine\u201d that rental as to them should cease, and released them, so that they were no longer \u201cretained or used,\u201d and rental for them ceased.\nNothing seems to turn on the fact that the part of the plant closed in by the coffer-dam was idle during the first part of the season of 1920. This plant was placed there in 1919, and worked there in that season under the contract. The Department chose to suspend work while negotiating for better terms, but did not \u201cabandon the work and cancel the contract,\u201d as provided by one of its terms. The respondents were not at liberty to remove their plant, because they were under contract to supply this plant, and they might have been required at any moment to proceed with the work.\nAs to the determination of the contract, dated 10th March, 1919, authorized by the Order in Council of 17th February, 1919, there need be no misunderstanding. The Government, by the provisions of the 12th clause, reserved the right, if deemed advisable or necessary, to \u201cabandon the work and terminate the contract.\u201d There is an Order in Council of 18th March, 1920, which provides,\nThat the contract with Messrs. Roger Miller and Sons, Limited, for the execution of works in the Harbour of Toronto, as authorized by Order in Council of February 17, 1919, be cancelled.\nAnd, in the appellant\u2019s factum, it is stated that, \u201cBy Order in Council dated 18 March, 1920, the said contract with the respondents was cancelled\u201d (meaning thereby the contract of 10th March 1919). This Order in Council, however, so far from providing for the abandonment of the work, expressly provides for its continuance, under a new contract to be made with the respondents, which was accordingly entered into on the 12th day of August, 1920.\nIn the new contract it is recited:\nIt has been found expedient and has been mutually agreed by and between the respective parties hereto that the said contract shall be cancelled and superseded by a new contract in relation to the said works.\nand this recital is followed by a mutual release and discharge of the contract; but it is, however, provided, at the foot of the 8th clause, that\nThe release clause of this contract shall not operate to release the party hereto of the second part from payment of any sum or sums of money due under the contract for partial performance of the same computed under the terms and conditions of the released contract and modified by this agreement.\nBy the statement of defence,\nThe respondent says that by the said contract, dated the twelfth day of August, 1920, the said contract, dated the tenth day of March, 1919, was cancelled.\nAt the opening of the case, however, we were informed by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the contract had not been cancelled. It seems clear that the Order in Council of 18th March, 1920, could not effectively cancel the existing contract, as clause 12 authorizes such cancellation only on the abandonment of the work, whereas the Order in Council expressly provides for continuance of the work by the respondents. Moreover, there is no evidence that the respondents had any notice of this Order in Council prior to the execution of the new contract. The appellant cannot therefore base any claim for reduction of rental on the alleged cancellation of the contract.\nThe contention of the appellant as to the basis on which rental of the plant is to be calculated is not therefore well founded, because there was no \u201cdetermination\u201d by the engineer that rental claimed should cease, and because the plant for which the rental is claimed was \u201cretained.\u201d It is conceded that in the event of the contract being construed as indicated above, the item of $47,298.21 was correctly allowed. The appeal as to this is therefore dismissed.\nThe only other amount in question here is the item of $10,937.71 allowed by the learned trial judge to the respondents for interest on moneys not paid to the respondents at the times stipulated in the contract. The total sum claimed by the respondents for interest was $28,700.16, of which $17,762.45 was allowed and paid by the appellant, voluntarily as appellant claims.\nIt was argued that the interest claimed should be treated as part of the cost of the work, and therefore is payable under the terms of the contract, but this argument seems quite unsound. It is a mere case of moneys becoming due to respondents at certain times and being withheld beyond the due dates, in which case the Crown is not liable to pay interest during default except under special circumstances such as the existence of statutory provision or contractual obligation.\nThe appeal therefore as to this item is allowed.\nThe appellant, having been obliged to appeal in order to get relief from the judgment for the latter item, would ordinarily be entitled to the costs of the appeal. Of the two items involved in the appeal, the one for $47,298.21 was much the larger and as to this, the appellant fails. A considerable portion of the costs is attributable to that item, and there will therefore be no costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ludwig, Shuyler & Fisher.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Company.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

Co., a Connecticut company, hat manufacturers, along with one Dobbs who took a qualifying share, formed the respondent company, of New York, with Dobbs as president. Respondent sold hats in stores in New York city, adopting a trademark of which the prominent feature was the word \u201cDobbs.\u201d It also contained the words \u201cFifth Avenue, New York,\u201d and other features. The hats were manufactured by C. & K. Co., which also placed the trade-mark on all hats which it manufactured and sold to its various representatives or agencies. From 1913, C. & K. Co. sold hats, manufactured by it and bearing the \u201cDobbs\u201d trademark, to representatives in Canada. In 1923 respondent procured registration of its trade-mark in the United States. By an agreement in 1924, respondent, in consideration of royalties to be paid to it, granted to C. & K. Co. the exclusive licence to sell hats bearing as a trade-mark the word \u201cDobbs,\u201d either alone or with other words, to customers outside of New York city. In 1922 or early in 1923, appellant, a hat manufacturer in Toronto, Canada, adopted a trade-mark having as a prominent feature the words \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d (a name not borne by any member of the company) and in 1923 procured registration of its trade-mark in Canada; and it did a considerable business in Canada under it. In 1925 respondent applied to have the word \u201cDobbs\u201d registered in Canada as a specific trade-mark. This was refused because of appellant\u2019s registered mark. On petition by respondent in the Exchequer Court, Audette J. ([1929] Ex. C.R. 164) ordered that appellant\u2019s mark be expunged, and that respondent be at liberty to renew or proceed with its application for registration. On appeal:\nHeld (1) Respondent was a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d within s. 45 of the Trade-Mark and Design Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 201, by registration of appellant\u2019s mark, and entitled to sue for its expunging (\u201cperson aggrieved\u201d discussed; reference to 27 Halsbury, p. 714; In re \u201cVulcan\u201d Trade Mark, 51 Can. S.C.R. 411, at p. 413, and other cases). (2) Appellant\u2019s mark was improperly placed on the register and should be expunged; its resemblance to respondent\u2019s mark, under which hats had been sold in Canada for years before appellant\u2019s mark was adopted, was such as to confuse and deceive the public.\n(3) Respondent should not be allowed to proceed with its application for registration. The hats sold in Canada bearing its mark were manufactured, owned and sold by C. & K. Co. It never was intended that C. & K. Co. should sell anywhere products of respondent; on the contrary, the principal object of the founders of respondent company in its formation was the acquisition of a business on Fifth Ave., New York, under the mark of which they could represent to the public, in cities and towns outside of New York, that the hats manufactured by C. & K. Co. were the product of Fifth Ave., New York; in that scheme of misrepresentation respondent acquiesced. To sell an article stamped with a false label is pro tanto an imposition on the public, and acquiescence by the owner of the stamp leaves representor and owner in pari delicto (see Leather Cloth Co. v. American Leather Cloth Co., 4 DeG. J. & S., 137; 11 H.L.C., 523). On this ground alone registration should be refused (Bowden Wire Ltd. v. Bowden Brake Co. Ltd., 30 R.P.C., 580, at p. 590). There were other grounds for refusal: Respondent could not truthfully make the declaration, required by s. 13 of the Act, that the mark was not in use to its knowledge by any other person than itself at the time of its adoption (Le., adoption in Canada) thereof; there was no adoption of it as a trade-mark in Canada by respondent; it did no business in hats in Canada and it knew that, from 1913 to 1924, the mark was being used in Canada in connection with the sale of hats by C. & K. Co. An applicant for registration of a trade-mark in Canada must shew that he is the proprietor thereof. Respondent had not acquired in Canada any property in the mark. There can be no property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed; the right to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good-will against the sale of another\u2019s products as his (Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalfe, 240 ILS. Rep. 403, at p. 412; Bayer Co. v. American Druggists Syndicate, [1924] Can. S.C.R. 558, at p. 569). The right to registration in Canada of a trade-mark belongs to him who first uses it there to designate as his the goods to which it is attached; and respondent did not come within this condition.\nJudgment of Audette J. (supra) varied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], ordering that the appellant\u2019s trade-mark registered in the Register of Trade-Marks of the Dominion of Canada be expunged, and that the respondent be at liberty to renew or proceed with its application for registration of its own trade-mark. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed as to the expunging from the register of the appellant\u2019s trademark. The appeal was allowed as to the leave given to the respondent to continue its application for the registration of its trade-mark. Success being about evenly divided, no costs were given on the appeal.\nA. W. Anglin K.C. and C. A. Thompson for the appellant.\nHarold G. Fox for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The short history of this case appears to be as follows: Prior to 1908 the Crofut & Knapp Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, and having its head office and factory in that state, was manufacturing, in a large way, hats and caps for both men and women. These it sold at wholesale throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The policy of the company was to sell to one agent or representative only, in each city or town. In 1908 the company, being desirous of putting on the market in cities and towns other than New York, an agency hat bearing a Fifth Avenue, New York, label, and being desirous also of selling its goods by retail in the city of New York, obtained the services of a Mr. Dobbs, the manager of an exclusive hat store on Fifth Avenue, and, with him as president, organized, under the laws of the State of New York, a new company called Dobbs & Co. All the stock of the new corporation was owned by the members of the Crofut & Knapp Company, except the qualifying share of Mr. Dobbs. Dobbs & Co. opened a retail store on Fifth Avenue, selling hats and caps for men. In connection with these articles that company adopted as a trade-mark the word \u201cDobbs\u201d in large type, and the words \u201cFifth Avenue, New York\u201d in smaller type, but, apart from the trade-mark, no claim was made to the words \u201cFifth Avenue New York.\u201d There were also the words \u201cThe Knapp-Felt Shops\u201d in small type, together with a coat of arms. Of this mark the really prominent feature\u2014the thing which would catch the eye\u2014was the word \u201cDobbs.\u201d This mark was affixed to the silk lining which covered the crown of the hat on the inside and, in addition, the word \u201cDobbs\u201d was stamped on the leather sweat band. Not only was this trade-mark placed on all hats and caps sold by Dobbs & Co., but it was placed by the Crofut & Knapp Company on all hats and caps manufactured by them and sold to their various representatives or agencies, including Dobbs & Co. Both companies have continued to use the mark since 1908. Dobbs & Co. has never manufactured any hats or caps, nor has it ever sold any, except by retail in the city of New York and, for a short period, at Palm Beach, Florida, and at Southampton, Long Island. All the \u201cDobbs\u201d hats and caps sold by it were manufactured by the Crofut & Knapp Company. Dobbs & Co. has not now, and never had, any place of business in Canada, nor has it sold any hats or caps in this country. This was made clear in the cross-examination of Mr. Wilmot, vice-president and secretary of both companies. Mr. Wilmot at first testified that the hats sold in Canada bearing the \u201cDobbs\u201d trade-mark were the hats of Dobbs & Co., but subsequently explained his statement by saying that the two companies were owned by the same people. As to the actual ownership of the hats, he testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. And I say Dobbs & Company have never sold a hat in Canada?\nA. Dobbs & Company\u2019s selling agents have, yes.\nHis Lordship: Make it clear, ask him, did Dobbs & Company sell themselves, direct, a hat in Canada?\nThe Witness: No.\nHis Lordship: Then you contend that they have sold in Canada, you mean they have sold through agents or licensees. Is that what you mean?\nA. Yes, my lord.\nMr. Thompson: Whose goods have Dobbs & Company sold in Canada through agents, who manufactured the goods?\nA. Made by Crofut & Knapp Company.\nQ. The goods were manufactured by Crofut & Knapp?\nA. Right.\nQ. Were sold by Crofut & Knapp?\nA. Sold through Crofut & Knapp, I would not say they were sold by Crofut & Knapp.\nHis Lordship: Has the petitioner a factory besides the factory of Crofut & Knapp?\nA. No.\nMr. Thompson: As a matter of fact Dobbs & Co. do not manufacture men\u2019s hats at all do they?\nA. No. Q. They sell in the retail stores in New York hats manufactured by Crofut & Knapp?\nA. True.\nQ. And Crofut & Knapp sell in Canada hats manufactured by themselves under the Dobbs name?\nA. Under a licence agreement.\nQ. So that Dobbs & Co., neither manufacture nor sell any hats that are sold in Canada or the United States, except the ones in the retail stores?\nA. True.\n* * * * *\nQ. And since Dobbs & Company has been incorporated the only actual business that Dobbs & Company has done has been a retail business in two or three retail stores in the United States?\nA. Five.\nQ. But that is all the business that Dobbs & Co. has actually done?\nA. As the Dobbs Corporation, yes.\nQ. Of course Dobbs & Co. has never done any wholesale business?\nA. Not Dobbs & Co., actually itself.\nHis Lordship: Dobbs & Co. were selling locally as retailers?\nA. Retailers.\nFrom 1913 to the present time the Crofut & Knapp Company has, every year, sold hats and caps, of its own manufacture but bearing the \u201cDobbs\u201d trade-mark, to Max Beauvais, Limited, Montreal, Canada. These annual sales have increased from 25 dozen in 1913 to 60 dozen in 1928. Sales were also made to other representatives in Canada: some were made to Richardson & Potts, Vancouver, but, apparently, not since 1921; one or two small orders were sold, some ten years ago, to Holt, Renfrew & Co., also one order to a firm in Edmonton, and a few shipments were made to Eaton & Co., Winnipeg. Within the last two or three years sales have been made to Eaton & Co., Toronto. All these hats shipped to Canada bore the mark of Dobbs & Co., and were manufactured by the Crofut & Knapp Company at their factory in Connecticut, and sold by their own salesmen. In February, 1923, Dobbs & Co. applied to have their trade-mark registered in the United States to be used in connection with sales of hats and caps and other wearing apparel for men, women and children, and it was registered there on October 23, 1923. On or about November 1, 1924, the Crofut & Knapp Company and Dobbs & Co. entered into an agreement in writing whereby, in consideration of certain royalties to be paid to it, Dobbs & Co. granted to the Crofut & Knapp Company the exclusive licence and right to sell hats, caps and wearing apparel for men, women and children, bearing as a trade-mark the word \u201cDobbs\u201d, used either alone or with other words, to customers for resale at retail at their places of business for the sale of such merchandise, outside of the city of New York.\nIn the latter part of 1922 or early in 1923, Robert Crean & Company, Limited, who had for many years been manufacturing hats and caps in Toronto, in the province of Ontario, adopted as its trade-mark the words \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d with a triangle above containing the words \u201cDeerskin Finish\u201d and one below containing the words \u201cCharacter Hats\u201d In April, 1923, Crean & Company applied to have their trade-mark registered in Canada, to be used in connection with the sale of men\u2019s felt and straw hats, and the same was registered on May 1, 1923. After its registration the company did a considerable business in Canada under its trade-mark.\nIn June, 1925, Dobbs & Co. applied to have the word \u201cDobbs\u201d registered in Canada as a specific trade-mark in connection with the sale of hats and caps. The application was refused by reason of the existence on the register of the prior registration of the words \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d in favour of Robert Crean & Company. Dobbs & Co. then filed a petition in the Exchequer Court praying for an order: (1) directing that the registered trade-mark \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d be expunged from the register, and (2) directing that the petitioner\u2019s trade-mark consisting of the word\n\u201cDobbs\u201d might be registered as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of hat and caps. The petition was objected to by Robert Crean & Company. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court, before whom the petition came for adjudication, held, that \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d and \u201cDobbs\u201d were words which, as applied to articles of the same kind, might readily be confused and which would tend to deceive the ordinary purchaser; and that hats bearing the word \u201cDobbs\u201d had been on sale in Canada prior to the registration of the trade-mark \u201cDan Dobbs.\u201d He also held that in the light of the evidence it was impossible to credit the statements of the objecting party\u2019s manager who had invented the trade-mark \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d that he was unaware of the existence on the Canadian market of hats bearing the mark \u201cDobbs\u201d, and that he was not influenced, in adopting his trade-mark, by a desire to benefit by the reputation which the petitioner\u2019s hats had acquired in the trade. He therefore ordered that the entry of the objecting party\u2019s specific trade-mark in the Canada Trade-Mark Register (No. 147, fol. 33279) be expunged therefrom. He further declared that the petitioner be at liberty to renew or proceed with the application for the registration of his own trade-mark. From that order Crean & Co. now appeal to this court.\nSection 45 of the Act respecting Trade-Marks and Industrial Designs (R.S.C., 1927, c. 201) reads as follows:\u2014\n45. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney-General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade-marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the Court, thinks fit; or the Court may refuse the application.\nThe first question therefore is, can it properly be said that the respondent is \u201ca person aggrieved\u201d by the registration of the appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d?\nThe construction placed upon the words \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d by the decisions under the English Act, and by those under our Act, is the same. Under the English decisions the words are construed to mean, as set out in 27 Halsbury, 714:\u2014\nAny person who is in any way hampered in his trade by the presence of the marks or who can shew any real interest in having them removed.\nIn Re Riviere\u2019s Trade-Mark[2]; In Re Apolonaris Company\u2019s Trade-Marks[3]; Powell v. Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Company[4].\nIn In re \u201cVulcan\u201d Trade-Mark[5], Davies J. construed \u201cany person aggrieved,\u201d under our Act, to include,\nany one who may possibly be injured by the continuance of the mark on the register in the form and to the extent it is so registered.\nSee also Crothers Co. v. Williamson Candy Co.[6].\nAs long as the appellant\u2019s registered mark remains on the register the appellant would have the right to prevent the respondent or its licensee from registering the \u201cDobbs\u201d trade-mark in Canada or from continuing to carry on in Canada the sale of hats and caps under the \u201cDobbs\u201d mark. If the right were exercised, it would injure the respondent in respect of the royalties to be paid on sales made in this country. The respondent, therefore, in my opinion, is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the statute.\nThen is the appellant\u2019s mark calculated to deceive the unwary or to cause those not skilled in the hat business to think they are purchasing a \u201cDobbs\u201d hat when they buy one having the appellant\u2019s mark thereon? The general principle adopted by the court is to consider the impression produced by the mark as a whole. A new mark is calculated to deceive if it suggests the article known by the old mark, or if, in its essential particulars, it resembles those of the old. Although the two marks in question are different in certain respects the prominent feature of each is the name. The respondent\u2019s hat was known as the \u201cDobbs\u201d hat, and the evidence shews that customers would ask for it by that name. The word \u201cDobbs\u201d along with the words \u201cFifth Avenue, New York\u201d indicates primarily the origin or ownership of the hat to which the mark is applied. A customer desiring to purchase a \u201cDobbs\u201d hat, and not having the respondent\u2019s mark before him, might very easily, it seems to me, be confused. No one has a right to use a mark by which another\u2019s goods are known for the purpose of passing off his goods as the goods of the other and, even when he is innocent of that purpose, he must not use it in any way calculated to deceive, or aid in deceiving, the public. The evidence, in my opinion, fully supports the finding of the trial judge that purchasers of hats would likely be misled and deceived by the general resemblance of the two marks in question. The name \u201cDobbs\u201d the trial judge found was adopted in good faith by the respondent company because it was the surname of its president. The appellant admits that no member of its organization bears the name Dobbs. The name \u201cDan Dobbs\u201d as a mark for hats and caps was evolved by the appellant\u2019s manager in Montreal during a conversation between him and one Harry Samuels, one of the appellant\u2019s Montreal customers who had just organized a company to sell hats and caps at wholesale. On cross-examination, the appellant\u2019s manager was asked:\u2014\nQ. What led you to adopt the word \u201cDobbs\u201d?\nA. I cannot tell you, it came from the blue sky. In Burgess v. Burgess[7], Lord Justice Turner said:\u2014\nWhere a person is selling goods under a particular name, and another person, not having that name, is using it, it may be presumed that he so uses it to represent the goods sold by himself as the goods of the person whose name he uses.\nIn view of all the facts and circumstances of this case: the reputation which the \u201cDobbs\u201d hat had acquired in the United States as a high class hat of superior quality; the sale of these hats in Montreal and the considerable advertising of them there for ten years by Max Beauvais, Limited; the extensive advertising of them in the United States in publications which found their way across the border, and the inability of the appellant to give any reasonable explanation of how it came to adopt the mark, the fair inference to be drawn, in my opinion, is that the appellant\u2019s mark was designed with the object of approaching as closely to the respondent\u2019s mark as the designer thought he could with safety, in order to obtain a trade benefit from the reputation of the respondent\u2019s hats. The appellant\u2019s mark being only a colourable variation of the mark under which hats had been sold in Canada for years, I agree with the learned trial judge that such mark was improperly placed upon the register and should be expunged therefrom.\nThe learned trial judge not only expunged the appellant\u2019s trade-mark from the register but also directed that the respondent be at liberty to proceed with its application for the registration of its own trade-mark. It is with this part of the judgment of the learned judge that I find myself not in accord. His conclusion was based upon the following findings:\u2014\nIt has been abundantly established, by conclusive evidence, that the* petitioner, as far back as 1913, to the present day, sold and is selling in Montreal, Canada, his hats with his trade-mark thereon and he further sold them in Vancouver, B.C., in 1917 and during some time subsequent thereto.\n* * * * *\nThese goods have been sold in Canada under the Licence (filed as exhibit No. 13) and were so sold under that name as per such licence. Qui facit per alium facit per se.\nFrom these quotations I take it that the learned judge was of opinion that the hats sold in Canada from the year 1913 to the present day were the hats of Dobbs & Co., sold by it through its licensee the Crofut & Knapp Company. I do not so read the evidence. It is true that all hats sold in Canada by the Crofut & Knapp Company bore the respondent\u2019s mark, but that did not make them the respondent\u2019s hats. They were the property\u2019 of the Crofut & Knapp Company and were sold as such. The fact that the respondent was a subsidiary company organized and owned by the Crofut & Knapp Company does not make the two companies identical. In law each company is a separate and distinct entity, and the rights of each are separate and distinct. It was stated by Mr. Wilmot that the Crofut & Knapp Company sold hats in Canada bearing the respondent\u2019s mark, under licence from the respondent. That is true since November, 1924, only. There is no evidence of any licence having been granted before that date. As the Crofut & Knapp people owned practically all the stock of the respondent company, it could, without doubt, have obtained a licence at any time, but there is no evidence that it did so. Neither is there any evidence that from 1908 until 1924 there was any actual agreement between the two companies that the Crofut & Knapp Company could use the respondent\u2019s trade-mark. Such an agreement was doubtless considered unnecessary since both companies were owned by the same group of shareholders. The evidence, however, establishes clearly that when hats were sold in Canada bearing the \u201cDobbs\u201d mark, they were hats manufactured and sold by the Crofut & Knapp Company and not by the respondent. They were not the respondent\u2019s hats sold by the respondent\u2019s agents or licensees. It never was the intention of anyone, from 1908 to the present time, that the Crofut & Knapp Company should put on the market, either in Canada or elsewhere, the products of the respondent. On the contrary, the principal object which the founders of the respondent company had in view in its formation, according to the evidence of Mr. Wilmot, was the acquisition of a business on Fifth Avenue, under the mark of which they could represent to the public, in cities and towns outside of New York, that their own Connecticut manufactured hats were the product of Fifth Avenue, New York. In that scheme of misrepresentation the respondent, with full knowledge thereof, acquiesced. To sell an article stamped with a false statement is pro tanto an imposition on the public, and an acquiescence therein by the owner of the stamp, in my opinion leaves representor and owner in pari delicto. See The Leather Cloth Co. v. The American Leather Cloth Co.[8]. On this ground alone the registration of the respondent\u2019s mark should be refused, for, as Vaughan-Williams L.J., said in Bowden Wire, Limited v. Bowden Brake Co., Limited[9]:\nThe whole object (of the Trade-Mark Act) is that by registering a trade-mark you should be able to represent to the public: \u201cYou may rely upon it that all goods which bear this registered trade-mark are the goods manufactured or sold by me, the registered proprietor of the mark.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe moment that you show that there is a plain case of an arrangement in respect of a trade-mark which is calculated to mislead in the sense that it will cause goods which had not been manufactured by the proprietor of the registered trade-mark to look as if they were so manufactured, that will cause people or customers to be deceived.\nThere is, however, another consideration which, in my opinion, must be equally fatal to the respondent\u2019s application.\nTo be entitled to register a trade-mark the applicant must be the proprietor thereof (s. 9), and he must make a declaration that the mark was not in use to his knowledge by any other person than himself at the time of his adoption thereof (s. 13). If the Minister is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of the mark, he may refuse to register it (s. 11a). Once it is registered, however, the proprietor has, under the Act, the exclusive right to use the trade-mark to designate articles manufactured or sold by him (s. 13 (2)).\nThe right to registration in Canada of a trade-mark belongs to him who first uses it there to designate as his the goods to which it is attached. Before an applicant can have a mark registered he must establish that he is the proprietor thereof\u2014that he has a property in the mark. There is, however, no such thing as property in a trademark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The right to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good-will against the sale of another\u2019s products as his. Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalfe10. In The Bayer Co. v. American Druggists Syndicate11, my brother Duff said:\u2014\nIt is sufficiently clear that a trade-mark, in order to be registrable under the Act, must be something which the applicant is entitled to adopt as distinguishing the articles to which it is applied as his own;\n* * * * *\nAdoption by the applicant for the purpose of distinguishing his goods is the ruling condition. There must, moreover, be adoption for use as a distinguishing mark implying a present bona fide intention to use the mark for such purposes; and indeed the affidavit in the form prescribed by the rules could hardly be made by an applicant who has not, in however limited a degree, actually made use of the mark in respect of which the application is made.\nThe business in Ganada since 1913 in connection with which the mark has been employed has been the business of the Crofut & Knapp Company, which business, until 1924, was carried on, so far as the evidence discloses, without any relation to the business of the respondent beyond the acquiescence of the latter in the use by the former of the trade-mark. Mere acquiescence by the owner of a foreign trade-mark to its use in Canada by another, does not give property in the trade-mark in Canada to the foreign owner thereof, unless the goods in connection with which it is used in Canada are put on the market as the goods of the owner of the foreign trade-mark, or sold under his name. Re Elaine Inescourt Trade-Mark12.\nIt is difficult, therefore, to see how the respondent could have acquired in Canada any property in the trade-mark. Furthermore, to be entitled to registration in Canada the respondent must be able truthfully to make the declaration required by s. 13. In its application to the Minister for registration the respondent declared as follows:\u2014\nWe hereby declare that the said Specific Trade-Mark was not, to our knowledge, in use by any person other than ourselves at the time of our adoption thereof.\n\u201cAdoption\u201d here means adoption in Canada. There was no adoption of it as a trade-mark in Canada by the respondent. The respondent did no business in hats in Canada and it knew that, from 1913 to 1924, the mark was being used in Canada in connection with the sale of hats by the Crofut & Knapp Company. It could not, therefore, in my opinion, truthfully make the declaration required by the statute. Its application for registration should, on this ground also, be refused.\nThe appeal, therefore, will be dismissed as to the expunging from the register of the appellant\u2019s trade-mark, and allowed as to the leave given to the respondent to continue its application for the registration of its mark. As success has been about equally divided, there will be no costs.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aylesworth, Thompson, Garden & Stuart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fetherstonhaugh & Fox.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

Wai Hon (Defendants) Respondents.\n1929: October 1; 1930: February 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Lease by unincorporated society\u2014Distress\u2014Right to levy\u2014Action for illegal distress\u2014Relationship by estoppel.\nThe members of the Chinese National League of Canada, scattered throughout the Dominion (hereinafter called the League) subscribed money for the purchase of a site and the erection of a building in Vancouver for \"headquarters\" purposes. As the League was an unincorporated and unregistered society, the conveyance of the property was taken in the name of a branch of the League, called \" The Chinese Nationalist League,\" which was incorporated under the Benevolent Societies Act, with headquarters at Victoria. After the erection of the building the then president and secretary of the League leased a portion of the premises to the appellant company, first in July, 1922, under a verbal arrangement and later in September, 1924, under the same arrangement put in writing. The appellant paid rents to the League for some time but falling in arrears, in April, 1927, the then president and secretary of the League, the respondents Low and Waiissued a distress warrant, and the respondents Thompson and Binnington, bailiffs, distained the goods, chattels and fixtures of the appellant. In an action for illegal distress, the appellant recovered $500 damages; but that judgment was reversed in the appellate court.\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the relationship of landlord and tenant never existed between the appellant company and the League, on whose behalf the distress was made; therefore the distress was illegal and the appellant was entitled to recover the damages awarded by the trial judge.\nHeld, also, that an unincorporated society such as the League (although not within the prohibition of section 8 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 38, inasmuch as it has not \" for its object the acquisition of gain \") is incapable of making a lease. Jarrott v. Ackerley (85 L.J. Ch. 135) and Henderson v. Toronto General Trusts Corporation (62: O.L.R. 303) followed.\nHeld, further, that the appellate court erred in holding that the appellant was estopped from setting up incapacity of the alleged landlords on the ground that to do so would be tantamount to impeaching the title to the premises of the persons by whom it was let into possession of them as tenant. To extend the estoppel, which exists where\n[Page339]\nthe relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted or established and which prevents the tenant questioning the landlord's title, so as to make it apply to a case in which the real question is as to the existence of that relationship, seems to be wrong in principle and is quite unwarranted by the authorities. Rennie v. Robinson (1 Bing. 147) and Morton v. Woods (L.R. 4 Q.B. 293) discussed. The courts, at the instance of a person claimed to be a tenant, ought to determine the status of an alleged landlord for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the relationship of landlord and tenant exists between them, and the consequent legality of a distress. Farwell & Glendon v. Jameson (26 Can. S.C.R. 588) followed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (41 B.C. Rep.230) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Murphy J.[2], and dismissing the appellant company's action in damages for illegal distress.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nG. R. Nicholson for the appellant.\nGlyn Osler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The record discloses the following material and relevant facts necessary to be considered on the present appeal.\nThe action is for damages for illegal distress. The learned trial judge held the distress to be illegal and awarded $500 as damages. The Court of Appeal, reversing, upheld the legality of the distress and dismissed the action. The present appeal is by the plaintiff, the Canada Morning News Company Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia in October, 1924.\nThe defendants are W. G. B. Thompson and Francis Edward Binnington, carrying on business as bailiffs, who effected the distress in question, and Low Yee Quan and Wai Hon, who signed the distress warrant. The actual form of the signature is as follows:\u2014\nThe Chinese Nationalist League,\n(Per Low Yee Quan, Pres.)\n(Per Wai Hon, Secy.) Although the status of the signatories as such officers has been challenged, for the purpose of the disposition of this appeal it may be assumed to be established.\nIt is clear law that in order to justify a distress for rent the relationship of landlord and tenant must subsist between the person on whose behalf it is made and the person against whom it is directed. It is also certain that this relationship can only arise out of contract, express or implied.\nThe learned trial judge took the view that no tenancy existed in this case because the Chinese Nationalist League of Canada (hereinafter called \"The League\"), which purported to be the landlord, was an unincorporated and unregistered society and, as such, an entity unknown to the law, and, therefore, incapable of making a lease. He further held that there was no evidence to support the contention that a lease existed between the plaintiff company and some member or members of the \" headquarters \" of The League, inasmuch as there was nothing to show who those individuals were, or that the distress warrant was issued on their behalf, or had since been ratified by them, although there is abundant evidence of such attempted ratification by the \"headquarters\" itself.\nThe Court of Appeal, on the other hand, relying on such authorities as Rennie v. Robinson[3], and Morton v. Woods[4], held the plaintiff estopped from setting up incapacity of the alleged landlord or landlords on the ground that to do so would be tantamount to impeaching the title to the premises of the persons by whom it was let into possession of them as tenant, or of their assignees or representatives.\nTo what has already been said, it may be added that the evidence is entirely silent as to whether the membership of The League is to-day the same as it was when the alleged lease was made. Indeed, the fact is, no doubt otherwise.\nOriginally, the publishers of the Canada Morning News then unincorporated, were given possession of the premises in question under a verbal arrangement made with persons who were then officers of The League. This occurred about 1922. In September, 1924, about a month before the plaintiff company was incorporated, at the request of one of its officers, the arrangement between these parties was put in writing. This document, in the nature of a lease, purports to be made by Louis Man Har and Mah Kaing Chee, as lessors; whereas the distress warrant is signed by Low Yee Quan and Wai Hon. The evidence shows that Louis Man Har had been both President of The League and editor of the Canada Morning News up to some time in 1924. It also appears from the evidence that the property in question was acquired about 1920 for the \" headquarters \" purposes of The League and was paid for by subscriptions of its members scattered throughout Canada. The agreement for its purchase was made in the name of two of such members; and the deed was originally drawn in favour of The Chinese Nationalist League of Canada, the unincorporated body in question. Difficulty having arisen as to registration of the title, however, it was decided to take the deed in the name of an incorporated branch of The League, viz., \" The Chinese Nationalist League\" (of Victoria, B.C.). This body had been incorporated under the Benevolent Societies Act of British Columbia in 1916. The legal title, thus vested in the incorporated branch, may have been held by it in trust for those members of The League who had contributed to the purchase of the property. The precise situation in this respect is not very clear in the record, but there probably arose a resulting trust in favour of such members of The League. If the distress had been made on behalf of these cestui que trustent, an interesting question might have arisen on such authorities as Vallance v. Savage[5]; but it was not so made. Nor is there evidence of authority having been given by such members to the men who purport to be the lessors to enter into a lease binding upon them. On the whole evidence, it is impossible to say that the members of The League intended to become lessors and if the lease should be regarded as having been made personally by the individuals who purported to make it on behalf of The League, it is equally impossible to hold that the two gentlemen who signed the distress warrant in any wise represented them.\nTo extend the estoppel, which exists where the relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted or established and which prevents the tenant questioning the landlord's title, so as to make it apply to a case in which the real question is as to the existence of that relationship, seems to be wrong in principle and, with respect, is quite unwarranted by the authorities.\nThat an unincorporated society such as the League (although not within the prohibition of section 8 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 38, inasmuch as it has not \" for its object the acquisition of gain \") cannot become a lessee is established by several judgments, of which it is only necessary to refer to two,\u2014 Jarrott v. Ackerley[6], and Henderson v. Toronto General Trusts Corporation[7]. These decisions rest upon the incapacity of an unincorporated and unregistered society to assert any position which is maintainable in law only by a legal entity. In principle, therefore, they are equally applicable whether the position so asserted be that of landlord or tenant.\nThat the courts will, at the instance of a person claimed to be a tenant, determine the status of the alleged landlord for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the relationship of landlord and tenant exists between them, and the consequent legality of a distress, seems to be settled by the decision of this court in Farwell & Glendon v. Jameson[8]. Indeed, the very cases cited by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal proceed on this footing, because in both of them the court first determined that the relationship of landlord and tenant existed. Thus, in the Rennie case[9], the question was whether the admitted rights of the original lessor extended to his assignee of the reversion, i.e., whether the latter might be regarded as landlord of the tenant let in by the former and, as such, entitled to distrain. It was so held upon the express ground that \" Rennie (the assignee) only stands in the shoes of Williams \" (the lessor);\nas the defendant was not competent to impeach the title of Williams, neither is he competent to impeach that of Rennie. In Morton v. Woods[10], the court, having stated (p. 303) that the second objection went to the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties, said of it:\u2014\nThese objections are all of a technical nature; but we are bound to give effect to them if they turn out to be sustained in point of law;\nand the decision proceeded upon the ground that the objections were not sustainable in fact, and that, therefore, the relationship of landlord and tenant subsisted between the parties. See too Baldwin v. Burd[11].\nThe evidence entirely supports the findings of the learned trial judge that the alleged lease purported to be made on behalf of the unincorporated body, The League; that \"The Chinese Nationalist League\" (of Victoria) had no connection with it at any time prior to the distress; and that any ratification of the acts of the defendants, Low Yee Quan and Wai Hon, by the Victoria society was impossible and wholly ineffective, inasmuch as the acts of these defendants did not purport in any way to be done on behalf of that society (Bowstead on Agency, 7th ed., p. 49), but, on the contrary, ex facie of the distress warrant itself and according to all the evidence, had been done on behalf of The League. That the alleged lease purported to be made on behalf of The League is also clear ex facie of the document of September, 1924, \" the makers \" thereof appearing to be\nLouie Man Har, President, and Mah Kaing Chee, Secretary of the Chinese Nationalist League Headquarters of Canada.\nThis alleged lease is also signed by \" Wong Ko, Treasurer of The Chinese Nationalist League\" (of Canada) and, \" Wong Kong Doo, Director of Canada Morning News.\"\nThe evidence clearly discloses payment of rent as such by the Canada Morning News Company Limited, both before and after its incorporation, to the alleged landlord, in cash and by way of set off of amounts due for rent against amounts due to the Canada Morning News Company for printing. If the alleged landlord, The League, had been an entity capable of granting a lease, there might well be enough in these payments to found an estoppel against the alleged tenant denying that the relationship of landlord and tenant subsisted between it and the alleged landlord. But, in order that there should be such an estoppel, the body invoking it must itself be an entity known to the law,\u2014in other words, must be capable of assuming the position of landlord. Estoppels in pais are mutual.\nOn the short ground, therefore, that the relationship of landlord and tenant never existed between the appellant and the Chinese Nationalist League of Canada, on whose behalf the distress in question was made, that distress in our opinion was illegal. The appeal must, accordingly, be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell, Nicholson & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W.

She died May 2, 1926. On January 12, 1925, a vote was taken in the congregation, pursuant to c. 100, statutes of Canada, 1924, when a majority voted for union, and, as a result, the congregation, on June 10, 1925, became a part of the United Church of Canada.\nHeld, that the congregation could not take under said bequests; by becoming a congregation of the United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche, it had become something so different from the congregation for whose benefit the bequests were made, that it did not now come within the description in the will; the present congregation was not the same entity as the congregation which P. contemplated as her beneficiary. (In re Donald, [1909] 2 Ch., 410, and In re Magrath, [1913] 2 Ch., 331, distinguished). As to the bequest to \u201cthe Trustees of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church,\u201d it was to a corporation which, even if it continued to exist, was not now one for carrying into effect the testatrix\u2019 object, and the same principle applied as in the case of the other bequest.\nThe fact that, about the time the congregation became part of the United Church of Canada, P.\u2019s name was, at her request, removed from its roll and she became a member of Sedgewick Memorial Church, a continuing Presbyterian Church formed at Tatamagouche by those of the original congregation opposed to the union, was not admissible as a guide to interpretation of the will. The question in issue must be decided without regard to whether P. remained in the United Church congregation or left it.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (60 N.S. Rep., 343), which held that there was an intestacy as to said bequests, affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL (by leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] which varied the decision of Chisholm J.[2].\nThe proceedings were commenced by originating summons in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at the instance of the executor of the will of Eliza Patriquin, late of Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia, deceased, to construe the said will and determine to what body or persons bequests left under certain clauses of the will should be paid.\nChisholm J.2 held that the present appellants were entitled as beneficiaries to the legacies bequeathed under the clauses in question. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco1 held that the property in dispute should be dealt with as if undisposed of by the will, and it was declared that the next of kin or persons entitled by law, had the deceased died intestate, were entitled to the legacies provided for by the said clauses.\nThe cross-appellants, the Trustees of Sedgewick Memorial Church, filed a notice discontinuing their appeal.\nThe clauses in question of the will, and the material facts of the case, are stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nDonald McInnes for the appellants.\nNo one contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014Eliza Patriquin made her last will, dated the 5th day of January, 1924, and died on the 2nd day of May, 1926. The clauses of the will that give rise to the questions here involved read as follows:\n7. I bequeath to the Trustees of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church, One Hundred Dollars.\n10. If there is any balance remaining I bequeath such balance to Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church.\nAt the date of the execution of the will, the testatrix was a member of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church.\nOn the 12th day of January, 1925, a vote was taken in Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church congregation, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 100, Statutes of Canada, 1924, when a majority of the members of the congregation voted for union, and, as a result, the congregation became a part of the United Church of Canada on the 10th of June, 1925.\nThe bequests under clauses 7 and 10 of the will quoted above are claimed by this congregation of the United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche. The respondent, Edwin C. McLellan, was, by order, appointed to represent the class comprising the next of kin of Eliza Patriquin. The cross-appellants, the Trustees of Sedgewick Memorial Church, have filed a notice discontinuing their appeal and disclaiming any interest in the bequests referred to.\nIt appears in the record that about the time the congregation became part of the United Church of Canada the name of the testatrix was, at her request, removed from the roll of that congregation and that she became a member of Sedgewick Memorial Church, a continuing Presbyterian Church formed at Tatamagouche by those of the original congregation opposed to the Union. Some argument was based on this incident. It, however, appears clear that evidence of what the testatrix did after the making of the will is no more admissible as a guide to its interpretation than evidence as to what she may have said would have been. We must decide the question presented without regard to whether the testatrix remained in the United Church congregation or left it.\nThere can be no doubt that at the time the will was executed the testatrix intended these two bequests for the benefit of the congregation to which she then belonged, and the sole question for determination is whether or not that congregation, under the circumstances that have since arisen, comes now within the description in the will or has become something so different that it does not now answer to the description.\nOn the return of the original summons before Mr. Justice Chisholm it was held that these bequests go to the congregation at Tatamagouche that became a congregation of the United Church of Canada[3]. This decision was unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[4], where it was held that, as to these bequests, there was an intestacy.\nThe first question is whether or not the bequest under clause 10, of any balance remaining, to \u201cTatamagouche Presbyterian Church,\u201d is effective as a bequest to the congregation which has now become a congregation of the United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche.\nNot much help is to be obtained from the cases cited in the appellant\u2019s factum.\nIn In re Whorwood[5], the bequest was to Lord Sherborne. He died before the testator, and it was held that the successor in title was not entitled to the bequest, for the reason that he was manifestly not the identical person described by the testator.\nThe case of In re Magrath[6], seems to have no bearing. On October 31, 1909, \u201cQueen\u2019s College, Belfast\u201d was dissolved under the provisions of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and by the same Act, \u201cQueen\u2019s University of Belfast\u201d was incorporated. The testatrix, by her will dated February 16, 1910, made a bequest to \u201cQueen\u2019s College, Belfast.\u201d It was held that \u201cQueen\u2019s University of Belfast\u201d was sufficiently referred to by the words of the will, and that the legacy took effect in its favour, the words in the will being treated as a mere misdescription of the legatee. It will be seen that the principle applied there has no relation to the present case. Had the will in that case been dated prior to the dissolution of \u201cQueen\u2019s College, Belfast,\u201d it would have more nearly resembled the present case, but the decision would in that case probably have been different, because in that event the bequest would have exactly described an institution then in existence, and subsequently dissolved. The contention here is that the legatee ceased to exist by becoming merged in a new corporation subsequently created.\nThe case of In re Donald[7], is more nearly in point, but is nevertheless capable of being distinguished. The bequests were for the benefit of certain military units. By the Territorial Reserve Forces Act, these units were transferred to the Territorial Forces under new names. Warrington J., in this case says:\nIn my opinion the effect of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907, and of the Order in Council of March 19, 1908, made under it, is not to destroy these units, but to reorganize them, and they are treated both in the Act and in the Order in Council as existing entities which are transferred to, and from henceforth become units of, the Territorial Force, and are called by different names; but, so far as the Act and the Order in Council are concerned, they continue to exist as institutions under those names.\nThese units were all, both before and after the change, part of His Majesty\u2019s military forces, and the units, being simply transferred and given new names, did not, in the learned judge\u2019s opinion, cease to exist.\nThe situation to be dealt with here is not altogether similar. These was, at the date of the will of the testatrix, a religious body named the Presbyterian Church in Canada, having a congregation of that church at Tatamagouche, to which the testatrix belonged. That congregation, or at least the majority of those who composed it, have now become a congregation of the United Church of Canada, an incorporated body that came into existence, as stated, subsequently to the date of the will. I think that the Supreme Court in banco has correctly held that the present congregation of the United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche is not the same entity as \u201cThe Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church\u201d to which the testatrix made this bequest, and therefore cannot take it. We have, incorporated by the Act, an entirely new and distinct legal entity, and what we have to consider is whether or not that entity is the same organization as that which she had in contemplation as her beneficiary. There can be no doubt that it was not present to her mind that there was to be any such change as subsequently took place, and it seems clear that the beneficiary that she had in mind was \u201cThe Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church\u201d, as a congregation of the Presbyterian Church as it then existed, and it cannot be said that a congregation of the United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche is the same religious organization as was within the contemplation of the testatrix in making this bequest to the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church.\nThe bequest of $100 is to \u201cThe Trustees of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church.\u201d\nBy 10 Vic., c. 37, The Presbyterian Congregation at Tatamagouche was empowered to appoint three trustees to take charge of the House of Worship and of the adjoining cemetery, called the Tatamagouche Burial Ground, whose name of office shall be \u201cThe Trustees of the Presbyterian Church at Tatamagouche.\u201d There is power to fill vacancies caused by death, resignation or otherwise, and to remove trustees and appoint others, and the power and authority of the former trustees is to vest in their successors for all purposes intended by the Act. The trustees are authorized, in the name of their office, to sue and be sued.\nUnder the authorities it seems clear that these trustees became a corporation by implication. The Conservators of the River Tone v. Ash, et al[8]; Re Wansley and Brown[9]; Beaty v. Gregory[10]. The statute 10 Vic., c. 37, does not provide for the vesting of any property in the trustees, and the only power given them is as to care and management of property already held. There are later statutes, authorizing the trustees to sell parts of the property and give title thereto, but there is nothing in the record that indicates that any property was vested in these trustees, and therefore sec. 20 of The United Church of Canada Act, N.S., 14-15 Geo. V, ch. 122, would seem not to apply to these trustees. If it does apply, subs. (b) expressly provides for their continuance as a body corporate.\nThe bequest of $100, therefore, is to a corporation which, perhaps, continues to exist, but it is nevertheless necessary to consider, even if that be so, whether or not it is a corporation for carrying into effect the object that the testatrix had in view, namely, to hold or expend the bequest for the benefit of the \u201cPresbyterian Church at Tatamagouche\u201d. It would seem that the same principle should be applied as in the case of the other bequest.\nIt follows, therefore, that the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church at Tatamagouche, if still a corporation, would take the bequest upon a trust different from that in the contemplation of the testatrix at the time of making her will, and that this bequest also lapses.\nThe appeal therefore must be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

The fact that an owner has acquired land in one connected parcel by a single conveyance and has included it all in one or more mortgaged does not necessarily imply that those entitled to liens in connection with a building erected on a part of it are entitled to place their liens on the whole parcel. In the case in question it was held that the land to be enjoyed with the building erected for the owner had been severed from the rest of the property by the owner and leased, to be occupied and enjoyed by the lessee, separate from the rest of the owner\u2019s property, and this leased land (and including, with regard) to the lien, one half of the wall of an adjoining building, which wall was used as a wall of the new building) was the only land upon which the lien was acquired, and therefore the claim of lien, which was filed against it only, was properly so confined, the contention of appellant, second mortgagee of all the land and purchaser thereof at a sale made under power of sale in the first mortgage, that the lien should have been filed against all the land, being rejected.\nIt was further held that the judgment at trial sustaining another claim of lien, which had been filed against the whole property, but which was for materials furnished for construction on some part of the land other than where the building above mentioned was erected, should be set aside and that it should be referred back to the trial judge to ascertain the particular part or parts of the property upon which this claimant was entitled to a lien.\nIt was further held that the appellant, who, subsequent to registration of claims of lien and with notice thereof, purchased the land at a sale by the first mortgagee (whose mortgage was registered long prior to when the liens arose) under the power of sale in the mortgage, did not thereby acquire a title free from the liens.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Steedman from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], dismissing his appeal from the judgment of His Honour Judge Brandon, Deputy Judge of the County Court of Wentworth, in favour of the respondents Sparks & McKay, as lienholders, in one action, and in favour of the respondent Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd., as lien-holder, in the other action. The two actions were mechanics\u2019 lien actions and were tried together.\nThe defendant Lord had owned certain land on the southwest corner of Barton and Ottawa streets in the city of Hamilton, Ontario. It was subject to three mortgages: (1) To the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, dated August 10, 1925, for $80,000; (2) To one Richardson, trustee, dated August 18, 1925, for $30,000; (3) To one Mills, dated September 19, 1925, for $10,000.\nBy deed, not registered, dated May 6, 1926, Lord conveyed the land to the defendant the East End Markets, Ltd., subject to the mortgages.\nThe northerly part of the frontage on Ottawa street, which runs north and south, was occupied by a market building. To the south of this was a store, and to the south of the store some land upon which there was no building, but some excavation and foundations. On August 19, 1927, the East End Markets, Ltd., leased to the F.W. Woolworth Co., Ltd., the northerly part of the said vacant land (immediately south of the store) and agreed to erect, for the use of the lessee, a building upon the land leased. The East End Markets, Ltd., then contracted with the plaintiffs (respondents), Sparks & McKay, for the latter to erect the building.\nSparks & McKay commenced work early in October, 1927, and on December 12, 1927, registered a claim of lien against the land on which the new building was constructed, including the southerly half of the south wall of the building immediately to the north thereof, which wall, so far as it extended, was used to provide the northerly wall of the new building, the joists of the new building being inserted six inches into the southerly wall of the old building. (The land against which Sparks & McKay registered their lien is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cWoolworth lot\u201d).\nThe second and third mortgages had been assigned to defendant (appellant) Steedman on March 25, 1927. The Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, the first mortgagee, had taken proceedings under the power of sale in its mortgage, offering the land for the first time in April, 1927, and the sale being postponed from time to time. On December 15, 1927, Steedman bought the land at the mortgage sale for $125,000.\nThe trial judge held that the lien of the respondents Sparks & McKay had been validly registered and ordered a sale. He found that when their lien arose the actual value of the Woolworth lot was $7,900. He therefore held that, under s. 7 (3) of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 173, the first mortgage had priority to the extent of $7,900, and that Sparks & McKay ranked next for the amount of their lien.\nThe appellant, Steedman, contended that the lien of the respondents, Sparks & McKay, was not validly registered against the Woolworth lot, and should have been registered against the whole of the land. This contention was rejected by the Appellate Division[2]. He also contended that the lien had been extinguished by the sale under its power of sale by the first mortgagee, and that the lien claimants were relegated to the purchase money on that sale, in lieu of the land, and, since the purchase money was not sufficient to satisfy the claims of the first mortgagee and of the appellant, there was nothing to which the lien claimants could resort. This contention also was rejected by the Appellate Division[3] on grounds (adopted by reference by this Court in the judgment now reported) which were stated as follows:\nIt is argued that the sale by the Canada Permanent under the mortgage has had the effect of preventing a sale of the property in these proceedings. I am unable to follow this contention. Of course, if such is the law, we should have the anomaly of a statutory lien wiped out by acts over which the lienor has no control. If such a sale could under any circumstances have any effect, it certainly could not in a case in which, as here, the purchaser bought with full statutory notice of the liens encumbering the property.\nThe respondent, Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd., on January 13, 1927, filed a claim of lien against the whole land, for $367.46, the price of materials used for some part or parts of the northerly buildings on the land, but none of which, of course, went into the Woolworth building, which was erected later. The trial judge fixed the value of all the said land when this lien arose at $160,000, directed a sale, and found that the claims of the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation and Steedman, as mortgagees, amounted to $92,796.50 and $37,583.40 respectively, and that they should rank in priority to the lien (of the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd.) in respect of $84,796.50 and $35,329 respectively, and that, subject to said priorities, the lien should rank in priority to any other claims of the said mortgagees.\nThe appellant contended, similarly as in the other action, that the effect of the sale under the power of sale in the first mortgage was to defeat the lien and to relegate the lien claimant to the purchase money, and since this was insufficient to satisfy the mortgagees\u2019 prior claims (which, he contended, should have been allowed at larger sums) and since the trial judge had found the value of the mortgaged lands to be $160,000 at the time when the first lien arose, the lien claimant was entitled to no relief as against the mortgagees. There were also certain questions in regard to the amounts and priorities allowed to the mortgagees, as follows:\nThe appellant alleged error in the trial judge\u2019s finding as to the time of advancement of an amount of $8,000 by the first mortgagee, and that the allowance of the latter\u2019s priority over the lien should have been larger.\nThe trial judge found that the second mortgagee, Richardson, was a trustee for certain creditors of Lord; that, although the face value of the mortgage was $30,000, it was only security for $28,183.59; that the appellant, on the assignment of the mortgage to him, paid only 70% of this latter amount, the creditors receiving only 70% of their respective claims; and he held that the appellant was only entitled to be credited to the extent of the amount actually advanced, viz., 70% of $28,183.59, plus interest. The appellant contended that he was entitled to hold the second mortgage for the full amount for which the mortgage was originally security.\nThe trial judge found that the third mortgage, which represented only an actual advance of $8,000, was assigned to the appellant for its full face value, without knowledge by the appellant that less than $10,000 had been advanced on it. He held, however, that the third mortgagee had only priority for $8,000, the amount advanced, and, as the assignment to appellant was after the registration of the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co.\u2019s lien, the appellant could be in no higher position in regard to that lien. The appellant claimed that he was entitled to priority, in respect of the third mortgage, to the full sum of $10,000 and interest.\nG. Lynch-Staunton K.C. and H.A.F. Boyde for the appellant.\nC.C. Robinson K.C. and E.G. Binkley for the respondents Sparks & McKay.\nH.E.B. Coyne for the respondent Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The defendant Lord was the owner of a property in the city of Hamilton, bounded on the north by Barton street and on the east by Ottawa street. The northerly part of the frontage on Ottawa street was occupied by the Market Building, to the south of which was a store, and to the south of that store there was no building, but some excavation and foundations.\nThere were three mortgages on the property prior to the registration of any lien, namely:\n(1) To Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, dated 10th August, 1925, for $80,000;\n(2) to Sinclair G. Richardson, dated 18th August, 1925, for $30,000;\n(3) to William R. Mills, dated 19th September, 1925, for $10,000.\nLord conveyed these lands, subject to the mortgages, to the East End Markets Limited, but the conveyance has not been registered. On the 19th of August, 1927, the East End Markets Limited leased to the F.W. Woolworth Co. Ltd., for ten years, the northerly 32 feet of the vacant portion of their lands referred to, lying immediately south of the line of the southerly wall of the store building mentioned, and, by the terms of the lease, agreed to erect a building upon the land so leased, for the use of the lessee, and entered into a contract with the plaintiffs Sparks & McKay for the erection of such building, pursuant to the terms of the lease.\nThe plaintiffs Sparks & McKay registered a lien on this 32 feet for the amount owing to them in connection with the construction of this building, in pursuance of their contract.\nThe building occupied the full width of the 32 feet except six inches south of the southerly wall. The pre-existing store was made use of to provide the northerly wall of the new building, as far as it extended, the joists of the new building being inserted six inches into the southerly wall of the old building. The new building on this 32 feet extended westerly beyond the older store to the north of it, but not all the way to the alleyway at the west, which is the westerly boundary of the lands described.\nThe appellant attacked the validity of this lien of the plaintiffs Sparks & McKay, on the ground that it should have been registered against the whole mortgaged prop- erty, whereas it is limited to the 32 feet on which the building was erected.\nThe learned deputy judge seems to have thought that these plaintiffs acquired a lien on the whole mortgaged property, but held that they had the right to sever the 32 feet from the whole and register their lien against that part only. In the Appellate Division the opinion is expressed that,\nthe lien attaches in whole and in part to all parts of the property liable to it so that every cent is a lien on every inch; and that he may abandon his lien on any part without interfering with his right in respect of the rest or any part of it.\nIt is, however, immediately pointed out that it is unnecessary to decide that point. I agree that there is no such necessity, and refrain from expressing an opinion in reference to it. It is manifest, however, that grave complications as to the rights, not only of the owner but of encumbrancers and other lienholders, might arise in connection with enforcement of liens by sale of the property if the opinion alluded to is correct. Such complications would arise, for example, in a supposed extreme case where an owner, having mortgaged his building lot with a view to erecting a dwelling house on it, finds at the completion of the building that a number of liens have been registered against the whole lot and some against only a part of the lot, including only part of the house.\nThe statute gives a lien on the estate of the owner, in the building and appurtenances and the land occupied thereby or enjoyed therewith, and it is a question of fact in each case what land this includes, to be determined from all the circumstances. The fact that an owner has acquired land in one connected parcel by a single conveyance and has included it all in one or more mortgages does not necessarily imply that those entitled to liens in connection with a building erected on a part of it are entitled to place their liens on the whole parcel. Here, as pointed out in the reasons of the Appellate Division, the land to be enjoyed with the building that was erected had been severed from the rest of the property by the owner and leased to the F.W. Woolworth Co. Ltd., to be occupied and enjoyed by them, separate from the rest of the owner\u2019s property, and was, in my opinion, the only land upon which these plaintiffs and others having claims in connection with the erection of the building acquired liens.\nThe appellant, however, further contends that by his purchase subsequent to the registration of the liens at the mortgage sale under the first mortgage, he acquired a title free from these liens. This contention also fails, upon the grounds set out in the reasons for judgment in the Appellate Division[4].\nThe deputy judge therefore proceeded properly in ascertaining and fixing the value of the land described in the lien of the plaintiffs Sparks & McKay at the time the first lien arose. Having fixed this value at $7,900, he has properly held that to that extent the mortgages have priority over the liens, and that the lienholders have priority over the mortgagees as to the surplus that may be realized from the sale of that land with the building; and has properly ordered such sale in default of payment into court of the amount found owing. The only lien found under this judgment is that of Sparks & McKay; but by the judgment in the other case he finds the plaintiff in that action also entitled to a lien on this property.\nThe Dominion Lumber & Coal Co., Ltd., registered a lien against the whole mortgaged property and brought a separate action to enforce the same. The formal judgment in that action declares that this plaintiff company is entitled to a lien on this whole property for the sum of $450.83, and finds that The Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation ranks in priority to this lienholder in respect of the sum of $84,796.50, and that the appellant Steedman ranks in priority to the lienholder in respect of the sum of $35,329, and that the lienholders have priority over the mortgages as to the balance of purchase money to be realized.\nWe have, then, as a result of the two judgments, a direction for the sale of the Woolworth lot and building and a direction to apply the whole proceeds on the mortgages and on Sparks & McKay\u2019s lien, according to the priorities already referred to, and without reference to any lien of the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd.; and then we have, in the other action, a judgment for sale of this same land as part of the whole, and a direction that the whole amount of the purchase money be paid to the mortgagees and to the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd., without any reference to the lien of Sparks & McKay. It is evident that both of these judgments cannot be carried out, and it seems equally evident that the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co., Ltd., was never entitled to any lien on the Woolworth lot and building, because the evidence establishes that no part of the material in that company\u2019s account went into the construction of that building. The judgment therefore, in the action in which the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co., Ltd., is plaintiff, must be set aside, and it must be referred back to the deputy judge to ascertain the particular part or parts of the mortgaged property upon which the plaintiff in that action is entitled to a lien.\nAccording to the evidence of Lord, these materials went into the East End Market building. If that is so, as indicated above, the lien should be confined to the estate of the owner in that building and appurtenances and the land occupied thereby or enjoyed therewith; and it will be for the deputy judge to ascertain what that includes. Having decided that question, he should ascertain, as in the other case, the value of the portion of the property to which he finds the lien attaches at the time the lien arose, and fix the priorities on the same principle as in the other case. One would think, however, that the plaintiff would regard it as rather a hopeless task to establish that the sale value of this market building and the lands enjoyed with it was much increased by the $367 worth of lumber that went into it, probably for repairs. Apparently this plaintiff\u2019s hope was to share in the increased value that arose from the Woolworth building, to which he had contributed nothing.\nThe deputy judge, it seems, made a mistake in holding that $8,000 of the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation mortgage moneys was not advanced till after the registration of the liens, and will make the necessary correction accordingly.\nThere is no evidence on which the finding of the deputy judge that the appellant is entitled under the second mortgage only to the amount he paid for it, can be disturbed. In the evidence it is sometimes stated that the mortgage was given to secure creditors and in other places that it was for subscriptions. Whether the appellant was buying the full rights of the creditors or subscribers from the trustee and settling with them at a discount where he could, or the creditors were reducing their claims and thus reducing the mortgage, so that the appellant was buying the mortgage thus reduced, does not appear. The mortgage on its face was for $30,000, but the appellant knew that this was mote than the real amount.\nMills took the third mortgage on the property for $10,000, but advanced only $8,000, and, after the registration of the liens, assigned it to the appellant for the full face amount. The appellant had no notice that the full amount had not been advanced, and acted in good faith. The answer to the question raised as to the respective rights of the mortgagees and lienholders under these circumstances is that the mortgage has priority over the liens only on the basis of the amount advanced prior to the first lien, but that, subject to this, the appellant is entitled to the full amount against the mortgagor and the land.\nBoth cases are referred back to the deputy judge, to be proceeded with as indicated above.\nThe appellant will pay the costs of this appeal of the respondents Sparks & McKay in the action brought by them.\nIn the other case, the plaintiffs claimed a lien on the whole property, and the judgment is set aside because the lien does not extend to the whole property. The appellant, however, contended here that this plaintiff had properly registered its lien on the whole property, and attacked it on the ground that he had, by his purchase under the first mortgage, acquired title free of all liens, and that in any case he had priority for the full amount of the mortgages; and moreover, that in any event there was no power to order a sale of the property. He has failed on all these contentions, but has succeeded on his contention that there cannot be two sales under separate judgments of the same property. There should therefore be no costs of either appeal in the action of the Dominion Lumber & Coal Co. Ltd.\nSteedman v. Sparks et al.: Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSteedman v.

Carling Export Brewing & Malting Co. Ltd., [1930] S.C.R. 361\nDate: 1930-02-04\nHis Majesty The King, on the information of the Attorney-General of Canada (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Carling Export Brewing And Malting Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent\n1929; December 12, 13, 16, 17, 18; 1930: February 4.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Gallonage and sales taxes\u2014Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (as amended), ss. 19B (1), 19BBB (1)\u2014Exemption in case of export\u2014 Requisites for operation of the exempting provisoes\u2014Onus as to proof of export\u2014Export of beer into a country in violation of its laws\u2014 Sales tax on sales made in Ontario in violation of Ontario Temperance Act\u2014Right of Crown to interest and penalties.\nThe Crown claimed against the defendant, under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (as amended), for sales tax in respect of beer sold, and for gallonage tax in respect of beer manufactured and sold, between April 1, 1924, and May 1, 1927. Defendant claimed that the beer was manufactured for export and was exported, and that, therefore, the taxes were not payable.\nHeld (1) Export, in order to attract the exemption from gallonage tax, must be under government regulation, and in the absence of regulations the exempting proviso in s. 19B (1) of the Act can have no operation. (2) The proviso in s. 19BBB (1) that the sales tax \u201cshall not be payable on goods exported\u201d exempts only in cases in which the goods are exported by the vendor in execution of the contract of sale. If the contract for sale is completed by delivery in Canada the liability for sales tax attaches, notwithstanding that export is contemplated and that the purchaser agrees with the vendor that the goods shall be exported. Subsequent export does not effect a defeasance of the obligation to pay the tax. The remedy in such case would be by way of the procedure (for refund) laid down in subs. 10 of s. 19BBB.\nIt was further held that, even assuming that subsequent export could have brought defendant within the benefit of the proviso, export had not been sufficiently established to effect this. The Crown having proved the sales, the defendant, to escape taxation in respect of any shipment, must shew it was in fact exported (meaning of \u201cexport\u201d discussed); and, upon the facts and circumstances in evidence, while no doubt beer was exported in large quantities, it was impossible to say judicially with regard to any particular shipment that it was in fact exported.\nQuaere whether \u201cexport,\u201d in the sense of the statutory exemption, should not be taken to exclude export which involved the violation of the laws of the United States by the introduction and sale there of goods which could not there be lawfully introduced or sold or (except in circumstances not here relevant) be the subject of property or juridical possession.\n(3) As to certain sporadic cash sales in Ontario, these were \u201csales\u201d within the meaning of said Act, and subject to the tax, notwithstanding that the Ontario Temperance Act, in force during the period in question, made such sales unlawful and deprived them of legal effect (Minister of Finance v. Smith, [1927] A.C. 193, applied).\n(4) The Crown was entitled to the penalties provided by s. 19GC (3) (as enacted by c. 69 of 1926-27, amending the Special War Revenue Act) not only in respect of sales made after its passing, but also, from the date of its passing, in respect of sales made prior thereto; and, up to the date of said enactment, to interest at 5% per annum from the dates when the taxes became due (Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto, [1906] A.C. 117).\nJudgment of Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1929] Ex. C.R. 130, varied in favour of the Crown.\nAPPEAL by the Crown (plaintiff) from the judgment of Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in so far as he refused to allow the Crown\u2019s claim. The defendant cross-appealed against the allowances made in the said judgment in favour of the Crown.\nThe Crown\u2019s claim was for $163,828.07 for sales tax, under s. 19 BBB of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (as amended), in respect of alleged sales of beer by the defendant on and after April 1, 1924, and prior to May 1, 1927, and for $260,662.21 for gallonage tax, under s. 19 B of said Act (as amended) in respect of beer alleged to have been manufactured and sold by the defendant on and after April 1, 1924, and prior to May 1, 1927; and for interest at 5% per annum from the dates when the taxes became due to June 1, 1927, and thereafter at the rate of 2\/3 of 1% per month as provided by s. 19 CC of said Act, as enacted by 17 Geo. V, c. 69, s. 4.\nThe defendant denied the Crown\u2019s allegations and alleged that the beer in respect of which sales taxes were sought to be recovered was exported and not subject to the tax, but, on the contrary, was exempted under the provisions of s. 19 BBB; and that the beer manufactured by it was manufactured for export and was exported within the meaning of s. 19 B, and the defendant was not liable to pay the gallonage tax.\nBy the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court of Canada, it was adjudged (inter alia) that the plaintiff should recover $1,590 for sales tax on certain sales of strong beer entered in the defendant\u2019s books as cash sales, upon which sales tax had not been paid; that the plaintiff should recover sales tax and gallonage tax on all strong beer sold by defendant to one Bannon and resold by him in Canada; that the plaintiff should recover sales tax on all other sales of strong beer upon which sales tax had not been paid and in respect of which Customs export entry forms commonly known as B. 13\u2019s were not produced and put in as exhibits at the trial [export entries produced covered about 83% of the total sales]; that the defendant was liable to pay to the plaintiff interest at the rate of 5% per annum upon such gallonage and sales tax in respect of all transactions prior to April 14, 1927 [the date of the passing of said 17 Geo. V, c. 69] from the due date thereof until paid, and interest at the rate of 2\/3 of 1% per month upon such gallonage and sales tax in respect of all transactions subsequent to April 14, 1927, from the due date thereof until paid. A reference was directed to ascertain and determine the amount payable by defendant under the judgment.\nThe Crown\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed with costs. By the formal judgment of this Court, it was adjudged:\n* * * that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent sales tax on all sales in respect of which sales tax is claimed in this action and gallonage tax on all sales in respect of which gallonage tax is claimed in this action as to which the said Exchequer Court held no liability-rested on the respondent.\n* * * that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent interest upon such sales tax and gallonage tax in respect of all sales prior to the fourteenth day of April, A.D. 1927, from the due date thereof until the said fourteenth day of April, A.D. 1927, at the rate of five per centum per annum and a penalty thereafter until paid at the rate of two-thirds of one per centum per month; and a penalty upon such sales tax and gallonage tax in respect of all sales subsequent to the said fourteenth day of April, A.D. 1927, from the due date thereof, until paid at the rate of two-thirds of one per centum per month.\n* * * that this action be remitted to the Exchequer Court of Canada which shall determine the amount payable by the respondent under the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada as varied by this Court and all subsequent costs, and, except as herein varied, the said judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada be affirmed.\nN. W. Rowell, K.C., G. A. Urquhart, K.C., and G. Lindsay for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley, K.C., and C. F. H. Carson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff, J.\u2014In the action out of which the appeal arises the Crown claims $163,828.07 sales tax in respect of beer sold between the 1st of April, 1924, and the 1st of May, 1927; and the sum of $260,662.21 gallonage tax in respect of beer manufactured and sold during the same period; and interest on these sums up to the 1st of June, 1927, at the rate of 5% per annum, and thereafter at the rate of two-thirds of 1% per month. The ground of defence was that all this beer was manufactured for export and exported in fact, and that consequently under the provisions of the Revenue Act upon which the Crown\u2019s claim is based, there is no liability.\nThe learned trial judge held that in respect of certain cash sales in London and the vicinity of London, the respondents are liable to sales tax, and in respect of certain sales by one Bannon, in Windsor, to both sales and gallon-age taxes. These items constituted a comparatively trifling element in the Crown\u2019s claim, and in respect of the claim as a whole the learned trial judge drew a distinction between shipments of beer sold by the respondents for which export entries were produced, and those for which evidence of such entries was not forthcoming. He accepted the export entry as evidence of export and held that in respect of sales of goods, of which export was thus proved, no liability rested on the respondents for either sales or gallonage tax. Export was in this manner established in respect of about 83% in value of the goods sold. As to interest and penalties, the learned trial judge allowed the Crown\u2019s claim for interest, but disallowed the claim for penalties under the statute of 1927 in respect of taxes payable upon transactions prior to the date of the statute.\nIt will be convenient first to consider the learned trial judge\u2019s view as to the Crown\u2019s claim for gallonage tax. The statute is section 19 B 1 (b) of The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended by 12-13 Geo. V, c. 47, s. 14:\n19B. 1. (b). There shall be imposed, levied and collected upon all goods enumerated in Schedule II to this Part, when such goods are imported into Canada or taken out of warehouse or when any such goods are manufactured or produced in Canada and sold on and after the twenty-fourth day of May, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, in addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act, or any other statute or law, the rate of excise tax set opposite to each item in said Schedule II.\n(c) Where the goods are imported such excise tax shall be paid by the importer and where the goods are manufactured or produced and sold in Canada such excise tax shall be paid by the manufacturer or producer; provided that if an automobile is, on the twenty-fourth day of May, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two in the hands of a dealer and not sold to a bona fide user the tax shall be paid by such dealer when such automobile is sold.\n(d) The Minister may require every manufacturer or producer to take out an annual licence for the purposes aforesaid, and may prescribe a fee therefor, not exceeding two dollars, and the penalty for neglect or refusal shall be a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars.\nProvided that such excise tax shall not be payable when such goods are manufactured for export, under regulations prescribed by the Minister of Customs and Excise.\nSchedule II. Ale, beer, porter and stout, per gallon, twelve and one-half cents.\nThe respondents base their defence upon the proviso which takes effect when the goods are manufactured for export \u201cunder regulations prescribed by the Minister of Customs and Excise.\u201d The construction advanced on behalf of the respondents turns upon the effect of the word \u201cunder\u201d Under regulations prescribed by the Minister\u201d means, it is argued, \u201cin compliance with such regulations, if any.\u201d That does not appear to be a natural reading of the words. Obviously an exemption on the ground that the goods affected are manufactured for export could not be generally allowed to take effect upon the unsupported representations of the manufacturer without grave risk of fraud upon the revenue, and it is this consideration, no doubt, which accounts for the requirement that export in order to attract the exemption must be under government regulation; in the absence of regulations the proviso can have no operation. Counsel for the Crown called attention to the distinction in the statute between cases in which export is made simpliciter the condition of exemption, and cases where the condition is manufacture for export. In the last mentioned cases (the proviso to s. 19 B and the proviso to s. 16 A) regulations, and export under them, are required. In other cases, as for example, sections 19 BB 1 (b), 19 BB 1 (e), 19 BBB 1, regulations are not required; proof of export is enough. Mr. Tilley argues that the present case is distinguishable from the case of the excise taxes which were in question in Dominion Press Ltd. v. Minister of Customs and Excise[2], and there are no doubt distinctions, but the reasoning in the Lord Chancellor\u2019s judgment in that case seems to extend in substance to this case. \u201cThe proviso,\u201d his Lordship said, \u201cis an exempting proviso, and, in order to obtain its protection, the tax-payer must bring himself within its language.\u201d That you cannot do unless there are regulations. This claim for exemption seems to be unfounded.\nI shall next mention the sporadic cash sales in London and Windsor. The contention in respect to these is that they are not subject to the tax because they are not sales. The Ontario Temperance Act, which was in force during this period, unquestionably did mark down as unlawful (indeed \u201ccriminal\u201d if we adopt the recently sanctioned terminology) sales of liquor, except sales of specified categories to which those in question do not belong. Furthermore, by force of the statute, such transactions had no legal effect except for the protection of bona fide purchasers for value, and no moneys or other consideration, received for liquor sold, became the property of the receiver as against the payer, who could recover it back. The effect of the Act was undoubtedly to deprive such transactions of the character of sales in contemplation of law, except for a limited purpose, that is to say, for the purpose of protecting a bona fide purchaser for value. The point made is that they are consequently not sales within the meaning of the statute the Crown is seeking to enforce.\nThe answer to the contention appears to be this. The Ontario Act did not apply to all sales within Ontario. Sales made in course of interprovincial or foreign trade, and sales made to the Ontario government were not affected. Where transactions have taken place which contain all the elements of a sale according to the ordinary language of business, which, but for such a prohibiting statute as the Ontario Temperance Act, would have legal effect as sales, and the parties have treated them as such, the purchaser receiving the goods as purchaser, and the vendor receiving the purchase price as vendor, then, the vendor having received the price, which has passed into and become a part of his assets, the court will not for fiscal purposes inquire into the application or effect of a statute such as the Ontario Temperance Act.\nThe case is not precisely the same as, but is not easily distinguishable from, the decision of the Privy Council in Minister of Finance v. Smith[3]. Smith was an Ontario bootlegger and he was assessed for income derived from his bootlegging business. This Court held[4] that he was not assessable in respect thereof because by the provisions of the Ontario Temperance Act, above adverted to, every transaction in which he engaged in that business was an offence against the Ontario Temperance Act and punishable by imprisonment, and that no moneys received by him from such transactions, and consequently no apparent profits, made in the course of his business, were his property; and that it must be assumed that the Income War Tax Act was not intended to apply to incomes made up of the aggregate of apparent profits of such transactions. That judgment was reversed3 on grounds which were stated in the following passage of Lord Haldane\u2019s judgment:\nConstruing the Dominion Act literally, the profits in question, although by the law of the particular Province they are illicit, come within the words employed. Their Lordships can find no valid reason for holding that the words used by the Dominion Parliament were intended to exclude these people, particularly as to do so would be to increase the burden on those throughout Canada whose businesses were lawful. Moreover, it is natural that the intention was to tax on the same principle throughout the whole of Canada, rather than to make the incidence of taxation depend on the varying and divergent laws of the particular provinces. Nor does it seem to their Lordships a natural construction of the Act to read it as permitting persons who come within its terms to defeat taxation by setting up their own wrong. There is nothing in the Act which points to any intention to curtail the statutory definition of income, and it does not appear appropriate under the circumstances to impart any assumed moral or ethical standard as controlling in a case such as this the literal interpretation of the language employed. There being power in the Dominion Parliament to levy the tax if they thought fit, their Lordships are therefore of opinion that it has levied income tax without reference to the question of Provincial wrongdoing.\nI see no substantial ground for holding these considerations (held decisive in the circumstances of Smith\u2019s case) to be without application here.\nI now come to the critical question in the case, the question, namely, of the liability of the respondents in respect of sales tax. The statute is section 19 BBB (1) of The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended by 13-14 Geo., c. 70, s. 6, and 14-15 Geo. V, c. 68, s. 1 (1):\n19 BBB. 1. In addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Part, or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of five per cent, on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, including the amount of excise duties when the goods are sold in bond, which tax shall be payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him; and in the case of imported goods the like tax upon the duty paid value of the goods imported payable by the importer or transferee who takes the goods out of bond for consumption at the time when the goods are imported or taken out of warehouse for consumption.\nFor the purpose of calculating the amount of the consumption or sales tax, \u201csale price\u201d shall mean the price before any amount payable in respect of the consumption or sales tax is added thereto.\nProvided that the consumption or sales tax specified in this section shall not be payable on goods exported; * * *\nIt was urged by Mr. Rowell that the phrase \u201cconsumption or sales tax\u201d should be read distributively, the designation \u201csales tax\u201d being applicable only to the tax payable in respect of \u201csales\u201d under the first limb of the subsection. I doubt if a strict analysis of the language would justify this; the phrase \u201cconsumption or sales tax\u201d seems rather to be a designation of the tax levied in respect of sales of good produced or manufactured in Canada, as well as of that which affects the case of imported goods only. In my view of the section, I cannot convince myself that the point is of any importance. The statute, for the purpose of this particular head of taxation, classifies goods as those produced or manufactured in Canada, and those imported. It is only with the first of these categories that we are concerned, and as to goods coming within it, there is \u201cimposed, levied and collected\u201d a \u201ctax of 5% on the sale price\u201d of all such goods. This tax, it is declared, is to be payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale of the goods by him. The tax is described as \u201ca consumption or sales tax\u201d or according to the view suggested by the Crown a \u201csales tax\u201d. It does not seem to me to matter in the least whether you think of this tax as a tax upon a sale, or upon goods sold, or upon the price of goods sold. The rubric is \u201csales tax\u201d; and any such compendious label might serve if it be distinctly understood that it is only a summary way of indicating the tax, which becomes exigible, according to the terms, and under the conditions, laid down in this sub-section. The statute seems clearly enough to assume that the liability to pay is completely ascertainable, as well as completely constituted, at the time of the sale. And this seems to be the cardinal thing, for the purpose in hand. In terms, the taxes are payable in respect of all sales of goods produced or manufactured in Canada, and the phrase \u201ctax * * * on the sale price\u201d is employed by the principal clause. The proviso employs a different turn of expression and seems to treat the impost as a tax \u201cpayable on goods\u201d; and declares that it shall not be payable upon a designated class of goods, namely, \u201cgoods exported,\u201d but there is absolutely nothing in the proviso to indicate any qualification of the enactment in the principal clause that the tax is payable at the time of sale. On the contrary, the proviso explicitly and exclusively legislates for \u201cthe tax specified in this section\u201d. What it seems to effect is a qualification of the general terms of the principal clause, which literally embraces all sales of goods produced or manufactured in Canada (or all such goods when sold), and it does so by excluding from that comprehensive category \u201cgoods exported\u201d; that is to say, the seller, by force of it, is not to come under the liability declared by the principal clause if he sells, not goods manufactured or produced in Canada simply, but such goods \u201cexported.\u201d In other words, the proviso seems to exempt from the operation of the tax cases in which the goods are exported by the vendor in execution of the contract of sale. That seems to be the fair and reasonable meaning of the language, and there is no context by which the natural construction of the language is controlled.\nThis exposition of the statute is criticized on two distinct grounds. First, it is said that the principal clause in itself, read apart from the proviso, would only apply to sales complete in Canada and that on this reading the proviso is merely pleonastic. Such inelegancies are not uncommon in statutes; and the criticism, if well founded, would not appear to be a satisfactory reason for departing from what appears rather plainly to be the effect of the language the legislature has seen fit to employ.\nThe alternative construction was not very precisely formulated in argument; but those suggested seemed to be open to the practicable objection that the exigibility of the tax would under them remain indeterminate for a more or less indefinite period after the completion of the sale. The second objection is that this construction would be productive of great inconvenience in practice. The purpose of the exemption being, it is said, to reinforce Canadian producers in their competition in foreign markets, it could not have been intended to restrict the scope of it so narrowly as to make it non-available in, for example, such frequently occurring transactions as sales through a foreign agent stationed here. But the ingenuity of commerce can hardly be supposed to be so limited in range as to justify a doubt that such transactions would quite legitimately assume a form within the proviso. It is difficult to suppose that any considerable inconvenience would arise in such cases from putting the transaction in some such form. In any case, provision is made by sub-section 10 for a refund of the tax where domestic goods are exported under regulations prescribed by the Minister of Customs and Excise. Further, there is a general provision by which the Government has authority to remit taxes and other claims where justice requires it. The argument ab inconvenienti has little cogency.\nThe Crown contends that, on this construction of the statute, the liability of the respondents to sales tax is indisputable, and that contention seems to be unanswerable. It is not seriously open to dispute, in view of the repeated admissions of Low, that the sales proved were sales completed in Canada; nor indeed was this denied on the argument. Neither is it possible to argue, assuming there was export in fact, that such export was effected by the respondents in execution of the contract of sale. The contention of the respondents was that the sales proved were sales to individual purchasers, first to one, Grandi, and afterwards to one, Savard, and that it was part of the arrangement with them that the beer delivered to them should be exported to the United States; that the sales were export sales in the sense that the beer was under the control of the respondents until it was placed in a boat (always an undecked boat) and entered for export, and that these boats cleared for the United States under the eyes of the respondents\u2019 agents. Shipment, in these craft, it is said, took place under the superintendence of Low acting for the respondents, for whom it was vital in a business sense that the goods should reach the United States.\nAssuming for the moment the point of fact in favour of the respondents, they do not bring themselves within the proviso. The contract for sale was completed by delivery in Ontario. The export, on any assumption, was a subsequent fact, in respect of which the respondents assumed no responsibility. In the view above stated as to the effect of the statute, the liability thereupon attached, and there is nothing in the statute to indicate that export effected a defeasance of the obligation to pay the duty. The remedy of the respondents in such circumstances would be by way of the procedure laid down in sub-sec. 10.\nTurning to another branch of the argument, let it be allowed that export, in the circumstances indicated, if proved in fact, would be sufficient to bring the respondents within the benefit of the proviso. The onus is, of course, upon them, to establish export in fact, and one observation is necessary as to what that means. The claim of the Crown is a claim for taxes payable in respect of sales of beer during the period mentioned. It was incumbent upon the Crown to prove such sales, and that has been done. The respondents, if they are to escape taxation in respect of any shipment, must shew it was in fact exported. Generally speaking, export, no doubt, involves the idea of a severance of goods from the mass of things belonging to this country with the intention of uniting them with the mass of things belonging to some foreign country. It also involves the idea of transporting the thing exported beyond the boundaries of this country with the intention of effecting that. The concrete question here is, have the respondents shewn that these goods passed beyond the boundaries of Canada in course of transport to the United States, and that they did not return to this country. I assume that goods passing within American territory and there seized by American customs officials, were exported within the meaning of the proviso. As I shall point out, there are difficulties in reconciling with the ordinary notion of export, as commonly understood in commerce, and as contemplated by this statute, the kind of operation in which the respondents were engaged. But putting this aside for the moment, the respondents must face the question whether export in fact, in the sense just indicated, has been proved.\nThe case they put is this. They were engaged, they say, in exporting beer to the United States. The beer that they manufactured was a beer which found its principal market there, and their aim throughout was to secure and maintain that market. The persons to whom they sold beer were engaged in the business of selling in the United States, and large quantities of their beer were sold in Detroit and the vicinity. And they go so far as to argue that the onus is on the Crown to shew that the goods did not reach their intended destination.\nIt is first necessary to remember that the learned trial judge has found virtually that 17% of the beer with which we are concerned was not exported. The learned trial judge was evidently satisfied that the export entries produced were all that could be produced; and I think it is right to say that, considering the opportunities the respondents have had of searching for export entries, and considering the fact that such export entries were in their own possession, it must be found against them, that of the beer in question, not more was entered for export than that covered by the export entries proved. This of course is a very important fact. It is inconsistent entirely with the theory that the respondents were exclusively engaged in carrying on an export trade, and it is also irreconcilable with any assumption that they have laid before the court an accurate account of the disposition of their beer. There is, moreover, another state of facts of decisive import. The persons concerned in the export of these goods were engaged in a trade which involved the introduction into the United States, and the sale there, of things which could neither be lawfully introduced nor sold there, nor, except in circumstances not here at all relevant, could be the subject of property or juridical possession there. The boundary waters were patrolled by police whose duty it was to prevent the entry of such goods into the United States and to capture and confiscate craft endeavouring to effect such entry. The evidence abounds in indications that this is by no means a theoretical consideration. One witness, Dunford, says that in one month six craft owned by him personally, were captured and confiscated. It is also clear from the evidence that there was an extensive trade carried on in Ontario in beer of all kinds. In view of the non-production of the export entries, in relation to 17% of the goods in question, I do not think we can accept the suggestion that there was no market for lager beer in Ontario. The learned trial judge dwells upon the fact that rice beer is peculiarly an American taste, and infers that it is not sold in Ontario. The evidence in support of this does not proceed from disinterested sources and I wonder whether the boundary line so sharply affects the taste in illicit liquor. In truth, it is stated by Low that it was not until some time in 1926 that the respondents began the manufacture of rice beer, and we are not told at what date, if ever, in their brewery, rice beer wholly superseded malt beer. My conclusion is that, while there is some evidence of export, while no doubt beer was exported in large quantities, it is impossible to say judicially with regard to any particular shipment that that shipment reached the United States side and was landed there, or that it was captured by the United States preventive officers, or that it was returned to the Canadian side and sold there. I may add, that, I hope, as a judge of fact, I shall not be supposed to have divested myself of all knowledge of human habits and modes of thinking. The Crown argues that as the export alleged in this case involves, as already indicated, a deliberate violation of the United States laws to the extent pointed out, it cannot be treated as \u201cexport\u201d within the meaning of the statute. I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of the view that \u201cexport\u201d in the sense of the statute may be limited in such a way as to exclude export so entirely beyond the ordinary course of commerce. The considerations in favour of this view are so numerous and so obvious that they need not be dwelt upon. As against this contention, however, one must not overlook the point, very moderately put by Mr. Tilley, that the Crown is proposing that we overlook the criminal law from one point of view, while giving decisive effect to it, from another. Personally, I do not think this last contention, although far from being without force, is conclusive. It may well be that here, not for the first time in the history of human affairs, the way of the transgressor is hard. In my view, it is hardly conceivable that Parliament should contemplate such transport beyond the country as is now relied upon as constituting a ground of exemption. But after all we are only concerned with the meaning of the words used. It is risky to speculate upon Parliamentary motives, and I prefer not to express any opinion upon this point.\nThe only remaining point concerns interest and penalties. As for interest, we are governed by Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto[5]. As to the other point, I think we are bound to give effect to the precise words of the statute.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the case remitted to the Court of Exchequer to be dealt with in accordance with the views herein expressed. The respondents must pay the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McTague, Clark & Racine.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

The purchase price was $13,500, payable \u201c$2,700 in cash on the date hereof and the balance as follows: in four equal annual consecutive payments on the 26th days of June in each year hereafter of $2,700 each together with interest thereon at 7% per annum payable on the amounts of principal from time to time due on the same dates as the said instalments\u201d.\nThe defendant had previously paid a deposit of $200, and at the time of execution and delivery of the agreement he paid the sum of $2,500, making up the cash payment of $2,700 under the agreement. In July, 1926, he paid another sum of $2,700.\nThe defendant complained that the terms of payment were not expressed in the agreement according to the understanding of the parties on previous negotiations, and that the annual payments of $2,700 should have been blended payments of principal and interest. As to this point the trial judge held that, on the evidence, the defendant should be held to the terms expressed in the agreement.\nThe agreement contained a provision that unless the payments were punctually made \u201cthese presents shall be null and void and of no effect and vendor shall be at liberty to re-sell the said lands and all payments heretofore made are to be forfeited to the vendor as liquidated damages\u201d.\nIn May, 1927, the plaintiff sued, alleging default by defendant in payment of interest and taxes, and claimed recovery of possession of the land and cancellation of the agreement. In August, 1927, the plaintiff entered into an agreement to sell the land to other parties.\nThe defendant delivered his defence in October, 1927, and counterclaimed for repayment to him of all amounts paid on account of the alleged contract together with interest thereon.\nMcEvoy J., in his judgment, said that he was satisfied that the property was one of highly speculative value, and that the peculiar wording of the forfeiture clause was made for the purpose of providing what the parties considered would be a fair amount to be forfeited if the defendant should fail to carry out the agreement; and refused to relieve the defendant from the forfeiture of the cash payment of $2,700, in the circumstances revealed in the evidence. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the land and for a declaration that under the terms of the agreement the same had become null and void and of no effect. He held that the defendant was entitled to recover all amounts paid by him in excess of the sum of $2,700 together with interest thereon at 5% per annum from the date of the sale by the plaintiff to the other parties above referred to. He refused to make any allowance to the defendant for alleged improvements to the property, but did not charge him with any occupation rent.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Division against the judgment of McEvoy J., in so far as he held defendant entitled to recover any sum from the plaintiff. The defendant cross-appealed, asking that the amount awarded him by the judgment be increased to the whole amount paid by him with interest.\nThe Appellate Division, without written reasons, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and dismissed the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nOn conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by the Chief Justice, allowing the appeal to the extent of restoring the judgment of the trial judge. The Court was unable to construe the word \u201cheretofore\u201d in the agreement as meaning \u201ctheretofore\u201d as had been suggested. As to the construction to be put upon the words \u201cpayments heretofore made,\u201d the Court was of opinion, in view of all that took place, that they should be taken to include the $200 deposit and the $2,500 paid at the time of the execution of the agreement, making $2,700 in all, but nothing more.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs.\nS. L. Springsteen for the appellant.\nJ. H. Rodd K.C. for the respondent.\n",

Meagher, Liquidator of the Estate and Effects of Trans-Canada Theatres Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1930: March 4; 1930: April 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nMortgage\u2014Agreed bonus to mortgagee\u2014Right to bonus\u2014Interest Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 102, ss. 6 to 9.\nAppellant agreed to loan to T. Co., on mortgage of real estate, $30,000, at 7\u00bd% interest, but stipulated that, in consideration of making the loan, it should receive a bonus of $3,000, to which T. Co. agreed. The mortgage on its face was one for $30,000, bearing interest half\u2011yearly at 7\u00bd% per annum, and containing no reference to the bonus. Appellant issued its cheque to T. Co. for $28,505.55, being the $30,000 less deductions for taxes, insurance premiums and solicitors\u2019 costs, and took a cheque from T. Co. for the $3,000 bonus. Some payments were made, but T. Co. became insolvent, and, the mortgage being in arrear, appellant advertised the property for sale, and the liquidator paid off the amount owing, on the basis of the full face amount of the mortgage, without knowledge of the bonus. He sued to recover the $3,000, with interest paid thereon, invoking ss. 6 to 9 of the Interest Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 102.\nHeld, that he could not recover. The agreement for the bonus was legal and enforceable. The $3,000 bonus could have been recovered by appellant as a debt, not under the mortgage, but under the agreement for the loan, and the full $30,000 was advanced, whether the bonus be taken as paid by the mortgagor\u2019s cheque or by retention from the loan, unless the Interest Act applies (G. & C. Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co. Ltd., [1914] A.C. 25, Biggs v. Hoddinott, [1898] 2 Ch. 307, Mainland v. Upjohn, L.R. 41 Ch. D., 126, referred to). The Act does not apply; in view of the effect of the legislation in question, its application should foe confined to mortgages coming clearly within its description; and, taking the precise language of s. 6, it applies only to mortgages which on their face come within the description in that section. In this case there is nothing in the mortgage itself that brings it within such description. Moreover, there was no offence against the spirit of the Act; the mortgage did not fail to disclose to an ordinary borrower what he was to pay for the loan; and the aim of the Act is, not to limit the rate of interest or recompense that lenders may exact, but to prevent the collection of interest provided for in the mortgage by plans which do not disclose to the ordinary borrower the real rate of interest being exacted by such plans.\nThe far-reaching consequences involved, if the legislation in question were held applicable against a transaction such as that in question, also form a reason for confining its application to mortgages coming strictly within the description in s. 6.\nSinger v. Goldhar, 55 Ont. L.R., 267, and Re Brown, 61 Ont. L.R., 602, discussed; and the passage in the former case, at p. 271, where Canadian Mortgage Invt. Co. v. Cameron, 55 Can. S.C.R., 409, and Standard Reliance Mortgage Corp. v. Stubbs, 55 Can. S.C.R., 422, are cited, commented on.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 64 Ont. L.R. 600 (affirming judgment of Wright J., ibid, p. 221) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Wright J.[2], holding that the plaintiff, liquidator of the estate and effects of Trans-Canada Theatres Ltd., was entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $3,000 and interest thereon, the said $3,000 being the amount of a bonus paid to the defendant by the said Trans-Canada Theatres Ltd. on the making of a loan by the defendant to the said company secured by a mortgage on certain theatre premises in London, Ontario. The plaintiff relied on ss. 6 to 9 of the Interest Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 102. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and Hamilton Cassels for the appellant.\nR.V. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The respondent (plaintiff) is the liquidator of the estate of Trans-Canada Theatres Limited, which company, in March, 1922, applied to the appellant (defendant) for a mortgage loan of $30,000. The appellant agreed to make the loan, at 7\u00bd per cent. payable half yearly, but stipulated that, in consideration of making the loan, it should receive from the mortgagor a bonus of $3,000, which the mortgagor agreed to pay.\nThe mortgage is dated the 15th day of March, 1922, and on its face is a mortgage for $30,000, bearing interest half yearly at 7\u00bd per cent., and containing no reference to the bonus.\nThe appellant issued its cheque to the mortgagor for $28,505.55, being the $30,000 less some deductions for taxes, insurance premiums and solicitors\u2019 costs, and took a cheque from the mortgagor for the $3,000 bonus. Some payments were made, but the mortgagor became insolvent, and, the mortgage being in arrear, the mortgagee advertised the property for sale, and the liquidator, about the 12th March, 1925, paid off the amount owing, on the basis of the full face amount of the mortgage, without knowledge of the bonus having been paid.\nIn this action, the liquidator sues to recover the $3,000 with interest paid thereon up to 12th March, 1925, claiming to be entitled to such relief by virtue of the Interest Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 102.\nThe trial judge[3] gave judgment in favour of the liquidator for the amount claimed, and this judgment was sustained in the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[4], the five judges being unanimous.\nThe portion of the Interest Act referred to, relating to the questions involved, reads as follows:\n6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance. 7. Whenever the rate of interest shown in such statement is less than the rate of interest which would be chargeable by virtue of any other provision, calculation or stipulation in the mortgage, no greater rate of interest shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on the principal money advanced, than the rate shown in such statement.\n8. No fine or penalty or rate of interest shall be stipulated for, taken, reserved or exacted on any arrears of principal or interest secured by mortgage of real estate, which has the effect of increasing the charge on any such arrears beyond the rate of interest payable on principal money not in arrear.\n2. Nothing in this section contained shall have the effect of prohibiting a contract for the payment of interest on arrears of interest or principal at any rate not greater than the rate payable on principal money not in arrear.\n9. If any sum is paid on account of any interest, fine or penalty not chargeable, payable or recoverable under the three sections last preceding, such sum may be recovered back, or deducted from any other interest, fine or penalty chargeable, payable or recoverable on the principal.\nI am of opinion that the payment of the full amount of $30,000 by the mortgagee and payment of the bonus by the mortgagor\u2019s cheque, as arranged, had no different legal effect from payment of that bonus by simply deducting and retaining it from the loan. Mainland v. Upjohn[5].\nIf, as argued, the bonus became a debt owing by the mortgagor to the mortgagee as consideration for the loan outside of the mortgage, the liability would have been satisfied by retention of the amount from the mortgage moneys, just as any other debt that might have been owing by the mortgagor to the mortgagee might have been paid effectually in that way.\nIt was an unsettled question for a considerable period as to whether or not, in connection with a mortgage loan, there could be any other transaction between the mortgagor and the mortgagee that might secure any possible advantage to the mortgagee. The question is discussed at length in Mainland v. Upjohn (cited above)[6]; Biggs v. Hoddinott[7], and G. & C. Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co. Ltd.[8] The latter case, in the House of Lords, settles the question in the following paragraph, commencing at the bottom of p. 60 of the Report:\nMy Lords, after the most careful consideration of the authorities I think it is open to this House to hold, and I invite your Lordships to hold, that there is now no rule in equity which precludes a mortgagee, whether the mortgage be made upon the occasion of a loan or otherwise, from stipulating for any collateral advantage, provided such collateral advantage is not either (1) unfair and unconscionable, or (2) in the nature of a penalty clogging the equity of redemption, or (3) inconsistent with or repugnant to the contractual and equitable right to redeem.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the stipulation for the $3,000 bonus in this case was legal and capable of being enforced, unless the Interest Act is a bar.\nAs to all mortgages that fall within the description set out in section 6, the Act takes away from the mortgagee part of what the mortgagor has agreed to pay, and would be obliged to pay, were it not for the Act. This results, quite irrespective of whether or not the terms are fair under the circumstances and have been agreed to by the mortgagor with full knowledge and appreciation of their meaning and effect, and irrespective also of whether or not the mortgagor would be entitled to relief under the ordinary rules of law. The application of the Act therefore must be confined to mortgages that come clearly within the description set out in the Act itself.\nIn this case the mortgage is not by its terms made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, nor on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, and does on its face contain a statement showing the amount of principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated half yearly, not in advance. There is therefore nothing in the mortgage itself that brings it within the description set out in section 6. The argument is that, by evidence outside the provisions of the mortgage, it is established that it was agreed that the mortgagor should pay for the use of the money $3,000 in advance, in addition to the 7\u00bd per cent. half yearly mentioned in the mortgage, so that the real terms of the loan were an advance of only $27,000, for which the mortgagor was to pay, as interest, $3,000 in advance, together with 7\u00bd per cent. half yearly on $30,000, and thus the $3,000 of interest became blended with the $27,000 of principal under the covenant to pay $30,000. This, however, is begging the question, because it is only if the Act applies that the result follows. As already pointed out, the $3,000 that the mortgagor agreed to pay as consideration for the loan, whether regarded as interest or as something differing from interest, could have been recovered as a debt, not under the mortgage, but under the agreement for the loan, and the full $30,000 was advanced, whether the bonus is taken as paid by the mortgagor\u2019s cheque or by retention from the loan, unless the Act applies. To hold, therefore, that only $27,000 was advanced, it must first be determined that the Act does apply, and that any right to the $3,000 bonus was by its provisions prevented from arising.\nThe argument, if acceded to, involves very far-reaching consequences. An innocent third party purchasing such a mortgage as the one in question at its face value without notice would be entitled to collect on it only the actual amount advanced ($27,000 on this mortgage) and no interest. A very usual commercial transaction is, as pointed out on argument, a mortgage by a corporation on its assets, including real estate, made to a trustee to secure a bond issue, the bonds being sold to the public at a discount. The mortgagor in such a case receives only the face amount of the mortgage less the discount, and probably less also the charges and expenses of the trustee (mortgagee). It would be difficult to distinguish in principle such a mortgage from the one in question here. It might even be argued that the principle would extend to the common transaction of the retention by the mortgagee of the amount of his solicitor\u2019s bill for examining title and putting through the loan.\nThese considerations form an additional reason for confining the application of the Act to mortgages coming strictly within the description in section 6. Taking the precise language of this section, it is only where any principal money or interest is, by the mortgage itself, made payable on any of the plans mentioned, that the section applies, the words being \u201cis, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan,\u201d etc., and it is only to mortgages described in the preceding part of the section that the final provision and sec. 9 apply. The proper conclusion seems to be that the provisions of the statute apply only to mortgages which on their face come within the description set out in section 6.\nIf it be thought that this leaves open the door for making agreements similar in practical effect to the mortgages de- scribed in section 6 but not covered by it, Parliament can enlarge the scope of the Act, at the same time providing, as it may see fit, against any undesirable results such as I have indicated.\nThe Act, however, as it stands does not aim at controlling or limiting the rate of interest or recompense that lenders may exact for loans, and has no such effect if the last part of section 6 is complied with, except that no greater rate can be exacted than the rate mentioned in the statement thereby called for. The aim is to prevent the collection of interest provided for in the mortgage by plans described in section 6, which do not disclose to the ordinary borrower the real rate of interest being exacted by such plans. So far, however, as this Act is concerned, any rate of interest may be provided for by such plans, and enforced, if that rate is disclosed by a statement in the mortgage of the principal money and of the rate of interest, as provided in the latter part of section 6.\nThere is, therefore, in the mortgage in question, no offence against the spirit of the Act, because it does not fail to disclose to an ordinary borrower what he is to pay for the loan, though he might not realize what rate per cent. the $3,000 cash in advance, added to the 7\u00bd per cent., would amount to. The $3,000 cash payment might, however, give him a clearer idea of what the loan was costing him than if provided for in terms of an added rate of interest.\nThere were previous decisions of the Appellate Divisions, which the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division thought were binding on them in this case, but one of the learned judges of the Appellate Division suggests a doubt as to their correctness. The first of these is Singer v. Goldhar[9]. There the mortgage was for $4,700, to be repaid in eleven monthly instalments of $100 each, the balance to be paid at the end of twelve months. There was no provision for the payment of interest, but there was a provision that the mortgage, when executed and registered, should not bind the mortgagee to advance the money or, \u201chaving advanced a part, to advance the balance.\u201d The action was for foreclosure. There was no oral evidence, but it was admitted, for the purposes of the trial, that only $3,500 was advanced and that the mortgagor had paid back $3,800, and it was held that the mortgage was satisfied. This result does not conflict with what I have indicated above to be the proper construction to place upon the Act.\nThere is, however, some conflict in the reasons given, and as two cases in this court are cited in support of these reasons, I deem it well to call attention to the particular passage where this appears. It is at page 271, and is as follows:\nBut the essential (thing is that the statute requires that the mortgagor shall be informed on the face of the mortgage not merely of the amount which he is to pay, but also of the rate of interest which he is to pay on the money lent, and this was not done: Canadian Mortgage Investment Co. v. Cameron[10]; and Standard Reliance Mortgage Corporation v. Stubbs[11].\nIn these cases this court was dealing with mortgages which on their face had plans of repayment coming within the description in the first portion of section 6, and the question in dispute was whether or not the mortgage contained a statement in compliance with the provision of the latter part of that section. I have already pointed out that this latter part of the section applies only to mortgages that come within the description in the previous part of the section. The passage quoted above is dealing, as will be seen, with a mortgage which had no provision for repayment on any of the plans described in section 6. The two cases cited are authority for the proposition laid down only when it is limited to mortgages described in section 6.\nAnother case referred to is Re Brown[12]. The terms of the mortgage are not set out, but in the reasons for judgment it is stated that there is a provision in the mortgage which \u201cinvolves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments.\u201d This brings the mortgage within the description in the first part of section 6, and this case, therefore, does not seem to be in conflict with the construction which I have placed upon the statute.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Brock & Kelley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Co.\n[1] (1929) 64 Ont.

The County Court Judge disallowed deduction or exemption of items (1) and (2).

(In the city of Ottawa the assessment is made in the year preceding the year in which the tax is imposed, under the provisions of what is now s. 60 of the Assessment Act.)\nThe appellant is a company incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act, having its chief place of business at the city of Ottawa. Its business consists in part, in leasing, administering and managing certain real estate owned by it in the city of Ottawa, and in part, in buying and selling on its own account stocks, bonds and other securities.\nIn 1925 the company derived a gross revenue of $12,288 from its real estate business. This amount represented rent received from real estate exclusively, and consequently was exempt from income assessment. The company also received in the same year a gross revenue of $27,091, by way of dividends and interest upon stocks, bonds and other securities owned by it, including an item of $6,622, being dividends or interest upon certain securities held by the appellant in another company known as the Ottawa Building Co. Ltd., carrying on a real estate business in the city of Ottawa, and the appellant company claimed exemption from assessment for this item. In his stated case the County Court Judge assumed, for the purpose of the appeal, that the business carried on by the Ottawa Building Co. Ltd. was a real estate business exclusively, and that its revenues were derived from the rental of real estate exclusively.\nThe appellant company also claimed exemption by way of deduction from its gross revenue derived from stocks and bonds, an item of $8,004.83, which might be described as a \u201ccarrying charge.\u201d The item was set out in the company\u2019s return to the Assessment Commissioner as follows:\nInterest paid Bank of Montreal for money borrowed to pay off $120,000 of T. Ahearn unpaid balance of stock and bond purchase price and to buy $290,000 bonds of The Auditorium Ltd., interest on which bonds not being paid to us until 1st June, 1926\u2026 $8,004.83\nThe company also claimed deductions in respect of salaries and general expenses, hereinafter referred to as \u201coverhead expenses.\u201d\nThe County Court Judge held that the \u201ccarrying charge\u201d of $8,004.83 could not be deducted, and that exemption could not be claimed for the income derived from the Ottawa Building Co. Ltd., but in respect of certain \u201coverhead expenses\u201d he allowed a deduction, in fixing which he adopted as a guide the proportion which the company\u2019s revenue from rentals bore to its total revenue.\nHe submitted the following questions for the opinion of the Appellate Division: \u201cQuestion 1. Was I right in holding that no part of the sum of $8,004.83, in respect of the interest paid by them to the Bank of Montreal (and which I have designated as the \u201ccarrying charge\u201d), should be deducted from the gross receipts of $27,091?\n\u201cQuestion 2. Was I right in over-ruling the appellant company\u2019s claim to deduct the revenue derived by them from the Ottawa Building Company Limited, amounting to $6,622?\n\u201cQuestion 3. Was I right in holding that the amount of the allowance for so-called overhead expenses, should be fixed and determined in the proportion which the amount of their non\u2011taxable [taxable?] income bore to their total gross income?\n\u201cQuestion 4. If question 3 is answered in the negative, what amount if any, should have been deducted for overhead expenses, so-called?\u201d\nThe Appellate Division2 answered questions 1, 2 and 3, each in the affirmative (Orde J.A. dissenting as to the first question), and dismissed the company\u2019s appeal with costs.\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Appellate Division.\nBy the judgment of this Court now reported, the appeal was allowed as to question No. 1, which this Court held must be answered in the negative, the appellant being entitled to the deduction of $8,004.83 from its gross receipts of $27,091 for assessment purposes. The appeal was dismissed as to the other questions.\nRedmond Quain for the appellant.\nF.B. Proctor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This is an appeal by the Wallace Realty Company, Limited, against the judgment of the Second Appellate Divisional Court[2], answering in the affirmative certain questions submitted to them by a County Court Judge under s. 84 of the Assessment Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 238). Mr. Justice Orde dissented as to the first question only. The questions submitted by the learned County Court Judge are as follows:\n(1) Was I right in holding that no part of the sum of $8,004.83, in respect of the interest paid by them to the Bank of Montreal, (and which I have designated as the \u201ccarrying charge\u201d) should be deducted from the gross receipts of $27,091?\n(2) Was I right in over-ruling the appellant company\u2019s claim to deduct the revenue derived by them from the Ottawa Building Company, Limited, amounting to $6,622?\n(3) Was I right in holding that the amount of the allowance for so-called overhead expenses, should be fixed and determined in the proportion which the amount of their non-taxable income bore to their total gross income?\n(4) If Question 3 is answered in the negative, what amount, if any, should have been deducted for overhead expenses, so-called?\nWith regard to questions 2, 3 and 4, as was intimated to counsel in the course of the argument, the Court entirely agreed with the conclusions reached below for, substantially, the reasons on which those conclusions were based. Judgment was reserved, however, on the first question; and upon it we are unable to accept the view that prevailed in the Appellate Division.\nIn our opinion, the determination of this question rests entirely on the proper view to be taken of the definition of the word \u201cincome\u201d in s. 1 of the Assessment Act, which reads as follows:\n(e) \u201cIncome\u201d shall mean the profit or gain or gratuity, wages, salary, bonus or commission, or other fixed amount, or fees or emoluments, or profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be; and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and also profit or gain from any other source.\nWe are, with great respect, unable to understand how\nthe profit or gain\u2026 from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling,\nfor \u201cthe year ending on the 31st of December then last past,\u201d (s. 10 (2)) can be arrived at without deducting from the gross receipts of such trade, business or calling, during that year, expenditures legitimately incurred during the same year in the business for the purpose of earning such receipts as a whole. Mersey Docks v. Lucas, in the House of Lords[3], is authority for the general principle that in ascertaining the \u201cprofits and gains\u201d of any trade, manufacture, adventure or concern for the purpose of the Income Tax Acts, the taxpayer is entitled to deduct from the gross profits of his trade or business the expenses necessary to earn them.\nGresham Life Assurance Soc. v. Styles[4], another decision of the House of Lords, established that, in Income Tax Acts, the words \u201cprofits or gains\u201d are, where the context does not otherwise require, to be construed in their ordinary signification.\n\u201cProfits\u201d generally mean the gain which is made upon any business or investment when both receipts and payments are taken into the account. The People v. The Supervisors of Niagara[5].\nIn the Gresham case (ubi supra)4 the company was held entitled to deduct the amount paid out by it for annuities in ascertaining its profits or gains for income tax purposes. Lord Herschell said, at p. 323,\nWhether there be such a thing as profit or gain can only be ascertained by setting against the receipts the expenditure or obligations to which they have given rise.\nLord Fitzgerald said in Russell v. Town and County Bank[6],\n\u201cProfits\u201d I read on authority to be the whole of the incomings of a concern after deducting the whole of the expenses of earning them\u2014that is, what is gained by the trade.\nIn City of Kingston v. Canada Life Assurance Company[7], Boyd C., delivering the judgment of a Divisional Court, said,\n\u201cincome\u201d, as commercially used, means the balance of gain over loss in the fiscal year or other period of computation.\nThe Privy Council, in Lawless v. Sullivan[8], dealing with a taxing Act of the Province of New Brunswick (31 V, c. 36), held that\nThe tax imposed by s. 4 (of the statute) upon \u201cincome\u201d is leviable in respect of the balance of gain over loss made in the fiscal year, and where no such balance of gain has been made there is no income or fund which is capable of being assessed. There is nothing in the said section or in the context which should induce a construction of the word \u201cin- come,\u201d when applied to the income of a commercial business for a year, otherwise than its natural and commonly-accepted sense, as the balance of gain over loss.\nThere was no definition of the word \u201cincome\u201d in the Act.\nSir Montague Smith, in delivering the judgment of the Court, said, that the Chief Justice of Canada had erred in treating\nevery particular earning as irrevocably subject to taxation, so soon as it is received, though the period of assessment is postponed to the end of the fiscal year. But the Act does not impose a tax on each individual earning or gain, but on the income of the year, which can only be ascertained on taking an account for the whole year. (P. 379.)\nand he added,\nAgain, suppose a bank, in order to increase its resources for lending and discounting, takes up money, say at 4 per cent., and, owing to a fall in the rate of interest, can only employ it at 3 per cent., is the amount which the bank receives for interest and on discounts at 3 per cent. to be treated as taxable income, without reference to the loss it has sustained by borrowing at the higher rate? Their Lordships cannot think that, on a reasonable construction of the Act, these questions ought to be answered in the affirmative (pp. 379-80).\nand,\nSo, a trader who keeps a general store may gain on some of the articles in which he deals and incur losses on others. In these cases, though the losses balanced or exceeded the gains, and consequently no income was or could be received from the business of the year, it would follow from the construction contended for by the Respondents that the gain on the particular sales which yielded a profit would still be subject to taxation. Such a construction implies, as already observed, that the tax would attach on each sale producing profit, which is not the ordinary or fair meaning of a tax upon the income of the fiscal year (p. 380).\nIn Farmer v. Scottish North American Trust, Ltd[9], the House of Lords confirmed the decision of the Court of Sessions[10]. The Courts were there called upon to deal with the right of a tax\u2011paying investment company to deduct from its gross receipts interest paid to a bank on loans made by the bank to the company to enable it to buy certain securities which it was part of the company\u2019s business to deal in. Under the Income Tax Acts this interest was deductible if it was\nmoney wholly or exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of such trade.\nAt p. 127 of [1912] A.C., Lord Atkinson, delivering the unanimous judgment of the House of Lords, says, The interest is, in truth, money paid for the use or hire of an instrument of their trade, as much as is the rent paid for their office or the hire paid for a typewriting machine. It is an outgoing by means of which the company procures the use of the thing by which it makes a profit, and, like any similar outgoing, should be deducted from the receipts to ascertain the taxable profits and gains which the company earns. Were it otherwise they might be taxed on assumed profits when, in fact, they made a loss.\nBryon v. Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co., Ltd.[11], cited in General Auction Estate & Monetary Co. v. Smith[12], is, as Stirling J. points out, at p. 441 of the latter case, direct authority that the borrowing of money, as was done in the case at bar, is not in any sense an increase of capital.\nAt p. 970 of the report of Scottish North American Trust, Ltd. v. Inland Revenue[13], Lord Salvesen, presiding at the Court of Session, said,\nIf the question had arisen for the first time for decision it would appear to me to present no difficulty whatever. From an ordinary business point of view it seems preposterous to suggest that the money which a trader pays to a bank upon overdraft or on a secured loan forms part of the profits or gains of his business. Money which he receives by way of interest will no doubt, in the ordinary case, go to swell his profits; but how payments which in fact diminished his receipts should be regarded as in any sense part of his income it is at first sight very difficult to understand. * * * The interest which a trader pays to a bank with which he deals for financial accommodation is not in any sense payable out of profits. It is an ordinary claim of debt with which the whole assets of the company or trader are chargeable.\nAt p. 971, His Lordship quotes from the decision of the Lord President of the Court of Sessions in Inland Revenue v. Stewart & Lloyds[14], as follows:\n* * * it all depended on whether this expenditure was really an outlay to earn profit or was an application of profit earned.\nLord Salvesen goes on to say that\nAssuming that to be the test, it would certainly be a strange abuse of language to say that interest which a trader has had to pay on money borrowed for the purposes of his business is an application of the profits earned, when it may be that the interest exceeds the total amount of the profits.\nAs Lord Halsbury said in the Gresham case[15],\nThe thing to be taxed is the amount of profits and gains. The word \u201cprofits\u201d I think is to be understood in its natural and proper sense\u2014in a sense which no commercial man would misunderstand. * * * The tax is payable upon the profits realized, and the meaning to my mind is rendered plain by the words \u201cpayable out of profits.\u201d\nand at p. 316, Profits and gains must be ascertained on ordinary principles of commercial trading, and I cannot think that the framers of the Act could be guilty of such confusion of thought as to assume that the cost of the article sold to the trader which he in turn makes his profit by selling, was not to be taken into account before you arrived at what was intended to be the taxable profit.\nOf course, in construing English Income Tax decisions, one must always bear in mind that they depend largely upon the phraseology of the statutes under consideration; but I find it impossible to understand how, where the word \u201cincome\u201d is defined, as it is here, to be \u201cprofit or gain,\u201d not from any particular transaction, but from the whole business of an entire year carried on by the \u201cperson\u201d upon whom the tax, in respect to it, is to be imposed, such \u201cincome\u201d can be arrived at otherwise than by taking account of the receipts for the year and deducting therefrom at least all expenditure made in, and properly attributable to, the earning of such receipts as a whole, including therein expenditure made in the hope of earning receipts for the business or undertaking, although such hope has been disappointed.\nUpon the evidence before us, it seems perfectly clear that, whether or not any receipts were actually had from the particular investment in question, there was expended, during the year in question, in respect of that investment, and for the purpose of enabling the company to earn from it any receipts that might be had therefrom, by way of interest paid to the bank which advanced the money required by the company to enable it to secure the investment, the sum of $8,004.83. This sum was not paid out of profits, because, until it was paid and deducted, the profits of the business could not be known. On the other hand, it was paid to enable the company to obtain an investment within its powers, from which, in the ordinary course, some return might be expected. In order to arrive at the \u201cprofit or gain\u201d from the undertaking, or business of the appellant company for the year in question, it is certainly necessary to deduct from the receipts which it had from all sources, among other items, this sum of $8,004.83. As Lord Herschell said in the Gresham case (ubi supra)[16], Whether there be such a thing as profit or gain can only be ascertained by setting against the receipts the expenditure or obligations to which they have given rise.\nand, in the Russell case[17],\nThe profit of a trade or business is the surplus by which the receipts from the trade or business exceed the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning those receipts. That seems to me to be the meaning of the word \u201cprofits\u201d in relation to any trade or business. Unless and until you have ascertained that there is such a balance, nothing exists to which the name \u201cprofits\u201d can properly be applied.\nWe are for these reasons of the opinion that the appeal must be allowed with respect to Question number One.\nSince the appellant should have limited its appeal to the particular question in respect of which it has succeeded, as provided by s. 64 (2) of the Supreme Court Act, it should have only the costs of the appeal to this Court incurred in connection with that question, against which should be set off any costs incurred by the respondent in regard to the three questions upon which the appellant has failed. The appellant is entitled to its costs in the Appellate Division and before the County Court Judge.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Quain & Wilson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.B.

C, s. 573, s.1013, ss. 5.\nThe appellant, with two other men, was convicted of conspiring to commit an indictable offence. On appeal to the appellate court and to this court, the appellant\u2019s main ground was that one Boulanger, the chief witness for the crown, was in fact an accomplice; that the direction given by the trial judge was bad in law, as he had omitted to instruct the jury on what is an accomplice in law, and to warn them of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. Held that, after consideration of the charge as a whole and reading it in the light of the evidence, there had been misdirection by the trial judge and that the appellant was entitled to a new trial. There was in the record of the trial some evidence upon which the jury might have found that Boulanger had been, at some stage of the affair, an accomplice in the conspiracy charged against the three accused; and it appears by his charge that the trial judge thought this was a question of fact that should be submitted for the determination of the jury. Therefore it was the first duty of the trial judge to have instructed the jury as to what in law would constitute a man an accomplice, he should then have proceeded to direct their attention particularly to any facts in evidence which would serve to indicate Boulanger\u2019s complicity in the conspiracy at any stage thereof, and to submit to them the issue as to whether what he was proved to have done made him, having regard to the direction in law already given, an accomplice; he should then have instructed the jury that, if they concluded that the witness was, at any stage of the proceedings, an accomplice in the crime charged against the accused, there would be danger in convicting them of that crime upon his evidence standing alone and uncorroborated, although the law did not preclude their doing so.\nThe formal judgment of the appellate court directed that \u201cseparate judgments should be pronounced\u201d by the two dissenting judges of the court; and there was no direction that any other judgment be pronounced except that to be delivered by Cannon J., who was said to have been \u201cdesignated by the Chief Justice to pronounce judgment.\u201d But opinions, practically the same as that of Cannon J., were also delivered by the two remaining judges.\nHeld that such a practice is contrary to the imperative prohibition of ss. 5 of s. 1013 Cr. C, its impropriety having already been asserted by this court in Davis v. The King, [1924] Can. S.C.R. 522. Gouin v. The King, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 539; De Bortoli v. The King, [1927] Can.

The statement that \u201cthe rule requiring the corroboration of accomplice does not apply to * * * police spy\u201d means that the informer must have been connected with the matter from the first only as a police spy and not merely have \u201ccontinued\u201d as such.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, criminal side, and sustaining the conviction of the appellant upon an indictment of having conspired to commit an indictable offence.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported. Francois Lajoie K.C. and Leopold Pinsonnault for the appellant.\nValmore Bienvenue K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nJ Anglin C.J.C.\u2014The appellant (Vigeant), with two other men, Edgar Gari\u00e9py and Armand Tremblay, was convicted at the assizes at Three Rivers, Que., before the Honourable Mr. Justice Marchand, of conspiring to commit an indictable offence (Cr. C., s. 573). On appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) by all three from this conviction, several grounds were taken; but only the two following, as given in the judgment of Cannon J., were thought to require consideration by the court:\n(\u0192) Le t\u00e9moignage de Boulanger est dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un t\u00e9moignage de complice avant le fait, son t\u00e9moignage doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tel, et Boulanger seul incrimine Vigeant dans l\u2019offense reproch\u00e9e, soit de la conspiration.\n(g) La direction donn\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal aux jur\u00e9s est fausse en droit, alors que le juge n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 ce fait, le juge a omis de renseigner les jur\u00e9s sur ce qui peut \u00eatre un complice en droit et que c\u2019est une question de fait que les jur\u00e9s ont \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nIn the appellant\u2019s factum in this court these two grounds are treated as one and stated as follows:\nThe witness Boulanger was in fact an accomplice and the direction given by the president of the assizes was bad in law, and the learned judge having omitted to instruct the jury on what is an accomplice in law, and to warn them of the danger to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\nThis was the ground of dissent by Lafontaine C.J.Q. and L\u00e9tourneau, J. in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe formal judgment of that court\ndirects that it is convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by Chief Justice Lafontaine and Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau, two of the members of the court who dissent from the judgment of the majority for the reasons stated in their respective judgments.\nThere is no direction that any other judgment be pronounced except that to be delivered by Mr. Justice Cannon, who is said to have been\ndesignated by the Chief Justice to pronounce judgment.\nYet, notwithstanding the imperative prohibition of s.s. 5 of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code that\nno judgment with respect to the determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any other member of the court,\nsave that which has been sa directed to be pronounced, the record now before us contains opinions by two of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, whose views, speaking generally, coincide with those of Mr. Justice Cannon. We had occasion to remark on the impropriety of a similar practice in Davis v. The King[1]. See also Gouin v. The King[2]; De Bortoli v. The King[3].\nAfter fully considering the record of the trial, which occupied three days, we are of opinion that there was some evidence upon which the jury might (of course we do not at all mean that they should) have found that Boulanger, the chief witness for the Crown, had been, at some stage of the affair, an accomplice in the conspiracy charged against the three defendants. That the trial judge thought this was a question of fact that should be submitted for the determination of the jury is manifest from the following passage in his charge:\nVous aurez \u00e0 juger la conduite de Boulanger. D\u00e8s le premier ou deux d\u2019ao\u00fbt, il a averti le g\u00e9rant de la banque, que Ton tramait quelque chose contre lui. D\u00e8s le quatre ao\u00fbt il a rencontr\u00e9 le d\u00e9tective Jargaille, \u00e0 tous les jours apr\u00e8s \u00e7a, \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019il voit les accus\u00e9s, qu\u2019il avait connaissance de ce qu\u2019ils faisaient, il venait le dire au d\u00e9tective Jargaille. Il \u00e9tait en communication constante avec lui. Je ne crois pas que c\u2019est la conduite d\u2019un homme qui est complice dans la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un crime. Je vous laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la conduite de Boulanger, est la conduite de quelqu\u2019un qui avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un complot.\nIt was suggested in the course of argument by counsel for the Crown that the complicity on the part of Boulanger referred to in the above passage was not complicity in the conspiracy charged against the defendants but in some other crime, which, it was said, the evidence disclosed was in the contemplation of Boulanger and the defendants. After careful consideration of the charge as a whole and reading it in the light of the evidence it seems to us impossible to put that construction upon the language used; on the contrary, it seems clear that what the learned judge intended to leave to the jury by this passage in his charge was the question of Boulanger\u2019s complicity in the very conspiracy which was the subject of investigation.\nUnder such circumstances, the first duty of the trial judge was, in our opinion, to have instructed the jury as to what, in law, would constitute a man an accomplice. He should then have proceeded to direct their attention particularly to any facts in evidence which would serve to indicate Boulanger\u2019s complicity in the conspiracy at any stage thereof; and to submit to them the issue as to whether what he was proved to have done made him, having regard to the direction in law, already given, an accomplice. Nothing of this kind appears to have been done by the learned trial judge in this instance.\nHe should then proceed to instruct the jury that, if they concluded that the witness was, at any stage of the proceedings, an accomplice in the crime charged against the defendants, there would be danger in convicting them of that crime upon his evidence standing alone and uncorroborated; that the law does not preclude their doing so\u2014 indeed, they are at liberty to do so\u2014but that there is danger in basing a conviction on such uncorroborated evidence. If, after this warning, the jury had faith enough in the evidence given by the accomplice to convict, their verdict will not be set aside. The jury should not be told to acquit the prisoner; but they should be warned of the danger of convicting. Rex v. Royal[4]. Where there has been failure so to charge a jury with regard to the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice the conviction must be quashed. Gouin v. The King[5]; Brunet v. The King[6].\nA passage from the 3rd edition of Phipson on Evidence (1902), at p. 456, cited by Mr. Justice Cannon, which, at first blush, lends colour to the view taken by that learned judge, that the rule as to corroboration does not apply\nto the case of persons who have * * * continued in a conspiracy as agents of the police,\nin our opinion does not correctly state the law. Indeed, this misleading statement will be found to have been corrected in a later edition of Mr. Phipson\u2019s work, viz., the 6th edition of 1921, at p. 486, where it is said that\nthe rule requiring the corroboration of accomplices does not apply to * * * persons who have joined in or even provoked the crime as police spies.\nThe latter passage makes it clear that the informer must have been connected with the matter from the first only as a police spy and not merely have \u201ccontinued\u201d as such. This distinction underlies the observation made in Roscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence (15th Ed.) at p. 156. Here, as already stated, there was some evidence on which it was open to the jury to determine, if they were so advised, that, from the 22nd of July and up to the 2nd or 4th of August, the witness Boulanger was connected with the conspiracy charged against the defendants as a principal therein and not merely as agent provocateur, police spy or informer.\nOn the whole case, for the foregoing reasons and for those very clearly and succinctly stated by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec in his dissenting judgment, we are of the opinion that the conviction of the appellant Vigeant must be set aside and a new trial as against him ordered.\nThis conclusion is the more satisfactory, because, while not open for consideration in this court, owing to its not having been made a ground of dissent in the court below, we are disposed to think that a new trial might well have been ordered as to the present appellant by that court on the ground, there taken at bar, but not given effect to, that the learned trial judge had, contrary to the prohibition of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C, c. 59, alluded, in the course of his charge, to the fact that the present appellant had not given evidence in his own behalf, when he said,\nDeux des accus\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus et le troisi\u00e8me ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9; c\u2019\u00eatait son droit. Ce sera \u00e0 vous d\u2019agir en cons\u00e9quence. Big\u00e0ouette v. The King[7].\nIt is always very unfortunate that a new trial should become necessary because of some misdirection by a trial judge. It is especially so where such misdirection is due to inattention to matters of substance. It is sometimes not as fully realized as it should be that such errors on the part of those charged with the conduct of criminal trials not only put the country to very considerable expense but also lead to delays and uncertainties in the administration of justice which are deeply regrettable.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1924] Can.

Respondent.\n1929: December 9; 1930: April 10.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nIncome tax\u2014Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97\u2014\u201cIncome\u201d\u2014 \u201cProfit or gain\u201d from a trade or business\u2014Assessability for income tax of \u201cSaskatchewan Wheat Pool\u201d in respect of sums retained for \u201ccommercial reserve\u201d and \u201celevator reserve\u201d\nThe respondent, commonly known as the \u201cSaskatchewan Wheat Pool,\u201d was incorporated under the Saskatchewan Companies Act, and its incorporation was confirmed by c. 66 of 1924 (Sask.). Its primary object was to enable its members, who were Saskatchewan grain growers, to market their grain co-operatively. It was assessed for income under the Income War Tax Act (now R.S.C., 1927, c. 97) in respect of certain sums which it retained, from the gross returns of sale of grain, as a \u201ccommercial reserve\u201d and as an \u201celevator reserve.\u201d It objected to the assessment on the ground that the sums so retained did not constitute income within the Income War Tax Act.\nHeld, that it was not assessable in respect of the said sums. Having regard to the provisions of its memorandum and articles of association, of its confirming Act, and of its agreement with the grain growers (its shareholders), its employment of the reserves, and provisions made for return to the growers, it could not be said that the reserves assessed constituted taxable income of respondent within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act. The basis of chargeability to income tax is the operation of a trade or business giving rise to a profit. The respondent in respect of said reserves was merely machinery for collecting contributions from the growers, not as its shareholders but as subscribers to the fund, and for using those moneys for the growers\u2019 benefit and handing them back in some form or other when no longer required; and hence the reserves could not be said to be \u201cprofits or gains\u201d of respondent.\nNew York Life Ins.

APPEAL by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Audette J.) (1), allowing the appeal of the present respondent from assessments made against it for the years 1925 and 1926, under the Income War Tax Act, now R.S.C., 1927, c. 97. By the judgment of the Exchequer Court the assessments were declared to have been erroneously made and were set aside.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nC. F. Elliott K.C. for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. H. Milliken K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of Mr. Justice Audette[1], in which he held that the respondent corporation was not liable to pay a tax, under the Income War Tax Act (now R.S.C., 1927, c. 97), in respect of the sums of money assessed against it as income. Section 9 of the Act provides that,\nSave as herein otherwise provided, corporations and joint stock companies, no matter how created or organized, shall pay a tax, at the rate applicable thereto set forth in the First Schedule of this Act, upon income exceeding two thousand dollars\nThe whole question here is, were the moneys, in respect of which the respondent was assessed for each of the years 1925 and 1926, part of its income for the year in question?\nThe respondent (commonly known as the \u201cSaskatchewan Wheat Pool\u201d) is a body corporate, having been incorporated under the Companies Act of Saskatchewan on August 25, 1923, which incorporation was confirmed by statute (c. 66 of 1924). The primary object of its incorporation was to enable its members, who were Saskatchewan grain growers, to market their grain co-operatively. Its authorized capital is $100,000 divided into 100,000 shares of one dollar each. Shares in the corporation can be issued only to Saskatchewan grain growers, and of those, only to such as enter into an agreement with the company for the marketing of grain in the form required by the company.\nIn this agreement the grower applies for one share of the corporation\u2019s capital stock and the corporation agrees to issue it to him. Each shareholder has only one vote and voting by proxy is prohibited. The governing body consists of sixteen directors, one from each of sixteen districts into which, for the purposes of the corporation, the province is divided. The shareholders in each district, from among themselves, elect ten delegates, and these delegates elect a director to the Board of Directors. The 160 delegates constitute the voting body at the annual meeting. Both the memorandum of association, and the statute confirming the same, contain the following provision:\u2014\nNo dividend shall be declared or paid to the shareholders of the company on the shares held by them in the company.\nBy its memorandum of association the objects of the respondent corporation are, inter alia, declared to be:\u2014\n1. To carry on the business of buying, selling, marketing and exporting of grain either as principal or agent.\n2. To enter into any contract whatsoever for or incidental to the co-operative marketing of grain.\n3. To act as agent or broker for its shareholders.\n4. To operate a pool for grain received or handled by the corporation.\n5. To make advances and payments from time to time on all grain delivered.\n6. To enter into and carry into effect all and every agreement for the co-operative marketing of grain and, particularly, agreements with growers of grain in the province of Saskatchewan, a copy of which agreement is attached to the memorandum of association.\n7. To distribute or pay to any person or persons who have held a contract or contracts with the company on the basis, so far as practicable, of their contributions, the moneys deducted or withheld from the proceeds of all or any commodity handled for such contract holder.\nOf the articles of association reference need be made to one only, which provides that the business of the company is to be conducted in such a manner that, so far as possible, no profits will be taken from any member of the company on the marketing of his grain. In the Marketing Agreement the respondent is referred to as the \u201cAssociation\u201d and, for convenience, I shall continue that designation.\nBy clause 8 of the agreement the grower appoints the Association his sole and exclusive agent, factor and mercantile agent within the meaning of \u201cThe Factors Act\u201d of Saskatchewan and also his attorney in fact with full power and authority in its name, in the name of the grower, or otherwise,\n(a) to receive, transport and market the wheat delivered to it by the grower;\n(c) to borrow on its own account on the security of the grain delivered and to exercise all rights of ownership without limitation in respect of such grain;\n(d) to retain and deduct from the gross returns from the sale of the wheat delivered to it by the growers, the amount necessary to cover all operating costs and expenses, and all other proper charges, and,\nin addition, the Association may deduct such percentage, not exceeding 1% of the gross selling price of the wheat as it shall deem desirable as a commercial reserve to be used for any of the purposes or activities of the Association;\n(\u0192) to deduct from the gross returns from the sale of all wheat handled by the Association for growers * * * a sum out of each grower\u2019s proper proportion thereof, not exceeding two cents per bushel and to invest the same for and on behalf of the Association in acquiring either by construction, purchase, lease or otherwise such facilities for handling grain as the directors of the Association may deem advisable or in the capital stock or shares of any company or association formed or to be formed for the purpose of so erecting, constructing or acquiring such facilities and to sell or otherwise dispose of any such investment and re-invest the proceeds thereof in like manner.\nThis latter deduction is commonly known as the \u201cElevator Reserve.\u201d\nClause 9 reads as follows:\u2014\n9. Any unused balance of reserves and surpluses shall stand in the name of the Association and be owned by the members and shall, when in the opinion of the directors a distribution should be made or upon a dissolution of this Association, be divided in the same proportions in which it was contributed by the members.\nClause 16 provides for an advance to be made to the grower on delivery of his grain and for payment of the proceeds thereof to him when sold, less advances already made, deductions retained as provided for in the contract, and marketing expenses. It also provides that the grower\u2019s whole right to the proceeds of the grain \u201cshall be to receive the initial advance and his due proportionate share of the moneys realized from the operation of the pool, less the deductions herein provided for.\u201d\nBy clause 26 the grower admits that the marketing agreement is a contract of agency coupled with a financial interest, and, by clause 27, any loss which the Association may suffer on account of inferior grade, quantity, quality or standard or condition at delivery, shall be charged against the grower and deducted from his net returns.\nIt is only the sums retained by the Association as a Commercial Reserve and as an Elevator Reserve that we are concerned with in this appeal.\nOut of the proceeds of the grower\u2019s wheat the Association made the following deductions, at uniform rates pursuant to clause 8 (d) and 8 (\u0192):\n1925 (wheat operations)\nCommercial Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 756,462 65\nElevator Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 958,238 32\n$1,714,700 97\n1926 (wheat operations)\nCommercial Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 907,113 90\nElevator Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,594,267 53\n$3,501,381 43\nIn addition to the deductions made in 1926 in respect of wheat operations, there were certain sums retained by the Association out of the proceeds of the sale of coarse grain. Some 30,000 out of 80,000 growers, who held agreements for the marketing of wheat, also held agreements relating to the marketing of coarse grains. These latter agreements authorized the Association to sell the coarse grains delivered to it by the growers and to retain out of the proceeds a portion thereof, not exceeding certain specified percentages, as a commercial reserve, and as an elevator reserve. The amounts deducted in 1926, under the coarse grains agreements, were as follows:\u2014\nCommercial Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 76,670 28\nElevator Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 157,498 35\nFor these sums retained by the Association in the years 1925 and 1926, it was assessed, and a tax, at the rate prescribed in the schedule, was levied thereon. The Association refused to pay the taxes levied, on the ground that the sums deducted as reserves did not constitute income within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act.\nBefore inquiring into the question as to whether or not these reserves constitute taxable income, it may be useful to ascertain how they were employed by the Association, and what provision, if any, was made for their return to the growers from the proceeds of whose grain they were taken.\nDealing first with the elevator reserve, which is by far the larger amount, it will be observed that the agreements provide that this reserve is to be invested, on behalf of the Association, in procuring facilities for handling the grain, or in the capital stock of any company formed for the acquisition of such facilities. The evidence shews that the Association organized and incorporated the Saskatchewan Pool Elevators Limited, of which it owns all the capital stock.\nTo the Pool Elevators Limited the Association handed over all the moneys retained by it as an elevator reserve and the same were expended in acquiring elevator facilities.\nThe moneys retained as a commercial reserve were employed, as follows:\u2014\n1. In paying the expenses of the Association from the beginning of each crop year until the grain of the year was sold and a deduction made from the sale proceeds to cover the operating expenses.\n2. In advances to the Pool Elevators Limited.\n3. In advances made from time to time to the Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, commonly called the Central Selling Agency. This corporation was organized by the wheat pools of the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and was given charge of the actual selling operations of the three pools.\nIn ascertaining the final destination of these reserves regard must be had to clause 29 of the agreement, which provides that the Association shall receive the sale proceeds of the growers\u2019 grain and shall\naccount and settle for any moneys so received by crediting the same to the Grower on the Books of the Association, which moneys, less all deductions as herein provided, shall be distributed pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. The whole marketing operation is as follows:\u2014\nThe grower delivers his grain to the country elevator, either a Line elevator or an elevator belonging to the pool. By an arrangement made by the Association, prior to the commencement of the delivery of grain, the grower receives in cash, from the elevator at which his grain is delivered, a certain price per bushel fixed by the Association. The grain is then forwarded to a terminal elevator operated by the Central Selling Agency, and the documents of title sent to the agency\u2019s head office. Upon receipt thereof the Selling Agency remits to the country elevator the amount advanced by it to the grower. The Central Selling Agency from time to time markets the grain, and, out of the proceeds thereof, it retains the sums which it paid to the country elevator for moneys advanced to the growers. The balance it remits to the Association. The Association credits on its books each individual grower with his proportionate share. This it does from time to time as sales are made. One or more interim payments are made to the growers. When the grain has all been sold and the proportionate share of each grower in the proceeds determined, the Association calculates the amount which, under the marketing agreement, should be deducted for, (1) operating expenses; (2) commercial reserve, and (3) elevator reserve. The difference between the aggregate of the deductions, plus payments already made, and the amount credited to the grower in the books of the Association, is remitted to him as a final payment. After the deductions are made a notice is sent to the grower informing him of the amounts retained out of the proceeds of his grain for the commercial reserve and for the elevator reserve. Interest at 6% has been paid each year by the Pool Elevators Limited on the elevator reserves handed over to it, and, at the expiration of the agreement (1927) this interest was distributed among the growers in proportion to the amount deducted from each for the elevator reserve. The only distribution that has been made of the principal moneys of the two reserves has been in cases where the grower died, leaving his family in not very affluent circumstances. In 119 of these cases the directors have remitted, to the personal representatives of the deceased grower, the moneys retained by it out of the proceeds of his grain, except that retained to cover operating expenses.\nIn view of these facts can it properly be said that the amount of these two reserves formed part of the income of the Association within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act?\nOn the argument it was contended that the Association received and marketed the grain merely as agent and that it held the proceeds thereof in trust for the growers in whom the beneficial title always remained. On this view the moneys comprising the reserves would not be moneys belonging to the Association and, therefore, would not be taxable. In my opinion the marketing agreement and the confirming Act do more than simply create the relationship of principal and agent, or mercantile agent, in the ordinary sense, between the growers and the Association. That relationship the agreement, without doubt, creates, but, in addition thereto, the property in the grain and in the proceeds is vested in the Association and all rights of ownership thereto without limitation are exercisable by it, for all or any of the purposes set out in the agreement. One of the purposes is to settle all claims for damages or otherwise that may arise in connection with the exercise by the Association of any of the powers or authority granted by the agreement. If, therefore, the reserves assessed in this case could properly be considered as assessable income of the Association, if no question of agency were involved, they can still be considered as income and the tax thereon a claim which the growers have authorized the Association to pay. Can these reserves properly be said to be \u201cincome\u201d?\nThe definition of \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of the Act is found in section 3 thereof. As applied to this case \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain directly or indirectly received by a person from any trade or business, whether such profit or gain is distributed or not.\nIn revenue cases it is a well recognized principle that \u201cregard must be had to the substance of the transactions relied on to bring the subject within the charge to a duty and the form may be disregarded.\u201d Pollock M.R., in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Eccentric Club, Ltd.[2].\nIt is also well established that once the sum assessed has been ascertained to be profits of a trade or business, neither the motive which brought these profits into existence nor their application when made is material. Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Lucas[3]. Nor does it signify that they were obtained by a company through trading with its own members as customers. Although a company may be given very wide powers, \u201cits business is the business of doing what is necessary to carry out the objects which it elects to carry out.\u201d Lord Sterndale M.R., in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Korean Syndicate, Ltd.[4].\nThe business which the Association in this case elected to carry out was the marketing of grain for those who had entered into contracts with it for that purpose. Was that business being carried on for profit?\nWhat is considered to be a profit or gain arising from a trade or business has been discussed in numerous cases. In Gresham Life Assurance Society v. Styles[5], Lord Herschell said:\u2014\nWhen we speak of the profits or gains of a trader we mean that which he has made by his trading. Whether there be such a thing as profit or gain can only be ascertained by setting against the receipts the expenditure or obligations to which they have given rise.\nIn Ryall v. Hoare[6], Rowlatt J. said:\u2014\nWithout giving an exhaustive definition, therefore, we may say that where an emolument accrues by virtue of service rendered whether by way of action or permission, such emoluments are included in \u201cprofits or gains.\u201d\nThe test to be applied laid down in Californien Copper Syndicate v. Harris[7], is whether the amount in dispute was\na gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making.\nThis principle was approved by the Privy Council in Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust, Limited[8], and by the House of Lords in Ducker v. Rees Roturbo Development Syndicate Ltd.[9]. On the argument numerous cases were cited to us for the purpose of shewing when a company\u2019s surplus would be considered \u201cprofits or gains of a trade or business\u201d and when it would not.\nThe cases of Last v. London Assurance Corporation[10], and New York Lije Insurance Co. v. Styles[11], were cited respectively on either side. In the former case an insurance company, whose shareholders and policyholders were two different bodies, issued participating policies, according to the terms of which at the end of each quinquennial period the \u201cgross profits\u201d of such policies were distributed thus: Two-thirds were returned by way of bonus or abatement of premiums to the holders of such policies, and one-third went to the company. It was held by the House of Lords that the two-thirds returned to the policyholders were profits or gains to the company, and, therefore, taxable. In the latter case the company had no shares or shareholders. The only members were the holders of participating policies, each of whom was entitled to a share of the assets and liable for losses. The policyholders paid in premiums an amount in excess of the sums required for expenses and liabilities, and this excess of payment was returned to the policyholders at the end of the year in the shape of a cash reduction from future premiums or an addition to the amount of the policy. It was held that the amounts returned to the policyholders were not profits made by the company. The distinction between these two cases made by their Lordships was, that in Last\u2019s case the company was making profits, and intending to make profits, not only from its own members but from others, which profits were divided between the participating policyholders and the shareholders of the company, which were entirely different bodies; while in the Styles case the individuals had associated themselves together for mutual insurance, that is to say \u201cthey contributed annually to a common fund out of which payments were to be made in the event of death to the representatives of the persons thus associated together. These persons were alone the owners of the common fund and entitled to its management. It was only in respect of his membership that any person was entitled to be assured a payment upon death.\u201d In regard to these facts Lord Herschell, at page 409 of the report, uses this language:\u2014\nCan it be said that the persons who are thus associated together for the purpose of mutual insurance, carry on a trade or vocation from which profits or gains accrue to them? I cannot think so.\nAt page 394 Lord Watson laid down the following:\u2014\nWhen a number of individuals agree to contribute funds for a common purpose, such as the payment of annuities, or of capital sums, to some or all of them, on the occurrence of events certain or uncertain, and stipulate that their contributions, so far as not required for that purpose, shall be repaid to them, I cannot conceive * * * why contributions returned to them should be regarded as profits.\nSee also judgment of Vaughan Williams L.J., in Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States v. Bishop[12].\nThe case of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Sparkford Vale Co-operative Society Limited[13], is clearly distinguishable: there the company bought milk from its own members and sold it to non-members, but, as Rowlatt J. pointed out in his judgment, the company (so far as appeared from the facts shewn), bought the milk outright and was in no sense a consignee for sale for its own members. Then it sold the milk to the public on its own account, and the difference between what it paid and what it received was profit to the company.\nIn Fraser Valley Milk Producers\u2019 Association v. Minister of National Revenue[14], the facts, in some respects, resemble those at bar. There is, however, this vital distinction: that in that case the contract provided for the payment of cash dividends on the paid up shares; it also provided that for the moneys retained by the association, under the contract, for purchasing facilities and equipment and so applied, paid up shares were to be issued and distributed to the purchasers in proportion to the butter fat value supplied by each. There it was held that the dividends received by the shareholders were received by them as shareholders. The dividends were, therefore, moneys paid out of profits, and, as profits, were assessable.\nTwo other cases were cited on behalf of the Minister. In Liverpool Corn Trade Association, Limited v. Monks[15], an incorporated company with a share capital of \u00a36,000, provided a corn exchange and marketing facilities for its members, who were all engaged in the corn trade. Every member was required to subscribe for one share. Members paid an entrance fee and an annual subscription. Non-members might use the marketing and other facilities but they paid therefor a higher subscription than was charged against members. The company could, and at one time did, declare a dividend on its share capital. The articles of association provided that the directors might set aside out of the profits a reserve fund. This fund, in 1921, amounted to \u00a374,000. It was held that the company\u2019s operations resulted in profits which were taxable. This case was distinguished from the Styles case[16] by the fact that the company had a share capital on which dividends might be paid if declared, and by the fact that both members and non-members paid individually for the services rendered and facilities provided. One of the purposes of the association, therefore, was the making of a profit on these services and facilities.\nA somewhat similar case was that of Cornish Mutual Assurance Co. Ltd v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[17]. There the appellant was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. It had no share capital and carried on a mutual fire insurance business. Each policyholder became a member on the issue to him of a policy. The revenue of the company was derived from: (a) entrance fees payable by members on taking up policies; (b) calls on members at the discretion of the directors, and (c) interest on investments. These funds were applicable by the directors to the general expenses of the company including payment of claims under its policies. The company was assessed in respect of the surplus arising from the contributions of its members. The House of Lords held that, although a mutual organization, the association carried on a trade or business and that such surplus was taxable. It was held taxable because, by a statute passed in 1920, it had been enacted that\nprofits shall include in the case of mutual trading concerns the surplus arising from transactions with its members. The issuing of insurance policies by the association and the payment of fees and calls in respect thereof, was, without doubt, a transaction between the association and its members. The question however, was, did it arise from mutual trading? Their Lordships were of opinion that the term \u201cmutual trading concerns\u201d in the Act was intended to include such an association as the Cornish Mutual Company. A perusal of the judgment of the Lord Chancellor, rather indicates, in my opinion, that, but for the statutory provision (which has no counterpart in our Act), the surplus contributed by the members in that case might not have been considered taxable income.\nThe only other case to which reference need be made is Jones v. S. W. Lancashire Coal Owners Association Limited[18]. In that case a mutual association was formed the sole activity of which was the indemnifying of its members, who were coal owners, against liability for compensation in respect of fatal accidents to workmen. The members of the association were the members protected by it, every member being liable to contribute a sum, not exceeding \u00a325, in the event of a winding-up. The association formed a general fund by making calls upon members proportionate to the wages paid them for the time being, and the balance of the ordinary call fund was transferred to the reserve fund into which the extraordinary calls were also paid. Upon retirement a member could get back in cash a portion of his share in the reserve fund but, apart from that, members had no right at all to the cash in the reserve fund. It was held that the surplus, in respect of which the association was assessed, was not a profit made by it, as the association was mere machinery for the purpose of enabling members to insure themselves. In his judgment, Rowlatt J., at page 404, said:\u2014\nAs I understand it, all that the company does is to collect money from a certain number of people and apply it for the benefit of those same people, not as shareholders in the company, but as the people who subscribed it. As I understand the New York case (supra),[19], the decision was that in such a case there is not any profit; it does not matter whether these people are called members of the company, or participating policyholders, or anything else; all that the company is doing is to collect money from people for those people, to do certain things for them, and let them have the balance of their profit in some form or other, and there is no profit to the company in that transaction. If the people do it for themselves there is no profit. If they incorporate a legal entity to do it for them, and to provide the machinery for them, there is equally no profit * * *\nand at page 405:\u2014\nI think the broad principle there laid down was that, if the interest in the money does not go beyond the people who subscribe it, or the class of people who subscribe it, then, just as there is no profit of any sort earned by the people themselves, if they act for themselves, so there is none if they get a company to act for them.\nJust what is the line which separates the two classes of cases is difficult to define. Each case must depend upon its own particular facts. Although the Association has a share capital, the prohibition against paying a dividend thereon shews that it is not a profit making scheme for the Association or its shareholders. That of itself might not be conclusive. The material before us, however, shews that the reserves assessed were not contributed by the growers as payment for services rendered by the Association. Nor did they result from any trading between them, they were rather advances made by the growers to their agent to enable it to carry out the provisions of the marketing agreement. These advances were made on the understanding that, until, in the opinion of the agent, they were no longer required for the purposes for which they were advanced, they need not be returned to the growers, but, that, until they were returned, each grower would have a credit on the books of the Association for the amount contributed by him. No one but a grower who contributed to the reserves was entitled to a credit in respect thereof, or to participate in their distribution when distributed. Stress was laid by counsel for the Minister on the fact that there was no obligation upon the Association to distribute the reserves among the growers either in cash or in specie. The answer to this contention seems to be that there is no necessity for any contractual or statutory obligation. As the growers who contribute the reserves have, in their capacity as shareholders who elect the directors, the absolute control and management of the Association, it must be amenable to their will without any express provision to that effect. As the basis of chargeability to income tax is the operation of a trade or business giving rise to a profit, and as the Asso- ciation in this case in respect of the reserves assessed is merely machinery for collecting contributions from the growers, not as shareholders of the Association but as subscribers to the fund, and for using those moneys for the benefit of the growers and handing them back in some form or other when no longer required, I am of opinion that the sums assessed cannot properly be said to be \u201cprofits or gains\u201d of the Association. The appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. F. Elliott.\nSolicitor for the respondent: O. M. Biggar.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

At conclusion of the evidence for plaintiffs, the trial judge withdrew the case from the jury and dismissed the action. An appeal to the Appellate Division, Ont., was dismissed, on equal division (36 Ont. W.N. 268). On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: There were facts in evidence from which negligence of defendants might be reasonably inferred by a jury; it was for the jurors to say whether from those facts negligence ought to be inferred (Metropoli- tan Ry. Co. v. Jackson, 3 App. Cas., 193, at p. 197). Therefore the case should not have been withdrawn from the jury, and there must be a new trial.\nThe railway line had formerly been operated by a provincial company. By 9-10 Geo. V, c. 13 (Dom.), the line was declared (as the work of a \u201cconstituent and subsidiary company comprised in the Canadian Northern System\u201d) to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. At the trial there was tendered as evidence for plaintiffs, and rejected as inadmissible, an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, made in 1917, when the line was under provincial jurisdiction, and made under s. 123 of the Ontario Railway Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 185. The order was expressed to be made \u201cfor the protection of the public,\u201d after the Board had \u201cinspected\u201d the crossing and had instructed its engineer to inspect it and report and he had done so. It provided a rule concerning the safety of persons using the crossing.\nHeld: The order had no continuing effect, once the line became (under the declaration aforesaid) a Dominion railway. Secs. 7 and 2 (28) of the Dominion Railway Act, 1919, (9-10 Geo. V, c. 68) were especially discussed in this regard. The question of precautions at highway crossings was one specially dealt with by ss. 308, 309 and 310 of that Act, to which, by the declaration, the line immediately became subject; these sections applied to the exclusion of any provincial statute and, a fortiori, of any provincial regulation; they were inconsistent with the order in question.\nHeld, further, however, that, while the order was not admissible as a rule enforceable against the defendant company, it was (subject to the qualification infra) admissible as affording evidence of an adjudication by a competent tribunal upon the dangerous character of the crossing\u2014a matter of public concern\u2014at the time the order was pronounced, and presenting a standard of reasonableness upon which a jury might act (Pim v. Curell, 6 M. & W., 234, at p. 266; Neill v. Duke of Devonshire, 8 App. Cas., 135, at p. 147; Sturla v. Freccia, 5 App. Cas., 623; Phipson on Evidence, 6th ed., p. 355; Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., pp. 442-3, 1213). But, in such cases, if, as a result of a subsequent enquiry made by the same or a similarly competent public authority, such an order were set aside or superseded, it would cease to have any evidentiary value; that would be the case here should it be established at the trial that, since the railway came under federal control, the Board of Railway Commissioners made an enquiry of its own and concluded that, by providing for other and different means of safety, or simply by following the general railway law, the crossing was protected to its satisfaction. It would also be open to defendants to shew that, since the order in question was made, the conditions at the crossing had ceased to be substantially the same as at that time.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], dismissing (on equal division of the court) the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Wright J. (sitting with a jury) who at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a non-suit and dismissed the action. The action was brought under the Ontario Fatal Accidents Act to recover damages for the deaths of certain persons, occupants of an automobile, resulting from a collision between an electric train of the defendant company and the said automobile, which collision the plaintiffs alleged was caused by the negligence of the defendant company, its servants or agents, and of the defendant Brooks, who was the motorman of the train. The non-suit was granted on the ground that there was no evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find a verdict against the defendants. The material facts of the case and the issues in question, so far as was necessary for the disposition of the present appeal, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and a new trial ordered, the costs of the abortive trial to abide the event of the new trial.\nJ.R. Robinson and J.L. Kemp for the appellants.\nR.E. Laidlaw for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C., and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ., was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014Walter Littley and three of his children were killed on the 18th day of June, 1928, in a collision between his automobile and an electric train operated by the respondent, Canadian National Railway Company, on which the respondent, Mansford Brooks, was the motorman.\nThe accident occurred on a level crossing, where the electric railway line intersects Dundas street, on the hill above Lambton, in the province of Ontario.\nThe appellants are the widow and an infant son of Walter Littley. They brought an action against the company and the motorman, under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act (ch. 183 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1927). At the trial, after the appellants had concluded their evidence, the case was withdrawn from the jury and the presiding judge dismissed the action. Upon appeal, a motion to set aside the judgment and for a new trial was dismissed on an equal division in the judges of the Appellate Division[2].\nThe judgment of the trial judge complained of had held that the evidence of negligence in the record was not sufficient to be submitted to the jury. So far as at least concerned the company, this judgment was sustained by all the judges of appeal; but two of them were of the opinion that the result at the trial was \u201cdue, in part at least, to the rejection of evidence by the learned trial judge, with whose ruling (they were) not in accord\u201d; and they would have directed a new trial.\nWe propose to discuss, first, the sufficiency of the evidence actually put in by the plaintiffs and, then, the admissibility of what was rejected by the trial judge.\nOne of the allegations of negligence against the defendants was the \u201cfailure to give an adequate warning by sounding whistle, horn or bell, of the approach of the electric train.\u201d\nThe railway is subject to federal legislation and, under the Railway Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 170), when the train was approaching the highway crossing at rail level, the engine whistle had to \u201cbe sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing\u201d (s. 308). In addition to that\u2014and that might indicate the peculiar danger of Dundas street crossing\u2014evidence was given that the company had placed a whistle post on the right of way alongside the railway track, at a distance of 331 feet from the travelled portion or pavement of Dundas street, and that, in this particular instance, it was the duty of Mansford Brooks, the motorman, to sound the whistle at that post.\nNow, the evidence of one Gordon Worgan was given on behalf of the plaintiffs. Worgan lived on Church street, south of Dundas street. His house was 300 yards south of the whistle post. From there he could see the tracks of the electric railway. At the time of the accident, he was standing on his verandah, facing the right of way and talking with a man who had come to see him on some business. Worgan testified as follows:\nQ. What signals did it give as it approached the crossing?\u2014A. I heard it whistle.\nQ. Whereabouts was it when it whistled?\u2014A. It whistled at the crossing, I cannot say how near but it seemed to be at the crossing. Q. Was the locomotive in sight at the time it whistled?\u2014A. It was a loud whistle.\nQ. Was the locomotive in your line of vision when it whistled?\u2014A. No.\nQ. What kind of whistle was it?\u2014A. It was a loud whistle, then I heard the crash.\nQ. Were there any other signals given?\u2014A. No, not that I heard.\nQ. How long after the whistle stopped did you hear the crash?\u2014A. The two seemed to be together, for it kind of startled me; I said to Mr. Chambers\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP: Never mind what you said.\nMr. ROBINSON: Where was the train in reference to the whistle post when you heard the whistle?\u2014A. I could not say that.\nHIS LORDSHIP: You could say then had it passed the whistle post at that time?\u2014A. I could not see from where I was, whether it had or not; I heard it whistle at the crossing an extra loud whistle it seemed to me.\nQ. When you heard the loud whistle the train was near the crossing then?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. It would have passed the whistle post then when you heard the loud whistle?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. ROBINSON: Can you indicate on this plan where your line of vision stops on the railway from the point where you were standing there?\u2014A. Which is the whistle post?\nQ. Here; that is the Hydro tower at the corner, here is the orchard in here?\u2014A. I could see it through here all right, to the end of this (indicating).\nQ. When you are looking across the fields you could see, as you say, 300 yards down the track, from the crossing, how close to the crossing can you see?\nHIS LORDSHIP: He said before about 50 yards are obscured?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. ROBINSON: Did you hear any other signal besides the whistle?\u2014A. No, sir.\nThat he did not hear the sound of the whistle is, as a general rule, the most any witness can say as to whether the particular signal was or was not given. No doubt, his evidence will not be relevant or material, if, at the time, the witness was not in a position to hear or was shown not to have been paying any attention whatever. But, in a later part of his testimony, Worgan said that \u201cwhat first attracted (his) attention to the train\u201d was \u201cthe sound of it going along the line.\u201d He could \u201chear the rumble of this train for a distance of 300 yards.\u201d If he could hear the train, it would not be unreasonable to assume that had the whistle been sounded, he could also have heard it. And if, under the circumstances he described, Worgan did not hear it, a fair and even logical inference may be that the whistle was not sounded either at eighty rods from the crossing or at the whistle post. That evidence, if believed by the jury, would establish the fact of non-performance by the motorman of a specific positive duty laid on him by the statute or imposed as a precautionary measure by the company itself; and if, in the opinion of the jury, the omission caused or contributed to the accident, it would entail the responsibility of both the motorman and the company.\nThat would bring this case within the rule laid down by Lord Cairns in Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson[3]:\nThe Judge has a certain duty to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The Judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts, when submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct. It would be a serious inroad on the province of the jury, if, in a case where there are facts from which negligence may reasonably be inferred, the Judge were to withdraw the case from the Jury upon the ground that, in his opinion, negligence ought not to be inferred; and it would, on the other hand, place in the hands of the jurors a power which might be exercised in the most arbitrary manner, if they were at liberty to hold that negligence might be inferred from any state of facts whatever.\nIn the passage quoted from Worgan\u2019s testimony, we think there was \u201cevidence\u2014more than a mere scintilla\u2014from which negligence may be reasonably inferred\u201d; and it was for \u201cthe jurors to say whether, from those facts, when submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred.\u201d Accordingly the case should not have been withdrawn from the jury, and there must be a new trial as against both respondents.\nFollowing our practice when a new trial is directed, we refrain from expressing any opinion on the evidence as a whole beyond what is necessary to warrant the conclusion we have reached. Having found a state of facts on which, in our opinion, the jurors would be entitled to hold that negligence might be inferred, that is sufficient for the purposes of disposing of the appeal. We go no further. We do not say that there is not, in the record, other evidence of the same character as that of Worgan and in respect of which a similar comment might be made. Nor do we say that Worgan\u2019s evidence is strong or ought to be believed. We appreciate that the trains go past Worgan\u2019s house quite frequently, that \u201cthis was not anything out of the ordinary\u201d and that, moreover, at the time of the accident, Worgan was talking to another man. Those were circumstances, to be drawn to the attention of the jurors and to be weighed by them.\nWe would add, however, that as regards the motorman Brooks alone, there were certain statements put in from his examination on discovery which, though not evidence against the company, would have warranted the trial judge in submitting to the jury at least the issue between the appellants and that respondent. But it is advisable not to say anything further, since the case must be retried.\nThere remains to be discussed the alleged improper rejection of evidence.\nAn order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, bearing no. P.F. 4478 and dated September 20, 1917, was tendered as an exhibit on behalf of the plaintiffs and was refused at the trial, when the following discussion took place:\nMr. ROBINSON: I propose to file an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board.\nHIS LORDSHIP: What have they to do with this case?\nMr. ROBINSON: There is an order of the Railway Board.\nHIS LORDSHIP: They have no jurisdiction over this railway.\nMr. ROBINSON: They have jurisdiction over it until it is superseded.\nHIS LORDSHIP: They have no jurisdiction over a Dominion railway.\nMr. ROBINSON: At the time this order was made they had jurisdiction.\nHIS LORDSHIP: That would not make any difference. You allege in your pleadings that this is a railway incorporated under the Revised Statutes of Canada; the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board has no jurisdiction over a railway so incorporated.\nMr. ROBINSON: I am suing the Canadian National Railway and at the time this order was made\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP: That does not make a particle of difference, and I am not going to admit the evidence because you allege that this is a Dominion railway and no order of the Ontario Board has any effect over a Dominion railway. I refuse the evidence. You have tendered it and\u2014\nMr. ROBINSON: I might be permitted to speak in support of my application?\nHIS LORDSHIP: What have you to say in support?\nMr. ROBINSON: At the time this order was made there was jurisdiction in the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board to make it: that order has never been superseded. HIS LORDSHIP: It does not need to be because when it becomes a Dominion railway it goes out; and that is my ruling.\nMr. ROBINSON: I would like a note made that this evidence is tendered, my Lord, and I further tender it on this point as proving that it is a dangerous crossing.\nHIS LORDSHIP: That cannot declare it is a dangerous crossing\u2014no jurisdiction at all.\nMr. ROBINSON: It is tendered on that point as well.\nMr. LAIDLAW: I think my friend should not have made that statement before the jury.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, I will correct it.\nMr. ROBINSON: I have to tender that on that point, and I do not know any other way I could have put it.\nHIS LORDSHIP: It would be unheard of if that were so, a railway under the jurisdiction of two railway boards, who make conflicting orders.\nMr. ROBINSON: Two have.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, I have ruled, that is the end. I don\u2019t want to hear any more.\nThe circumstances are these:\nThe order is addressed to The Toronto Suburban Railway Company, a provincial company operating the electric railway at the time the order was made. By an Act to incorporate Canadian National Railway Company and respecting Canadian National Railways (ch. 13 of Statutes of Canada, 9-10 George V), The Toronto Suburban Railway Company was stated, in the first schedule, to be a \u201cconstituent and subsidiary company comprised in the Canadian Northern system\u201d and, as such, by the 18th section of the Act, it was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\nThe question is whether the regulations made by the provincial railway board still continued to apply as such to that railway.\nWe agree with those of the learned judges below who held that they did not.\nThe effect of the declaration, by force of section 7 of The Railway Act, 1919 (ch. 68 of 9-10 George V), was to subject the railway to federal legislation and control, \u201cto the exclusion of such of the provisions of (its) Special Act as (were) inconsistent with the (said Railway) Act, and in Lieu of any general railway Act of the province.\u201d The Special Act, when used with reference to a railway, is defined in the Railway Act (subsection 28 of section 2 of c. 68, 9-10 George V) as meaning\nany Act under which the company has authority to construct or operate a railway, or which is enacted with special reference to such railway, whether heretofore or hereafter passed, and includes,\u2014\n(a) all such Acts,\n(b) [refers to Grand Trunk Pacific Railway],\n(c) any letters patent, constituting a company\u2019s authority to construct or operate a railway, granted under any Act, and the Act under which such letters patent were granted or confirmed.\nSuch only, therefore, of the provisions of the Special Act so defined as were not inconsistent with the federal Railway Act, 1919, continued to apply to the respondent company\u2019s railway. Otherwise, the railway was withdrawn from the authority of the provincial laws and of the regulations adopted by the provincial boards. For, as said by Middleton J.A., (with whom Mulock C.J.A., concurred), these regulations could \u201chave no greater authority or validity than if they were found in The Ontario Railway Act,\u201d and we would add: or in the Special Act enacted with reference to the railway.\nThe question of precautions at highway crossings is one specially dealt with by sections 308, 309 and 310 of the federal Railway Act to which, by the declaration, the railway immediately became subject. These sections applied to the exclusion of any provincial statute and, a fortiori, of any provincial regulation. They were inconsistent with the Order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board tendered in evidence by the plaintiffs.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under whose jurisdiction the railway was placed, was immediately vested with full and exclusive authority to make orders in respect of Dundas street crossing. This authority was to be exercised unhampered by any pre-existing regulation or order of the provincial board, which could not be done unless the effect of section 7 is to exclude all such regulations, for the Dominion Railway Act contains no provision empowering the Board of Railway Commissioners to rescind or cancel a provincial regulation or order. We think, therefore, the latter had no continuing effect once the road became a Dominion Railway. But, contrary to what was urged before us, this does not make for a period of lawless- ness, for the federal legislation must be presumed to be adequate to fully cover the situation and there is nothing to prevent The Board of Railway Commissioners from immediately adopting any measures required in special cases. Moreover, the Act of the Parliament of Canada declaring the railway to be a work for the general advantage of Canada might, if thought necessary or desirable, well contain a provision continuing in force provincial orders and regulations unless and until reconsidered by the Dominion Board.\nThe learned trial judge was therefore right in ruling that the Order of the 20th day of September, 1917, was no longer in force as an order binding on the respondent railway company.\nBut the Order was made by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board \u201cin the matter of section 123 of The Ontario Railway Act,\u201d being then chapter 185 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914. Section 123 of that Act provided that\nwhere a railway is already constructed upon, along or across any highway the Board may, upon its own motion, or upon complaint or application by or on behalf of the Crown, or any municipal or other corporation, or any person aggrieved, order the company to submit to the Board, within a specified time, a plan and profile of such portion of the railway and may cause inspection of such portion and may inquire into and determine all matters and things in respect of such portion, and the crossing, if any, and may make such order as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it deems expedient * * * and that such other work be executed, watchmen or other persons employed, or measures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction, in the opinion of the Board, arising or likely to arise in respect of such portion or crossing, if any, or any other crossing directly or indirectly affected.\nThe Order was made while the Ontario Board had jurisdiction over the Dundas street crossing. It is expressly stated to have been made \u201cfor the protection of the public,\u201d after the Board had \u201cinspected\u201d the crossing and had \u201cinstructed its Engineer to inspect and report on the said crossings, and the said Engineer having completed his inspection and filed his Report.\u201d It provided a rule concerning the safety of persons using the crossing.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the train was being operated at an excessive and immoderate rate of speed considering the dangers of the crossing. While the Order was rightly rejected as a rule binding on the company, it was further tendered as affording evidence that Dundas street crossing was dangerous, and that it was not unreasonable to require that some precaution be taken there such as it prescribes. Documents such as these will be received in evidence when they contain the results of inquiries made, as here, under competent public authority in the exercise of a judicial or quasi-judicial duty and concerning matters in which the public are interested. (See speech of Lord Blackburn in Sturla v. Freccia[4]; see also Phipson, Law of Evidence, 6th ed., p. 355). Lord Abinger\u2019s words in Pirn v. Curell[5] are apposite:\nIn the cases where reputation is evidence, that is, cases involving a general right, in which all the Queen\u2019s subjects are concerned, a verdict or a judgment upon the matter directly in issue between the parties (although between other parties) is also evidence; not, however, that it is evidence of any specific fact existing at the time, but that it is evidence of the most solemn kind, of an adjudication of a competent tribunal upon the state of facts, and the question of usage at that time.\nThese words are quoted with approval by Lord Selborne L.C., in Neill v. Duke of Devonshire[6] who adds:\nSuch evidence * * * is not itself, in any proper sense, evidence of reputation. It really stands upon a higher and a larger principle.\nWe think, therefore, that the Order was admissible not as a rule that could be enforced against the railway company, but as affording evidence of an adjudication by a competent tribunal upon the dangerous character of the crossing\u2014a matter of public concern,\u2014at the time the Order was pronounced, (Taylor, on Evidence, 10th ed., pp. 442-443 and 1213) and presenting a standard of reasonableness upon which a jury might act.\nWe must qualify what we have just said by adding that if, as a result of a subsequent inquiry made by the same or a similarly competent public authority, the regulation, order, rule or decree was set aside or superseded, it would, of course, cease to have any evidentiary value. That will be the case, should it be established at the new trial that, since the railway came under federal control, the Board of Railway Commissioners proceeded to make an inquiry of its own and came to the conclusion that, by providing for other and different means of safety, or simply by following the general railway law, \u201cthe said crossing is protected to the satisfaction of the Board.\u201d It may be\u2014although we express no opinion on this point\u2014that this will be shown to be the actual condition, as a result of Order No. 39895 of the Board of Railway Commissioners, dated the 19th day of November, 1927. This Order was tendered as exhibit, but was refused because it did not bear the certificate required by section 68 of the Railway Act (R.S.C., 1927, ch. 170). No doubt, at the new trial, the copy of the Order will have been properly certified and its admissibility on that ground at least will be no longer in dispute.\nFor the reasons stated, we direct a new trial, with costs here and in the Court of Appeal; the costs of the abortive trial to abide the result. We further hold that the Order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board dated the 20th day of September, 1917, may be received in evidence for the limited purpose we have indicated, unless it is shown to have been superseded by a subsequent order of the same Board made while it was still in control or of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and subject, of course, to the right of the defendants to shew that, since the Order, the conditions at or about the Dundas street crossing have ceased to be substantially the same as when the Order in question was made.\nDUFF J. concurred in the result.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Church & Robinson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R.E.

Charlesworth, [1930] S.C.R. 427\nDate: 1930-04-10\nFrank Ryan (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nKatherine Charlesworth, Administratrix of the Estate of Peter Ryan, Deceased, and the said Katherine Charlesworth (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1930: March 10, 11; 1930: April 10.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nExecutors and Administrators\u2014Fraudulent conveyances\u2014Attack by plaintiff, claiming as judgment creditor of deceased and as administratrix of his estate, on alleged transfers by deceased in fraud of creditors\u2014Status of plaintiff in said capacities\u2014Doctrine as to extinguishment of debt due to an executor by his testator.\nPlaintiff, a daughter of R., deceased, purchased judgments which had been obtained against R. in his lifetime. She later became administratrix of his estate. She then, as administratrix and in her personal capacity, sued her brother, the defendant, attacking transfers made by R. to defendant as having been made to defraud creditors. The Appellate Division, Ont. (36 Ont. W.N. 265), held that the transfers were fraudulent and void as against creditors; and that defendant must account and pay over, out of what had been transferred to him, sufficient to meet creditors\u2019 claims; but rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim as administratrix to the further moneys in defendant\u2019s hands. On appeal and cross-appeal:\nHeld (1) The findings below that the transfers were made in fraud of creditors should be sustained.\n(2) As to defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff\u2019s claims against R.\u2019s estate were extinguished by operation of law upon the grant of letters of administration followed by the acquisition of assets by her as administratrix\u2014putting the doctrine, as to extinguishment of a debt due to an executor from his testator, in the form most favourable to defendant, it had no application in this case, as there was nothing to show the existence of assets in plaintiff\u2019s hands \u201csufficient and properly applicable to pay\u201d the judgments acquired by her (In re Rhoades, [1899] 2 Q.B. 347, at pp. 352-353).\n(3) Plaintiff\u2019s position as administratrix did not entitle her to attack the fraudulent transfers. A debtor who fraudulently transfers his property cannot himself attack his fraudulent transaction, and his administrator has no greater right (Shaw v. Jeffery, 13 Moo. P.C., 432; Hawes v. Leader, 1 Brownl. & G. 111; Orlabar v. Harwar, Comb. 348; Ayerst v. Jenkins, L.R. 16 Eq., 275; Colman v. Croker, 1 Ves. 160).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (supra) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] varying, but as varied affirming, the judgment of Raney J.[2]\nThe plaintiff and defendant are children of Peter Ryan, late of the city of Toronto, deceased, who died on October 26, 1925, intestate. Letters of administration of his property were granted to the plaintiff on October 31, 1927.\nThe plaintiff alleged that judgments had been obtained against the said deceased in his life time; that she in her personal capacity had purchased all such judgments as were in force at the date of his death of which she had been able to obtain any knowledge, and was the assignee thereof. The dates of the plaintiff\u2019s acquisition of the judgments were prior to the date of her taking out letters of administration.\nThe plaintiff, as administratrix of the deceased\u2019s estate, and in her personal capacity, brought action in the Supreme Court of Ontario, alleging that said deceased had from time to time transferred to the defendant various sums of money, stocks, bonds and other assets of said deceased, with intent to defeat, delay and hinder his creditors from obtaining payment of their judgments; that such transfers were fraudulent and void as against the judgment creditors and as against her as their assignee; and that defendant had full knowledge of the circumstances and of said intent and was a party to the fraudulent scheme to defeat the creditors; further that all assets transferred to defendant as aforesaid were to be held by him in trust for the said deceased and form part of his estate. She claimed an account, an order requiring defendant to assign and transfer all of said assets to her as administratrix of the estate of said deceased, and incidental relief.\nThe defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s allegations; and alleged that, while it was true that from time to time the deceased had given to him sums of money and securities, these were given to him as absolute gifts and advancements for the purpose of assisting him in his business; that many transfers of property had been made by deceased to plaintiff and other members of the family in addition to those made to defendant, and that the transfers made to defendant represented that share or portion which the deceased desired that defendant should have in his estate; and that all transfers made by the deceased to the defendant or other members of the family were matters of common knowledge to plaintiff and other members of the family.\nRaney J.[3] gave judgment against the defendant. The formal judgment at trial was as follows:\n2. * * * that the moneys, stocks, bonds and other assets of the said Peter Ryan transferred or caused to be transferred to the defendant were not gifts to the defendant or advances to him, but were so transferred for the sole purpose of defeating, delaying and hindering the creditors of the said Peter Ryan from obtaining payment of their claims and that all such transfers were and are fraudulent and void and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly; 3. * * * that it be referred to the Master of this Court to inquire and state what moneys, stocks, bonds and other assets were transferred by the said Peter Ryan to the said defendant and what of such assets remained in the hands of the said defendant at the date of the issue of the writ in this action and when and for what consideration the defendant disposed of the remainder of said assets and the market value thereof on this date, and the said Master is hereby directed to advertise for creditors of the said Peter Ryan and to pass on the claims of said creditors and to report;\n4. * * * that the moneys and securities received by the plaintiff from the said Peter Ryan and the securities still in the hands of the defendant that were received by him her sister, Margaret Monteith, and her brother, Bernard Ryan, belong to the Estate of the said Peter Ryan, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly. [Reporter\u2019s Note: Apparently there is some omission or error in this paragraph. As to what was directed by the trial judge, see 34 Ont. W.N., at p. 286.]\n5. * * * appoints the Sheriff of the City of Toronto Receiver of the assets of the Estate of the said Peter Ryan and directs the plaintiff and the defendant to turn over to the said receiver all moneys and securities in their hands belonging to the said estate and that the solicitor for the said sheriff shall act as solicitor for all creditors of the said Peter Ryan other than those whose claims have been assigned to the plaintiff until such creditors are ascertained and are otherwise adequately represented on the said reference;\n6. * * * that further directions and the question of costs and of the Sheriff\u2019s compensation be reserved until the said Master shall have made his report.\nOn appeal by the defendant, the Appellate Division[4] varied the judgment below, but, subject to the variation, dismissed the appeal with costs. The formal judgment in the Appellate Division was as follows:\nUpon motion * * * by way of appeal * * * and the plaintiff by her counsel agreeing not to assert any individual claim to the moneys recovered from the defendant save for her out of pocket expenses in obtaining the assignments of the judgments on which this action is brought and to hold the moneys recovered from the defendant for the benefit of the next of kin of the said Peter Ryan, deceased, other than the defendant, * * *\n1. This Court doth order that the said Judgment be varied and as varied be as follows:\n(1) \u201d* * * that the moneys, stock, bonds and other assets of the said Peter Ryan transferred or caused to be transferred to the defendant were so transferred for the sole purpose of defeating, delaying and hindering the creditors of the said Peter Ryan from obtaining payment of their claims and that all such transfers were and are fraudulent and void as against the plaintiff Katharine Charlesworth and other creditors of the said Peter Ryan, deceased, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly. (2) \u201c* * * that it be referred to the Master of this Court at Toronto to ascertain and state whether the judgments of the plaintiff are the only liabilities of the estate of the said Peter Ryan, deceased, and the said Master is directed to advertise for creditors of the estate of the said Peter Ryan, deceased, and that the said Master do ascertain the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and that he do ascertain and pass upon the claims of the other creditors, if any, of the said estate.\n(3) \u201c* * * that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the amount found due to her by the said Master forthwith after the confirmation of the said Master\u2019s report and that the said money when recovered by the plaintiff be disbursed in accordance with her undertaking.\n(4) \u201c* * * that after payment of the plaintiff\u2019s costs the defendant do pay to the other creditors of the said Peter Ryan, deceased (if any), the amounts found due to them by the said Master\u2019s report forthwith after the confirmation thereof.\n(5) \u201c* * * that Margaret Ryan and Bernard Ryan be added as party defendants in the Master\u2019s Office.\n(6) \u201c* * * that the plaintiff do recover from the defendant her costs of this action and of the reference before the said Master forthwith after taxation thereof.\n7. \u201c* * * that the said Master do also take an account of the costs of the plaintiff as between solicitor and client and the costs, charges and expenses and disbursements of the plaintiff of and incidental to this action over and above the plaintiff\u2019s costs as between party and party and apportion the difference among the creditors who have proved their claims before him, including the plaintiff, in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, and that the said creditors other than the plaintiff do pay to the plaintiff their respective proportions of such difference.\u201d\n2. And this Court doth further order that in all other respects this appeal be and the same is dismissed.\n3. [Costs of the appeal.]\nThe defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division to the Supreme Court of Canada. The plaintiff, while submitting that the judgment appealed from was correct in so far as it gave effect to her claim as a judgment creditor, submitted, by way of cross-appeal, that the judgment should be amplified to give effect to her claim as administratrix to recover from the defendant all the property of the deceased that came into his hands in order that she might administer the estate according to law.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed with costs.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and S. Haydon for the appellant.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and M. Des Brisay for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed. Three substantial points were raised on the argument and these I shall discuss seriatim.\nFirst, Mr. McCarthy\u2019s principal contention was that the respondent\u2019s claims against the estate of Peter Ryan were extinguished by operation of law upon the grant of letters of administration followed by the acquisition of assets by her as administratrix. This, I think, is completely answered by the judgment of Lindley M.R., in In re Rhoades[5]:\nThe older common law authorities go far to shew that if an executor was a creditor of his deceased testator and had assets in his hands sufficient to pay his debt (and all others of a higher degree, if any) such debt was treated as extinguished. Sufficient assets to pay his own debt and properly applicable thereto being in the executor\u2019s hands, such assets were treated without more as applied by him to such payment. Blackstone says so distinctly. His words are (Bl. Com. by Kerr, 4th ed., vol. iii, p. 18): \u201cSo much as is sufficient to answer his own demand is, by operation of law, applied to that particular purpose.\u201d Plowden goes further, and says that the property in the assets is changed: See Woodward v. Darcy[6]. But this can only be true if the assets spoken of can be identified and appropriated to the debt which they have satisfied, and this presupposes the exercise of the right in fact; and in the case in Plowden it had been so exercised: See ibid., p. 184. [The learned judge then referred to the facts stated in the report of Woodward v. Darcy[7], and proceeded:\u2014]\nUntil the executor does some act to shew which assets he retains, it is obvious that the property in them cannot be changed. This has been noticed before: See [1898] 1 Q.B. 286, and Wentworth\u2019s Office of Executor, cited in the margin of 1 Plowden, p. 185a. But it was settled that an executor sued by a creditor could give a retainer by himself in satisfaction of his own debt in evidence under a general plea of plene administravit, and that he need not plead a retainer specially: 1 Wm. Saunders, 333, n.6. The extent to which the doctrine that his debt was extinguished was carried is further illustrated by the cases collected in Williams on Executors, vol. ii, p. 1180, which shew that an executor, having assets sufficient and properly applicable to pay a debt due to him from his testator, could not sue the testator\u2019s heir nor any third person who might be liable with the testator for the debt in question.\nThere is nothing in this case to shew the existence of assets in the respondent\u2019s hands \u201csufficient and properly applicable to pay\u201d the judgments acquired by her, and, therefore, it is quite clear that, putting the doctrine in the form most favourable to Mr. McCarthy, it has no application here. Second, Mr. McCarthy contends that the respondent was a party to the scheme under which the property in question was acquired by the appellant. It is sufficient to say that while more than one member of the family seems to have been aware of the transactions by which the intestate intended to put his property beyond the reach of his creditors, there is no evidence implicating the respondent.\nThird, the concurrent findings of the courts below that the property in question was in fact transferred in fraud of creditors were attacked, but quite unsuccessfully.\nThe form of the order is perhaps a little exceptional, but in view of the special circumstances there appears to be no good ground for interfering with the disposition of the case by the Appellate Division.\nIt is necessary to notice a point, urged by Mr. Hellmuth by way of cross-appeal, which, we think, also fails. The argument advanced is very clearly and concisely stated in the respondent\u2019s factum in these words:\nThe respondent submits that the defendant is retaining property to which he has no right and which was never intended to be his and the equitable rule that a settlor cannot recover from his transferee property fraudulently transferred does not estop an administrator of the settlor seeking to recover assets forming part of the deceased\u2019s estate for the benefit of persons not parties to the fraud and that to refuse relief would be to make an equitable rule an instrument of iniquity.\nThe respondent will submit that the point as to whether or not an administrator in the circumstances present here could recover has not been settled by any decision binding on this Court.\nWe agree with the Appellate Division[8] that this contention is not sustainable, and that as to the property transferred into the name of Frank Ryan by his father, for the purpose of defeating his father\u2019s creditors; the respondent, as administratrix, stands in no better position than that which her father would have occupied. \u201cTransfers made by him which were fraudulent and void as being for the purpose of defeating his creditors could not be attacked by him and can not be attacked by his administratrix. A debtor who fraudulently transfers his property cannot himself attack his own fraudulent transaction, and his administrator has no greater right.\u201d This passage in the judgment of the learned judge states a settled proposition of law.

V, c. 18, s. 6, in respect of export of liquors\u2014Goods not exported to the place named\u2014False landing certificate\u2014Purported cancellation of bond\u2014Crown\u2019s right to recover on the bond\u2014Amount recoverable\u2014Limitation period for action\u2014Defect in form of bond\u2014Interest.\nAppellant gave a bond to the Crown, pursuant to s. 101 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 48, as amended by 12-13 Geo. V, c. 18, s. 6, respect of certain liquors entered at Halifax, N.S., by the S. Co., for export to Georgetown, Grand Cayman, by the steamer G. The required form of bond in such cases was expressed to secure actual exportation to the place provided for in the entry and production of proof thereof. The steamer reported outwards from Halifax on. February 3, 1925, for Georgetown, via St. John, which she reached on. February 5, where additional liquors were loaded for transport to Havana, Cuba. On February 25 she cleared at St. John for Georgetown. On March 3 she reported inwards at Shelburne, N.S., in ballast, and, therefrom, she cleared for Halifax on March 10. At Shelburne the master made a sworn statement before a customs officer that the goods with which the G. was laden on departure from St. John had been disposed of on the high seas, 30 miles off the United States\u2019 coast, and transferred on board lighters. On February 27 there was deposited with the collector of customs at Halifax, purporting to proceed from the customs office at Georgetown, a certificate, dated February 16, that the goods described in the Halifax export entry had been delivered over to the customs at Georgetown. The goods had not been so delivered and the certificate was a concocted document. The collector acted on this fraudulent certificate (believing, as was found, in its genuineness) and, purporting to proceed under the authority given by s. 102 of the Act, cancelled the bond and surrendered it to appellant. In September, 1928, the Crown brought action in the Exchequer Court for the amount of the bond and interest. Maclean J. sustained the claim ([1929] Ex. C.R. 216). On appeal:\nHeld (1) It could not be said that the conditions of the bond were in effect complied with, even assuming that the principal object of the statute and regulations was to provide special precautions against the clandestine re-importation of wines and liquors into Canada. Parliament, and the Minister, under its authority, had laid down rules which were deemed necessary in order to secure that object. The bond and the statute and regulations must be held to take effect according to their plain meaning.\n(2) Appellant could not rely upon the collector\u2019s act in delivering up the bond with the intention of cancelling it, even assuming such delivery to have misled it to its prejudice (Mayor, etc., of Kingston-upon-Hull v. Harding, [1892] 2 Q.B. 494). Even if the collector had (contrary to the finding) been a party to the fraud, a purported cancellation based upon it could not, as between the Crown and persons bound by the acts of parties implicated in the fraud, or civilly responsible for the non-observance of the law, have any effect as against the Crown.\n(3) The amount recoverable by the Crown was not limited to damages proved. Where a bond is given to secure the performance of the provisions of a revenue statute, it is forfeited if the condition is not performed, especially where the bond is required by statute (The King v. Dixon, 11 Price, 204, at p. 211; The King v. Canadian Northern Ry. Co., [1923] A.C., 714, at p. 722).\n(4) It could not be said that the object of the proviso to s. 101 was to obtain a guarantee for the payment of the penalties exacted by s. 237 (now s. 235 of R.S.C., 1927, c. 42) and that the limitation period applicable thereto applied; the proviso created a substantive additional protection in the case of wines and liquors, and could not be fairly read as subsidiary to s. 237. The claim was not statute barred under s. 279 (now s. 277); s. 279 must be read with s. 272 (now s. 270), and s. 272 shews that the words \u201cprosecutions or suits for the recovery\u201d of \u201cpenalties or forfeitures imposed by this Act\u201d do not embrace a proceeding upon a bond required by the statute; they apply to penalties, etc., imposed directly by the Act rather than to guarantee bonds. (5) Notwithstanding the omission of certain words in the condition of the bond (as proved at trial by production of a copy) it should be read as of the form prescribed by the regulations. The recitals established clearly that the bond was given under the Act and regulations, and it was therefore necessary to look at these before deciding that a substantive clause in the condition, in which obviously the intention was not completely expressed, was entirely nugatory; the intention as to the form of the condition could be ascertained with certainty by reference to the Act and regulations, and it was one of the cases in which it is the court\u2019s duty to supply the missing words, to avoid the purpose of the document being defeated.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (supra) affirmed, subject to a variation disallowing the claim for interest prior to date of judgment in that court.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the amount of a certain bond. The bond was dated January 31, 1925, and was given pursuant to the provisions of s. 101 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 48, as amended by 12-13 Geo. V, c. 18, s. 6, in respect of certain liquors entered at Halifax, N.S., by the Scotia Import and Export Company, Ltd., for export to Georgetown, Grand Cayman, by the steamer Gemma. The material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment below1 and the judgment now reported. The Crown brought the action in September, 1928, claiming $41,500 (the amount of the bond) with interest at 5% from February 28, 1925. The claim was allowed by the Exchequer Court1. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, subject to a variation disallowing the claim for interest prior to the date of the judgment in the Exchequer Court.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and W. L. Scott K.C. for the appellant.\nN. W. Rowell K.C. and G. Lindsay for the (plaintiff) respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal arises out of proceedings by way of information in the Exchequer Court taken by His Majesty the King to recover the sum of $41,500 under a bond given pursuant to the provisions of section 101 of the Customs Act as amended by 12-13 Geo. V, c. 18, s. 6. We have had the advantage of an elaborate and rather protracted argument, but the decisive considerations can be stated in comparatively few pages.\nSection 101, as so amended, is as follows:\n101. Upon the entry outwards of any goods to be exported from a Customs warehouse, either by sea or by land or by inland navigation, as the case may be, the person entering the same for such purpose shall, by and upon the making of such entry, whether so expressed in such entry or not, become bound, when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by sea, to the actual exportation of the said goods, and, when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by land or inland navigation, to the actual landing or delivering of the goods at the place for which they are entered outwards, or, in either case, to otherwise account for the said goods to the satisfaction of the collector or other proper officer, and to produce, within a period to be named in such entry, such proof or certificate that such goods have been exported, landed or delivered or otherwise lawfully disposed of, as the case may be, as shall be required by any regulation of the Governor in Council, or by the collector or other proper officer.\nProvided, however, that upon the entry outwards of wines and spirituous liquors to be exported from a Customs Warehouse either by sea or by land or inland navigation, as the case may be, the person entering the same for such purpose shall give security by bond of an incorporated guarantee company authorized to do business in Canada, and whose bonds are acceptable to the Dominion Government, such bond to be in form approved by the Minister, in double the duties of importation on such goods, that the same shall, when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by sea, be actually exported to the place provided for in said entry, and when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by land or inland navigation, shall be landed and delivered at the place for which they are entered outwards, unless in either case the said goods were after leaving Canada lost and destroyed, and that such proof or certificate that such goods have been so exported, landed or delivered, or lost and destroyed, as the case may be, as shall be required by any regulation of the Minister, shall be produced to the Collector or other proper officer within a period to be appointed in such bond. * * *\nThe goods in respect of which the security was given were certain liquors entered at Halifax, by the Scotia Import and Export Company Limited, for export to Georgetown, Grand Cayman, by the steamer Gemma.\nThe steamer reported outwards from Halifax, February 3, 1925, for Georgetown via St. John, which she reached on February 5, where additional liquors were taken on board for transport to Havana, Cuba. On the 25th February, she cleared at St. John for Georgetown; on the 3rd of March, she reported inwards at Shelburne in ballast, and, therefrom, she cleared for Halifax on the 10th of the same month. It is not contended that the liquors, or any part of them, entered for export at Halifax, reached Georgetown, or that the intended destination of the Gemma was in fact Georgetown. At Shelburne, on reporting inwards, the master made a sworn statement before a customs officer that the goods with which the Gemma was laden on departure from St. John had been disposed of on the high seas, thirty miles off the coast of the United States, and transferred on board lighters. On the 27th of February, two days after the ship had cleared from St. John for Georgetown, a written certificate was deposited with the Collector of Customs at Halifax, professing to be under the signature of L. A. R. Adams, and purporting to proceed from the office of Customs at the port of Georgetown, bearing date the 16th of February, certifying that the goods described in the Halifax export entry had been delivered over to the customs at Georgetown.\nOn this certificate the Collector at Halifax acted, believing it to be genuine (as the learned trial judge found), and, purporting to proceed under the authority given by section 102 of the Act, cancelled the bond, and surrendered it to the appellants.\nThe first question for consideration, is, whether the act of the Collector at Halifax in delivering up the bond with the intention of cancelling it, operated as a cancellation of that document. It is first necessary to notice a defect in the form of the bond as proved at the trial, by the production of a copy.\nThe form of bond approved by the Minister of Customs is as follows:\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that we.............. hereinafter called \u201cthe Guarantee Company,\u201d are held and firmly bound unto His Majesty the King, His Heirs and Successors in the sum of.......................................dollars, currency money of Canada, to be paid to His said Majesty the King, His Heirs and Successors, and for which payment well and truly to be made we bind ourselves and our successors and assigns firmly by these presents.\nSealed with our seal and dated this.............................day of............................., 192.... WHEREAS...................................hath passed an entry, ................to export to................by the..................... whereof....................is Master. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. and which goods are now deposited in.................................. at............................, in the Port of........................., under the provisions of the \u201cCustoms Act\u201d and Regulations thereunder.\nAND WHEREAS the Guarantee Company has agreed to guarantee that the said goods shall be duly exported, landed and delivered as required by the Customs Act and Regulations thereunder.\nNOW THE CONDITION OF THE ABOVE WRITTEN OBLIGATION is such that if the said goods shall, when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by sea, be actually exported to the place provided for in said entry, and when the entry aforesaid is for exportation by land or inland navigation, shall be landed and delivered at the place for which they are entered outwards, unless in either case the said goods are after leaving Canada lost and destroyed, and if such proof or certificate that such goods have been so exported, landed or delivered, or lost and destroyed, as the case may be, as required by Regulations of the Minister of Customs and Excise, be produced to the Collector or other proper officer of Customs and Excise at the Port of...................., within.................. days from the date hereof, then this obligation shall be void; but otherwise shall be and remain in full force and virtue.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the Guarantee Company has hereunto affixed its Corporate Seal.\nSEALED AND DELIVERED AND COUNTERSIGNED by....... of the Guarantee Company.\nIn the Presence of\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe bond, as proved at the trial, omits the words (following \u201cMinister of Customs and Excise\u201d) \u201cbe produced to the Collector or other proper officer of Customs and Excise.\u201d The point need not detain us. The recitals establish clearly that the bond was given under the Customs Act and Regulations, and it is therefore necessary to look at these before deciding that a substantive clause in the condition, in which, it is obvious, that the intention is not completely expressed, is entirely nugatory. The intention of the parties as to the form of the condition can be ascertained with certainty by reference to the Act and Regulations made under it, and this is one of those cases in which it is the duty of the court to supply the missing words, in order that the purpose of the document may not be defeated, and the document should therefore be read as of the form, prescribed by the Regulations, above set forth.\nIt is argued that the bond must be regarded as cancelled, because in effect the condition was in fact complied with, and because the appellants, being mere sureties, are entitled to act, as they did act upon the apparent cancellation, the obligee is precluded from denying that this apparent cancellation was valid, and, in their favour, effective.\nAs to the first of these contentions, it is argued that the aim of the proviso in section 101, and the Regulations made thereunder, was to provide special precautions against the clandestine re-importation of wines and liquors into Canada, as to which there is (as is well known) a powerful inducement for smuggling, in the exceptionally high duties on such commodities. It is said, moreover, that it was quite well known to the Customs officers that the goods in question were destined for the United States, and that the venture of the exporters proceeded in the usual course, and in conformity with the expectations of those officers.\nThe learned trial judge has found that in fact the Collector at Halifax accepted the certificate produced as a genuine certificate, and acted in full belief in its genuineness. The document now proves to be, obviously, a concocted document, concocted for the purpose of defeating, and committing a fraud upon, the Customs law, and even if the Customs Collector had been a party to such a fraud, a purported cancellation based upon it could not, as between the Crown and persons implicated in the fraud, or persons bound by the acts of parties so implicated or civilly responsible for the non-observance of the law, have any effect as against the Crown. The authority and the duty of customs officials in respect of such matters is to be found in, or in instructions authorized by, the Statute or the Regulations; such officials possess no dispensing capacity unless a discretion is reposed in them by or under the authority of some enactment or regulation. Assuming that the principal object of the Statute and Regulations is that contended for, Parliament and the Minister under the authority of Parliament, have laid down rules which are deemed necessary in order to secure that object. A power is vested in the Governor-in-Council to deal with exceptional cases in which penalties have been incurred by remitting them in whole or in part. R.S.C. (1927) c. 178, s. 91. This would enable the Government to deal in a practical way with penalties incurred under section 235 in the special cases suggested in the appellants\u2019 factum*. The Act does not apply to bonds, but that is not a reason for holding that the bond and the regulations and the statute are not to take effect according to their plain meaning.\nNow, as to the second contention, the appellants, dealing with Government officials, are presumed to know the statutes under which the officials act, and the limitations of their powers. But apart from this, assuming the delivery of the cancelled bond to the appellants to have misled them to their prejudice, there is a final answer to this contention, in the fact that it was a condition of the bond, as required by the proviso to section 101, that such proof or certificate of the export of the goods to the place named in the export entry should be furnished, as might be prescribed by the Regulations. It is not alleged that the certificate required by the Regulations was in fact produced, and it was, as the learned trial judge found, the production of the fraudulent certificate that led to the cancellation of the bond. The appellants can in these circumstances get no advantage from what the Collector did. The case, in principle, is covered by Mayor, etc., of Kingston-upon-Hull v. Harding[2].\nThen, it is argued that the plaintiff can only recover such damages as have been proved. It is settled law, I think, that where a bond is given to secure the performance of the provisions of a revenue statute, the bond is forfeited if the condition is not performed, especially where the bond is required by the statute. The King v. Dixon[3]; The King v. Canadian Northern Ry. Co.[4].\nTwo further contentions must be considered. It is argued that the object of the proviso to section 101 is to obtain a guarantee for the payment of the penalties exacted by section 235, and that the limitation clause of that section applies. I cannot agree. The proviso creates a substantive additional protection in the case of wines and liquors; it cannot be fairly read as subsidiary to section 235. Then the appellants rely on section 277, as showing that the claim is statute-barred. I think that section 277 must be read with section 270, and this latter section shows\nthat the words \u201cprosecutions or suits for the recovery of penalties or forfeitures imposed by this Act\u201d do not embrace a proceeding upon a bond required by the statute. I think they apply to penalties, seizures and forfeitures imposed directly by the Act rather than to guarantee bonds*.\nThe appellants cannot therefore succeed except in respect of interest, which admittedly was not exigible prior to judgment.\nSubject to a variation of the judgment below, disallowing interest prior to judgment, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs (subject to variation disallowing claim for interest prior to date of judgment in Exchequer Court).\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

He filed his application in Canada within twelve months from the passing of the Patent Act of 1923 (c. 23). The United States being a foreign country which affords \u201csimilar privilege to citizens of Canada,\u201d defendant\u2019s filing date in the United States was his Convention filing date in Canada, under s. 8 (2) of the Act.\nThe evidence established that a year before the earliest date to which defendant\u2019s invention could be carried back, B., in Denmark, conceived the idea, disclosed it to \u201cothers,\u201d instructed experiments, made some on his own account and produced porous cement. B. filed his application in Denmark on September 11, 1922, and the patent issued on July 2, 1923.\nHeld, that defendant\u2019s process was \u201cnot patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country more than two years prior to his application,\u201d and therefore was not barred in this respect.\nAn application for patent is not a \u201cprinted publication\u201d within the meaning of s. 7. This construction is indicated by the use of the word \u201cpatented\u201d in the immediate context; and is supported by the existence of the provisions for secrecy which safeguard a pending application in Canada; and, in absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be presumed that the secrecy of application in a foreign country is likewise safeguarded.\nHeld, however, that defendant\u2019s process did not fulfil the condition in s. 7: \u201cnot known or used by others before his invention thereof.\u201d According to Canadian patent law, B. was the first who had invented the process. To bar fulfilment of said condition in s. 7, prior knowledge or use in a foreign country is sufficient (Wright & Corson v. Brake Service Ltd., [1926] Can. S.C.R., 434; Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd. v. Fada Radio Ltd., [1930] A.C. 97, at pp. 106-107), and need not be by the public. If the first inventor has formulated, either in writing or verbally, a description which affords the means of making that which is invented, and has communicated his invention to \u201cothers\u201d, although without disclosure to the public or application for patent, he is the first and true inventor in the eyes of the present Canadian patent law, so as to prevent any other person from securing a Canadian patent for the same invention. Such prior knowledge, however, must be demonstrated; evidence of this character should be very closely scrutinized; the burden of establishing anticipation on such basis is a weighty one; it cannot be satisfied by mere proof of conception.\nCanadian General Electric Co. Ltd. v. Fada Radio Ltd. [1930] A.C. 97, and Permutit Co. v. Borrowman, 43 R.P.C., 356, cited and discussed. Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., 270 U.S. Rep., 390, at pp. 400-401, referred to. The Queen v. La Force, 4 Can. Ex. C.R. 14, and Gerrard Wire Tying Machines Co. Ltd. of Canada v. Cary Mfg. Co., [1926] Ex. C.R. 170, discussed and, so far as inconsistent herewith, overruled.\nOn the question of anticipation by B., which was the sole issue, the sufficiency of B.\u2019s specification in his Danish application for patent should not be judged by applying the rules in s. 14 of the Canadian Act. Moreover, B.\u2019s invention should not be envisaged from the starting point only of his Danish application; he invented a new principle and a practical means of applying it; he was not bound to describe every method by which his invention could be carried into effect (Terrell on Patents, 7th ed., p. 144); the conception of the idea, coupled with the way of carrying it out (Hickton\u2019s Patent Syndicate v. Patents, etc., Ltd., 26 R.P.C., 339, at p. 347) and reduced to a definite and practical shape (Permutit Co. v. Borrowman, supra) constituted the invention of his process, which he communicated to others. He had, on the evidence, made a workable invention, notwithstanding the fact of continuance of laboratory experiments, in endeavours to improve the foam ingredient.\nHeld, further, that\u2014as to defendant\u2019s claim to be entitled to his patent pro tanto, under s. 31 of the Act, in respect of certain specifically defined claims in his application embodying suggestions as to the use of glue (it being argued that B. suggested only mucilage) as a foam developing substance\u2014assuming that, under the circumstances, the evidence justified a distinction between mucilage and glue, and without deciding whether s. 31 would, in a proper case, permit the court to discriminate in the way indicated, such relief could not be granted in this case, in view of Rule 14 of the Patent Office (that \u201ctwo or more separate inventions cannot be claimed in one application, nor included in one Patent\u201d) and in view of the nature and extent of the expressed object for which his patent was applied for and granted.\nJudgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1929] Ex. C.R., 111, reversed in the result, and defendant\u2019s patent held invalid. (Comment and direction as to an apparent omission, causing apparent untruth of an allegation, in an applicant\u2019s oath accompanying petition for patent.)\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing their action, in which they asked that Canadian Letters Patent Number 252,546, issued to the defendant on August 11, 1925, be declared invalid and adjudged cancelled. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nW. D. Herridge K.C. for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellants are manufacturers of Copenhagen and they own, by assignment from Erik Christian Bayer, Canadian patent No. 265,601, issued on the 9th of November, 1926, for \u201cprocesses of manufacturing porous building material.\u201d They were plaintiffs in the Exchequer Court and sought to impeach Canadian patent No. 252,546 for \u201ccellular cement products and processes of making same,\u201d issued on a date anterior to that of the appellants\u2019 patent, to wit: on the 11th of August, 1925, and owned by the respondent, who was the defendant in the court below.\nThe particular objection on which the appellants relied was that Rice was not the true and first inventor of the process described in his patent, because, prior to the date of his alleged invention, the same process had been invented by Bayer, in Copenhagen, and formed the subject matter of a patent issued in Denmark on the 2nd of July, 1923.\nThe action was dismissed1 and is now brought to this court by way of appeal.\nThe invention claimed by Bayer and Rice relates to a new building material consisting of a cellular concrete produced by mixing cementitious material, such as gypsum or cement, with a tenacious foam containing bubbles sufficiently strong to remain unbroken while the cement is being mixed and is setting. \u201cIt is stated that the bubbles displace the cement or other material with which it is mixed, and that a product considerably lighter in weight than that produced in the ordinary way from concrete mixtures is obtained, and further, that the cellular voids improve the heat insulating and sound insulating properties of the finished material.\u201d\nThe process thus consists in mixing a stable foam with a cement and in regulating the porosity by the simple expedient of making this foam mechanically rather than developing it chemically. It is identical in the Bayer patent and in the Rice patent. The product is the same in the one as in the other. And the trial judge found that \u201cboth Bayer and Rice had the same idea in mind.\u201d In fact, it was conceded at bar that both processes are the result of the same conception and the same invention in the popular sense.\nThe judgment appealed from also found that each inventor \u201cwas in good faith\u201d and that \u201cthey were working independently of each other.\u201d The only question for determination therefore was: As between the two, who was the first inventor in the legal sense; and the judgment held that it was Rice.\nThe decision of that question involves a consideration of section 7 of chapter 23 of the statutes of 1923, which was the legislation current at the time of the grant to Rice. It is as follows:\n7. (1) Any person who has invented any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others before his invention thereof and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country more than two years prior to his application and not in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to his application may, on a petition to that effect, presented to the Commissioner, and on compliance with the other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to such person an exclusive property in such invention.\n(2) No patent shall issue for an invention which has an illicit object in view, or for any mere scientific principle or abstract theorem.\nIt may be convenient to point out that the wording is different in some respects from that of the corresponding section in the Patent Act as contained in the Revised Statutes of 1906, and we shall have to consider how far, if at all, the effect of previous decisions is modified by the amendments made by Parliament. It will at once be noticed that, in the new section, the public use or sale for more than two years (N.B.\u2014In the statute of 1906, it was one year) prior to the application is now expressly stated to be public use or sale \u201cin this country,\u201d thus indicating on that point anticipation by Parliament of the judgment in Pope Appliance Corporation v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited[2]. A further change is that consent or allowance of the inventor is no longer essential to make public use or sale in Canada, previously to the application, a bar to the valid grant of a Canadian patent.\nThat part of the section, however, has no bearing upon the present litigation. Suffice it to say that, on the facts, it is abundantly clear that the appellants cannot rely on it for the purposes of their case. But the other parts of the section must receive careful examination.\nWe are now dealing with a process and may limit our discussion to that species of invention. Under section 7, to form a valid subject matter of a patent, a process must, of course, be useful\u2014and the utility of Rice\u2019s process is not disputed. It must also be new and its novelty must be such that it was \u201cnot known or used by others before the invention thereof and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country more than two years prior to (the) application.\u201d The validity of Rice\u2019s patent depends on the interpretation of this part of the enactment and its application to the particular facts.\nThe words \u201cnot patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country\u201d are new. They were not in the former section of the Patent Act. Except possibly for the express declaration that the provision applies to a patent or publication either \u201cin this or in a foreign country,\u201d these words, however, do not introduce new law. Subject to this exception, they are to be found in section 25 of the Act respecting Patents for Inventions, being chapter 34 of Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 22 Vict., 1859, and, no doubt, in earlier legislation. They embody a well known principle of patent law.\nSo far as it may be sought to apply that principle in this case, the matter may be disposed of at once. Rice applied for a patent in the United States on December 21, 1922. That application, the trial judge found, \u201ccovered the same subject-matter\u201d as his Canadian application. We agree with this finding and, on the record before us, we entertain no doubt that the case was fought, at the trial, on the understanding that Rice\u2019s United States application was substantially the same as his Canadian application. Now Section 8 (2) of the Act reads in part as follows:\nAn application for patent for an invention filed in Canada by any person who has previously regularly filed an application for a patent for the same invention in a foreign country which by treaty, convention or law affords similar privilege to citizens of Canada, shall have the same force and effect as the same application would have if filed in Canada on the date on which the application for patent for the same invention was first filed in such foreign country, provided the application in this country is filed within twelve months from the earliest date on which any such foreign application was filed, or from the passing of this Act.\nThe United States is one of the foreign countries affording \u201csimilar privilege to citizens of Canada.\u201d Rice, having previously applied for a patent in the United States, filed his application in Canada \u201cwithin twelve months * * * from the passing of (the Canadian) Act.\u201d Accordingly the trial judge rightly decided that \u201cRice\u2019s filing date in the United States is his Convention filing date in Canada.\u201d\nThat fixes the date of Rice\u2019s application for all relevant purposes as of the 21st December, 1922. It is not claimed that, before that date, the process was patented anywhere. There was no printed publication \u201cin this or any foreign country\u201d describing Rice\u2019s invention prior to the 21st of December, 1922.\nBayer filed his application in Denmark on the 11th of September, 1922. But a pending application in Canada is not open to the inspection of the public (Sec. 52 of the Patent Act). Information in relation thereto may be furnished only to the applicants or persons authorized by them (Rule 19). It does not therefore properly come under the designation of a \u201cprinted publication.\u201d It must, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed that the secrecy of application in Denmark is likewise safeguarded.\nMoreover, the use in section 7 of the word \u201cpatented\u201d in the same sentence: \u201cPatented or described in any printed publication\u201d determines the matter in our opinion, since it would have been quite unnecessary to enact that no person may in Canada obtain a patent for an invention already \u201cpatented * * * in this or any foreign country,\u201d if a mere application for a patent was to be taken as a \u201cprinted publication\u201d within the meaning of the statute, sufficient to preclude the grant of a Canadian patent for the thing therein described. (The Queen v. La Force[3]).\nThe filing in Canada of an application for a patent will, subject to the conditions prescribed in the Act, prevent a subsequent applicant from obtaining a patent for a similar invention. The filing of a previous application in a foreign country may have the same effect. In neither case, however, will it be because the application is viewed as an antecedent publication, but for other considerations presently to be discussed.\nSection 7 requires that the process be \u201cnot known or used by others before (the) invention thereof.\u201d It may be at least questionable whether these words are qualified by the other words \u201cin this or any foreign country,\u201d now inserted in the enactment after the sentence: \u201cand not patented or described in any printed publication,\u201d but whether they are or are not would seem to be immaterial, in view of the decision of this court in Wright & Corson v. Brake Service Limited3, that the words \u201cwhich was not known or used by any other person before his (the applicant\u2019s) invention thereof,\u201d are not qualified by the words \u201cin Canada,\u201d from which, \u201cas a mere question of construction of the statute,\u201d the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Canadian General Electric Company, Limited v. Fada Radio Limited[4] was \u201cnot prepared to differ.\u201d\nPrior knowledge or use in a foreign country is therefore sufficient. But, in the Wright & Corson case[5], Cady, who produced the anticipating machine, had been using it openly, in his public garage in Canastota, in the State of New York. That was, at least, a user in a public way; and the question whether antecedent knowledge or user not public was also contemplated by the section did not come up for decision. It has now become necessary that we should discuss that question; and we agree with the learned trial judge as to its importance and its difficulty.\nIn The Queen v. LaForce[6], Burbidge J. delivered an elaborate and considered judgment, in the course of which he said that the words \u201cnot known or used by any other person\u201d in their true meaning have reference not to \u201ca secret use or the knowledge of an earlier inventor or of those to whom in confidence he may have disclosed it, but to such a publication or use as affords the public the means of information or knowledge of the invention.\u201d His conclusion was that \u201cunder the patent law of Canada, a prior foreign invention, of which the public had no knowledge or means of knowledge is not sufficient to defeat a patent issued to an independent Canadian inventor.\u201d\nIn Gerrard Wire Tying Machines Company, Ltd. of Canada v. Gary Manufacturing Co.[7], the present President of the Exchequer Court expressed the same view:\nI cannot accept Mr. Anglin\u2019s proposition, as expressing the law, even with the evidence of the alleged inventor as to the conception being accepted as proven, nor can I agree that a \u201cphysical embodiment\u201d of the conception, which was never disclosed would void the patent of a subsequent inventor who had first and effectively disclosed his invention. It must be conceded I think, without qualification, that a mere conception of anything claimed to be an invention, that is concealed and never disclosed or published, is not an invention that would invalidate a patent granted to a subsequent inventor. To say that mere conception is invention or that a first inventor in the popular sense who has not communicated or published his invention is entitled to priority over a later invention accompanied by publication, and for which a patent was granted, or applied for, would I think throw this branch of our jurisprudence into such utter confusion as to render the law of little practical value owing to uncertainty. If this is the policy and meaning of the Patent Act, an inventor might safely withhold from the public his invention for years, while another independent but subsequent inventor of the same thing, who had secured or applied for a patent, and who had proceeded to manufacture and sell his invention without any knowledge of the undisclosed invention, would always be in danger if the prior inventor could secure a patent by merely proving an unpublished invention. The situation should not I think be changed by the production of drawings, plans, etc., evidencing the date of the prior invention, or even a physical embodiment of the invention by the alleged inventor. All this might be done and still be within the knowledge of the inventor alone, it having been kept a secret, and which so far as the public is concerned is no more effective publication than a mere conception uncommunicated to the public. There must be a publication or a use in public of a satisfactory kind in order to bar the claim of a subsequent inventor who discloses the same and first applies for a patent.\nAnd again (pp. 185-186):\nInvention without publication, in my opinion, is of no effect as against another inventor who discloses the invention and who applied for a patent. Whether this rule rests upon the principle of estoppel or laches, or for want of consideration for the monopoly inherent in a patent, or whether it is a rule of evidence which presumes against invention in law when undisclosed, it seems to me to matter little. It is a safe rule to follow. It imposes no hardship or injustice upon any person, it appears well within the letter and spirit of the statute and seems to have the support of weighty authority. It is a bar to the fabrication of evidence and other objectionable practices, and will render assurance to many whose position ought to be secure.\nWe have quoted rather extensively from this judgment, because it puts forward with great force the reasons in favour of construing the relevant words of section 7 as meaning \u201cnot known or used\u201d by the public.\nThe words \u201cby the public,\u201d however, are not in the section, and one must accept with caution an interpretation requiring the addition of other words to the language the legislator has seen fit to adopt.\nIt is not without significance that, in the same section, the words \u201cpublic use\u201d are to be found in a different connection. If a similar use was meant with regard to the time preceding the invention, it is likely that it would have been expressed in a similar way. In fact, there is a qualification in the language of the section, which rather repels the idea of the necessity for public knowledge or user. \u201cNot known or used by others\u201d is clearly a more limited expression than \u201cnot known or used by the public.\u201d The prior use or knowledge need not be widespread; if it be knowledge or use by more than one person besides the inventor and not confidential, it is sufficient and the language of the enactment is satisfied.\nWhat appears to us a conclusive argument is that, with such a construction, we adhere to the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words (See Lord Macnaghten in Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors[8]). This well known rule in construing statutes, leading, as it does in this case, to no absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency, should, in our opinion, prevail over an inference based on the assumed intention of Parliament to reward the discoverer who offers his invention to the public, or on the danger of opening the door to perjury and the fabrication of evidence. The reward of the inventor is a matter of policy for Parliament, and, after all, in the present case, the question is not one of Bayer\u2019s rights, but whether Rice is entitled to a monopoly as against the public. As was said by Lord Haldane in British Thomson-Houston Company Ltd. v. Corona Lamp Works Ltd.[9]:\nIf inventors have to be protected, so have the public. Every patent, if valid, restricts the liberty of other inventors, and confers a monopoly * * *. The stimulus to development due to the protection of the Patent Acts may prove to be less of an advantage to the State than would have been the stimulus to free production in the interest of the consumer. But with the question of policy your Lordships sitting as Judges have no concern. That question is for Parliament. We as Judges have only to interpret the law as Parliament has enacted it.\nAs for the incentive to perjury and the fabrication of evidence likely to result if proof of private knowledge is to be accepted, that is of course a serious danger; but it is of a character which the courts are not unaccustomed to dealing with.\nSince the judgments in The Queen v. LaForce[10] and in Gerrard v. Gary[11], a change has occurred in the phraseology of the section we are now discussing. It was then \u201cnot known or used by any other person,\u201d and, of necessity, the knowledge might, therefore, have been confined to one person. It now is: \u201cnot known or used by others\u201d and would appear to require that the knowledge be held by at least two persons other than the inventor. But whether it was or was not meant, by this substitution of words, to alter the law, it is needless to say that such prior knowledge must be demonstrated. Evidence of this character should be subjected to the closest scrutiny. Anyone claiming anticipation on that basis assumes a weighty burden which cannot be satisfied by mere proof of conception\u2014if, indeed, it can be said that conception alone constitutes an anticipating invention. Fortunately two recent decisions of the Privy Council afford us guides in this respect.\nThe first was rendered in The Permutit Company v. Borrowman[12]. It will be remembered that, in that case, one Spencer, in 1917, filed an application in the Canadian Patent Office for a patent for the use of greensand or glauconite for the purpose of softening water. In 1919, Borrowman filed a similar application. The Commissioner declared a conflict between the applications and the assignees of Spencer commenced an action in the Exchequer Court claiming a declaration that Spencer, and not Borrowman, was the inventor. Borrowman counterclaimed for a declaration to the same effect in his favour.\nThe Lord Chancellor (Viscount Cave) delivered the judgment of the Board. We reproduce the following passage (p. 359), stating the facts and the conclusion of the Judicial Committee:\nAs to the Respondent Borrowman, there is no question as to the date on which he made the invention. It is undisputed that in the month of November, 1913, he conceived the idea, that he then made some experiments for the purpose of testing it, that he actually made a few filters in which greensand was used for the purpose of softening water and sold one of those filters to a friend. In the year 1914 he made an application in the United States of America for a patent, but on that occasion without success. In June, 1916, having further developed his process, he made another application for a patent in the United States of America, which ultimately succeeded; and it is admitted that in the month of August, 1916, he put the invention fully upon the market.\nThose being the facts as regards the Respondent, the question is whether Mr. Spencer, the predecessor of the Appellants, has been proved to have made the same invention, in the true sense of the word \u201cinvention,\u201d before that date. Mr. Spencer gave evidence in this case, and he said that he had the idea, or (as in one passage in his evidence he calls it) the vision, of this process in or just before the month of May, 1912, and he referred to certain letters and other documents which he says indirectly corroborate his statement. This evidence is not strong, and is open to considerable comment; but it is needless to examine it in detail, because it appears to their Lordships that, assuming it to be true, it is not proved that there was an invention by Mr. Spencer within the true meaning of the statute. Mr. Spencer did not test his idea; he made no experiments for that purpose; he did no work for that purpose. It is said that he communicated the idea through his agent to a Dr. Duggan, who was then connected with the Permutit Company, and that Dr. Duggan tested it and came to some conclusion about it; but it is plain that what Dr. Duggan did he did for his own purposes, and not as the agent of Mr. Spencer. Mr. Spencer in his evidence makes that clear, for he says that he took a portion of greensand and carried it to his agent\u2019s office for the purpose of having it forwarded to parties in New York with the idea that they would do the necessary work and report to him, but that those parties were unknown to him, that he heard nothing from them, and they made no report to him; and apparently he did nothing whatever further until late in the year 1916, that is to say, at a date after Mr. Borrowman\u2019s invention was fully made and completed.\nThese being the facts, it appears to their Lordships that it is not proved that any invention in the true sense of the word was made by Mr. Spencer in 1912. It is not enough for a man to say that an idea floated through his brain; he must at least have reduced it to a definite and practical shape before he can be said to have invented a process. Still less could it be said that the invention as described in the Appellants\u2019 application for a Patent was made in that year 1912. If so, that is enough to dispose of this appeal.\nWe have it, therefore, that, for the purpose of section 7, \u201cit is not enough for a man to say that an idea floated through his brain; he must at least have reduced it to a definite and practical shape before he can be said to have invented a process.\u201d\nThe second decision of the Privy Council to which we wish to refer is that in The Canadian General Electric Company, Limited v. Fada Radio, Limited[13]. This was also (inter alia) a case of priority as between two inventors.\nThe application was made by the inventor, Alexander-son, on the 17th of September, 1920, and the patent was granted to his assignees, the Canadian General Electric Company, on the 15th of February, 1921. Among the grounds of defence raised by Fada Radio, Limited, was anticipation by the specification of a German patent granted, on the 23rd of June, 1919, to Schloemilch and Von Bronk, on an application made on the 9th of February, 1913, which, however, remained unpublished until the grant of the patent.\nTheir Lordships came to the conclusion that, upon the true construction of the respective specifications, the ground of anticipation by the German patent was not established and the attack upon Alexanderson\u2019s patent failed. But they also discussed the point now under consideration. After having referred to the particular words in section 7 and to the decision of this court in Wright & Corson v. Brake Service Ltd.[14], Lord Warrington of Clyffe, speaking for the Board, said (pp. 106-107): It undoubtedly overturns patent law as understood in England, for it is quite certain that in English law if A. applied for and took out a patent it would be neither here nor there for B. to come forward and say: \u201cI will show that I had already made the discovery, but I kept it to myself.\u201d A. had made a contribution to the public by showing them how to practice the invention. B. had made no such contribution, and therefore he had no rights in the matter. Also it obviously opens the door to defeat any invention, it may be after a long space of time when it has shown itself to be really valuable, by parol evidence which may be hard to check. Nevertheless, as a mere question of construction of the section, their Lordships are not prepared to differ from the Supreme Court on this point.\nHaving thus pointed out what he calls \u201cthe danger of the matter,\u201d his Lordship proceeds to state the facts and, again we deem it advisable to quote in extenso, because the passage is illuminating and places the conclusion in full light:\nAlexanderson had been enjoying the profits of his patent for many years, yet now it may be set aside not by Schloemilch and Von Bronk\u2019s specification but by what from the parol testimony may be held to be their knowledge. It must be clearly kept in view that the date of the knowledge or use by any other person is a date before the invention, not before the patent. This therefore lets in parol evidence to uphold, just as it has let it in to cut down. Now, taking the knowledge of Schloemilch and Von Bronk, as the Supreme Court has done, as at least ten or fourteen days prior to February 9, 1913, the date of the application for the German patent, how stands it here as to Alexanderson\u2019s invention? On February 4 Alexanderson wrote a letter to Davis in which he describes \u201cthe new system of tuning which I have devised,\u201d and he clearly sets out his method of tuning, as he expresses it, by geometrical progression. A copy of that letter was sent to Dr. Langmuir, who had had conversations with Alexanderson in January, and this is what he says about it, and the conversations he had: \u201cQ. I would ask you to state whether or not, as one skilled in the art, at that time, the letter formed a disclosure to you of the subject-matter of the Alexanderson patent later in suit in this action?\u2014A. This letter covers practically the same ground as the-conversations that I had had with Mr. Alexanderson during the preceding weeks. It gives a very clear summary of Mr. Alexanderson\u2019s ideas and describes the principles involved in the idea of tuning in geometrical progression, so clearly that it would have been sufficient even if I had not had any previous conversation with Mr. Alexanderson, to have enabled me to build the device and obtain the advantages of geometrical tuning which Mr. Alexanderson foresaw. Not only is the theory of the operation of this system described in this letter, but the means of accomplishing it by use of the audion is clearly described.\u201d The respondents\u2019 expert witness, Mr. Hazeltine, is asked as to this letter, and he criticises the use of the word \u201crectify\u201d used in it, but in cross-examination he admits that the writer is really referring not to a rectifier but to a type of audion which DeForest invented and which he expected Langmuir to improve.\nThe question really comes to this, and it is the root of the matter. The letter taken owing to Langmuir\u2019s evidence as being a mere reproduction,\n[Page 456\nof the conversation in January, shows the whole method, but indicates that one of the necessary parts of the contrivance must be of a certain quality. That is indicated by this sentence: \u201cThe device necessary to accomplish this is some form of high frequency relay which enables one high frequency current to control another high frequency circuit without the first circuit being influenced by the phenomena in the second circuit. Such a relay is the incandescent rectifier where the flow of current in the local circuit is controlled by a potential introduced in the path of the radiating energy.\u201d The well known relay was that of DeForest. It was suspected, though not actually proved, that it might prove too sluggish for a high frequency relay, but Langmuir improved on the DeForest relay and that was the relay that was included in the specification for the patent. Now, the Supreme Court has held that Alexanderson\u2019s invention was not completed till May, when, to quote their words, Dr. Langmuir had constructed audions which when tested were found to give a frequency in the relayed current equal to the incoming oscillations. The point is a narrow one, but their Lordships think that what is meant in the section by using the word \u201cinvention\u201d instead of \u201capplication\u201d or \u201cpatent\u201d is that what is to be considered is the description whether spoken to (sic) or put in writing which really gives the means of making the desired thing which is to be the subject of the patent. In other words, the arrangement as to the audion was complete. The invention was a tuning by geometrical progression associated with a suitable audion which the modification of the DeForest audion proved to be. DeForest\u2019s audion might do. If it did not, then a modification of it would. It is just analogous to saying that a certain part of a machine should be of a strength capable to bear such-and-such a strain without an indication of what the exact strength should be. Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that, fairly read, the evidence shows that Alexanderson had discovered his \u201cinvention\u201d in January, 1913, and therefore he is not hit by the fact which is assumed that Schloemilch and Van Bronk also discovered it in February, 1913, though they did not proceed to make practical use of that discovery.\nThe holding here, therefore, is that by the date of discovery of the invention is meant the date at which the inventor can prove he has first formulated, either in writing or verbally, a description which affords the means of making that which is invented. There is no necessity of a disclosure to the public. If the inventor wishes to get a patent, he will have to give the consideration to the public; but, if he does not and if he makes no application for the patent, while he will run the risk of enjoying no monopoly, he will none the less, if he has communicated his invention to \u201cothers,\u201d be the first and true inventor in the eyes of the Canadian patent law as it now stands, so as to prevent any other person from securing a Canadian patent for the same invention.\nComing now to apply these guiding principles to the facts of this case, we find that the commission evidence taken in Denmark establishes that in 1921\u2014almost a year before the earliest date to which Rice\u2019s invention can be carried back\u2014Bayer conceived the idea, disclosed it to \u201cothers\u201d (Maule, Jacobsen, Philipsen, Schnadorph), instructed experiments, made some on his own account and produced porous cement. Therefore, he had invented the process.\nThe learned trial judge disregarded that evidence because it did not indicate a disclosure to the public. As we have seen, it is now determined by authority that disclosure to the public is not necessary, under our law, to establish invention in the true sense of the word. On the other hand, the learned judge envisaged Bayer\u2019s invention from the starting point only of the Danish application and, as he considered that the specification therein was insufficient, he decided that Bayer had failed to establish priority over Rice. But he arrived at that opinion by applying to the Danish specification the rules governing specifications in section 14 of the Canadian statute. We do not think Bayer\u2019s application should have been judged by that standard for the purposes of this case.\nIn the passage quoted above from the judgment in Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd. v. Fada Radio, Ltd.[15], Lord Warrington said:\nTheir Lordships think that what is meant in the section by using the word \u201cinvention\u201d instead of \u201capplication\u201d or \u201cpatent\u201d is that what is to be considered is the description whether spoken to or put in writing which really gives the means of making the desired thing which is to be the subject of the patent.\nBayer invented a new principle and a practical means of applying it. He \u201cwas not bound to describe every method by which his invention could be carried into effect.\u201d (Terrell on Patents, 7th ed., at p. 144). The conception of the idea \u201ccoupled with the way of carrying it out\u201d (Hickton\u2019s Patent Syndicate v. Patents, etc., Limited[16], and \u201creduced to a definite and practical shape\u201d (Permutit Co. v. Borrowman[17]) constituted the invention of his process, which he communicated to others. The question of the validity of the Danish patent was not in issue\u2014far less that of the compliance of that foreign patent with the statutory requirements of the Canadian law. The only question in issue was whether the prior knowledge of the invention by Bayer, communicated as established by the evidence, anticipated Rice. The learned trial judge found that \u201cBayer preceded Rice in his conception of his alleged invention and in his experimental work developing the same\u201d; but thought that he had not yet made a \u201cworkable invention,\u201d when Rice filed his United States Application.\nHis opinion appears to have been formed largely\u2014if not altogether\u2014upon the fact that, at that time, experiments were still being made in the laboratory of Mr. Jacobsen, in Copenhagen. But those experiments were not for the purpose of discovering a method of carrying out the process; they were endeavours to make the foam \u201cbetter and better.\u201d\nBayer had completed his invention when he added a foam made of frothy substance to the paste of cement and got a porous cement product. In the words of Mr. Philipsen: \u201cYou may always try to make a thing better in working with it and there are innumerable ways of mixing cement, foam and water together.\u201d But Bayer had already found and adopted at least one method of mixing them effectively so as to carry out his idea. He tells us that, about New Year 1921, he conceived it by seeing his wife make a sponge cake, \u201cby seeing her mix the whipped white of eggs into the dough.\u201d He immediately went to his laboratory and, his shaving soap being the most frothy substance he had at hand, he used it to mix up with the cement paste, and it turned out that it immediately gave an excellent result. Later on he experimented with many different substances: ordinary soap, several kinds of mucilage, gelatine and gelatine mixed with formaldehyde. He produced samples and showed them to an engineer, Mr. Fox Maule, in the first days of September, 1921. He applied to Professor Jacobsen, at the Royal Technical High School, with similar samples. Mr. Jacobsen was interested and asked his assistant, Professor Philipsen, \u201cto help them with the work of that invention.\u201d The latter made experiments as a result of Bayer instructing him and showing him how to do them; and asked: \u201cQ. What was the product?,\u201d he answers: \u201cA. It was what we now call cell concrete.\u201d\nBayer sold his invention, in the spring of 1923, to Christiani and Neilson, who have since manufactured it with much commercial success.\nIt seems reasonably clear on the evidence that, so far as concerns the invention, the precise manner in which the foam would be produced was a matter of no consequence. This was decidedly Rice\u2019s own view, as appears from his specification, where he said:\nI have indicated above a number of substances and methods for producing the foam or froth which is to be added to the mortar, but I wish it to be distinctly understood that my invention, in its broad aspects, is not limited thereto, inasmuch as any foam, no matter how made and no matter of what it may consist, fails within the scope of my invention.\nIt was common knowledge at the time that a stable foam could be made from a great many well known mucilaginous substances. The experts agree that \u201cit is a very simple process,\u201d requiring no scientific training, and that any ordinary workman would be able to work. On that point, reference may be made to two short extracts of the evidence. Mr. A. E. MacRae, one of appellants\u2019 witnesses deposed:\nMr. Herridge: Now, Mr. MacRae, in those experiments which you have referred to, and which you say were based on this Bayer disclosure, were you in any difficulty in carrying them out because of the suggested scarcity of bubble in the Bayer disclosure?\nA. None whatever.\nQ. And why do you say that the Bayer disclosure contains adequate instructions to enable these experiments to be done.\nMr. Biggar: He has not said that.\nHis Lordship: He has said so inasmuch as he did it himself.\nWitness: The disclosure clearly discloses enough to enable anyone to carry out the process there described.\nHis Lordship: I understand you, Mr. MacRae, to say that everything about this is simple.\nA. Extremely simple.\nMr. Rice, the rival inventor himself said:\nMr. Herridge: Well, it is a thing (the process) that could be carried out by any practical minded person if the general idea is disclosed?\nMr. Rice: One would think so. Paraphrasing the words of Lord Warrington in the Fada. Radio case[18]: When Bayer went to Professor Jacobsen, the invention was complete. The process was the addition to the paste of cement of a stable foam, which the foam adopted by Bayer. \u201cproved to be.\u201d Bayer\u2019s foam \u201cmight do.\u201d It may be that other foam producing agents would equally do; but Bayer\u2019s foam was sufficiently effective to produce the porous cement.\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that Bayer had \u201cdiscovered\u201d his invention in September, 1921, or more than a year prior to the earliest date to which Rice can carry his invention back. He had then made it impossible for Rice to claim the invention at a later date (Alexander Milburn Company v. Davis-Bournonville Company[19]) and accordingly to secure a valid grant for it under the Patent Act\nThere remains one point to be disposed of. On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that the use of glue is a distinctive mark of the Rice patent. While Bayer, it was argued, suggests only mucilage as a foam developing substance, Race suggests glue in a certain specified form and has embodied the suggestion in certain specified claims, to wit: claims 13 and 18 of his patent. It is said that those are specific suggestions in respect of which he is entitled to his patent pro tanto and the court is urged to render a judgment in accordance with those facts under section 31 of the Patent Act.\nAssuming that, under the circumstances, the evidence justifies a distinction between mucilage and glue, and without deciding whether section 31 would, in a proper case, permit the court to discriminate in the way indicated, we do not think such relief can be granted in this case.\nUnder rule 14 of the Rules and Regulations of the Patent Office of Canada, made pursuant to section 59 of the Act and effective the first of September, 1923, \u201ctwo or more separate inventions cannot be claimed in one application, nor included in one Patent.\u201d The invention named and described in Rice\u2019s patent, in accordance with the imperative requirements of sections 13 and 14 of the Act, was declared as having for \u201cits particular object\u201d the providing of a \u201ccellular composition or product adapted to be used for walls, constructional purposes, fireproofing of the frame work of steel buildings and practically all purposes that concrete can be used for.\u201d The patent that Rice got is for the principle of producing a cellular or porous cement product by mixing a tenacious stable foam with a cementitious material. The patent is not for an invention consisting in a particular new method of applying the principle. In other words: it was not applied for, nor was it granted for the subordinate discovery of certain foam producing agents or mixtures such as may be specifically defined in claims 13 and 18. Rice did not claim that as a separate invention. His patent may not now be transformed into and restricted to a patent for that kind of invention.\nOur conclusion is that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and that Letters Patent number 252,546 should be declared invalid and adjudged cancelled, with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nWe think, however, we should not part with this case without taking yet another step. The Patent Act was enacted for the public and the grant of a patent is a matter of public concern. For that reason, attention should be drawn to the following facts: It was demonstrated, in this case, that the invention made by Bayer formed the subject-matter of a patent issued to him in the Kingdom of Denmark on the 19th of June, 1923, and there published on the 2nd of July, 1923, upon an application filed on the 11th of September, 1922. When application for the same invention was filed in the Canadian Patent Office on the 6th of December, 1924, the oath accompanying the petition to the Commissioner of Patents (taken by one who cannot escape the imputation of full knowledge of the matter) was to the effect that no application for a patent for \u201cthe said improvements had been filed in any foreign country except as follows: Germany, German Patent Application No. 111,020, filed on September 8, 1923.\u201d No mention was made of the Danish application or patent, and a material allegation in the declaration of the applicant was, therefore, apparently untrue. Possibly this circumstance is susceptible of satisfactory explanation and we do not wish to be understood as casting any reflection on anybody since the facts have not been fully investigated and ascertained. But we deem it our duty to direct that notice of this apparent omission should be sent by the Registrar to the Commissioner of Patents and to the Minister of the Crown entrusted with the administration of the Patent Act, so that they may be informed of this situation and enabled to act upon it as they may deem advisable.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Henderson & Herridge.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

The condition for the grant is that the thing so claimed be truly new and useful and that there be given out to the public a correct and full description of the mode or modes of operating the invention, as contemplated by the inventor. Held, also, that, to that extent, the jurisdiction of the courts is not limited by section 29 of the Act. By the very terms of the patent, the grant is made \u201csubject to the conditions contained in the Act\u201d and also \u201csubject nevertheless to adjudication before any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Therefore, unless the claims or the description or both comply strictly with the requirements of the Act, the monopoly should not be granted, and the patent is accordingly invalid and should be declared null and void.\nHeld, further, that obviously the decision on the point referred to above, depends upon the construction of the specification. It should not be construed astutely. The patent should be approached, in the words of Sir George Jessel \u201cwith a judicial anxiety to support a really useful invention\u201d (Hinks & Son v. The Safety Lighting Co. (4 Ch. D. 607, at p. 612) ); but, on the other hand, the consideration for a valid patent is that the inventor must describe in language free from ambiguity the nature of his invention, including the manner in which it is to be performed; and he must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege which he claims. Otherwise the specification is insufficient and the patent is bad.\nAt the trial, the depositions of three expert witnesses, who had previously been examined in Europe on commission, had been read and the testimony of a fourth witness similarly examined in Europe was about to be put in, when an argument took place as to the right of the respondent to call more than five of such witnesses without leave having been applied for before the examination of any one of them, as required by section seven of the Canada Evidence Act. The trial judge suggested that leave might then be applied for; and, notwithstanding objection by counsel for the appellant, the application for leave was held to be still in time and was allowed.\nHeld that such application was made too late and ought not to have been entertained at that stage of the proceedings. The application should at least have been made before the testimony of any of the witnesses examined on the Commission was read at the trial.\nSemble that, in a case tried before a judge, it should not be necessary, on account of the evidence so improperly admitted, to refer it back to the trial court, such as would have to be done in a case tried before a jury or by arbitrators (Canadian Northern Western Ry. Co. v. Moore, (58 Can. S.C.R. 519) ); but that it should be sufficient for an appellate court to disregard the evidence improperly admitted and to base its decision solely upon the record as it would then stand.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1927] Ex. C.R. 94) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the respondent\u2019s action to impeach a patent granted to appellant\u2019s author, for an alleged process to extract zinc from zinc lead ore by electrolysis.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. R. S. Smart K.C. and Henri G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., A. Geoffrion K.C. and R. C. Crowe for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J\u2014The action of the Electrolytic Zinc Process Company impeaches the Canadian patent no. 140,402 granted to Andrew Gordon French on the 14th of May, 1912, and now owned by French\u2019s Complex Reduction Company of Canada Limited.\nThe patent is a process patent for alleged improvements in the treatment of zinc and manganese sulphate solutions obtained in the hydro-metallurgical process for the extraction of zinc from zinc lead refractory ores containing manganese by the use of electrolysis.\nThe validity of the patent was disputed on several grounds which may be summarized as follows:\n(a) No invention;\n(b) Lack of novelty and anticipation; *\n(c) Lack of utility;\n(d) Insufficiency of the specification;\n(e) Wilful omission and misleading, deceptive or false statements in the specification;\n(\u0192) The specification did not specifically state or claim, and was not limited to, that which was the novelty, if any, of the alleged invention.\nThe trial judge, Audette J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada, held practically that all of these grounds of attack were established and, upon the conclusion of the argument, he delivered judgment adjudging the patent invalid and declaring it null and void.\nHe found that there was no invention;\nthat the defendant\u2019s patent does not possess any element of invention and (he could) in no sense, find any creative work of an inventive faculty which the patent laws are intended to encourage and reward; (and again) it cannot be found there was invention in the present case.\nHe found lack of novelty and anticipation:\nIt cannot be said that the improvement claimed lies so much out of the track of former use as to involve ingenuity of invention * * *\nDr. Ingalls (he said), a witness of unusual knowledge and experience in the metallurgical art, has described and considered with great competence, every substantial allegation in the defendant\u2019s patent and has demonstrated and established beyond any doubt that each and every one of them has been anticipated and belongs to the prior art. There is, according to his view, not one single element of the patent which is not found in the prior art.\nOn the ground of usefulness, the learned judge remarked that the patent \u201chas never been put into practice\u201d and \u201chas never been used commercially.\u201d He points out that \u201cNo purification is mentioned in the patent and it is in the evidence that purification is necessary\u201d; and further that \u201cThe patent does not show that the impurities must be taken out.\u201d Although he does not state whether he considers the absence in the patent of any reference to purification as insufficiency in the specification or as wilful omission, both misleading and deceptive, it may be noted that that statement in the judgment comes immediately after his reference to section 13 of the Act, and the averment that if the patentee \u201cdesignedly or unskilfully makes it ambiguous, vague or indefinite, the patent becomes obviously bad.\u201d He does say that \u201cthere is not in this indefinite and uncertain patent a new clearly and well defined process or method dealing with complex ore containing manganese,\u201d that it does not \u201cpoint out clearly the method by which the process is to be performed.\u201d\nFinally, he agreed with the Electrolytic company that the specification does not state or claim, and is not limited to, that which was the novelty, if any, of the alleged invention. If it consisted in\nfixing the proportion of manganese to be used, (that) does not amount to ingenuity of invention\u2014however valuable it may be, and it is not defined in the patent.\nIf the invention consisted only in the discovery that \u201cthe presence of manganese sulphate in the electrolyte is a benefit,\u201d the learned judge says\nthat no such statement as alleged can be found in any of the eight claims of the patent; and were it so, could it be a valid subject-matter under the circumstances of the present case?\nEven if it were in the specification\u2014a statement which I do not find \u2014if it is not embodied in the claims, it becomes publici juris. It has been given to the public. The patentee must define and limit with precision what he claims to have invented and I cannot find such a statement in the claims.\nAnd the learned judge concludes:\nThe use of manganese as mentioned in the patent, I am unable to take as a patentable improvement under the circumstances.\nFrom such judgment the French\u2019s Ore Company now appeals to this court. Whether in a particular case there is invention, novelty or utility is always a question of fact depending on the special circumstances and stands to be decided on the evidence of those having the technical skill and knowledge enabling them to understand the new art, machine, manufacture, process or composition of matter or the improvement thereon for which the patent was granted.\nThe subject-matter of the French patent is such that the specification must be envisaged as a description addressed primarily to persons possessing a not inconsiderable amount of chemical knowledge (Lord Parker in Osram Lamp Works Limited v. Pope\u2019s Electric Lamp Co.[2] ). The trial judge, in this case, had the advantage of the assistance of eminent chemists and metallurgists of several countries in Europe, America and Australia; men, as he rightly says, \u201cthe most qualified to speak upon this subject-matter in our days.\u201d For reasons which he gives\u2014and which have our approval\u2014he made his choice in the conflict of testimony. From his judgment on these points\u2014agreeing as it does \u201cwith the weighty evidence of the plaintiff,\u201d\u2014we are not prepared to differ.\nCounsel for the French company, however, drew our attention to the fact that, at the hearing of the case, the depositions of Messrs. Ashcroft, Cowper-Coles and Laszczynski, who had previously been examined in Europe, on commission, were read and put in evidence by counsel for the Electrolytic company. The testimony of yet another witness similarly examined in Europe, Dr. Victor Engelhardt, was about to be put in, when a discussion arose as to the character of these witnesses,\u2014whether they were professional or expert witnesses\u2014and as to the right of the plaintiff to call more than five of such witnesses, without leave having been applied for before the examination of any one of them, as required by the 7th section of the Canada Evidence Act.\nThe contention of counsel for the Electrolytic company was that the witnesses heard in Europe were \u201conly accounting for what they did\u201d and giving the results they obtained, that they were not \u201cexperts with regard to the validity of the patent.\u201d The learned trial judge held a different view and, for greater certainty, suggested that leave might now be applied for, to which counsel acceded without prejudice to his contention that none of the witnesses so far examined had given opinion evidence. Application was therefore made orally by counsel for the plaintiff for leave to examine five expert witnesses outside of those examined in Europe. Objection was taken by counsel for the defendant, but the learned judge held that the application was still in time and he allowed it.\nWith due respect, we think such application was made too late and ought not to have been entertained at that stage of the proceedings. The rule is clear that\nsuch leave shall be applied for before the examination of any of the experts who may be examined without such leave (s. 7-2).\nIn this case, the application should therefore at least have been made before the testimony of any of the witnesses examined on the commission was read at the trial. Their evidence became part of the trial as soon as it was put in. It already formed part of the trial when the application was made and the testimony of three of the witnesses had already been read and dealt with by counsel for the plaintiff.\nIn Canadian Northern Western Ry. v. Moore[3], this court, holding that s. 7 of the Canada Evidence Act had been infringed, set aside the award and referred the case back to the arbitrators. But this was a judgment in arbitration proceedings. No doubt also, in a jury trial, the like situation would have to be remedied in a similar way. In a case like this however, tried before a judge, the same result does not necessarily ensue. It should be sufficient, we think, to disregard the evidence improperly admitted and to base the decision solely upon the record as it would then stand. But we do not find it necessary to express an opinion upon the remedy, if any, to be applied, because of the views we hold upon other points, which do not depend on the evidence and which remain presently to be discussed.\nThe French patent was granted under the law in force in 1912. This was The Patent Act, to be found in Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, chapter 69. Under it, an applicant for a patent must present to the Commissioner a petition under oath giving the title or name of the invention and accompanied by a specification containing the claims of the alleged inventor. Under section 13 of the Act,\nThe specification shall correctly and fully describe the mode or modes of operating the invention, as contemplated by the inventor; and shall state clearly and distinctly the contrivances and things which he claims as new and for the use of which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\nIn compliance with this requirement of the law, French filed the following specification of his invention accompanied by the following claims. We shall omit those parts of the specification having reference to a process of calcination where bisulphate of sodium is used. That is covered by another patent against which the action was originally directed, but as to it a discontinuance was filed, and the process is not made an essential element of the patent in issue, it being distinctly stated that any other mode of calcination may be used for the oxidating and sulphating of the ores.\nThis invention has for its object the electrolytic treatment of zinc and manganese sulphate solution obtained by the lixiviation of calcined zinc lead and manganese refractory ores * * *\nThe mole of practising my invention is as follows:\nIn my process the solution of the sulphates of zinc and manganese resulting from the lixiviation of the calcined zinc lead and manganese ores either with a dilute solution of bisulphate of sodium, or with water acidulated with sulphuric acid is placed in electrolytic tanks of any convenient form which are provided with anode plates of lead, and cathode plates of zinc or any other convenient metal for receiving the deposit of metallic zinc. The solution of zinc and manganese sulphates should be as near the saturation as possible, say from 1\u00b725 to 1\u00b730 specific gravity and a direct electric current of a minimum of four volts is passed through the solution from anode to cathode. The proportion of manganese to zinc in the solutions may be from one-half to three-fourths, ie, one pound of zinc to from one-half to three-fourths of a pound of manganese, but the process works well with only an eighth part of manganese to one of zinc.\nAn immediate and constant deposit of reguline zinc takes place on the cathode plates, whilst a simultaneous formation of manganese dioxide occurs at the anode plates partly adhering thereto and partly falling as a black mud to the bottom of the electrolytic tank. The advantages of this formation of dioxide of manganese by the action of the current on the sulphate of manganese in the solution are threefold, namely: (1) Polarization by free oxygen at the anode is prevented. (2) Peroxidation of the lead anodes and consequent destruction is prevented. (3) The manganese in the solution obtained from the ores is recovered in a commercially valuable form. The solution obtained from ores poor in manganese may be mixed with that from ores richer in manganese so as to get a good average. The sulphuric acid originally combined with the zinc and the manganese in the solution as it reaches the electrolytic tanks is separated by the current from those metals. Then comes a description of what will happen if bisulphate of sodium was used in the calcination and the specification proceeds:\n* * * In the case of plain calcining of the ores without the bisulphate of sodium the liberated sulphuric acid remains free in the effluent liquor from the electrolytic tank and is used again for leaching fresh ores * * *. In order to obtain the highest efficiency in the electrolytic tanks, it is necessary to maintain the zinc and manganese solution at as high a strength as possible, and to keep the acidity from rising to such an extent as will cause a local back current at the cathodes, thereby diminishing the deposition of zinc. To effect these objects the solution is caused to circulate continuously between the leaching and the electrolytic tanks and not allowed to fall below 1\u00b72 specific gravity or rise above 2 per cent of active sulphuric acid.\nThe applicant is aware that attempts have been made to electrolyse solutions of zinc obtained from zinc ores, but owing partly to inherent defects in the roasting or calcining and largely to the absence of manganese in the solution, such attempts have never reached the commercial working stage.\nWhat I do claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent is:\u2014\nClaims:\n1. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in hydrometallurgical solutions obtained from zinc lead ores containing manganese, the deposition of zinc in reguline form.\n2. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in hydrometallurgical solutions obtained by treating zinc lead ores containing manganese, the deposition of zinc in reguline form on the cathode and manganese dioxide at the anode.\n3. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in hydrometallurgical solutions obtained by treating and leaching zinc lead ores containing manganese, the precipitation of manganese dioxide at the anode.\n4. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese from an aqueous solution of their sulphates and sodium sulphate, the regeneration and recovery of sodium bisulphate.\n5. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in an aqueous solution of their sulphates, the combination of the nascent oxygen formed at the anode with manganese and the consequent freedom from liberated gas.\n6. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in an aqueous solution of their sulphates, the combination of the nascent oxygen formed at the anode with manganese producing manganese dioxide and the consequent freedom from oxidation of the lead anode itself.\n7. In the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese in hydro-metallurgical solutions obtained by heating complex zinc lead ores containing manganese, with bisulphate of sodium and leaching, the deposition of reguline zinc on a zinc cathode and granular manganese dioxide on or in the vicinity of the anode and the regeneration and recovery of the bisulphate of sodium.\n8. In the separation of zinc and manganese by the electrolysis of a concentrated aqueous solution of the sulphates of these metals having a specific gravity of from 1\u00b725 to 1\u00b730 with a direct current of four volts or over, the precipitation of manganese dioxide at the anode and pure reguline zinc at the cathode. The object of the specification, as we have seen is to give a clear and distinct statement of what the alleged inventor \u201cclaims as new and for the use of which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\u201d The effect of the patent is to grant him, for a fixed period of years, a monopoly in what he has so claimed. The condition for the grant is that the thing so claimed be truly new and useful and that there be given out to the public a correct and full description of the mode or modes of operating the invention, as contemplated by the inventor. To that extent, at least, we do not think the jurisdiction of the courts is limited, as was urged upon us, by section 29 of the Act. By the very terms of the patent, the grant is made \u201csubject to the conditions contained in the Act\u201d and also \u201csubject nevertheless to adjudication before any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d And we take it that unless the claims or the description or both comply strictly with the requirements of the Act, the monopoly should not have been granted, and the patent is accordingly invalid and should be declared null and void.\nObviously the decision on this point depends upon the construction of the specification. It should not be construed astutely. The patent should be approached, in the words of Sir George Jessel \u201cwith a judicial anxiety to support a really useful invention\u201d (Hinks & Son v. Safety Lighting Co.[4]; but, on the other hand, the consideration for a valid patent is that the inventor must describe in language free from ambiguity the nature of his invention, including the manner in which it is to be performed; and he must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege which he claims. Otherwise the specification is insufficient and the patent is bad.\nNow if we come to examine the specification sent in by French, reading first the description of the invention and looking afterwards to what he has claimed, in accordance with the rule laid down by Lord Hatherley in Arnold v. Bradbury[5], we find that it describes a process wherein refractory complex zinc lead ores containing manganese are crushed in their crude state; these ores are then subjected to roasting or calcination, and subsequently to leaching or lixiviation with water acidulated with sulphuric acid, the resulting solution of the sulphates of zinc and manganese being placed in tanks wherefrom zinc is recovered in metallic form by means of electrolysis. At the same time as zinc is deposited in the electrolytic cells, the sulphuric acid is regenerated in the cells and sent back to the leaching tanks for the dissolving of new ores.\nIt is therefore a cyclic process for the treatment of zinc lead ores containing manganese by means of electrolysis. But the cyclic process for the recovery of zinc and all the general features of the process described by French had obtained in the prior art. Calcination and leaching in the manner suggested were well known and formed part of the common knowledge. Electrolysis is considered a very simple operation. It is one which had been used in many departments of metallurgy. On the other hand, in the specification no mention is made of purification. It is now conceded to play an important part in the process and Thomas French, the son of the inventor and himself a consulting metallurgist and chemical engineer, emphasized the necessity of purification of the solution (or, as he said, of obtaining a \u201cfinished liquor\u201d) before it went into the electrolytic cell. This was in a letter written by him, at the time when he went to Trail, British Columbia, for the purpose of experimenting with his father\u2019s process. He had previously carried on operations under the process jointly with his father; and, in that letter, he was answering certain questions that had been asked of him in writing by Mr. Stewart, one of the officers of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, for whose benefit the experiments were being made.\nIn explanation of the omission to mention purification, counsel for the appellant argues that leaching includes the purifying of the solution and that a skilled worker at the time of the patent would have understood that purification must therefore be read into the patent as forming part of the leaching operation. That is not what a reading of the specification suggests. It does not convey the impression that the patentee left out in his description anything which he expected craftsmen to read into it. He referred to every step of the operation in the order in which it took place,\u2014 whether in his own mind such step was a matter of common knowledge or whether it was not. Yet purification is not mentioned. Contrast this with the interpretation of the language of the specification put forward by some witnesses on behalf of the French company, to the effect that the invention consisted in the discovery of the properties of manganese in inhibiting the toxic effect of the impurities in the solution. This would dispense with purification by other means and, instead of inducing one to read such purification into the patent (as urged before us by counsel for the appellant), would rather lead in the other direction. The evidence being undoubtedly that purification is a necessary part of the process, as found by the trial judge, it may well be argued that the absence of any reference to it in the specification amounts to an omission wilfully made for the purpose of misleading.\nBut the most serious difficulty in the way of the appellant is that of finding in the specification in precise and unambiguous terms, both the nature and ambit of the invention which French claims to have made. The widely different constructions put upon it show in themselves how much it lacks in the clarity which is essential and which is indeed imperatively required by law.\nCounsel for the respondent expressed the view that French was making the whole claim of being the inventor of the application of electrolysis to zinc lead ores containing manganese. We do not think he does; but if he did, it would be conclusive against the validity of the patent.\nWe think the patent is only intended to cover a stage in the treatment by electrolysis. Experts heard on behalf of the French company thought the fundamental idea was the usefulness or beneficial effect of manganese sulphate in the electrolyte. Thomas French was put the question:\nWhat in your opinion are the essential features of patent 140, 402?\nThe answer was:\nThe essential feature is that manganese should be present in the solution.\nThis answer does not agree with his letter to Mr. Stewart of 12th January, 1915, already referred to. That letter is valuable at least to indicate how Thomas French understood the patent at the time and also what a metallurgist and a chemist reading the specification would understand from it.\nIt should be remembered that the patent deals with ores containing manganese. It does not pretend to deal with other ores. It will at once be apparent that no patent could issue granting the exclusive privilege of having manganese in a solution of complex zinc lead ores containing manganese. But assuming the beneficial effect of manganese sulphate in the solution, we are unable to find that the patentee made such a broad claim. Had it been made, the claim itself would have been sufficient to defeat the patent.\nThe appellant\u2019s position as to the invention was not so stated at bar by counsel. In the transcript of trial proceedings, Mr. Smart \u201cputs his case in this way\u201d:\nNow the electrolysis of a zinc sulphate solution was of course known before; and it was also known before that when zinc sulphate solutions were derived from a complex ore containing manganese there would necessarily be some manganese sulphate in that solution; but this patentee discovered that if that manganese sulphate were maintained in certain proportions and in a certain way that it had a beneficial result; and he added to that discovery a practical means of applying it. Now that in brief is the invention with which we are concerned here.\nMr. Smart maintained that position before this court. It requires some ingenuity to discover that that is what the description of the invention in the specification means. But be it so, while no limit is fixed in the patent, none of the experts regarded the reference in the specification to the proportion of manganese to zinc in the solution as forming part of the alleged invention in the sense that such proportion must be adhered to. We are told by Mr: Witherell that\nthe real range * * * is the highest possible degree of manganese to z:inc which you can get in the ore, or has been known of, as the maximum; and the minimum is down so fine and so low you could not discover it.\nThis would amount to claiming the whole range and if the patent were to be so read, it would be obviously bad. Assuming there was ingenuity in the conception of the idea that manganese should be maintained in the solution instead of being eliminated, such conception \u201ccoupled with the way of carrying it out\u201d might support a claim for the broad idea; Hickton\u2019s Patent Syndicate v. Patents, etc., Limited[6]. Admittedly French does not make such a claim. Neither could he claim all modes of carrying the idea or the principle into effect. In such a case, the words of Baron Alderson in Neilson v Harford[7], would be apposite:\nIn the first place, it is necessary to ascertain what the patentee has claimed as his invention; and, in the next place, if he has claimed the principle and all the modes of applying it, his claim will be indistinguishable from a claim to the principle itself and will be too large.\nFurther, it is shown that the proportions mentioned in the specification are of no importance; and no intention is apparent on the part of the patentee to ascribe to them any special significance.\nAccording to the appellant\u2019s own experts, none of the particular conditions set forth concerning proportion of manganese to zinc, saturation of solution, specific gravity, voltage or acidity have any real bearing as a means for obtaining whatever may be the beneficial effect of manganese. These proportions and these particular conditions were discarded by Thomas French, as appears from his letter to Stewart, while he was conducting operations at Trail, and also by Mr. Witherell in the experiments he made. In fact, the results of the latter would show that greater efficiency was obtained from a solution containing no manganese.\nThus far, while dealing with the specification, we have confined our attention to the description of the alleged invention; but, as was said by Lindley M.R. in Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Puncture Proof Pneumatic Tyre Co. Limited[8],\nwhether a patentee has discovered a new principle or whether he has not, his monopoly is confined to what he has already invented, and what he has claimed as his invention.\nIf we turn to the claims, we do not find in any of them the necessity of maintaining manganese, still less of securing in the solution a certain relationship between zinc and manganese sulphates. Each claim begins by the words: \u201cIn the electrolytic separation of zinc and manganese.\u201d No one reading those claims would imagine that the patentee thereby intended to \u201cclaim as new\u201d the idea of preserving manganese or a certain proportion of manganese in the hydrometallurgical solutions of zinc lead ores containing manganese. If the novelty or the utility of the process lay in the use of manganese in certain proportions, French had to claim it in order to secure for that use an exclusive property and privilege. And if he did not claim it, he may be taken to have disclaimed it. At all events, he made no claim for what is now suggested to be the invention, and there is no invention or subject-matter left in what he did claim and the patent is therefore bad.\nAssuming that the process was new, no claim was made for the process itself. Results alone are stated in the claims; not the process whereby these results are obtained. Through the operation of the ordinary laws of nature and on account of the inherent properties of manganese, these results are said to happen as a necessary consequence of the process for which no protection is claimed. It would follow that the process, if patentable, was given to the public and, of course, the natural results, for which alone claims were made, were not patentable. So far as they are involved, the grant made was wholly invalid.\nTo sum up our views, on this branch of the case, we think the specification is insufficient. It fails to comply with the conditions of clarity and distinctness required by section 13 of the Act and does not state in precise and unambiguous terms in what the alleged invention consists. If the descriptive part of the specification be construed as suggested by counsel for the French Company, the claims were not made to conform with it and they are inadequate for that purpose. We can find in the patent no other subject-matter patentable in law. The utility or the beneficial effect of manganese or of certain proportions of manganese are not what French\nclaimed as new and for the use of which he claimed an exclusive property and privilege.\nAt least, he did not clearly and distinctly do so. In the words of Fletcher Moulton L.J., the claim is\na separate part of the specification primarily designed for delimitation.\nBritish United Shoe Machinery Company Limited v. A. Fussel & Sons, Limited[9]. The delimitation must be clearly marked out. And, in conclusion, we will quote the following passage from Lord Halsbury\u2019s speech in The British Ore Concentration Syndicate Limited v. Minerals Separation Limited[10].\nThe statute requires it (the specification) to be a distinct statement of what is the invention. In construing a specification one has to remember that it is a document not only assuring a monopoly to the patentee, which but for the statute would be contrary to the common law, but so (also?) prohibiting any one, other than the patentee, doing what he would be free to do, but for the right which is granted, subject to the condition, among other things, that the patentee states distinctly what his invention is. If he designedly makes it ambiguous, in my judgment the patent would undoubtedly be bad on that ground; but even if negligently and unskilfully he fails to make distinct what his invention is, I am of opinion that the condition is not fulfilled, and the consequence would be that the patent would be bad.\u201d\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kavanagh, Lajoie & Lajoie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] [1927] Ex C.R. 94\n[2] (1917) 34 R.P.C. 369, at p. 391.\n[3] (1916) 53 Can.

Bethune (L.R. 4 P.C. App. 33).\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nLs. St-Laurent K.C. and Errol M. McDougall K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. and J. A. O\u2019Gilvy for the respondent T. Pringle & Son Ltd.\nGregor Barclay K.C. for the respondent The Foundation Company Ltd. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The respondent T. Pringle & Son, Limited, pursuant to agreement with the appellant, prepared plans and specifications for a dam to be erected for the appellant in connection with its mill on the North River at St. J\u00e9rome, and supervised the carrying out of the work as provided in the agreement. The respondent The Foundation Company, Limited, pursuant to agreement with the appellant, constructed the dam from the plans and specifications so furnished, and under the supervision of the respondent T. Pringle & Son, Limited, the work having been completed in August of 1919.\nIn March of the following year cracks were discovered in seven of the nine piers of the dam so constructed, which, appellant claims, necessitated extensive repairs and additional works to secure the stability of the dam, which both the respondents refused or neglected to make after request and which appellant, in consequence, was obliged to make at its own cost, which, it is alleged, amounts to $89,612.79. This action is brought to recover this amount from the respondents as damages, for which it is claimed they are jointly and severally liable.\nArticle 1688 of the Civil Code reads as follows:\nIf a building perish in whole or in part within ten years, from a defect in construction, or even from the unfavourable nature of the ground, the architect superintending the work, and the builder are jointly and severally liable for the loss.\nThe declaration does not expressly state that the claim is based on this article, and if the article were to be regarded as introducing into the law of the province a new statutory liability, questions might arise as to its construction and meaning. Such questions, however, have been settled to a large extent by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Wardle v. Bethune[1]. There the action was brought before the enactment of article 1688 of the Civil Code, but the appeal was heard after that enactment. At p. 52 of the report it is stated that articles 1688 and 1689 C.C. are declaratory of the law of Lower Canada as it was before the enactment of these articles, and are expressly founded on the case of Brown v. Laurie[2], affirmed on appeal by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in 1854, and not open to review because incorporated into the Civil Code. At pages 54 and 55 there is the following statement:\nThe broad general rule of law established by the case of Brown v. Laurie\u2014the rule certain for architects and builders in the execution of the works entrusted to them[3]\u2014is that there is annexed to the contract, by force of law, a warranty of the solidity of the building that it shall stand for ten years at least.\nIt is further pointed out that it was not decided whether this was to be taken as an absolute warranty or with an implied exception of cases in which the building gives way within the time, wholly or in part, from causes that could not have been discovered or removed by due diligence and competent skill, but it was decided that the approval and direction of a competent architect, or his omission to ascertain the nature of the soil of the foundation by known and available tests does not exonerate the builder from the consequences of following such direction or of building on the foundation without making himself sure of its efficiency.\nIt is also stated (p. 55) that when there has been a breach of warranty of the stability of the building, the onus is on the builder to shew that he is exempted from liability by some exception in his favour, which must be made out (if at all) by legal implication.\nTo this extent, then, the construction to be placed on article 1688 C.C. is authoritatively settled.\nIn appellant\u2019s factum a long list of authorities in the Quebec courts is cited to shew that it has there been uniformly held that the old law of Lower Canada as stated above and article 1688 C.C. apply to works such as the dam here in question, and this proposition is not contested in the factums of the respondents.\nMuch was said on the argument as to the onus of proof. On the authority referred to it would seem that on proof by the appellant of the contracts with the respondents and the construction of the work pursuant to these contracts and its failure for reasons stated in the article within the ten years, the onus would be on respondents to exonerate themselves from liability. The respondents, however, contend that the appellant, by alleging specific causes for the failure and by first proceeding to prove failure from these causes, placed on itself the onus of establishing these allegations. It is quite conceivable that a plaintiff, in making a prima facie case, might by the same evidence establish the existence of some condition which, without more, might be held to be the cause of the failure, and which, on such finding, would exonerate the defendants. In such a case a plaintiff might very well at the outset undertake to shew that such condition was not the cause of failure, and to establish the real cause. This may have been the reason for the appellant in this case alleging and attempting to prove facts which, as claimed in the declaration, it was not necessary to allege or prove.\nThe question of onus does not, however, seem to be very material here, because the question of whether or not the failure resulted from the conditions that the respondents claim exonerate them from liability is one of fact as to which there is much contradictory evidence, and as to that fact there is a finding in the courts below in the respondents\u2019 favour not arrived at by reason of onus one way or the other, but deduced from consideration of the contradictory evidence.\nWhat has now to be determined is whether or not this finding of fact on the evidence submitted should be reversed as the appellant contends, and, if not reversed, whether or not on that state of fact the respondents are exonerated, or are not to be held to have warranted stability under these conditions found to have existed and to have caused the failure. The conditions that the respondents rely on as exonerating them from liability are established solely by the appellant\u2019s witnesses, and are not in dispute.\nTo understand the relevancy of these conditions it is necessary to consider the design of the dam, and how, according to that design, it was intended to be operated to accomplish the object for which it was built.\n(Smith J. then makes an extensive review of the voluminous evidence produced at the trial by the parties and adds:)\nAccording to the decision of the Privy Council referred to, [4] article 1688 of the Civil Code imported into the contracts between the appellant and the respondent a warranty of the stability of the dam for ten years. This liability would not be different from the liability on such a warranty expressly written into the contracts, and would not apply where the use of operation is not in compliance with the design, and the failure is the result of departure in use or operation from the design. The departure from the designed mode of operation in this case is unquestionable, and the failure resulted from that departure, according to the finding already discussed. It is contended, however, that the respondents are nevertheless liable because they failed to instruct the appellant how to operate the dam according to the design. No authority is cited in support of this proposition and article 1688 C.C. does not purport to impose such an obligation. If it were deemed to exist, designers and contractors would be compelled at their peril to give instructions complete to the minutest detail as to the manner of use and mode of operation of every structure. In this case the appellant\u2019s engineers had, as such, expert knowledge of the construction, use and operation of dams. They had prepared plans themselves for the proposed development and collaborated with respondent T. Pringle & Son\u2019s engineer in the preparation of the plans adopted, and therefore knew all about the design and mode of operation. Henthorne says they had all the information required. Ruiter says he knew enough himself to take out the stop logs. He says Jenner, one of the respondents\u2019 engineers, told him the dam would operate itself, and, being asked what was meant by that, Mr. Ruiter answers,\nHe meant by that, \u201cYou would only have to take out the stop logs when the high water came.\u201d Those were just the words he said.\nLater he tries to explain this away by saying he did not understand the question, but that does not change his statement at all, because he was giving the words Jenner used, and they did not in any way depend on the form of the question.\n(Smith J. then Continues the review of the evidence and concludes that, upon the evidence, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.)\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, McDougall & Demers.\nSolicitors for the respondent T.

Co. for damages for alleged negligence in operation of what was formerly the Intercolonial (a Canadian Government) railway\u2014Defence of contributory negligence\u2014Application of provincial Contributory Negligence Act (R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 143)\u2014Canadian National Railways Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 172, ss. 12, 15, 33, 2 (a), 3, 16, 19, 21\u2014Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, s. 19\u2014Consideration by Supreme Court of Canada of question of law not raised below.\nPlaintiff sued defendant, the Canadian National Ry. Co., for damages for alleged negligence causing a collision, at Saint John, N.B., between plaintiff\u2019s omnibus and defendant\u2019s train, in defendant\u2019s operation of what was formerly the Intercolonial (a Canadian Government) railway. Defendant pleaded contributory negligence of plaintiff. The jury found, on questions submitted to them, that the injury was caused by joint negligence of the panties; defendant\u2019s negligence being in its flagman not remaining long enough to warn traffic properly, and plaintiff\u2019s being in insufficient attention of the bus chauffeur and excessive speed; that the proportions of fault were: defendant 90%, plaintiff 10%. Plaintiff recovered judgment for the damages assessed, subject to above apportionment, which judgment was, subject to reduction of amount, affirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division. Defendant appealed to this Court. The Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick (R.S., 1927, c. 143) provides for apportionment of liability according to degrees of fault. Its application was not questioned in the courts below, but was attacked by defendant (in its factum and argument) on its appeal to this Court.\nHeld (1): As the evidence upon which the question as to the application of said Act depended was before the Court and it was not suggested that any further proof material to its elucidation would or could have been produced had the question been made prominent at the trial, it was proper for this Court to decide it (The Tasmania, 15 App. Cas., 223, at p. 225; Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Kavanagh, [1892] A.C., 473, at p. 480, and other cases referred to).\n(2): The trial judge, in charging the jury, should have ignored said Act with its provisions for apportionment of the damages, and instructed the jury to ascertain the cause of the collision, and, if there were negligence on both sides, to find, by application of the principles of the common law, whether it was the negligence of the plaintiff or that of the defendant which operated directly as the effective cause. In the different course taken there was serious misdirection. This Court could not, therefore, do justice to the case upon the present findings, and there must be a new trial, subject, however, to defendant\u2019s election therefor upon terms imposed as to costs.\nDefendant, with relation to the Intercolonial Railway, was answerable only for the liabilities to which the Crown would have been subject if the railway\u2019s management and operation had not been transferred to defendant and the action had been brought in the Exchequer Court directly against the Crown; defences available to the Crown were available to defendant; (Canadian National Railways Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 172, especially ss. 12, 15, 33, also ss. 2 (a), 3, 16, 19, 21; and orders in council as to defendant company, of October 4, 1922, and January 20, 1923, considered); contributory negligence is a defence (Wakelin v. London & South Western Ry. Co., 12 App. Gas. 41, at p. 48); the Crown\u2019s, and therefore defendant\u2019s, responsibility was to be regulated by the general law of New Brunswick as it prevailed on October 30, 1887, when (in its original form) what is now s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, came into effect (Ryder v. The Queen, 36 Can. S.C.R., 462, and earlier decisions referred to therein; Armstrong v. The King, 11 Can. Ex. C.R., 119; 40 Can. S.C.R., 229, at p. 248); and, therefore, the provincial Contributory Negligence Act, which was not in force earlier than 1925, c. 41, had no application.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which, in effect, dismissed its appeal (except to the extent of reducing the damages recovered, from $3,711.60 to $2,933.20) from the judgment of Byrne J. (on the findings of a jury) for the recovery by the plaintiff against the defendant of damages in respect of a collision between an omnibus of the plaintiff and a freight train of the defendant on March 11, 1927, at Saint John, New Brunswick.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. By this judgment a new trial was ordered upon the defendant electing for it within thirty days, upon certain terms imposed as to costs; otherwise the appeal to be dismissed with costs.\nI. C. Rand K.C. for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. and A. M. Latchford for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) sued the defendant railway company (appellant) for damages sustained in a collision between the plaintiff\u2019s motor omnibus and a freight train of the defendant company, which took place at Saint John, N.B., on 11th March, 1927, at the junction of Marsh street, upon which the defendant operates a spur line of railway, and City Road, alleging negligence on the defendant\u2019s part by reason of excessive speed, absence of proper lookout and failure to sound its engine whistle and bell. These allegations of fact were denied, and the defendant moreover pleaded contributory negligence of the plaintiff, in that the plaintiff\u2019s omnibus was proceeding, without chains, at dangerous and excessive speed, and without maintaining a proper lookout. The train suffered some slight damage in the accident, and the defendant counterclaimed for this; but, as the damage proved to be inconsiderable, the counterclaim was withdrawn at the trial.\nThe case was tried at Saint John before Byrne J., with a jury, and the evidence adduced covers 127 printed pages of the case. The learned judge submitted questions, upon which the jury found that the accident was caused by the joint negligence of the parties, in the proportions of 90 per cent. on the defendant\u2019s part, and 10 per cent. on the plaintiff\u2019s part; apportionment being authorized by the general provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick, R.S., 1927, ch. 143, the application of which was not questioned in the courts below; and the jury assessed the damages at $4,124.11, which included $1,000 for the plaintiff\u2019s loss of the use of its omnibus while undergoing repairs. The plaintiff accordingly recovered damages for $3,711.60.\nThe defendant appealed to the Appellate Division of New Brunswick, where the findings were attacked on its behalf as unjustified by the proof, and it was contended that the action should be dismissed, or, in the alternative, that the damages should be reduced. The defendant\u2019s grounds of appeal were thus stated in the judgment of the Appellate Division:\n1. On the findings of the jury it appears that the legal cause of the accident was the negligence of the plaintiff and the action should have been dismissed with costs.\n2. There was no basis in fact or in law on which the jury could find the proportions of responsibility declared, and in the absence of such the damages should have been equally divided. 3. There was no sufficient basis on the evidence submitted to justify the jury in awarding damages of $1,000, for loss of use of the bus.\nThe court, upon consideration of these objections, reduced the judgment entered at the trial, holding that, in respect of the damage, amounting to $1,000, which the jury had found for the loss of use of the plaintiff\u2019s omnibus, there was no proof to establish an amount in excess of $135, and that the total recovery should therefore be limited to $2,933.20.\nThe defendant appealed to this court, and at the hearing, upon the assumption that the judgment was right in the particular which remains to be discussed, the court expressed itself as unwilling to disturb the findings or judgment of the Appellate Division.\nBut Mr. Rand, for the defendant, raised ingeniously a new and important point, which had not been considered or mentioned at the trial, or upon the provincial appeal. The point is, however, stated in the appellant\u2019s factum; and, as I understand the submission of the learned counsel, it depends upon the interpretation and effect of the Canadian National Railways Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 172; the contention being that the action is, in reality, against the Crown, and that, in relation to the undertaking which was formerly known as the Intercolonial Railway, the Canadian National Railway Company is no more than an officer or servant of the Crown entrusted with the management and operation; that the Act, and the executive orders thereunder, substitute the present method of administration for that which previously prevailed under the Government Railways Act (now ch. 173 of R.S.C., 1927) and are not intended to enable the company, either on its own behalf, or for the Crown, to assume any responsibility to which the Crown would not, in the like case, formerly have been subject; and, moreover, seeing that the Contributory Negligence Act of the province does not apply to or affect the Crown in the right of the Dominion, it cannot serve to alter the rights of the parties as they would, but for that Act, have been found to exist.\nIt was objected on behalf of the respondent that it is now too late to raise such a question; but the practice of this court has, I think, conformed very closely to that which is well established in England, and we have for our guidance the rulings of the House of Lords and of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in such cases as The \u201cTasmania\u201d[1], where the general rule is stated by Lord Herschell; and in Connecticut Fire Insurance Co. v. Kavanagh[2], a judgment of the Judicial Committee, in which Lord Watson says:\nWhen a question of law is raised for the first time in a court of last resort, upon the construction of a document, or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient, in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea. The expediency of adopting that course may be doubted, when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact, in considering which the Court of ultimate review is placed in a\u2019 much less advantageous position than the Courts below. But their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that the course ought not, in any case, to be followed, unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence upon which they are asked to decide establishes beyond doubt that the facts, if fully investigated, would have supported the new plea. To accept the proof adduced by a defendant in order to clear himself of a charge of fraud, as representing all the evidence which he could have brought forward in order to rebut a charge of negligence, might be attended with the risk of doing injustice.\nSee also Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[3]; Wilson v. United Counties Bank Ltd.[4]; North Staffordshire Railway Co. v. Edge[5].\nThe Order in Council of 4th October, 1922, constituting the company, is in evidence, also the Order in Council of 20th January, 1923, which recites\nThat the Canadian National Railway Company, hereinafter called the Company, has been brought into existence by virtue of an Order in Council passed on the 4th day of October, 1922, whereby certain persons were nominated directors of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 (now Section 3) of the said Act.\nThat the powers of the General Manager in respect of the Canadian Government Railways were heretofore entrusted by Order in Council dated 20th November, 1918, to certain persons from time to time constituting the Board of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, and that the powers of General Manager in respect of the Canadian Government Railways so entrusted are now being exercised by the persons who constitute the Board of Directors of the Canadian National Railway Company.\nThat it is expedient to terminate the authority of the said persons to act as General Manager of the Canadian Government Railways and to entrust in lieu thereof the management and operation of the said railways to the Company, pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 (now Section 19) of the said Act as above in part mentioned. The effect of said change will be to make applicable to the management and operation of the said railways many of the provisions of the said Act, and to accomplish the main purpose of the said Act as expressed in the recital thereto, namely\u2014\n\u201cto provide for the incorporation of a Company under which the railways, works and undertakings of the Companies comprised in the Canadian Northern System may be consolidated, and together with the Canadian Government Railways operated as a national railway system.\u201d\nAnd thereupon the Order in Council proceeds to declare\nthat the Canadian Government Railways, which for the purpose of section 10 (now section 2) of the said Act, shall include the following lines designated specifically\u2014\nThe Intercolonial Railway\nThe National Transcontinental Railway\nThe Lake Superior Branch leased from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company\nThe Prince Edward Island Railway\nThe Hudson Bay Railway,\nand as a general designation all other railways and branch lines, the title to which, and to the lands and properties whereon such railways are constructed, is vested in His Majesty, be by Order in Council entrusted in respect of the management and operation thereof to the Company on the terms in the said Act expressly specified, namely, that such management and operation shall continue during the pleasure of the Governor in Council and shall be subject to termination or variation from time to time in whole or in part by the Governor in Council.\nIt is also provided \u201cthat the Order in Council of November 20, 1918, above referred to, be cancelled.\u201d\nIn these circumstances, it appears that the evidence upon which the controversy now under consideration depends is before the court; and it is not suggested that any further proof material to the elucidation of the question would or could have been produced if the point now raised had been made prominent at the trial. Consequently, following the practice above explained, I shall proceed to consider the merits of the appellant\u2019s contention.\nIt is necessary briefly to consider the relevant provisions of sec. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 34. By that section, which, in its original form, came into effect on 30th October, 1887, when the Exchequer Court was constituted, it is enacted:\u2014\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work. (d) Every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council;\n* * * * *\n(f) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury or loss to the person or to property caused by the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon, in or about the construction, maintenance or operation of the Intercolonial Railway or the Prince Edward Island Railway.\nThese clauses must be read in the light of the decisions, of which the earlier leading examples are mentioned in the case of Ryder v. The King[6]; and by these and the later authorities it is well established in this Court that not only does the Exchequer Court acquire jurisdiction to adjudicate the classes of claims above described, but also that in such cases liability is imposed upon the Crown to respond in damages for the negligence of its officers or servants where, in the like circumstances, such a liability would rest upon a subject corporation or individual according to the law of the province in which the claim arose, as that law existed at the time when the Exchequer Court Act began to operate.\nThe judge of the Exchequer Court reviewed the cases in Armstrong v. The King[7], He said:\u2014\nIt may be taken to be settled by the general concurrence of judicial opinion in the cases referred to that it was the intention of Parliament that the liability of the Crown should be determined by the general laws of each province in force at the time when such liability was imposed:\nAnd he proceeds to explain, and to elaborate his view. This judgment was maintained by the Supreme Court[8], Davies J. (afterwards the Chief Justice) saying, at page 248:\u2014\nOn all the legal points debated so fully at bar I am in agreement with the conclusion of the learned trial judge. I think our previous decisions have settled, as far as we are concerned, the construction of the clause (c) of the 16th section of the Exchequer Court Act, and determined that it not only gave jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court but imposed a liability upon the Crown which did not previously exist, and also that such liability was to be determined by the general laws of the several provinces in force at the time such liability was imposed and that the case at bar is within the provision of the above cited amendment.\nAnd an application for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was refused.\nIn this state of the authorities, I do not consider that the court is now at liberty to take a different view as to the interpretation of the statute; and, if the defendant company, with relation to the Intercolonial Railway, answers only for the liabilities to which the Crown would have been subject if the management and operation of the railway had not been transferred to the company; and, if the responsibility of the Crown is to be regulated by the law of New Brunswick as it prevailed on 30th October, 1887, there is, of course, no authority for the application of the provincial Contributory Negligence Act, which was in force not earlier than chapter 41 of New Brunswick, 1925.\nThat Act, as revised, now appears as ch. 143 of the Revision of 1927, and it provides:\u2014\n2. Where by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault:\nProvided that:\n(a) If having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, the liability shall be apportioned equally, and\n(b) Nothing in this section shall operate so as to render any person liable for any loss or damage to which his fault has not contributed.\n3. In actions tried with a jury the amount of damage, the fault (if any), and the degrees of fault shall be questions of fact for the jury.\nQuestions were submitted to the jury, and the material findings were these:\u2014\n5. Was the injury suffered in the collision caused by the joint negligence of the servants of the plaintiff and defendant company?\u2014A. Yes.\n6. If so, in what proportion do you say that each party was at fault? \u2014A. Defendant: 90 per cent. Plaintiff: 10 per cent.\n9. If the injury suffered was caused by the joint negligence of the plaintiff and defendant,\n(a) In what did the negligence of the servants of the defendant consist?\u2014A. The flagman did not remain in the street sufficiently long enough to properly warn vehicular or pedestrian traffic.\n(b) In what did the negligence of the servant of the plaintiff company consist?\nA. Not sufficient attention was paid by the bus chauffeur to the entrance of Marsh Street, and he was exceeding the limit of speed set by the City of Saint John.\nTherefore, in a case controlled by these findings, the Contributory Negligence Act, if it apply, is apt so to operate as to compel the defendant company to bear a part of the loss, which it might otherwise have entirely escaped by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. Hence the question now raised as to whether the Crown has, by the effect of the Orders in Council under the Canadian National Railways Act, so enlarged or affected its liabilities with respect to the operation of the Intercolonial Railway-as to become subject to the general legislation of the respective provinces in which the railway operates as it may, from time to time, exist.\nThe governing provisions of the Canadian National Railways Act are these:\u2014\nBy sec. 2 (a), the expression \u201cCanadian Government Railways\u201d includes all railways and parts thereof\nor interests or any of them as may be designated, whether generally or in detail, in any Order in Council from time to time subsisting, entrusting the management and operation thereof to the Company under the provisions of section nineteen of this Act.\nThe incorporation of the company is provided for by sec. 3, whereby the Governor in Council nominates directors, and thereupon the persons so nominated and their successors, and others who may from time to time be nominated in like manner as directors, \u201cshall be and are hereby incorporated as a company, under the name of Canadian National Railway Company.\u201d\nBy sec. 12,\nThe Company may, in respect of the operation of its lines of railway or the lines of railway of the Canadian Northern System or the Canadian Government Railways, use the name \u201cCanadian National Railways\u201d as a collective or descriptive designation of all lines of railway or railway works under its control, without, however, affecting the rights or liabilities of any of the respective corporations, including His Majesty, for any of their respective acts or omissions.\nThere is a pertinent suggestion in the last three lines, and it should be recalled in connection with sec. 33, which I shall presently quote.\nSection 15 is a more important section; it reads as follows:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything in the Government Railways Act or the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, all expenses incurred in connection with the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways, under the provisions of this Act, shall be paid out of the receipts and revenues of the Canadian Government Railways.\n2. In the event of a deficit occurring at any time during any fiscal year the amount of such deficit shall from time to time be payable by the Minister of Finance out of any unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, the amounts paid by the said Minister under this section to be included in the estimates submitted to Parliament at its first session following the close of such fiscal year; and in the event of a surplus existing at the close of any fiscal year such surplus shall be paid into the said fund. Section 16 provides that, notwithstanding anything in the Government Railways Act or any other Act, the provisions of the Railway Act respecting the operation of a railway shall apply to such of the Canadian Government Railways\nas would but for the passing of this Act be subject to the Government Railways Act, during such time as the operation and management thereof is entrusted to the Company under the provisions of this Act.\nI have not discovered that, for present purposes, this substitution of the Railway Act for the Government Railways Act makes any material difference; but there are sections 385 and 419 of the Railway Act that should not escape attention, if, upon a new trial, it should be found that the negligence causing the accident consists in breach of their provisions.\nBy section 19,\nThe Governor in Council may from time to time by Order in Council entrust to the Company the management and operation of any lines of railway or parts thereof, and any property or works of whatsoever description, or interests therein, and any powers, rights or privileges over or with respect to any railways, properties or works, or interests therein, which may be from time to time vested in or owned, controlled or occupied by His Majesty, or such part or parts thereof, or rights or interests therein, as may be designated in any Order in Council, upon such terms and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Governor in Council may from time to time decide; such management and operation to continue during the pleasure of the Governor in Council and to be subject to termination or variation from time to time in whole or in part by the Governor in Council.\nBy section 21 the company may, with the consent of the Governor in Council, construct and operate railway lines, branches and extensions.\nAnd, finally, by section 33, it is enacted that\nActions, suits or other proceedings by or against the Company in respect of its undertaking or in respect of the operation or management of the Canadian Government Railways, may, in the name of the Company, without a fiat, be brought in, and may be heard by any judge or judges of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada, with the same right of appeal as may be had from a judge sitting in court under the rules of court applicable thereto.\n2. Any defence available to the respective corporations, including His Majesty, in respect of whose undertaking the cause of action arose shall be available to the Company, and any expense incurred in connection with any action taken or judgment rendered against the Company in respect of its operation or management of any lines of railway or properties, other than its own lines of railway or properties, may be charged to and collected from the corporation in respect of whose undertaking such action arose. When, in the concluding lines of subs. 2 of sec. 33, it is provided that any expense incurred in connection with any action taken or judgment rendered against the company in respect of its operation or management of any lines of railway or properties, other than its own lines of railway or properties, \u201cmay be charged to and collected from the corporation in respect of whose undertaking such action arose,\u201d it is meant, I think, that it is the Canadian National Railway Company by which the charge may be made and collected, and that the word \u201ccorporation\u201d must be taken to include His Majesty, because, at the beginning of the subsection, His Majesty is expressly included among the corporations to which the subsection applies.\nNow, of course, if the Canadian National Railways Act had not been passed, and if the Intercolonial Railway were still working under the former system, this action would have been brought against the Crown, and, by the ordinary procedure of the Exchequer Court, a fiat would have been requisite; but, from the last quoted section, which declares that such an action may be brought against the company without a fiat in any court of competent jurisdiction, it reasonably follows that a provincial court, having general jurisdiction in cases of tort, may entertain an action against the company to recover damages for negligence in the operation of the railway which could formerly have been adjudged against the Crown in the Exchequer Court, and may determine the liability and declare and enforce it against the company where the Exchequer Court could, under the former procedure, have authorized the recovery.\nThen, while by sec. 12 it is suggested that the rights or liabilities of His Majesty are not to be affected by the incorporation of the Canadian Government Railways in the Canadian National Railway System, it is plainly enacted by subs. 2 of sec. 33 that, as to actions against the company in respect of the operation of the Canadian Government Railways, defences available to His Majesty shall be available to the company; and contributory negligence is a defence; Wakelin v. London and South Western Ry. Co.[9]; moreover, by the same subsection, and by sec. 15, the liabilities incurred are chargeable to His Majesty, and therefore it seems plain enough that it was not intended to charge the company with any greater obligation than that which the Crown would have incurred if, in the absence of these provisions, the action had been instituted in the Exchequer Court directly against the Crown.\nFrom these considerations it results that there was serious misdirection in the learned judge\u2019s charge to the jury. If I am right in my conclusions, he should have ignored the Contributory Negligence Act, with its provisions for apportionment of the damages, and instructed the jury to ascertain the cause of the collision, and, if there were negligence on both sides, to find, by the application of the principles of the common law, whether it was the negligence of the plaintiff, or that of the defendant, which operated directly as the effective cause. It is impossible, therefore, to do justice to the case upon the present findings, and there must be a new trial, if the defendant so elect, having regard to the terms which, I think, should reasonably be imposed; and it seems only right that the plaintiff should not, in any event, be put to expense by reason of the costs of the trial and of the appeal to the Appellate Division of New Brunswick, which have been lost by reason of the defendant\u2019s failure to raise, in the lower courts, the contention upon which it now succeeds. Therefore I think that this appeal may properly be disposed of by a direction that there should be a new trial upon payment by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s costs of the former trial and of the appeal to the Appellate Division, as between solicitor and client, and that the costs of the present appeal shall abide the event, subject, however, to the condition that the defendant must so elect within thirty days; and, if the defendant do not comply with these terms, that this appeal shall be dismissed with costs.\nNew trial ordered upon appellant electing within 30 days to take the same, on certain terms imposed as to costs; should appellant not so elect within 30 days, appeal to be dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Thomas J.

Its engineer interviewed T. who assented, with certain stipulations, to the work being done. In 1915 a contract was prepared between the municipality and a contractor for the doing of the work and the municipality passed by-law no. 837 authorizing this contract, which was then executed, and the work was done. In 1928 the municipality passed) by-law no. 1987 enacting that a certain other drain running through the land (which was then owned by defendants) \u201cbe cleaned, altered and deepened\u201d according to plans, etc., and that the municipality\u2019s officers, servants, etc., \u201care hereby authorized and empowered to enter upon said land for the aforesaid purpose;\u201d and the work was done. In 1929 defendants blocked up both drains, and the municipality sued in the County Court for damages. The question was as to the municipality\u2019s right to make and maintain the said works.\nHeld: As to the first work, the municipality could not recover judgment based on an equitable right to make and maintain the ditch by reason of T.\u2019s assent, and execution of the work in pursuance thereof, as the County Court had no jurisdiction, even in the absence of objection by either party, to hear and determine an equitable right of this character; but, as to both works, under s. 590 of the Municipal Act, R.S.M., 1913, c. 133, the municipality had the power, having passed a by-law for the purpose, to do the work in question (without expropriating any land under s. 574) subject to the owner\u2019s right to compensation. Each of said by-laws was sufficient, for the purpose of s. 590, as authority for the Work done in pursuance of it, although bylaw no. 837 was not drawn in the form that a skilled draughtsman would adopt. Defendants\u2019 certificate of title was subject to said statutory rights of the municipality. Defendants\u2019 rights were confined to claiming compensation, to be determined as provided in the Act.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 38 Man. R., 527, reversed in part. APPEAL by the defendants (by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba), and cross-appeal by the plaintiff, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which maintained in part and reversed in part the judgment of McPherson, C.C.J., in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff is a Rural Municipality in the province of Manitoba, and brought action in the County Court of Winnipeg, in said province, claiming damages against the defendants for blocking up certain drain work done by the plaintiff on land now belonging to the defendants. The real question in issue was whether or not the plaintiff was within its rights in making and maintaining the works in question. McPherson, C.C.J., gave judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants\u2019 appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed in part, and the judgment below varied by reducing the damages awarded, the court holding that the defendants were justified in stopping up one of the ditches in question, but had no right to stop up the other one1.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The defendants\u2019 appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, and the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal allowed with costs both in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. and J. K. Morton for the appellants.\nF. Heap K.C. and C. Isbister for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014Prior to the year 1915, the late Honourable John Taylor was the owner of a large tract of land at and around Headingley, in the respondent municipality. The natural drainage of these and neighbouring lands was in a southeasterly direction, passing south of Portage Avenue, through a depression or ravine on the Taylor property to the Assiniboine River. The late Mr. Taylor granted these lands to himself and wife for life, and, after their death, to his daughters, the appellants. There was a small artificial ditch passing from a culvert at Portage Avenue through the ravine mentioned, and also a small ditch on the north side of Portage Avenue, leading to the culvert. The late Honourable John Taylor had endeavoured to get relief from surface water lying on part of his lands at Headingley, but nothing was done until about 1915, when Portage Avenue was being paved. This resulted in bringing water more quickly to the culvert crossing Portage Avenue, and it became necessary to enlarge this culvert and provide an enlarged outlet. The respondent municipality, about this time, instructed its engineer, G. W. Rogers, to interview the Honourable John Taylor in reference to the proposed enlargement of the ditch south of Portage Avenue on his property, and a meeting was brought about by Councillor Taylor, a son of the Honourable John Taylor, at the property, at which the two Taylors and Mr. Rogers were present. Mr. Rogers explained what was proposed to be done, and the Honourable John Taylor asked that the culvert across the existing ditch be enlarged, and that some of the dirt be put north, to improve the grade, and that otherwise no dirt be left on his property. With these stipulations, he assented to the municipality entering and doing the work.\nPlans and specifications were prepared by the engineer, and tenders asked for, and the tender of Elgin Real was accepted. An agreement was accordingly prepared between the municipality and Elgin Real, bearing date the 25th May, 1915, for building and completing the proposed ditch; and on the 1st June, 1915, a by-law of the municipality, No. 837, was passed, authorizing the entering into of this contract with Elgin Real, \u201cfor building an open drain running in a southeasterly direction from the northeast corner of the Headingley Ferry Road, as shewn on profile prepared by G. W. Rogers, Municipal Engineer, and marked No. 2 by him,\u201d and instructing and authorizing the Reeve and Clerk of the municipality to sign an agreement with Real attached to the by-law and marked \u201cA\u201d; and to attach the seal of the municipality thereto. The contract was accordingly signed, and the work completed and paid for by the municipality. On the 19th day of September, 1928, the respondent municipality passed a by-law, No. 1987, to provide for the cleaning, deepening and altering of a certain drain on lots 50, 51 and 52 of the Parish of Headingley north of Portage Road, commencing at the municipal ditch on Dodds Street opposite a dry well put down by the municipality, and running thence in a southeasterly direction to the culvert under the C.P. Ry. tracks and along the railway tracks and opposite the Headingley Agricultural grounds. This by-law enacted that\nThe said drain be cleaned, altered and deepened, in accordance with the recommendations, plans and specifications, of William Fulton, District Engineer, for the Provincial Government, heretofore annexed marked Exhibit A and identified by the signature of the Reeve and Secretary-Treasurer, and that said work be carried out under the supervision and direction of Councillor Taylor, of Ward No. 1, Headingley; and the officers of the Municipality its servants, agents and workmen, are hereby authorized and empowered to enter upon said land for the aforesaid purpose.\nThe work was carried out accordingly. This drain passes through the lands of the appellants lying north of Portage Avenue.\nIn the year 1929, the appellants caused both of these drains to be blocked up, and the respondent municipality brought action in the County Court against the appellants for damages for this alleged wrongful act of the appellants, and were awarded the sum of $22, the amount agreed on as the cost of removing the obstructions.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] varied the judgment of the court below by reducing the damages to $11, holding that the municipality had the right to maintain the ditch south of Portage Avenue, and that the appellants had wrongfully blocked the same, but that the municipality had no right to make the ditch on appellants\u2019 lands north of Portage Avenue, and that therefore the appellants had committed no wrong in blocking the same.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal as to the ditch south of Portage Avenue proceeds upon the ground of the equitable right of the municipality to make and maintain the ditch by reason of the assent of the late Honourable John Taylor and the execution of the work in pursuance of that assent. It seems quite clear that the County Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine an equitable right of this character, but the Court of Appeal deals with it because no objection was taken by either party to the jurisdiction. This lack of objection, however, would not confer jurisdiction, and the conclusion arrived at as to the ditch south of Portage Avenue cannot be upheld, as a judgment for the enforcement of an equitable right.\nThe ground relied upon as respondent\u2019s justification for the ditch south of Portage Avenue is by-law No. 837; and for the ditch north of Portage Avenue is by-law No. 1987. In the Court of Appeal it is stated that the municipality had no right to enter upon the appellant\u2019s land and construct a ditch without taking the necessary proceedings to expropriate the property required for the purpose, and it is pointed out that section 574 (a) of the Municipal Act, R.S.M., 1913, ch. 133, gives the power to expropriate land required for the construction of a ditch through the appellants\u2019 land. Section 574 does not seem to have any relation to the ditches in question in this action. The section upon which the respondent relies is section 590, under which the council of every municipality is given power to pass bylaws for opening, making, preserving, improving, maintaining, repairing, flushing, widening, altering, diverting, stopping up and pulling down drains, sewers or water courses within the jurisdiction of the council; and for entering upon, breaking up, taking or using any land in or adjacent to the municipality in any way necessary or desirable, in the opinion of the council, for the said purposes, or for the purpose of providing an outlet for any drain, sewer or water course, or for the purpose of carrying off through private property any water on a public highway; but subject always to the payment of compensation to persons who may suffer injury therefrom. Under this section it is not necessary to expropriate the land, and no notice whatever to the owner of the lands to be entered upon is provided for. The moment that work of the kind mentioned is done upon the owner\u2019s land, under authority of a by-law, the owner\u2019s right to compensation arises for any injury suffered therefrom.\nBy-law No. 837 is not drawn in the form that a skilled draughtsman would adopt, but it authorizes the doing of the very thing that the municipality is authorized to do by bylaw; and the municipality and its contractor entered upon the lands in question in pursuance of this by-law. It is true that the engineer in the first place talked the matter over with the late Honourable John Taylor, the owner of the lands, and explained to him the nature of the contemplated work, and intimated that his wishes as to enlargement of the culvert on his lands and disposal of the material would be complied with. Mr. Taylor assented to the work being done, but his assent was in no way necessary, because the municipality had, under the statute, full authority to pass the by-law and carry out the work without any such assent.\nThe by-law, No. 1987, authorizing the work that was done north of Portage Avenue, is in better form, and fully authorizes the work under section 590 referred to, and the appellants\u2019 rights in connection with that work are, as in the other case, confined to claiming compensation, as provided by that section.\nThe method of determining, by arbitration, in case of dispute, the amount of compensation for injury occasioned is provided by the statute.\nThe certificate of title is subject to the statutory rights conferred upon the municipality, under section 590.\nThe judgment of the trial judge should therefore be restored, with costs to the respondent of this appeal and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs. Cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Jacob, Morton & Irwin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Isbister & Morton.\n[1] 38 Man. R. 527; [1930] 1 W.W.R., 500.\n1 38 Man.

The Crown appealed.\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. dissenting): The licence was revocable at the Postmaster General\u2019s discretion. He had no authority to grant it so as to bind his successor or the country at a future time. It is of the quality of a licence that it shall be revocable. An implied covenant in this case not to exercise his power of revocation would be in excess of his powers to bind the Crown. A minister cannot by agreement deprive himself of a power which is committed to him to be exercised from time to time as occasion may require in the public interest, or validly covenant to refrain from the use of that power when it may be requisite, or expedient in his discretion, upon grounds of public policy, to execute it (Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald, 8 App. Cas., 623). The question was one of statutory administration of the public service; the Minister could depute the performance of his duties only so far as authorized by Parliament; and, compatibly with the statute (Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 161; ss. 2 (1), 4, 5, 7, 8, 66-80, referred to), he should have remained free to revoke the licence as the exigencies of the case in the public interest might require.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. (dissenting): The Postmaster General, in making the agreement, did not exceed his powers under the Post Office Act. S. 9 (n) of c. 66, R.S.C., 1906, as amended, 1911, c. 19, (now s. 7 (m) of c. 161, R.S.C., 1927), on its proper construction, authorizes him to secure by contract the erection and use of machines such as those in question, and implies authority to contract for a period of time, that period, in the absence of statutory limit, being left to his discretion, which in this case he exercised by fixing the period provided in the agreement. That period was not shown to have been, in the circumstances, unreasonable. While he cannot by contract deprive either himself or his successors of the right to close a post office if the public interest requires its closing, that right was not interfered with by the agreement; a machine was a post office only when, with his consent, mailable matter might be placed in a compartment thereof, and on the closing of that compartment the machine would cease to be a post office. The granting in the contract of permission to respondent to have and use compartments in the machines for certain purposes of its own, was within the Minister\u2019s authority. The Postmaster General had no right to determine the agreement as he did, even assuming that it was a mere licence. A licence, if given for value, or a licence with an agreement not to revoke it, if given for value, is an enforceable right and cannot be revoked without sufficient cause; further, if the agreement for the giving or continuing of a licence, or the circumstances under which it is given or continued, are such as to make it inequitable that the licence should be revocable at the will of the licensor a court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to prevent an unjust revocation (Ramsden v. Dyson, L.R. 1 H.L., 129; Plimmer v. Mayor, etc., of Wellington, 9 App. Cas., 699; Hurst v. Picture Theatres Ltd., [1915] 1 K.B. 1; Whipp v. MacKey, [1927] I.R., 372, and other cases, cited). Even if the agreement in question could have been revoked before respondent expended money in construction of the machines (as to which quaere), once it had expended money on the faith of the licence, an equity was created in its favour which rendered a revocation unjust; the agreement, in the light of what was contemplated by and done under it, should be construed as containing an implied contract not to revoke it except in accordance with its provisions for its determination.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, holding that it was not competent for the Postmaster General of Canada to terminate the agreement in question at the expiration of 10 years from its date arbitrarily and without cause, but reserving to the parties the right to have determined the issue as to the proper fulfilment of the agreement. The original agreement was dated 20th May, 1911, and was made between the Postmaster General of Canada and one Katrine Ellen Fawns. It was amended by agreement dated 22nd May, 1913, made between the Postmaster General and the respondent, the latter, as recited in the agreement, being then the holder of the licence granted by the original agreement. The licence was to have effect as if originally granted by the agreement as amended, and as if the respondent were the original licensee.\nBy the agreement the Postmaster General granted to respondent a general licence to sell (on commission) postage stamps, etc., by means of automatic machines;\nSuch licence to be for a period of ten years from the date hereof, and if this contract has been properly fulfilled then for a further period of ten years without further agreement and upon the termination of the said periods above the licence shall be renewed for further periods of ten years each successively unless and until either party shall during the six months preceding the expiry date of any such period give to the other party notice of intention to terminate this agreement.\nThe material clauses of the agreement, with regard to the questions before the Court on this appeal, are sufficiently set out in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note.\nBy letter dated November 3, 1920, signed by the Acting Deputy Postmaster General, the respondent was notified that the Postmaster General intended to terminate the agreement \u201cat the end of the ten-year period, namely, on the 19th May, 1921,\u201d and the Postmaster General terminated the agreement accordingly. The respondent claimed that the Postmaster General had no right to do so, and sued for damages by way of petition of right. Clauses 2 and 4 of the Crown\u2019s answer read as follows:\n(2) * * * it was competent for His Majesty rightfully to terminate the agreement * * * at the expiration of ten years from the said 20th day of May, 1911, by giving to the suppliant during the six months preceding the expiration of the said period of ten years notice of his intention to terminate the same, which notice was duly given * * *\n(4) * * * the petition of right does not disclose any cause of action which entitles the suppliant to relief sought herein.\nThe questions of law raised in said paragraphs 2 and 4 were (pursuant to order made for that purpose) set down for hearing. Maclean J. held\nthat paragraph one [above quoted in part] of the agreement * * * means, that if the agreement was being properly fulfilled by the licensee, the contract was to continue for two ten year periods, altogether twenty years, and the Postmaster General could not arbitrarily terminate the agreement without cause, at the end of the first ten year period, which was attempted to be done. I do not think that this clause of the agreement is capable of any other interpretation. I am therefore of the opinion that it was not competent for the Postmaster General to terminate the agreement of May 20, 1911, as amended, at the expiration of ten years from such date, by giving to the suppliant six months notice preceding the expiration of the said period of ten years. I am of the opinion therefore that the Petition of Right does disclose a cause of action.\nThe Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nF. P. Varcoe for the appellant.\nHamilton Cassels for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, New-combe and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The action is by Petition of Right, upon an instrument under seal of 20th May, 1911, to which the parties are the Postmaster General of Canada, of the first part, and Katrine Ellen Fawns, of the second part, as amended by a supplementary instrument of 22nd May, 1913, executed in like manner, between the Postmaster General and the suppliant company; the latter substituted for the party of the second part. The Postmaster General grants to the suppliant a general licence to sell, by means of automatic machines, postage stamps, post cards, stamped envelopes and such other post office supplies, as may from time to time be specified by the Postmaster General, the licence to be for ten years from the date of the original instrument, and, \u201cif this contract has been properly fulfilled,\u201d then for another period of ten years, and, at the end of that term, to be renewed for a further period of ten years, and so on, successively, \u201cunless and until either party shall during the six months preceding the expiry date of any such period give to the other party notice of intention to terminate this agreement.\u201d\nIt is recited by the amending instrument that the suppliant company (now the respondent), \u201care the present holders of the said licence and the Postmaster General has requested that certain amendments be made thereto to which request the Company has agreed.\u201d There are many clauses regulating in detail the business provided for; but these clauses are interwoven and dependent, the whole being based upon the main licensing provision, whereby the suppliant becomes a general licensee of the Postmaster General for the sale of the commodities mentioned, and, assuming performance on the suppliant\u2019s part, the licence is to continue in force for a period of at least twenty years or perhaps thirty years, and thenceforward indefinitely, subject to the agreed terms. The licence is thus designed to continue forever, unless, after twenty years, it be terminated by notice within the six months next preceding any subsequent decennial. Not only so, but by the second paragraph of clause 1, of the indenture of 20th May, 1911,\nThe Postmaster General agrees that during the term of this agreement or licence he will not licence the use of any other machine than those used by the Licensee from time to time to carry out this agreement, if such other machine depends substantially on similar principles for its operation;\nalthough, by the amending indenture of 22nd May, 1913, this paragraph is modified by adding the following provision:\nBut this clause shall not be interpreted as meaning that the department shall be precluded from using or licencing any other more satisfactory or advantageous machine.\nAnd thus the Postmaster General undertakes to limit the power which is committed to him generally by paragraphs (m) and (o) of section 7 of the Act which I am now going to quote.\nThe powers and duties of the Postmaster General are defined by the Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927, chap. 161. By sections 4 and 5 it is provided that\n4. There shall be at the seat of Government of Canada a department, known as the Post Office Department, for the superintendence and management, under the direction of the Postmaster General, of the postal service of Canada.\n5. The Postmaster General shall be appointed by the Governor General, by commission under the Great Seal of Canada, and shall hold office during pleasure.\nBy section 7 the Postmaster General may\n(a) establish and close post offices and post routes;\n(b) remove or suspend any postmaster or other officer or servant of the post office;\n(c) enter into and enforce all contracts relating to the conveyance of the mails, or other business of the post office;\n* * * * *\n(f) cause to be manufactured and distributed postage and registration stamps necessary for the prepayment of postages and registration charges, under this Act; also stamped envelopes for the like purpose, and post cards and stamped post bands or wrappers for newspapers or other mailable matter not being post letters;\n* * * * * (m) establish and provide street letter boxes or pillar boxes or boxes of any other description, for the receipt of letters, and such other mailable matter as he deems expedient, or for the sale of stamps or other post office supplies, in the streets of any city or town in Canada, or at any railway stations or other public places where he considers such boxes necessary;\n* * * * *\n(o) grant licences to agents other than postmasters, for the sale to the public of postage stamps and stamped envelopes, and allow to such agents a commission not exceeding two per centum of the amount of their sales:\n* * * * *\n(w) make and alter rules and orders for the conduct and management of the business and affairs of the Department and for the guidance and government of the postmasters and other officers, clerks and servants of the post office in the performance of their duties;\n(x) make such regulations as he deems necessary for the due and effective working of the post office and postal business and arrangements, and for carrying this Act fully into effect.\nBy subsection 2\nEvery such regulation shall have force and effect as if it formed part of the provisions of this Act.\nBy section 8\nEvery regulation made by the Postmaster General under this Act, other than those made solely for the guidance and government of the officers or other persons employed in the postal service, which may be communicated by departmental order or otherwise, as the Postmaster General sees fit, shall have effect from and after the day on which the same is published in the Canada Gazette.\nBy section 2, which embodies the interpretation clauses,\nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\n* * * * *\n(l) \u201cpost office\u201d means any building, room, post office railway car, street letter box, street stamp-vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.\nBy the fasciculus of sections 66 to 80, under the title, \u201cMail Contracts and Contractors,\u201d the Postmaster General is expressly empowered to make contracts for carrying the mail; but these are not to stipulate for more than four years; see section 77, as follows:\nNo contract shall be entered into for a longer term than four years; but the Postmaster General may, in special cases, when in his opinion the service has been satisfactorily performed under an expiring contract, and on conditions advantageous to the public interest, renew the contract with the same contractor for a further term not exceeding four years.\nI find nothing to authorize or suggest that the Postmaster General may grant a licence for the sale of postage stamps, by means of automatic machines or otherwise, so as to bind his successor or the country at a future time, when this method of conducting the business of the post office may, in the discretion of the ruling authority, be found to be undesirable or in conflict with the public interest. The licence, as I have shewn, is granted by the Postmaster General under an express statutory power to grant licences to agents. It is of the quality of a licence that it shall be revocable; it is said to be implied in the instrument that the licence will not be revoked; but, if it can continue beyond the will of the Postmaster General only upon an implication that he has covenanted with the suppliant not to exercise his power of revocation, that covenant is, I think, in excess of his powers to bind the Crown; and such a covenant would, I am persuaded, serve to aggravate rather than to cure the vice of the transaction. A Minister cannot, by agreement, deprive himself of a power which is committed to him to be exercised from time to time as occasion may require in the public interest, or validly covenant to refrain from the use of that power when it may be requisite, or expedient in his discretion, upon grounds of public policy, to execute it; that follows, I think, as a deduction from the principle enunciated by the judgment of the House of Lords in Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[1]. The whole question here is one of statutory administration of the public service; and, in my view, the Minister has invoked a power which he did not possess. It seems to me that he can constitutionally and validly depute the performance of his duties, only so far as authorized by Parliament; and, compatibly with the statute, the Postmaster General should have remained free to revoke the licence as the exigencies of the case in the public interest might require.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and declare the licence revocable at the discretion of the Postmaster General. There are raised by the petition some minor questions of accounting and responsibility for loss of commission earned, as to which the suppliant may proceed if so advised; otherwise the petition should be dismissed with costs and the respondent should have the costs of the appeal.\n[Page 507\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J., dissenting, was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal by His Majesty the King from a decision of the President of the Exchequer Court in favour of the respondent in an action for damages for breach of contract.\nOn May 20, 1911, the Postmaster General of Canada and one Katrine Ellen Fawns entered into an agreement in writing by which Katrine Ellen Fawns obtained the right to erect stamp vending machines and a licence to sell stamps by means thereof. The respondent was incorporated to take over the rights and obligations of Katrine Ellen Fawns under the agreement and did take them over. The agreement, with some minor alterations, was confirmed to the respondent by the Postmaster General by an agreement dated May 20, 1913. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the agreement as confirmed read as follows:\u2014\n1. The Postmaster General hereby grants to the Licensee a general licence to sell postage stamps, post cards, stamped envelopes and such post office supplies as may from time to time be specified by the Postmaster General, by means of automatic machines. Such licence to be for a period of ten years from the date hereof, and if this contract has been properly fulfilled then for a further period of ten years without further agreement and upon the termination of the said periods above the licence shall be renewed for further periods of ten years each successively unless and until either party shall during the six months preceding the expiry date of any such period give to the other party notice of intention to terminate this agreement.\nThe Postmaster General agrees that during the term of this agreement or licence he will not licence the use of any other machine than those used by the Licensee from time to time to carry out this agreement, if such other machine depends substantially on similar principles for its operation. But this clause shall not be interpreted as meaning that the department shall be precluded from using or licensing any other more satisfactory or advantageous machine.\n2. The Licensee shall have the right to erect automatic machines at any point or place at which the Postmaster General under the Post Office Act or otherwise has authority to place boxes for the receipt of letters or machines for vending stamps, but no automatic machine shall be erected in a place outside of a district or territory served by letter carriers if such automatic machine is to be under the control of a postmaster until the written consent of the Postmaster General has been obtained. Machines may be placed in any post office under the conditions above mentioned providing that in the event of a machine being already installed it shall be purchased by the Licensee from the Postmaster General if he so desires. In any event except as to post offices and points where boxes are already erected, the other points and places where such automatic machines will be erected must have been submitted beforehand to the Postmaster General and approved by him. 3. All automatic machines erected in public streets and highways shall be erected by the Licensee for or on behalf of the Postmaster General but at the expense of the Licensee. Such machines may, as hereinafter provided, contain suitable compartments for the mailing of letters as well as for the vending of stamps or other postal supplies but the Licensee shall have the right to control and use all the other parts or compartments in such automatic machines as set out in paragraph ten other than such stamp and postal supply vending and letter receiving compartments. On the termination of this agreement such automatic machines shall become the property of the Licensee with the exception of the locks thereof, and any other devices connected therewith, that have been provided by the Postmaster General.\n4. When the Licensee reports to the Postmaster General that an automatic machine has been erected under the authority of this agreement and with his consent as above provided, the Postmaster General shall thereupon supply and keep supplied the nearest post office or other supply office with the required rolls of stamps.\nIn the agreement the Postmaster General agrees to keep a full and complete record of all stamps or other postal supplies sold by means of the automatic machines erected under the agreement and also agrees to pay to the Licensee quarterly a commission of 2% on the amount so sold, (clauses 6 and 7).\nThe stamp vending compartments of all automatic machines erected within any district which is served by letter carriers or any other place approved by the Postmaster General are to be under his exclusive control; the locks for these compartments are to be furnished by the Post Office Department and the key for each lock is to be held by a postmaster named by the Postmaster General (clauses 9 and 10).\nThe last paragraph of clause 10 reads as follows:\u2014\nThe Postmaster who is in charge of any automatic machine shall be required to see that all moneys are collected from and that such automatic machines are kept supplied with the necessary stamps or other post office supplies.\nBy clause 11 it is provided that where automatic machines are erected by the Licensee and the stamp vending compartment is not under the control of the Postmaster General he shall issue a stamp vending licence to the Licensee, or to any other person designated by the Licensee, and approved of by the Postmaster General, who shall be paid a commission of 2% on all stamps or other postal supplies sold by means of such machine.\nOn November 3, 1920, the respondent was notified that the Postmaster General intended to terminate the agreement on May 19, 1921, and the privileges which the respondent had thereunder were terminated accordingly. On November 14, 1922, the respondent brought action by way of a petition of right in the Exchequer Court alleging that His Majesty had no right to terminate the agreement, and claiming damages for breach thereof. In answer to the petition His Majesty\u2019s Attorney-General for Canada appeared and filed a statement of defence on behalf of His Majesty, paragraphs 2 and 4 of which are as follows:\u2014\n2. His Majesty\u2019s Attorney-General says that it was competent for His Majesty rightfully to terminate the agreement of May 20, 1911, as amended by the agreement of May 22, 1913, (both of which agreements are referred to in the Suppliant\u2019s Petition of Right) at the expiration of ten years from the said 20th day of May, 1911, by giving to the Suppliant during the six months preceding the expiration of the said period of ten years notice of his intention to terminate the same, which notice was duly given to the Suppliant in November, 1920.\n4. His Majesty\u2019s Attorney-General further says that the Petition of Right does not disclose any cause of action which entitles the Suppliant to relief sought herein.\nUpon motion on behalf of the respondent the court ordered that the question of law raised in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the statement of defence be set down for hearing.\nThis motion was heard by the President of the Exchequer Court, who was of opinion that\nparagraph one of the agreement as it originally stood, and as amended, means, that if the agreement was being properly fulfilled by the Licensee, the contract was to continue for two ten year periods, altogether twenty years, and the Postmaster General could not arbitrarily terminate the agreement without cause, at the end of the first ten year period.\nHe therefore held that the Petition of Right disclosed a cause of action. He, however, left it open to the parties to try out the issue as to the proper fulfilment of the agreement by the Licensee during the first ten years. From that decision His Majesty appeals to this court\nOn the argument before us counsel for His Majesty did not seriously question the correctness of the construction placed by the learned President upon clause 1 of the agreement, and with that construction I entirely agree. The main questions argued before us was as to the authority of the Postmaster General to make the contract, and his right subsequently to terminate it. Counsel for His Majesty contended that he had no authority to make it because authority had not been given to him to make a contract for the vending of stamps which would fetter the future exercise of his discretion, or that of his successor in office, as to what might be in the public interest. That the Postmaster General could only exercise the power vested in him admits of no doubt. It also, in my opinion, admits of no doubt that as the executive head of the Post Office Department, carrying on the business of the department for the public good, the Postmaster General would have no authority, by means of a contract, to restrict or limit the exercise of his discretion, or that of his successor in office, as to what at any time the public interest required unless authority to make such a contract had been vested in him either expressly or by necessary implication. Without such authority the contract would not be binding upon His Majesty. This, I think, is clear upon the decided cases, to one of which only I need refer. In Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[2], the legislature had conferred upon the Harbour Trustees power to compulsorily take land for a particular purpose. The trustees took the respondent\u2019s land but sought to lessen the compensation which should be paid to him by agreeing that the conveyance to them should restrict their use of the land taken so as not to interfere with the access from the remaining property of the owner to the harbour. It was held that the trustees could not bind either themselves or their successors by the agreement. In his judgment, at page 634, Lord Blackburn says:\u2014\nI think that where the legislature confers powers on any body to take lands compulsorily for a particular purpose, it is on the ground that the using of that land for that purpose will be for the public good. Whether that body be one which is seeking to make a profit for shareholders, or, as in the present case, a body of trustees acting solely for the public good, I think in either case the powers conferred on the body empowered to take the land compulsorily are intrusted to them, and their successors, to be used for the furtherance of that object which the legislature has thought sufficiently for the public good to justify it in intrusting them with such powers; and, consequently, that a contract purporting to bind them and their successors not to use those powers is void.\nThe question then is: Was authority vested in the Postmaster General to make the contract which he, in fact, did make?\nSection 2 of the Post Office Act then in force (R.S.C., 1906, c. 66, as amended 1911, c. 19), defines a post office as follows:\u2014\nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, \u201cpost office\u201d means any building, room, post office railway car, street letter box, street stamp vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.\nand section 9, in part, reads:\u2014\nThe Postmaster General may, subject to the provisions of this Act,\u2014\n(n) establish and provide street letter boxes or pillar boxes or boxes of any other description, for the receipt of letters, and such other mailable matter as he deems expedient, or for the sale of stamps or other post office supplies, in the streets of any city or town in Canada, or at any railway stations or other public places where he considers such boxes necessary.\n(o) grant licences, to agents other than postmasters, for the sale to the public of postage stamps and stamped envelopes, and allow to such agents a commission not exceeding two per centum of the amount of their sales.\nAs the Parliament of Canada has, by section 91 (5) of the British North America Act, 1867, exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the Postal Service, section 9, above quoted, vests in the Postmaster General authority to establish and provide in the places therein mentioned boxes for the sale of stamps, that is automatic stamp vending machines. It also authorizes him to grant licences for the sale of stamps and to pay a commission on the amount of the stamps sold thereunder. To \u201cprovide\u201d boxes, means to procure, furnish or supply them. It is not, in my opinion, confined to furnishing boxes by purchase, but includes obtaining them by hire or lease, or securing their erection and use by means of a contract to that effect. Authority to hire, lease or contract for the use of automatic vending machines, implies authority to make a contract for a certain period of time. The statute places no limit upon the time for which a contract, under the section, may be made. That is left to the discretion of the Postmaster General and, in the present case, he has exercised his discretion by fixing the period at that set out in the agreement.\nIn his petition the respondent alleges that he has expended large sums of money \u201cin the acquisition of the said licence and in erecting pillar boxes and vending machines.\u201d To recoup himself for this expenditure by means of a 2% commission on the sales made would require some considerable time. As a matter of business therefore, the Postmaster General, in order to secure the construction and erection of the machines, with an expenditure only of a 2% commission, was necessarily obliged to grant a licence to sell stamps for a long period. Without such a licence no one would incur the initial expenditure for the machines. It is not suggested that the period fixed by the agreement was more than sufficient to enable the respondent to recoup himself for his expenditure and secure a reasonable interest thereon. The period for which the licence was granted is, therefore, not shewn to have been unreasonable.\nThe object the parties had in view is, I think, clear: The Postmaster General was obtaining, for the convenience of the public, without the expenditure of one dollar of the public money beyond the statutory 2% commission, machines which would automatically sell to the public whatever stamps it might require; while the respondent was obtaining a virtual monopoly of the stamp vending business for twenty years (unless machines more suitable for the purpose were invented) and a 2% commission on the stamps sold. In addition he would have whatever advantages might be derived from advertising or vending his own goods or those of his assigns or lessees in compartments of the vending machines other than those used for vending stamps or receiving mailable matter. With the advertising and vending of these goods the Postmaster General had nothing to do beyond granting permission to the respondent to have compartments for these purposes in the boxes erected in streets and highways, and to use them for such purposes. It was contended that the Postmaster General had no authority to make a contract \u201cwhereby the Post Office business was to be mixed up with a merchandising and advertising scheme.\u201d In my opinion, if the Postmaster General had been buying stamp vending machines he could, without at all exceeding his authority, have purchased machines having all the compartments which the respondent\u2019s machines possessed, and, if certain of these compartments were not required for post office purposes, I can see no reason why they should not, by leasing or otherwise, be made to yield a revenue for the department.\nIt was also contended that if section 9 were construed as giving authority to contract for the use of stamp vending machines for a definite period of time, it would enable the Postmaster General \u201cto contract himself and his successors out of the right to close post offices and discontinue stamp vending boxes in his discretion.\u201d In my opinion the right of the Postmaster General to close a post office depends upon considerations entirely different from his right to discontinue the use of a stamp vending machine, the use of which he has contracted to continue. The right in the former case depends upon a consideration of what the public interest requires. The public has no more interest in the individual who sells stamps than it has in the individual with whom the Postmaster General contracts for post office supplies. I quite agree that the Postmaster General cannot, by contract, deprive either himself or his successors in office of the right to close a post office if the public interest requires that it should be closed. Authority to close a post office is given to him by the statute, but his right to close a post office is in no way interfered with by the agreement in question. Under section 2 (1) a stamp vending box becomes a post office only when it contains a receptacle or compartment in which letters or other mailable matter may be placed. They can only be so placed with the consent of the Postmaster General. In my opinion section 2 does not mean that a street stamp vending machine which, during the time letters were deposited in a compartment thereof, was a post office, continues to be a post office after the Postmaster General has closed that compartment. The moment the compartment has been closed, the vending machine ceases to be a post office.\nAnother contention advanced was that the Postmaster General, being the owner of the vending machines erected in streets and highways and having the exclusive control of the stamp vending compartments therein, could use or refrain from using those compartments at his option. This, I think, would be true unless he was under a contractual obligation to continue the use of the vending compartments during the term of the agreement. Such a contractual obligation I find in the last paragraph of clause 10.\nI am therefore, of opinion that the Postmaster General, in making the agreement in question with the respondent, did not exceed the powers vested in him by the statute. Had Parliament altered the law so as to no longer require the use of stamps on mailable matter, other considerations would apply, but as Parliament by authorizing the use of stamp vending machines declared such use not to be contrary to the public interest, and has, up to the present, continued in force that statutory provision, a change in the personal views of the Postmaster General would not, in my opinion, justify the breaking of a contract validly made by him for the sale of stamps.\nThe only remaining question is, had the Postmaster General authority to determine the agreement at the end of the first period of ten years? If the agreement is to be construed as a valid contract, then its termination by the Postmaster General undoubtedly constituted a breach thereof for which His Majesty is liable. In Windsor and Annapolis Railway Co. v. The Queen and the Western Counties Railway Co.[3], the Privy Council said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that it must now be regarded as settled law that, whenever a valid contract has been made between the Crown and a subject, a petition of right will lie for damages resulting from a breach of that contract by the Crown.\nIt is, however, suggested that the agreement on its true construction amounts to no more than a bare licence to sell stamps by means of stamp vending machines if the respondent wished to set up such machines. It is quite true that the agreement places the respondent under no obligation whatever to erect a single machine or to sell a single stamp. The agreement, nevertheless, was based on the assumption that he would do both. And, in view of the fact that the Postmaster General was to have vested in him the property in the machines erected in streets and highways until the termination of the agreement and to have the exclusive control of the stamp vending compartments in all machines, except those referred to in clause 11, I find it difficult to reach the conclusion that the agreement was not something more than a mere licence. Assuming however, in favour of His Majesty, that it was not, I am still of opinion that the respondent is entitled to succeed.\nAt common law a mere licence (that is one not coupled with a grant or an interest), whether under seal or not and whether for valuable consideration or not, was revocable at any time by the licensor. If coupled with a grant or interest it was not in general revocable because the licence was necessary to make the grant effective. Wood v. Lead- bitter[4]. Even before the Judicature Act, if the licence was continuous and the licensee had expended money on the faith of it, courts of equity would not permit the licence to be revoked except upon terms. Jackson v. Cator[5]; Ramsden v. Dyson[6]. Since the Judicature Act the court is bound to give effect to equitable rules and it can no longer be said that a mere licence is always revocable.\nIn Plimmer v. Mayor, etc., of Wellington[7], the plaintiff\u2019s lessor had, prior to 1856, obtained a revocable licence from the Government to erect a wharf and a jetty. In 1856, at the request of the Government and for its benefit, he incurred a large expenditure for the extension of his jetty and the erection of a warehouse. These the Government used and made payments for such use. In 1880 the land was vested in the defendants by statute and two years later they took possession. Plimmer claimed compensation. In giving the judgment of the Privy Council, Sir Arthur Hob-house, at page 712, after referring to the Ramsden v. Dyson case6, said:\u2014\nIn the present case, the equity is not claimed because the landowner has stood by in silence while his tenant has spent money on his land. This is a case in which the landowner has, for his own purposes, requested the tenant to make the improvements. The Government were engaged in the important work of introducing immigrants into the colony. For some reason, not now apparent, they were not prepared to make landing-places of their own, and in fact they did not do so until the year 1863. So they applied to John Plimmer to make his landing-place more commodious by a substantial extension of his jetty and the erection of a warehouse for baggage. Is it to be said that, when he had incurred the expense of doing the work asked for, the Government could turn round and revoke his licence at their will? Could they in July, 1856, have deprived him summarily of the use of the jetty? It would be in a high degree unjust that they should do so, and that the parties should have intended such a result is, in the absence of evidence, incredible.\nIn Hurst v. Picture Theatres, Limited[8], the plaintiff purchased a ticket for a seat in the theatre and paid for it and was shewn to a seat by an attendant. Under the mistaken belief that he had not paid for it the defendant ejected him. He brought an action for damages and it was held that he was entitled to recover. At page 10, Buckley L.J., says:\u2014\nThere is another way in which the matter may be put. If there be a licence with an agreement not to revoke the licence, that, if given for value, is an enforceable right. If the facts here are, as I think they are, that the licence was a licence to enter the building and see the spectacle from its commencement until its termination, then there was included in that contract a contract not to revoke the licence until the play had run to its termination. It was then a breach of contract to revoke the obligation not to revoke the licence, and for that the decision in Kerrison v. Smith[9] is an authority.\nIn Whipp v. MacKey[10], the court had before it an agreement in writing, dated May 10, 1919, by which the defendant\u2019s assignor obtained liberty to moor eel tanks to an island in the river Shannon at an annual rental. One of the clauses provided that if the tenant should \u201ccommit any breach of this agreement the landlord shall be at liberty, upon giving one week\u2019s notice, * * * to determine the licence hereby created.\u201d A breach was committed by the non-payment of rent and the requisite notice given. The plaintiff brought an action in which he claimed an injunction restraining the defendant from mooring eel tanks to the island. It was held that the agreement was simply a licence for valuable consideration for the period specified; that such an agreement was revocable according to the terms of the contract but not otherwise; that the non-payment of the rent was a breach thereof, but that it was one against which the defendant ought to be relieved on equitable grounds as the clause had been inserted as a penalty.\nSee also British Actors Film Co. v. Glover[11]; King v. David Allen & Sons Bill Posting, Limited[12]; McManus v. Cooke[13]; Wilson v. Tavener[14]; Lowe v. Adams[15]; James Jones & Sons v. Tankerville[16].\nThese authorities establish that a licence, if given for value, or a licence with an agreement not to revoke it, if given for value, is an enforceable right and cannot be revoked without sufficient cause. I think they go even further and justify the conclusion that if the agreement for the giving or the continuing of a licence, or the circumstances under which it is given or continued, are such as to make it inequitable that the licence should be revocable at the will of the licensor, a court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to prevent the unjust revocation of the licence. If the agreement itself contains a clause providing for its determination that method of terminating it must be followed. If no such provision is made then reasonable notice must be given and the court may in applying equitable remedies select that remedy which is most suitable to the circumstances of the particular case.\nIn the case before us, even if the agreement could have been revoked before the respondent expended money in the construction of the machines, as to which I express no opinion, once the respondent had expended money on the faith of the licence given by the agreement, an equity, in my opinion, was created in his favour which rendered it unfair and unjust that the licence should be revoked. The agreement, in the light of what was contemplated by and done under it, should, therefore, be construed as containing an implied contract not to revoke it except in accordance with the provisions for its determination contained therein. As it has not been shewn that the respondent failed to properly fulfil his obligations under the agreement during the first ten year period, its determination at the end of that period constituted a breach of the agreement.\nThe respondent\u2019s petition therefore shews a cause of action to be tried. That cause of action is the loss which he has sustained through being deprived of his right to vend stamps for the period of his agreement and to earn a 2% commission on the amount which would have been sold.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, reserving right to suppliant to proceed on questions of accounting and responsibility for loss of commission earned as alleged by it.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Webster (Defendant) Respondent\n1929: October 2; 1930: February 4.\nPresent:\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nContract\u2014Sale of land\u2014Printed form\u2014Alteration by pen and ink\u2014 Whether ambiguity or repugnancy between clauses\u2014Interpretation\u2014 Evidence of intention by use of deleted words. The appellant sold to the respondent two large areas of land in Alberta. The parties in formulating their agreement employed the printed form which the vendor customarily used for such transactions, filling up the blanks in typewriting; but there were some handwritten interlineations in the print, and the printed clause immediately following the blank in which the description of the parcels of land was typewritten appeared in the original executed agreement in the following form:\n\"* * * excepting thereout and therefrom any overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands and any portion of the said lands taken for roads or public purposes * * *;\"\nLater in the instrument, and as part of the printed, form not stricken out, there was a covenant by the vendor that, if the purchaser pay the purchase money and perform all and singular the conditions of the agreement, he shall be entitled to receive from the vendor a transfer of the land in fee simple, \"excepting thereout and therefrom all coal mines and other minerals including petroleum and natural gas and valuable stones.\" The sale was for a price of $190,219.80 of which $45,000 was paid upon the execution of the agreement and the balance was made payable in five yearly instalments with interest and taxes. None of the deferred payments was in fact made by the respondent except a sum of $384; and, the agreement not being fulfilled, the appellant brought this action for specific performance. The respondent resisted payment on the ground that the land agreed to be sold embraced all coal mines, coal pits, seams and veins of coal and the right to work the same, which coal mines, etc., were the property of the Crown, and the appellant being unable to make title thereto as required by its agreement, the respondent counterclaimed for the repayment of $45,000 and a declaration that the agreement was cancelled.\nHeld, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting, that, according to the meaning of the deed, it was not the intention of the agreement that the vendor should convey the mines and minerals with the lands.\nHeld, also, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting: In order to reach the conclusion that, according to the meaning of the deed, the mines and minerals were to go with the lands, the trial judge and the Appellate Division had to take into consideration \"the printed form as it existed before the erasures,\" relying upon the authority of Strickland v. Maxwell (2 Cr. & M. 539). But, although it is difficult to distinguish the material facts of that case with those in the present one, the opinion therein expressed by Bayley and Vaughan B.B., who held it admissible to reason from the obliteration, cannot be followed, because that seems contrary in principle to the rule against extrinsic evidence as laid down by the books and, moreover, in conflict with the judgment in Inglis v. Buttery (3 App. Cas. 552).\nThe original grant from the Crown contained the reservation by it of \"all coal mines, etc., * * * together with full power to work the same * * *\" and while there is an exception embodied in the agreement which, according to the above holding, embraces coal mines, etc., if there be any, it does not provide expressly for the working powers and liberties. There are however powers and liberties incident to the ownership and they rest upon the implications of the case. But the respondent raised the ground that the powers for working, as expressly reserved by the Crown, are more comprehensive than those which are incident to the exception created by the agreement and therefore the appellant company has less than it has agreed to convey. Fuller v. Garneau, (61 Can. S.C.R. 450) relied on.\nHeld, further, per Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ., that there was no evidence that the lands subject to the agreement contained any coal, or, if any, that it could not be worked without causing damage to the surface. The Crown grants are in common form, and no inference can be drawn that a parcel of land contains coal because the grant by which the parcel is conveyed contains the common form of reservation. But if there be coal upon which the reservation operates, it is only \"to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working\" of it that the right \"to enter upon or use or occupy the said lands\" may be exercised. The necessity must therefore be shewn, either by the vendor or by the purchaser, before the reservation of the Crown grant can be found to extend beyond the exception for which the agreement provides. The onus is upon the party who suggests or relies upon the necessity, namely the respondent, to produce the proof or to establish this evidence, and the respondent has failed to do it.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014While, under ordinary circumstances, it is not proper to look at deleted words in an instrument as an aid to its construction (Inglis v. Buttery, 3 App. Cas. 552), that rule does not apply where, as a result of the deletion, there is ambiguity between different clauses of an agreement. And when the ambiguity is obvious, as in the present case, the principle which governs is that laid down in Strickland v. Maxwell (2 Cr. & M. 539), namely, that \"the works struck out might be looked at to shew what the intention of the parties was.\" Judgment of the Appellate Division (24 Alta. L.R. 174) reversed, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J., dismissing the appellant's action for specific performance and allowing the respondent's counterclaim for rescission.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. McL. Sinclair K.C. and D. H. Elton K.C. for the appellant.\nP. H. Russell and J. B. Barron for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The parties made a contract in writing, dated 1st April, 1926, whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell and the defendant agreed to purchase two large areas of land in the province of Alberta, firstly and secondly therein described as comprising respectively 10,762.32 acres and 1,920 acres, for the sum of $190,219.80, of which the purchaser paid $45,000, and agreed to pay the balance in five equal annual payments of $29,043.96, with interest, beginning on 2nd April, 1927; also to pay the taxes. None of the deferred payments was in fact made, but it appears that the purchaser did pay, in addition to the $45,000 above mentioned, a sum of $348, which is credited on account on 1st June, 1926.\nThus the agreement was not fulfilled; and, on 9th February, 1928, the plaintiff commenced this action for specific performance. On 9th March, next following, the defendant wrote the plaintiff, referring to the agreement of sale and the payment of $45,000, and continuing thus:\nI have just discovered that in respect to sections one to eighteen, in township three, range twenty-three, west of the fourth meridian, you are unable to deliver to me title to the coal mines, coal pits, seams and veins of coal, which, together with the right to work them, are reserved to the King of Great Britain, who also owns all coal lying under sections thirty-four, thirty-five and thirty-six, in township two, range twenty-three, west of the fourth meridian. As I am entitled under agreement with you to call for title to all coal mines, coal, coal pits, seams and veins of coal and the right to work them, and as you have not the title to these, I hereby notify you that I repudiate the agreement of April 2, 1926, made with you and demand from you the repayment to me forthwith of the sum of forty-five thousand dollars which I have paid you in connection therewith.\nOn 13th March, 1928, the defendant pleaded a defence and counterclaim, whereby, along with the usual denials, he alleged that\n* * * the land agreed to be sold embraced all coal mines, coal pits, seams and veins of coal and the right to work the same, which said coal mines, coal pits, veins and seams of coal are not owned by the plaintiff but are in fact the property of His Majesty King George V., who also has the right to work the same.\nThe defendant also relied upon the letter quoted above as repudiating the agreement, and he counterclaimed for the amount of $45,000.\nIt is admitted that the original grant from the Crown contains the following:\n* * * excepting and reserving unto Us, Our Successors and Assigns, all coal mines, coal pits, seams and veins of coal, as well open as not open, which shall or may be wrought, found out or discovered or which may exist within, upon or under the said lands, together with full power to work the same, and for this purpose to enter upon and use and occupy the said lands or so much thereof, and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said mines, pits, seams and veins; * * *\nIn making the agreement, the parties used a printed form, filling up the blanks in typewriting, but there were some handwritten interlineations in the print, and the printed clause immediately following the blank in which the description of the parcels is typewritten appears in the original executed agreement in the following form:\n\"* * * acres to be the same more or less, excepting thereout and therefrom any overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands and any portion of the said lands taken for roads or public purposes; * * *\"\nFollows in the agreement a statement of the consideration money, and terms of payment, and certain covenants, the third of which reads as follows: And the purchaser hereby agrees with the vendors, and this agreement is made on the express stipulations and conditions:\n* * *\n(3) If the purchaser or legal representative or approved assignee shall pay the several sums of money aforesaid punctually at the several times above fixed, and shall in like manner strictly and literally perform all and singular the aforesaid conditions, then the purchaser, as hereinafter provided, upon request at the office of the vendors, at the town of Raymond, and the surrender of this agreement, shall be entitled to a transfer of the said land in fee simple excepting thereout and therefrom all coal mines and other minerals, including petroleum, natural gas and valuable stones.\nThe agreement does not expressly provide for the possession of the premises, but the eighth and ninth admissions are as follows:\n8. The defendant became entitled to the possession of the said lands immediately after the completion of the said agreement for sale.\n9. The plaintiff has not at any time received any rents or profits of the said lands since the date of the said purported agreement.\nThe case was tried before Ives J., of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and he maintained the action, because, while he had no hesitation in holding that the intention of the agreement was that the vendor should convey the minerals, nevertheless he thought that the defendant, by leasing a part of the area which he had agreed to purchase, after he knew that the minerals were reserved, had elected not to take advantage of the alleged defect in the plaintiff's title, and was therefore bound to complete his purchase. The Appellate Division, however, reversed the learned trial judge upon this point, considering that the leases were made pendente lite and subject to the litigation, and that there was no evidence sufficient to establish waiver or intention to waive. At the hearing before this court a similar view prevailed, and the defence of waiver was accordingly denied.\nThe Appellate Division was, nevertheless, in agreement with the trial judge that, according to the meaning of the deed, the minerals were to go with the lands, but in reaching that conclusion the learned judges took into consideration \"the printed form as it existed before the erasures,\" relying upon the authority of Strickland v. Maxwell[2]. I confess that I find it difficult to distinguish the material facts of that case, but I cannot follow the opinion of the two learned judges (Bayley and Vaughan B.B.), who held it admissible to reason from the obliteration, because that seems to me contrary in principle to the rule against extrinsic evidence as laid down by the books, and, moreover, in conflict with the judgment of the House of Lords in Inglis v. Buttery[3], by which we are bound. In the latter case fourteen material words had been deleted, and Lord; Hatherley said in his speech, at page 558, their Lordships being unanimous upon the point,\nNor can I think, and I believe your Lordships will concur with me in this opinion, that it is legitimate to look at those words which appear upon the face of the agreement with a line drawn through them, and which are expressly, by the intention of all the parties to the agreement, deleted, that is to say, done away with, and wholly abolished. It is not legitimate to read them and to use them as bearing upon the meaning of that which has become the real contract between the parties, namely, the final arrangement of the document which we must now proceed to construe.\nSee also Leggott v. Barrett[4], per James L.J. at pp. 309, 310; Manchester Ship Canal Co. v. Horlock[5].\nReading the first exception as it stands, it is this:\nExcepting thereout and therefrom any overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands.\nAnd, in clause no. 3 above quoted, which is introduced as a \"stipulation or condition\" of the contract, it is provided that when the purchaser, having made the payments or performed the conditions stipulated, becomes entitled to a transfer of the land purchased, the transfer shall be in fee simple,\nexcepting thereout and therefrom all coal mines and other minerals, including petroleum, natural gas and valuable stones.\nAt the hearing nobody was able to explain precisely what was meant by the handwritten exception; and there is no evidence of any lease or the constitution of any royalty. The expression \"any overriding royalty of ten per cent of oils or gas\" is indefinite; while apparently intended to include any royalty of the character described, constituted before the grant, it seems to contemplate a state of uncertainty as to whether or not there were any such royalty.\nThere is no repugnancy that I can see between the printed exception in clause no. 3 and the preceding handwritten exception. They operate in the same field only with relation to oils or gas, and there they do not conflict. More- over, so far as appears by the case, no point is raised with regard to oil or gas. The objection relates to the coal.\nThe meaning, of course, must be ascertained by interpretation of the instrument. It is true, as said by Lord Ellenborough C.J., in Robertson et al v. French[6], speaking of words superadded in writing to a printed form of contract, that such words are entitled,\n* * * if there should be any reasonable doubt upon the sense and meaning of the whole, to have a greater effect attributed to them than to the printed words, inasmuch as the written words are the immediate language and terms selected by the parties themselves for the expression of their meaning, and the printed words are a general formula adapted equally to their case and that of all other contracting parties upon similar occasions and subjects.\nAnd see Glynn v. Margetson and Coy. et al[7].\nBut while, therefore, the written words may prevail, or have the right of way, in case of competition, there is, of course, nowhere a suggestion that printed language is not a perfectly good and lawful medium of expression. Lord Herschel indeed says in terms, in the last mentioned case, page 354, that \"It would not be legitimate to discard the printed words,\" and I say the same here.\nMoreover, suppose there were no royalty, and it is consistent with the agreement that there may be none, clearly the exception printed in clause no. 3 would remain in operation; and, if the respondent rely upon the handwriting, or contend for an advantage in the interpretation of the instrument by reason of the fact of any overriding royalty within the meaning of the written exception, it is surely incumbent upon him to prove the existence of that royalty, and to make the language of the deed intelligible. All relevant parts of the instrument have to be read together when necessary in order to ascertain the meaning. There is an exception printed in clause 3, and it has been quoted. I see no reason to doubt that the coal mines and other minerals are excepted by force of that clause, and the words \"other minerals\" therein may I think be interpreted as suggested by my brother Duff at the hearing to mean minerals other than coal in coal mines.\nIt follows that the plaintiff should succeed upon the questions already considered, but the defendant raises an additional ground. I have referred to the reservation by the Crown of the coal and the power to work it. That power is expressed in very broad terms; and while, if the court adopt my view, there is an exception embodied in the agreement which embraces coal mines, coal pits, seams and veins of coal, if there be any, it does not provide expressly for the working powers and liberties. There are however powers and liberties incident to the ownership, and they rest upon the implications of the case. But it is said that the powers for working, as expressly reserved by the Crown, are more comprehensive than those which are incident to the exception created by the agreement, and therefore that the plaintiff company has less than it has agreed to convey, and the defendant relies upon Fuller v. Garneau[8], in which it was held by the majority of this court that the reservation in a Crown grant of the mines and minerals, associated with express powers identical with those reserved in the present case, created an easement for the exercise of working powers in excess of those implied by the mere exception of mines and minerals. And it seems to follow, applying the last cited authority, that, if the lands agreed to be sold contain coal mines, there are working rights expressly reserved to the Crown which are not implied in the exception of \"all coal mines and other minerals\" expressed in the third article of the stipulations and conditions of the agreement; and consequently, upon the like assumption, that the agreement would extend to rights which are withheld from the plaintiff company, and therefore not competent to it to grant.\nI think this objection admits of a sound answer; and it is this: There is no evidence whatever that the lands subject to the agreement contain any coal, whether in mines, pits, seams or veins, or, if there be any coal there, that it cannot be worked without causing damage to the surface. The Crown grants are in common form, and no inference can in my opinion be drawn that a parcel of land contains coal because the grant by which the parcel is conveyed contains the common form of reservation. But, if there be coal upon which the reservation operates, it is only \"to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working\" of it that the right \"to enter upon or use or occupy the said lands\" may be exercised. The necessity must therefore be shewn, either by the vendor or by the purchaser, before the reservation of the Crown grant can be found to extend beyond the exception for which, as I have shewn, the agreement provides. And who is to produce the proof, or to establish this condition? I would think it must be he who suggests or relies upon the necessity, namely, the defendant, and his case fails for lack of such proof.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in all courts, and the counter-claim should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion in this case prepared by my brother Newcombe, in which I understand the other members of the court concur.\nIn so far as he would affirm the conclusion of the Appellate Division that the evidence was not sufficient to establish waiver by the respondent or intention to waive the defect in the vendor's title, consisting of its inability to convey the mines and minerals in and under the lands agreed to be sold, I entirely agree. But, in so far as my learned brother holds that, on the proper construction of the agreement between the parties, the vendor did not agree to sell such mines and minerals, I find myself unable to share his view.\nAs the trial judge pointed out, the parties in formulating their agreement employed the printed form which the vendor customarily used for such transactions. Erom that form was struck out the exception and reservation from the land agreed to be sold of\nall coal and other minerals, including petroleum, natural gas, and valuable stones in or under the said land, and the right to use so much of the said land or the surface thereof as the vendors or their assigns may consider necessary for the purpose of working and removing the said coal or other minerals; including petroleum or natural gas.\nFor this the parties substituted the words,\nany overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands,\nthese words being inserted by the vendor's attorney in handwriting following the printed words \"excepting thereout and therefrom\" which in turn follow the description, in typewriting, of the land sold. It is precisely here, i.e., immediately following the description of the land sold that one would expect to find any exception or reservation intended to be made therefrom of that which the agreement to sell such land would otherwise carry by implication. While the words struck out do not correspond exactly with the words of exception or reservation in the Crown grant, they do so substantially; and they would (speaking generally) have sufficed, had they remained in the instrument, to preclude a claim by the purchaser of a right to receive what had been so reserved to the Crown.\nLater in the instrument, and as part of the printed form not stricken out, we find a covenant by the vendor that, if the purchaser pay the purchase money and perform all and singular the conditions of the agreement, he shall be entitled to receive from the vendor a transfer of the land in fee simple,\nexcepting thereout and therefrom all coal mines and other minerals including petroleum and natural gas and valuable stones.\nEx facie there is an ambiguity in this document the only exception from the description of the property purchased being\nany overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands.\nPrima facie the purchaser is entitled to get the land agreed to be sold subject only to this exception; but, in the covenant to convey, the exception, subject to which the title is to be transferred, reads\nexcepting thereout and therefrom all coal mines and other minerals in chiding petroleum, natural gas, and valuable stones\nwhich forms the most substantial part of the very exception that the parties had deliberately stricken from the printed form where it was appended to the description of the property sold. That he was satisfied of the bona fides and honesty of the defendant in refusing the vendor's demand that he carry out the purchase, on the ground of the latter's inability to make title to the mines and minerals, is a necessary implication of the learned trial judge's judgment, which the Appellate Division has accepted. That court, under these circumstances, considered itself entitled to look at the words which had been so stricken out and for which the words, \"any overriding royalty, etc.,\" were substituted, not to vary nor to contradict them, but to con- firm their completeness. As I read the opinion of my learned brother, on the authority of Inglis v. Buttery 9, he thinks this course was unjustified. He would reconcile the words of exception in the vendor's covenant for the deed with the exception in the description of the lands to be sold by saying that\nthey operate in the same field only with relation to oils or gas, and there they do not conflict.\nWith the utmost respect, I am unable to accept the view that they can be so reconciled. The idea that a clause in the sale agreement which excludes from the property to be conveyed\nall coal mines and other minerals including petroleum, natural gas and valuable stones,\nis not hopelessly inconsistent with a clause therein which excepts from the property purchased only\nany overriding royalty of ten per cent of all oils or gas found or produced from said lands\nI have, with deference, much difficulty in appreciating. While, no doubt, under ordinary circumstances, it is not proper to look at deleted words in an instrument as an aid to its construction (Inglis v. Buttery[9]), that rule, I venture to think, is sometimes too broadly stated and does not apply where, as a result of the deletion, there is an ambiguity such as that now before us. In Inglis v. Buttery 9 Lord O'Hagan said (p. 571) that the court was asked to commit the error of \"attempting to construe a contract, perfect in itself, by acts antecedent to it.\" In that case no ambiguity whatever resulted from the deletion. After the words had been stricken out the contract was clear, unambiguous and complete. In the case at bar, on the contrary, the ambiguity is obvious and, under such circumstances, the principle on which the Court of Exchequer decided Strickland v. Maxwell[10], in my opinion, governs. While I cannot find that that judgment has been followed or expressly approved in subsequent cases, on the other hand, its correctness has never been challenged so far as I am aware; and it is cited in modern text books of repute as authoritative. See Norton on Deeds, 2nd Ed., (1928), at p. 94; Beal on Legal Interpretation, 3rd Ed., (1924), pp. 123-4. It upholds the conclusion reached by the Appellate Division that the exception inserted in handwriting in place of the words stricken out, was the whole exception which the parties intended to make from the property that formed the subject of their contract. The material facts of Strickland v. Maxwell [11] are indistinguishable in substance from those now before us and, as I read the judgment in that case, it does not at all conflict with that of the House of Lords in Inglis v. Buttery[12]. In the latter case no ambiguity whatever resulted from the striking out of the words at which, it was there held, the court should not look for the purpose of construing the contract. Effect was given to the words left after the deletion, viz:\u2014 the plating of the hull to be carefully overhauled and repaired, as if the words stricken out,\nbut if any new plating is required the same to be paid for extra,\nhad never been in the draft contract. Here the respondent relies upon the substituted words of exception and merely invokes the deleted words in order to put it beyond doubt that the former expressed the entire exception which the parties intended. But for the existence, in a later part of the printed form, of the vendor's covenant restricting the scope of the deed which he undertook to give by an exception almost as wide as the printed words stricken out after the description, the resultant inconsistency presumably having escaped attention, this case would have been clearly within the authority of Inglis v. Buttery 12 and must have been decided as the Appellate Division has decided it. It is perhaps needless to add that in Inglis v. Buttery 12 there is no allusion whatever to Strickland v. Maxwell 11.\nThe presence of the words of exception in the vendor's covenant at the highest creates an ambiguity in the agreement before us and makes the intention of the parties doubtful. The fact that nobody seems to know precisely what was meant by the handwritten exception following the description does not lessen the uncertainty of the situation. Under these circumstances, several pertinent rules of interpretation seem to require that effect should be given to the vendor's covenant as if its stipulation for an exception were the same as that in the defendant's agreement to purchase. It is of the latter's undertaking to pay the purchase money for the lands sold, which alone contains the obligation of the purchaser, that the plaintiff demands specific performance. Specific performance of a contract such as this, at the instance of either party, should, if resisted, be refused. (Stuart v. Alliston[13]; In re Davis and Cavey[14]. Specific performance with compensation for the inability to transfer mines and minerals by abatement in the purchase price has not been suggested, probably because the difference in value would be so problematical that it could not be fairly computed. (Brooks v. Rounthwaite[15]; Holiday v. Lockwood[16].\nIn aid of the view I have taken, reference may be made to the rule of construction that, if there be conflict between the written and the printed parts of an instrument, ordinarily the written part must be given effect to (Robertson v. French[17]; Gumm v. Tyre[18], rather than the printed part, inasmuch as attention had been pointedly drawn to the change made in writing and it, rather than mere printed words of a general formula, may be supposed to express, in their own language, the intention of the parties.\nAnother ordinary rule of construction, in case of conflict between earlier and later provisions of instruments inter vivos, is that the earlier is usually held to prevail.\nNo case had been made for reformation of the exception to the description to make it conform to the terms for which the vendor's covenant provides; and, if such a case had been made, it is doubtful whether a decree for specific performance of an agreement so reformed should be granted. Moreover, the reservation in the deed, for which the vendor's covenant stipulates, does not include the right to go upon the land and full power to work the mines, etc., which were explicitly covered by the exception in the Crown grant. The materiality of such an omission was considered by this court in Fuller v. Garneau[19]. For the foregoing reasons I would uphold the judgment of the Appellate Division dismissing the vendor's claim for the special, extraordinary and discretionary equitable remedy of specific performance.

(Third Party) Respondent.\n1930: March 14; 1930: May 5; 1930: June 11.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nExchequer Court\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Third party procedure introducing matter purely of civil right as between subject and subject\u2014B.N.A. Act, s. 101 (establishment of courts for better administration of \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d)\u2014Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, ss. 30, 87, 88\u2014Exchequer Court Rules 262-269.\nThe Crown took proceedings in the Exchequer Court to recover from defendant upon certain bonds. Defendant, by third party notice, in the form prescribed by Exchequer Court Rule 262, claimed indemnity against the third party under an agreement between defendant and the third party. Upon motion by the third party, Audette J. ([1929] Ex. C.R., 101) set aside the third party notice, without prejudice to any existing right of indemnity which defendant might have. Defendant appealed.\nHeld (Newcombe J. dissenting): The third party notice was rightly set aside. It was not authorized by the Exchequer Court Rules, construed with due regard to s. 101 of the B.N.A. Act, which authorized the creation of that court, and to the terms in which Parliament has conferred jurisdiction on it (Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34; s. 30 particularly dealt with). The words \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d in said s. 101 mean laws enacted by the Dominion Parliament and within its competence; s. 101 does not enable Parliament to set up a court competent to deal with matters purely of civil right in a province as between subject and subject. Therefore, even if, ex facie, said rule 262 might be broad enough to include a third party procedure in a case such as that in question, it cannot have been intended to have any such effect, since so to construe it would be to attribute to the Exchequer Court an intention, by its rules, to confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it would transcend the power of Parliament to give to it. Nor can it be said that it is \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d (Montreal v. Montreal Street Ry., [1912] A.C., 333, at pp. 344-6) to the exercise by that court of the jurisdiction conferred upon it, that it should possess power to deal with matters such as were here attempted to be introduced by the third party procedure, even where they arise out of the disposition of cases within its jurisdiction.\nPer Newcombe J. (dissenting): The words \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d in s. 101 of the B.N.A. Act include any law which operates in the Dominion, whether by statute or as part of the common law. The Dominion\u2019s powers under s. 101 were not intended so to be restricted or controlled as to cease to be exercisable when they come into contact with an issue between individuals relating to property and civil rights in a province. In the Exchequer Court Act Parliament has validly given the Exchequer Court jurisdiction in cases within which the present action falls; and the third party procedure in question was authorized by rules (which are statutory rules) validly made.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Consolidated Distilleries Limited from the judgment of Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], granting (without prejudice to any existing right of indemnity which the defendant might have) a motion made by the third party to set aside the third party notice issued herein by the said defendant, on the ground that the issue raised by the third party notice between the defendant and the third party was one over which that court had no jurisdiction. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Anglin C.J.C., now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Newcombe J. dissenting.\nF. T. Collins for the appellant.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. and G. H. Sedgewick K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by Anglin C.J.C.\u2014The Attorney-General, by his information, filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada, on the 26th of December, 1928, claimed, upon seven export bonds, to recover from the defendant (appellant) the sum of $445,093, with interest at five per cent. from the 15th of October, 1924, the date of the bonds. An agreement under seal of the 24th of October, 1924, is produced, whereby the third party covenants to indemnify the appellant against any loss, damages or expenses which the appellant may suffer or be put to by reason of these bonds; and, by third party notice, filed on the 31st of January, 1929, the appellant claimed indemnity under the said agreement, adopting the third party procedure of the Exchequer Court, Rules 262 to 269 inclusive, according to the form prescribed by Rule 262, whereby the third party is notified in the following terms:\u2014\nAnd take notice that if you wish to dispute the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action as against the defendant, Consolidated Distilleries Limited, or your liability to the defendant, Consolidated Distilleries Limited, you must cause an appearance to be entered for you within eight days after service of this notice.\nIn default of your so appearing you will be deemed to admit the validity of any judgment obtained against the defendant Consolidated Distilleries Limited and your own liability to indemnify to the extent herein claimed, which may be summarily enforced against you, the whole with costs.\nThe defendant, by its defence filed on the 12th of February, 1929, pleaded, among other allegations, its right to indemnity and the issue and service of the third party notice.\nIt should here be observed that Rule 262 of the third party procedure, as it appears at p. 503 of Audette\u2019s Exchequer Court Practice, 2nd ed., was rescinded on the 28th of May, 1921, and replaced by the following:\u2014\nWhere a defendant claims to be entitled to contribution or indemnify from or entitled to relief over against any person not a party to the action, he may issue a notice (hereinafter called the third party notice) in the form given in schedule \u201cZ\u201d to these rules, with such variations as circumstances may require, which shall be stamped with the seal of the Court and shall state the nature and grounds of the claims.\nA copy of the notice shall be filed with the Registrar, and a copy together with a copy of the information, petition of right, or statement of claim, as the case may be, shall be served on the third party within the time limited for the delivery of his defence.\nThe third party, immediately upon the service of the notice, obtained a summons against the defendant, dated the 8th of February, 1929, to shew cause why the third party notice should not be set aside. The motion was heard on the 12th of February before Audette J., and, by order of the 4th of March, that learned judge directed that the third party notice \u201cbe and the same is hereby set aside, without prejudice to any existing right of indemnity which the defendant may have.\u201d This order proceeded upon the ground that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction, the learned judge holding that the issue involved\nis a separate and distinct controversy from the one raised between the plaintiff and the defendant; it is resting upon a separate cause of action which must be tried and determined in the provincial court having jurisdiction over such matters[2].\nThe defendant appealed to this Court. Although its case was not, perhaps, very fully submitted, in substance its counsel contended that the third party notice, which it had given, is authorized by the Exchequer Court Rules (262 to 269 inclusive) and that the rules so authorizing it are within the competence of that Court.\nIn construing the rules of the Exchequer Court, however, attention must always be paid to s. 101 of the British North America Act (1867), which authorized the creation of that Court, and to the terms in which Parliament has conferred jurisdiction on it. It is not conceivable that, by mere rule of court, it should have been intended to enlarge the jurisdiction thus conferred, so as to embrace matters which it would not be otherwise competent for that Court to hear and determine. S. 101 of the British North America Act reads as follows:\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance, and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nIt is to be observed that the \u201cadditional courts\u201d, which Parliament is hereby authorized to establish, are courts \u201cfor the better administration of the laws of Canada.\u201d In the collocation in which they are found, and having regard to the other provisions of the British North America Act, the words, \u201cthe laws of Canada,\u201d must signify laws enacted by the Dominion Parliament and within its competence. If they should be taken to mean laws in force anywhere in Canada, which is the alternative suggested, s. 101 would be wide enough to confer jurisdiction on Parliament to create courts empowered to deal with the whole range of matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, including \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d in the provinces, although, by s. 92 (14) of the British North America Act,\nThe administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts\nis part of the jurisdiction conferred exclusively upon the provincial legislatures.\nWhen we come to look at the Exchequer Court Act itself (R.S.C., 1927, c. 34) we find that by s. 30, which outlines its general jurisdiction, that court is given,\nconcurrent original jurisdiction in Canada\n(a) in all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada, including, etc.;\n(b) in all cases in which it is sought at the instance of the Attorney-General of Canada, to impeach or annul any patent of invention, or any patent, lease or other instrument respecting lands;\n(c) in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought against any officer of the Crown for anything done or omitted to be done in the performance of his duty as such officer; and\n(d) in all other actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner.\nIt will be noted that in every instance the jurisdiction of the Court is confined to matters directly affecting the Crown in the right of the Dominion and to cases affecting its revenue, \u201cin which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada.\u201d\nWhile there can be no doubt that the powers of Parliament under s. 101 are of an overriding character, when the matter dealt with is within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, it seems equally clear that they do not enable it to set up a court competent to deal with matters purely of civil right as between subject and subject. While the law, under which the defendant in the present instance seeks to impose a liability on the third party to indemnify it by virtue of a contract between them, is a law of Canada in the sense that it is in force in Canada, it is not a law of Canada in the sense that it would be competent for the Parliament of Canada to enact, modify or amend it. The matter is purely one of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, concerning, as it does, a civil right in some one of the provinces (s. 92 (13) ).\nIt would, therefore, in our opinion, be beyond the power of Parliament to legislate directly for the enforcement of such a right in the Exchequer Court of Canada, as between subject and subject, and it seems reasonably clear that Parliament has made no attempt to do so. What Parliament cannot do directly, by way of conferring jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court, that court cannot itself do by virtue of any rule it may pass. It follows that, even if, ex facie, rule 262 of the Exchequer Court might be broad enough to include a third party procedure in a case such as that now before us, it cannot have been intended to have any such effect, since so to construe it would be to attribute to the Exchequer Court an intention, by its rules, to confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it would transcend the power of Parliament to give to it.\nOn this short ground the present appeal should be dismissed.\nWhile it might conceivably be convenient in some cases to have the Exchequer Court exercise, by way of third party procedure, a jurisdiction such as that here invoked, it certainly cannot be said that it is \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d (City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[3]) to the exercise by that court of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Parliament, that it should possess power to deal with such matters, even where they arise out of the disposition of cases within its jurisdiction. On the other hand, in many cases, and not at all improbably in the present case, it would be highly inconvenient that the Crown should be delayed in its recovery against the defendant liable to it while that defendant litigated with the third party a claim\u2014possibly very contentious\u2014to be indemnified by it.\nNewcombe J.\u2014Notwithstanding what was said at the hearing, and the view entertained by the majority of the Court, I am not persuaded to join in the dismissal of this appeal, and I shall mention briefly some of my reasons in favour of the jurisdiction. The question depends upon the interpretation of sec. 101 of the British North America Act, 1867, by which it is provided that\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance, and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nBy sec. 30 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 34,\nThe Exchequer Court shall have and possess concurrent original jurisdiction in Canada\n(a) in all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada, including actions, suits and proceedings by way of information to enforce penalties and proceedings by way of information in rem, and as well in qui tarn suits for penalties or forfeiture as where the suit is on behalf of the Crown alone;\n* * * * *\n(d) In all other actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner.\nLord Robertson, pronouncing the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Crown Grain Company Ltd, v. Day[4], said, with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada:\nThe appellants maintain that the implied condition of the power of the Dominion Parliament to set up a Court of Appeal was that the Court so set up should be liable to have its jurisdiction circumscribed by provincial legislation dealing with those subject-matters of litigation which, like that of contracts, are committed to the provincial Legislatures. The argument necessarily goes so far as to justify the wholesale exclusion of appeals in suits relating to matters within the region of provincial legislation. As this region covers the larger part of the common subjects of litigation, the result would be the virtual defeat of the main purposes of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is to be observed that the subject in conflict belongs primarily to the subject-matter committed to the Dominion Parliament, namely, the establishment of the Court of Appeal for Canada. But, further, let it be assumed that the subject-matter is open to both legislative bodies; if the powers thus overlap, the enactment of the Dominion Parliament must prevail. This has already been laid down in Dobie v. Temporalities Board[5]; and Grand Trunk Ry. Co. of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada[6].\nFrom this it may be inferred that the Parliament of Canada, in the execution of its powers under s. 101, has ancilliary legislative authority of the same character as it possesses under the enumerations of s. 91. But the case is capable of being stated even more strongly, seeing that the powers of Parliament under s. 101 are expressly declared to be exercisable, \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d; so that not only may the Parliament, within the scope of what is comprised in\nthe constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada\neffectively exercise powers of the ancillary variety, like those which are exemplified in such cases as Tennant v. The Union Bank of Canada[7], and The Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[8]; but it has moreover, perhaps by the most comprehensive language which the Imperial Parliament could have adopted, the unfettered power to establish courts \u201cfor the better administration of the laws of Canada\u201d; an expression which it is my purpose to shew is apt to include any law which operates in the Dominion, whether by statute or as part of the common law. It is of no use to suggest interference with the exclusive powers of the provinces. The Exchequer Court, constituted under s. 101, is not intended to interfere with or affect provincial powers or courts under the 14th head of s. 92; and that clause must, of course, be read with s. 101, which, within the intent of its language, is meant to prevail over anything to the contrary.\nThe law by which the defendant seeks to have its claim for indemnity established is, I think, a law of Canada not less truly than the law by which the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, seeks to recover the penalties stipulated by the bonds in suit. If this meaning be admissible, it simplifies the application of the statute; whereas the restricted interpretation which has been adopted involves difficulties and improbabilities which are, I fear, too serious to be overcome.\nThe respondent is willing to concede that \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d, in the context, embrace not only the statutes competently enacted by the Dominion, but also those provisions of the common law, as it exists in each of the provinces, which Parliament is empowered, in its discretion, to declare or change. It is thus suggested that anything is a law of Canada which the Parliament of Canada has power to enact; but there can be no law without a sanction; and therefore it must come to this, if such a contention can prevail, that the power of Parliament to enact constitutes the subject matter a law of Canada, although there has been no enactment; a proposition which seems to me incomprehensible. But, if I correctly apprehend the view expressed by the majority of the Court, the words extend only to laws competently enacted by the Parliament of Canada.\nNow, with great respect, I find it impossible to reconcile with reason or probability the suggestion that, if the Imperial Parliament had intended so to limit the Dominion power, it would have chosen an expression so ill qualified for the purpose, and so well adapted to a broader and more natural meaning; seeing, especially, that elsewhere throughout the Act, other and more apt words have been used to distinguish Parliamentary enactments from those which derive their force from the legislatures; and seeing moreover that, if there be no laws of Canada except those which are enacted by the Parliament of Canada, the Exchequer Court is, I venture to think, denuded of the greater part of the jurisdiction which it was designed to possess, and has heretofore generously and habitually exercised.\nIt is true that in 1897, before the the third party rule was promulgated, Burbidge J. refused to make a third party order in The Queen v. Finlayson[9], saying that he had no jurisdiction over an issue between the defendant and Mr. Corby, and that he had made such an order in one case only, where the Crown was defendant and all parties consented. This suggests that the learned judge may have refused in the exercise of his discretionary power; but his reason for denying the application is not very perfectly stated, and at that time the practice was not regulated, as now, by the procedure subsequently introduced and sanctioned by the learned judge\u2019s successor, on 28th May, 1921, which provides:\nWhere a defendant claims to be entitled to contribution or indemnity from or entitled to relief over against any person not a party to the action, he may issue a notice (hereinafter called the third party notice) in the form given in schedule \u201cZ\u201d to these rules, with such variations as circumstances may require, which shall be stamped with the seal of the Court and shall state the nature and grounds of the claims. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the Registrar, and a copy together with a copy of the information, petition of right, or statement of claim, as the case may be, shall be served on the third party within the time limited for the delivery of his defence.\nI wonder whether every clause of the British North America Acts is not a law of Canada? What about such sections as 41 and 65? Then there are the two great sections, 91 and 92, designed for the distribution and sanction of the Dominion and provincial legislative powers and enactments which are to have force in any part of the Dominion or of a province. Surely these are laws of Canada. There are legislative powers which may be exercised concurrently; see s. 95, respecting Agriculture and Immigration; and there are enactments of provincial origin which remain in force, although the power to supersede or alter them has passed to the Dominion, as in the case of works wholly situate within a province, which are, after their execution, declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage, under the 10th enumeration of s. 92. And there is s. 93, respecting Education. In the case of agriculture and immigration, there might be identical laws in force in a province at the same time, one enacted by Parliament, the other by the legislature. If Parliament were then to repeal its Act, the law would, I suppose, nevertheless remain, by virtue of its provincial sanction. But would that law, which had until then been a law of Canada, and still continued to operate as theretofore, not persist as a law of Canada?\nIt was not doubted at the hearing that there might be a law of Canada having local operation confined to a single province or part of a province; then if the sanction be adequate, why is a law not a law? What about the uniform laws, which might be produced by the execution of the powers conferred by s. 94?\nSection 129 must not be overlooked. To which category are to be referred the Imperial Acts included within the exception? Are these not laws of Canada, or are they laws of Canada only if they relate to matters which, had it not been for the exception, would have been within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe late Mr. Lefroy, who was a very careful commentator, in his Canadian Federal System, at pages 685 et seq., referring to Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[10], and the submission of Sir Robert Finlay, that \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d mean the laws of the Dominion as distinguished from the laws of the provinces, tells us that,\nIn the course of the argument, on Sir Robert Finlay so contending, Lord Macnaghten is reported as observing: \u201cIs that so very clear? I am not quite sure about that. I should have thought that the laws of Canada might embrace the laws of the several provinces.\u201d\nBut as this proved to be a side-point, it was not decided.\nMr. Lefroy also calls attention to the discussion which took place upon Mr. Bethune\u2019s application to the Judicial Committee for special leave to appeal in McLaren v. Caldwell[11], the notes of which are printed in (1883) 3 Can. Law Times, 343-346. The question was there debated as to the application and effect of the concluding words of s. 101 in relation to the general court of appeal for Canada, which, by the earlier words of the section, the Parliament of Canada is empowered to constitute, maintain and organize; and Sir Barnes Peacock, pronouncing the decision, although granting leave to appeal upon other points involved, said[12]:\nThere is one other point to which their Lordships wish to allude, that is, the objection which has been made to the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to pass the law with reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, and also the power of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain such an appeal as this, which involves a question of the construction of the Acts of the Provincial Parliament. Their Lordships do not think there is any ground for allowing that question to be raised on the hearing of the appeal.\nSee also the observations of Strong, C.J., in The City of Quebec v. The Queen[13].\nIf the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction only for the administration of Dominion statutes, or laws which might be enacted as Dominion statutes, then what is to be done with civil proceedings by or against the Crown, involving the enforcement of contracts, actions of assumpsit, etc., and petitions of right generally? See the reporter\u2019s note in Smith v. Upton[14]; Feather v. The Queen[15]; Thomas v. The Queen[16]. All such actions, when the Dominion Crown is a party, have been uniformly entertained and adjudicated in the Exchequer Court, and nobody has questioned its jurisdiction, although there would seem to be no adequate foundation for it if \u201cthe laws of Canada\u201d consist only in Dominion statutes. What possible jurisdiction, I wonder, has the court to adjudge a simple action of assumpsit for or against the Crown, if its jurisdiction be limited to Dominion statutes, or even if, by any ingenuity of interpretation, it extend also to provisions which, though not enacted, would be competent to Parliament to enact? Or, for instance, if the Dominion Crown, having become an ordinary bailee of goods in one of the provinces, fail to fulfil its obligation to deliver the goods, doubtless a petition of right would lie, but the case would not be ruled by any Dominion statute, or, I shall assume, any law that the Parliament of Canada could make. Nevertheless the Exchequer Court would readily, in accordance with all past practice, try and determine the petition, and it would be governed by the common or statute law effective in the province. I confess I do not see how such a case is admitted to a jurisdiction which extends only to the administration of Dominion statutes.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is defined by the Exchequer Court Act in secs. 18 and 19, et seq., and one cannot read these sections without realizing that Parliament interpreted its powers as extending far beyond the limit which is now suggested. It was said by Sir Montague Smith, in the course of his judgment in Citizens and Queen Insurance Companies v. Parsons[17], that\nThe declarations of the Dominion Parliament are not, of course, conclusive upon the construction of the British North America Act; but when the proper construction of the language used in that Act to define the distribution of legislative powers is doubtful, the interpretation put upon it by the Dominion Parliament in its actual legislation may properly be considered.\nThe Crown frequently interpleads two subjects\u2014a procedure which is specially provided for by s. 25 of the Exchequer Court Act. Proceedings under this clause have not been uncommon, and, like third party proceedings, they have for their object the determination of claims between individuals, but the jurisdiction in cases of interpleader has, so far as I am aware, never been doubted.\nTo mention another example, the principle of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act had, at the Union, been legislatively adopted by all the uniting provinces, and it was therefore the law in every one of them. Is it not to be embraced within the laws of Canada for the purposes of s. 101?\nI have already shewn that, in the constitution of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Parliament has given the court original jurisdiction, concurrent with that of the provincial courts, in all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada, and in all other actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner; and the present action falls under one or other or both of these descriptions.\nThe rules defining the practice and procedure of the Exchequer Court are statutory rules, and not subject to be reviewed judicially, so long as they are not ultra vires of Parliament to enact, and the procedure now in question, which has been condemned by the learned judge below, has been expressly sanctioned in the manner authorized by secs. 87 and 88 of the Exchequer Court Act. See Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood[18]. The rules of court are designed for the better administration of the laws of Canada, and there can be no question as to the advantage, in experience and fact, of the practice introduced and authorized by third party procedure.\nFor my part, I cannot suppose that the Dominion powers under s. 101 are intended so to be restricted or controlled as to cease to be exercisable when they come into contact with an issue between individuals relating to property and civil rights in a province.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

S. having died, his executors sued the bank and F. to recover these sums. It was contended in defence that F. had repaid them to S. Chisholm J. dismissed the action ([1930] 2 D.L.R. 617). His judgment was sustained, on equal division, by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (ibid). Plaintiffs appealed.\nHeld (reversing the judgments below, Cannon J. dissenting), that, on the evidence, defendants had not acquitted themselves of the onus of establishing repayment, and plaintiffs were entitled to recover; that, as to certain documents signed by S. at various times as to bank balance and vouchers, these documents, having regard to their form and the meaning which a customer would, in the circumstances, probably attach to them, and having regard to the facts that the sums in question were taken without authority and there were no vouchers in respect to them, were founded upon a fundamental error, and could have no evidentiary value in defendants\u2019 favour.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): The said documents, which were not shewn to have been obtained by any misrepresentation or fraud, were effective as corroboration and confirmation of F.\u2019s evidence of repayment, which was also corroborated in part by other material evidence; on the whole evidence, the judgments below in defendants\u2019 favour should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, on equal division of the court, affirmed the judgment of Chis- holm J.[2], dismissing their action. The plaintiffs were executors under the will of Thomas E. Stewart, deceased, and sued to recover certain sums alleged to have been withdrawn, during the deceased\u2019s lifetime, without deceased\u2019s authority, from the deceased\u2019s current account in the defendant bank, by the defendant Fraser, who was the local branch manager of the defendant bank. The main issue was as to whether or not the said sums had been repaid by the defendant Fraser to the deceased. The material facts of the case, as found in this Court, are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, Cannon J. dissenting.\nHector McInnes K.C. for the appellants.\nFrank Smith for the respondent Fraser.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent The Royal Bank of Canada.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The action with which this appeal is concerned was brought by the executors of the late Thomas E. Stewart against the respondent, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Roy C. Fraser, who was at the time of the material occurrences, manager of the bank\u2019s branch at Middle Musquodoboit. Mr. Stewart in his lifetime was engaged in farming, contracting, cattle dealing and lumber dealing, and kept a current account of considerable dimensions, as well as a savings account, at this branch. The plaintiffs claim to recover $5,000 and interest, which they allege was wrongfully abstracted from this current account by the defendant Fraser, while manager of the branch, in two sums: $3,500 on the 28th of February, 1922, and $1,500 on the 14th of February, 1924. The testator died in November, 1924.\nIt is not denied by either Fraser or the bank, indeed, it is explicitly admitted by both, that these sums were taken by Fraser without any authority, and it was conceded at the trial, and the trial proceeded upon the basis, that the sole issue was whether or not these sums had been repaid by Fraser in Stewart\u2019s lifetime. Fraser, it seems, had, in disobedience to his instructions, permitted the Musquodoboit Creamery Company, a customer of the bank, to exceed its credit. The sums abstracted from Stewart\u2019s account, were, it is alleged by Fraser, advanced by him as a personal loan to the Creamery Company in order to reduce that company\u2019s credit to the limit permitted by the bank; in form, however, the advance was made as an advance by the bank, and interest upon it was paid by the Creamery Company to the bank, although appropriated by Fraser.\nEraser\u2019s story is that the sum of $5,000 was restored to Stewart by the delivery to him of bearer bonds of the Dominion of Canada. As to the sum abstracted in February, 1922, that, in his examination-in-chief, he said was restored in the manner indicated on the occasion of the first visit of Stewart to the bank after the date of the abstraction, which would be about two months later than that date. In cross-examination he endeavoured to qualify that, and to fix the date of restitution at about six weeks later than the date of abstraction. As to the item of $1,500, only general evidence is given as to restitution by delivery of bonds; no date is mentioned.\nThe question then is, whether restitution by the delivery of bonds has been proved. No memorandum of any description is in existence containing any record of these transactions. Fraser is unable to give any description of the bonds except that they were \u201cGovernment of Canada bonds\u201d or \u201cWar bonds\u201d; he stated at the trial that he had segregated these bonds at the times of the several abstractions and attached a note to them indicating that they were the property of Stewart. But his evidence at the trial is not really consistent with the story he told to Mr. Melvin, who having discovered, as inspector, the irregularity in the Creamery Company\u2019s accounts, asked Fraser for an explanation. According to Mr. Melvin\u2019s account of this conversation, Fraser told him that he, Fraser, had made personal loans to the company and that the interest appropriated by him was interest upon these loans. On further inquiry the inspector eventually obtained the dates of the loans and the amounts of them. The form in which the loans were made was not consistent with the statement that they were personal loans; notes had been taken from the company payable to the bank, and the proceeds credited to the company\u2019s account in the ledger. The inspector wished an explanation of these facts, on the assumption that these loans were personal loans, and he says that after pressing Fraser for an explanation, Fraser \u201ceventually\u201d told him that both amounts credited to the Creamery Company had been taken from Stewart\u2019s account. Fraser then informed the inspector that he had made restitution to Stewart by giving him his own bonds. When pressed as to the character of the bonds, and as to particulars by which they might be identified, Fraser was unable to give any information. Mr. Melvin\u2019s evidence is this: \u201cI asked him if he could tell me what the character of the bonds was; he said he could not. Q. What reason did he give?\u2014A. He did not remember. Q. That is all you got?\u2014A. That is in effect all I got at any time.\u201d\nIt is not without significance in considering the credibility of Fraser that he dealt with two other accounts in the same manner in which he dealt with Stewart\u2019s; that, these two customers being alive, when the wrongful dealing was discovered, the bank accounted to them for the sums abstracted. It is desirable, I think, to cite verbatim Fraser\u2019s evidence on this point:\nQ. I want to know if when the money was abstracted from Cole\u2019s account, whether there were bonds put aside for his account; you took money from Cole\u2019s account exactly in the same way you took it from Stewart\u2019s?\u2014A. Mr. Cole denies me taking any money from him at all.\nQ. In any event, the Royal Bank have paid Cole a $1,000.\u2014A. I don\u2019t know about that.\nQ. Did you know that the contention of the Royal Bank is that Mr. Cole\u2014that the Musquodoboit Creameries is credited in exactly the same way from Cole\u2019s, as the $3,500 and the $1,500 from Stewart\u2019s account. Is that a fact?\u2014A. I can\u2019t swear to that.\nQ. What about Mr. P. G. Archibald\u2019s account?\u2014A. He has given me authority to charge his account whenever I wanted it.\nQ. You took money from Mr. Archibald\u2019s account in the same manner?\u2014A. I won\u2019t swear to that.\nQ. And the Royal Bank have returned to Mr. Archibald the amount that was taken from the account?\u2014A. I will not swear to that.\nQ. They were sent credit slips?\u2014A. Not that I know of; I don\u2019t know they were sent credit slips or not.\nQ. Did you know they were accounted for; both these sums were accounted for to Archibald and Cole?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. They happen to be living and Stewart is dead.\u2014A. Probably they are.\nFraser\u2019s conduct after his interview with Mr. Melvin must also be considered. The bank declined to accept his explanation of the transaction and required him to procure an affidavit from the personal representatives of Stewart, confirming his statement. He did succeed in procuring from the son a letter, by telling him that he had given bonds to his father and that these sums were in payment of these bonds, and suggesting that there were reasons for silence with regard to the transaction. He begged him not to disclose the matter to his mother. The bank refused to accept the letter and he pressed both mother and son for an affidavit. In order to influence the mother to execute an affidavit, he told her that the son had given him a letter, upon which he had taken legal advice, and that he had been advised that the letter was binding. I can see no reason whatever for disbelieving the evidence of the plaintiffs as to what occurred between Fraser and themselves, and, putting it in the mildest way possible, I cannot credit him with having acted straightforwardly. His entire absence of recollection with respect to the character of the bonds, the date of their delivery, and with respect to any other particular of the transaction, when he was interviewed by Mr. Melvin, gives to his whole story a doubtful hue, and his transactions in relation to the Cole and Archibald accounts throw discredit on him personally. Considering the evidence, as far as I have reviewed it, alone, I should have no hesitation in concluding that the respondents have not acquitted themselves of the onus of establishing that restitution was made to Stewart by Fraser.\nThere remains, however, a further point, which is really the point upon which the majority of the court below proceeded. It is this: five documents dated respectively, May 2, 1922; October 3, 1922; October 20, 1923; March 24, 1924, and July 10, 1924, are produced from the possession of the bank. The first of them is as follows and the others are in the same form:\nTHE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA\nIncorporated 1869\nMiddle Musquodoboit, N.S., May 2, 1922.\nRECEIVED from THE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, Middle Musquodoboit, N.S., statement of my\/our account as at the close of business on April 29, 1922, showing a balance of $6,684.05 in my favour, together with vouchers for all amounts charged to the said account up to and including the said date. For valuable consideration I\/we agree to examine forthwith into the accuracy of the said statement and the regularity and validity of the said vouchers, and I\/we further agree that at the expiration of ten days from the date hereof, the said statement shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the balance therein shown, and the bank shall be and is released from all claims by me\/us in respect of any and every item shown in the said statement, save such as shall have been questioned or objected to in writing within the said ten days.\n(Sgd.) T. E. STEWART.\nN.B.\u2014This Receipt and Undertaking must be signed by the Customer or his Attorney.\nIt is first necessary to observe that the document is a receipt for vouchers, for vouchers for all amounts charged to the \u201csaid account\u201d up to and including the \u201csaid date.\u201d Now this is a receipt produced to the customer by the bank for signature, and there can be no possible doubt as to the meaning of the word voucher used in it; it is something in the nature of authority or some evidence or record of authority to the bank to dispose of the sums charged. Admittedly, there never was any such voucher in respect of these sums of $3,500 and $1,500; as to the sum of $3,500, there is a vague suggestion, but as evidence it is negligible. And here it must be insisted on, because it is vital, that the case has proceeded from the beginning to the end on the basis that neither the bank nor Fraser had authority to abstract these sums. Eraser\u2019s story from the beginning was that he took the money and with it made personal loans to the Creamery Company. It is perfectly plain, therefore, that this document is founded upon a fundamental error and as against the deceased Stewart can have no evidentiary weight as to the state of the account. It is to be observed that the document as drawn by the bank, and presented by the bank to its customer, is one of those documents which, being in ambiguous form, can be no protection. Read without extraordinary care by a customer, relying not only on the honesty, but upon the reasonable care of his banker, he might very well receive from it the idea: here are vouchers for all the sums charged, examine them and see whether or not they are genuine and if we do not hear from you within ten days, we are to be at liberty to assume that the balance is correct. That, I think, in the circumstances, is the meaning a customer would probably attach to this piece of paper; and the customer\u2019s signature is of no value whatever as evidence in favour of the bank or anyone else. I have come to the conclusion that the reasons given by Mr. Justice Paton are conclusive. The learned trial judge, I think, with very great respect, has misdirected himself as to the onus of proof; and so, also, again with very great respect, Mr. Justice Mellish.\nOne observation seems proper. In view of Fraser\u2019s stand, the bank cannot properly be censured for submitting the dispute to the courts, and nothing said above should be construed as a reflection upon their conduct.\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the appellants should have judgment for the amount of their claim with costs in all courts.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs, as executors and trustees of Thomas E. Stewart, who died on or about the 7th day of November, 1924, sued, on the 3rd January, 1929, the Royal Bank of Canada and Roy C. Fraser. They claimed that on the 28th day of February, 1922, the sum of $3,500, and on the 14th day of February, 1924, a further sum of $1,500, were withdrawn from the current account of the said deceased at the branch of the Royal Bank of Canada at Middle Musquodoboit, in the County of Halifax, by the defendant Roy C. Fraser, or under his direction, without the knowledge, authority or direction of the deceased. No restitution or refund of said sums of money or any part thereof having been made to the deceased, or to his executors, the executors and trustees claim:\n1. $3,500 with interest at the rate of 5% from the 28th day of February, 1922;\n2. $1,500 with interest at the rate of 5% from the 14th day of February, 1924; and\n3. An accounting with respect to all the accounts and dealings of the said deceased with the bank.\nThe respondents filed separate defences.\nThe Royal Bank admits that the amounts were withdrawn from the current bank account of the deceased, at the dates mentioned, by the defendant Fraser, or under his direction; but the bank has no knowledge, and does not admit, that the said withdrawals, or either of them, were made by the said Fraser without the knowledge, authority or instruction of the deceased. The bank further admits that no restitution or refund of the said sums of money, or any part thereof, has been made to the deceased or his estate by the bank; but alleges that it does not know and does not admit that no restitution or refund of the said sums of money or any part thereof has been made to the deceased, or his estate, by Fraser.\nThe substantial defence of Fraser is found in the following paragraphs of his plea:\n(c) He denies that the said sums of $3,500 and $1,500 were withdrawn from the current bank account of the said Thomas E. Stewart, deceased, without his knowledge, authority or instructions and he further denies that no restitution thereof in whole or in part was ever made. On the contrary he says that shortly after the said amounts were deducted from the said current account he paid and delivered over to the said Thomas E. Stewart with full knowledge of the said withdrawals and in complete discharge thereof bonds in the one case in the amount of $3,500 and in the other case in the amount of $1,500 which the said Thomas E. Stewart accepted in full and thereupon and thereafter on at least three occasions the said Thomas E. Stewart by acknowledgments in writing\u2014having received the said bonds as aforesaid\u2014acknowledged his current account with the defendant Bank and the balances showing to his credit to be absolutely true and correct although the said charges against his said current account remained standing on the books.\n(d) The said defendant repeats paragraph 2 (c) hereof and says that the acknowledgments in writing were in the following forms mutatis-mutandis\u2014\n\u201cThe Royal Bank\n\u201cReceived from the Royal Bank of Canada statement of my account as at the close of business on 19, showing a balance of $ in my favour, together with vouchers for all amounts charged to the said account up to and including the said date.\n\u201cFor valuable consideration I agree to examine forthwith into the accuracy of the said statement and the regularity and validity of the said vouchers and I further agree that at the expiration of ten days from the date hereof the said statement shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the balance therein shown and the Bank shall be and is released from all claims by me in respect of any and every item shown in the said statement save such as shall have been questioned or objected to in writing the said ten days,\u201d and that neither within ten days after the signing of the said acknowledgment nor within any other time nor at all did the said Thomas E. Stewart in his lifetime nor the plaintiffs as his legal representatives after his death nor any other person ever question or object to in writing or otherwise the said statements of account as referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph hereof and the plaintiffs are thereby estopped and precluded from now calling into question either the said statements or the absolute correctness thereof.\nThe appellants, in their reply to this defence, denied the delivery of bonds to Thomas E. Stewart in his lifetime, and stated that any acknowledgments as to the correctness of his balance at the bank were obtained by the fraud and misrepresentation of Fraser; and that, at no time, was Thomas E. Stewart given a full disclosure of his correct account with the bank, and that Fraser concealed from Stewart the true facts as to the state of his account.\nThe action came for trial before Mr. Justice Chisholm.\nThe plaintiffs produced their own evidence, together with that of Willard Melvin, inspector of the bank, who explained how he discovered, in 1928, certain irregularities in the management of the branch by Fraser, and exacted from the latter that he should secure first a letter, then an affidavit from plaintiffs respecting the deceased\u2019s dealings with the bank. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence describes the embarrassed efforts made by Fraser to secure from them, four years after the settlement of the account, and after they had destroyed all vouchers, the additional documents requested by this very cautious inspector. Another witness for the plaintiffs was one George Wilson, whom Fraser asked, when he was threatened with the present action, to see Arnold E. Stewart, in order to try and reach an amicable settlement. The plaintiffs did not produce the deceased\u2019s pass-book and claim that it could not be located.\nDefendant Fraser was heard and swore positively that he had on both occasions acted under implicit instructions from the deceased and had given satisfaction or consideration to the latter, with bonds of the value of $3,500 in one instance, and of $1,500 in the other; and that, on both occasions, in 1922 and in 1924, they were accepted by Stewart and taken away by him.\nThis evidence, by itself, would not be sufficient under R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 225, c. 37, which provides that\nin any action, or proceeding in any court, by or against the heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party to the action shall not obtain a verdict, judgment, award, or decision therein on his own testimony, or that of his wife, or of both of them, in respect to any dealing, transaction, or agreement with the deceased, or in respect to any act, statement, acknowledgment, or admission of the deceased, unless such testimony is corroborated by other material evidence.\nThe decision of this case rests entirely on the solution of the question whether or not Fraser\u2019s testimony is corroborated by sufficient material evidence to support the judgment dismissing the action. I quite agree that if we had only Fraser\u2019s evidence to support his plea of payment and satisfaction on the two occasions above mentioned, the appeal should be maintained. But the Executors cannot have more rights before this court than Stewart himself would have been able to exercise in his lifetime, and they are bound by Stewart\u2019s signature, given on five different occasions, on the bank\u2019s verification receipts dated May 2, 1922, October 3, 1922, October 20, 1923, March 24, 1924, and July 10, 1924. This man in active business, who, according to his wife\u2019s evidence, \u201cwhenever he came home would have a statement verified at the bank\u201d, must be credited with enough intelligence to perceive that during that period his current account had been reduced on two occasions by the rather large amounts of $3,500 and $1,500; surely he must have received satisfaction or consideration for his money before he acknowledged that the balances shewn by his account at those dates were correct. His signature, and his failure to question or object to these statements within ten days from the dates thereof, unless induced by fraud and misrepresentation, bind his heirs and representatives. The latter grasped this, when, in their reply to the plea, they claimed that these receipts or acknowledgments had been secured through misrepresentations and fraud. No attempt whatever has been made by the plaintiffs to prove these allegations, so that we must accept and give their full value to these documents signed by the deceased: mortus adhuc loquitur, and he gives evidence for the defence. This is more than corroboration; it is confirmation of Fraser\u2019s defence.\nMoreover, Robert McFetridge, who was in the employ of the bank from January 1, 1924, gave material evidence corroborating in part Fraser\u2019s version. He swore that Stewart, in the last year of his life, was frequently in the bank and asked for his balance from the ledger keeper. This witness also saw Stewart with his pass-book, which was written up and handed to him on several occasions; and he also remembers that, in the latter part of the winter of 1924, Mr. Fraser brought out his own deposit box, at a time when Mr. Stewart was in the bank, set it on witness\u2019s desk, took out some bonds and took them into his office; a few minutes later Fraser called witness to bring a large envelope; Fraser put these bonds in the envelope and handed them over to the late Mr. Stewart. This witness was not cross-examined by the plaintiffs.\nThe whole of the evidence of record, except that part based on more or less suspicious circumstances which occurred four years after the death of the bank\u2019s client, favours the defendant. In presence of the five receipts and quit claims bearing the signature of the testator, and the latter\u2019s inaction from May 2, 1922, to the time of his death in November, 1924, the Executors had to prove their allegation of error through defendant\u2019s fraud and misrepresentation; this they have failed to do. The trial judge saw and heard Fraser in the witness box; and, to use his own words, he was not prepared to find his statement untrue, as it was supported by the vouchers and acknowledgments already mentioned. Two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have also found that the defendant had proven his plea of payment, that he had given satisfaction to Stewart in his lifetime; and I do not see any reason why this Court should decide that these findings are contrary to the facts of the case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

Sections 80 to 90 of the Militia Act repose certain powers in the person occupying the position of Attorney-General in the province for the time being, but the exercise of these powers does not in any way depend upon the consent of the Lieutenant-Governor or of the provincial legislature. The Militia Act envisages the Attorney-General, not in his capacity as Attorney-General to His Majesty as the Sovereign Head of the province, but as a person in whom certain powers are vested and on whom certain duties are laid by the statute. These sections apply to every province and go into operation independently of the scope of the Attorney-General\u2019s authority to bind the province in respect of the expenditure of moneys for such purpose. Therefore these enactments do not contemplate a duty to pay, proceeding from a contract between the province and the Dominion. The revenues of the province are vested in His Majesty as the supreme head of the province, and the right of appropriation of all such revenues belongs to the legislature of the province exclusively. Semble that the Attorney-General (whose duties, in so far as now material, include the supervision of the administration of justice within the province) has no statutory authority to undertake the payment now demanded by the Dominion: the subject matters comprised within the supervision of the administration of justice would not embrace authority to enter into such an undertaking.\nPer Newcombe J. (dissenting).\u2014Assuming that sections 84, 86 (3) and 89 of the Militia Act are ineffective to bind the province without provincial sanction, there are other valid provisions remaining, respecting Aid of the Civil Power, which are independent of and separable from the impugned Dominion provisions, and which provide all legislation that the Dominion requires to enable it to maintain the claim now under consideration. An Order in Council was not necessary in order to bind the province, seeing the authority which the provincial Attorney-General, who requisitioned the troops, had by statute, as the political head to whom adequate executive power was delegated; and the provincial Government, during the long period of military activity, had stood by consenting.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014Such an undertaking, signed by the Attorney-General acting as such on behalf of the province of Nova Scotia, to be valid and binding on the province, would have to be ratified by the legislature, as it would affect the finances and dispose of the revenues of the province. But it is the spirit of our constitution that, in emergencies beyond the control of the civil power in one province, the cost of the aid given by the Dominion militiamen should be borne by the province. In this case, the province of Nova Scotia is only conditionally liable to the Dominion for the expenses now claimed, because, since the amending of the Militia Act, in 1924, the legislature has not yet passed legislation concurrent with that Act and has not yet voted the necessary funds to honour the signature of its Attorney-General who, under the rule of ministerial solidarity, acted for and on behalf of the government of the province. REFERENCE by the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, of the following question:\n\u201cIs the province of Nova Scotia, on the facts (hereinafter) set out, liable to pay to His Majesty in the right of the Dominion all expenses and costs incurred by reason of the calling out of part of the Active Militia in aid of the civil power in Cape Breton as aforesaid?\u201d\nThe facts, as stated in the Order in Council, are as follows:\n\u201cUpon and in pursuance of a requisition dated 11th June, 1925, from the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia (a true copy whereof is contained in the Schedule hereto annexed, marked \u201cA\u201d), made by him under the provisions of sections 81, 85 and 86 of the Militia Act, as enacted by chapter 57 of the Statutes of Canada, 1924, the District Officer Commanding, Military District No. 6, at Halifax, pursuant to the provisions of said section 81 and of section 82 of the Militia Act, as enacted by said Chapter 57 of the Statutes of 1924, called out a portion of the Permanent Force to aid the civil power in connection with certain riots and disturbances in the County of Cape Breton, and as specified in the said requisition.\n\u201cSubsequently, it appeared to the District Officer Commanding, Military District No. 6, to whom the said requisition was addressed, that the services of the Active Militia in Districts other than the one of which he was in Command were necessary for the purpose of suppressing or preventing the riot or disturbance mentioned. The said District Officer Commanding, pursuant to the provisions of Section 83 of the Militia Act, as enacted by the said Chapter 57 of the Statutes of 1924, notified the Adjutant-General of the number of officers and other ranks, horses and equipment which he considered necessary, and of which number the said section 83 makes the District Officer Commanding the sole judge.\n\u201cOn receipt of this notification, the Adjutant-General, pursuant to the powers vested in him by the said Section 83, ordered the despatch to Cape Breton of the further number of troops, horses and equipment required, the personnel, horses and equipment of the Permanent Force in Military Districts Nos. 1 (London), 2 (Toronto), 3 (Kingston), 4 (Montreal), 5 (Quebec), and (10 (Winnipeg), being used to fulfil the requirements of the District Officer Commanding, Military District No. 6.\n\u201cThe troops so called out remained on duty in aid of the civil power from the 12th June, 1925, to the 24th August, 1925, both dates inclusive, on which latter date they were finally withdrawn pursuant to the notification, dated 25th August, 1925, received from the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia (a true copy whereof is contained in the Schedule annexed hereto, marked \u201cB\u201d), that the services of the Active Militia were no longer required.\n\u201cThe expenses and costs incurred by His Majesty in the right of the Dominion, by reason of the Active Militia being called out as aforesaid, amount to $133,116.73, the details whereof are set out in the statement contained in the Schedule annexed hereto, marked \u201cC.\u201d\n\u201cThe Minister is informed by the Deputy Minister of National Defence that the said statement sets out only those expenses which were actually incurred by His Majesty in the right of the Dominion by reason of the Militia being called out in aid of the civil power as aforesaid, and that there are not included in such expenses any sums with respect to the pay and allowances paid to the officers and men so called out which would have been paid or with respect to the costs of the rations which would ordinarily have been issued to them in any event irrespective of whether or not they had been called out in aid of the civil power.\n\u201cThe Minister observes that the expenses and costs so incurred by His Majesty in the right of the Dominion are, by section 89 of the Militia Act, as enacted by chap. 57 of the Statutes of 1924, required to be paid to His Majesty by the province of which the Attorney-General made the requisition, and the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia purporting to act for and on behalf of the Province of Nova Scotia, moreover, gave an undertaking in the terms set forth in the requisition made by him as aforesaid that all expenses and cost so incurred by His Majesty should be paid to His Majesty by the said province. \u201cThe Minister reports that he has received from the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia in confirmation of allegations of fact first communicated to the Dominion Government or any officer thereof by telegram from the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia to the Deputy Minister of Justice, dated 3rd February, 1928, satisfactory proof, in the form of a statutory declaration, dated 9th February, 1928, made by one Arthur S. Barnstead of the city of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, Clerk of the Executive Council for the said province, of the statements of fact hereinafter set out, and the Minister recommends that the said statements of fact be embodied in the narrative of facts herein set out, subject to the reservation of all pleas or claims in law or equity which are or may be open or available to the Crown in the right of the Dominion. The said statements of fact, numbered paragraphs (1) and (2) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) That His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council made no order authorizing, ratifying, or confirming, or in any way whatever referring to the making of a requisition by the Honourable W. J. O\u2019Hearn, Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, addressed to the District Officer Commanding Military District No. 6, Halifax, N.S., or to any other official or person, requiring such officer, official or person to call out the Active Militia or any part or portion thereof for the purpose of suppressing or dealing with any riot or disturbance, or authorizing, ratifying or confirming, or in any way whatever referring to the giving of an undertaking by the said W. J. O\u2019Hearn that all of any expenses and costs, or either of them incurred by His Majesty by reason of the Militia or any part or portion thereof being called out or serving in aid of the civil power pursuant to any requisition should be paid to His Majesty by the Province of Nova Scotia, and that there is no record of any such authorizing, ratifying or confirming by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in any other way, nor is there any record of any advice respecting the matter having been tendered to His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor by the Executive Council for the Province of Nova Scotia; and\n\u201c(2) That His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council made no order authorizing, ratifying, or confirming, or in any way whatever referring to the giving of a notification by the late the Honourable John C. Douglas, Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, addressed to the District Officer Commanding Military District No. 6, Halifax, N.S., or the officer appointed to administer that District or for the time being performing the duties of the District Officer Commanding that District, or to any other official or person, that the services of the Active Militia were no longer required in aid of the civil power, and that there is no record of any such authorizing, ratifying or confirming by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in any other way, nor is there any record of any advice respecting that matter having been tendered to His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor by the Executive Council for the Province of Nova Scotia.\n\u201cThe Minister further reports that there was not communicated, in any manner or form, to the Crown in the right of the Dominion, or to its officers, either at the time the said requisition with the undertaking therein embodied was made or during the whole period the Active Militia so called out remained on duty in Cape Breton, any notice of repudiation on the part of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council or Government of Nova Scotia of the authority of the Attorney-General to give the said undertaking for and on behalf of the Province or disavowal of the liability of the Crown in the right of the Province, under the said undertaking, to pay to the Crown in the right of the Dominion the expenses aforementioned, and that the first intimation received by the Dominion Government or by any of its officers of any intention on the part of the Province of Nova Scotia to repudiate the authority of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia to give such undertaking for and on behalf of the said Province, was contained in the telegram of the 3rd February, 1928, from the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia to the Deputy Minister of Justice aforementioned.\n\u201cThe Minister further reports that at the conference recently held at Ottawa between representatives of the Dominion and the several provincial governments, the representatives of the Government of Nova Scotia disputed the liability of the province of Nova Scotia to pay the expenses and cost incurred by His Majesty in the right of the Dominion as aforesaid, and it was agreed that this question was a proper question for the determination of the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201d\nL. Cannon K.C. and F. P. Varcoe for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nW. L. Hall K.C. for the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The liability which the province of Nova Scotia is alleged to have incurred is based, if it exists, upon the requisition printed in the case, in these words:\nSchedule\n\u201cA\u201d\nATTORNEY-GENERAL OF NOVA SCOTIA\nProvince of Nova Scotia\nTo Wit: Halifax\nWhereas a notification has been received by me from the County Court Judge having jurisdiction in such place, that a riot or disturbance of the peace beyond the powers of the civil authorities to suppress or to deal with, and requiring the aid of the Active Militia to that end has occurred and is in progress at the Waterford Power plant at or near the town of New Waterford in the county of Cape Breton and elsewhere in the said county.\nAnd whereas it has been made to appear to my satisfaction that the services of the Active Militia are required in aid of the civil power.\nNow therefore I, the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia under and by virtue of the powers conferred by the Militia Act do hereby require you to call out the Active Militia or such portion thereof as you consider necessary for the purposes of suppressing or dealing with such riot or disturbance.\nAnd for and on behalf of the said province of Nova Scotia I, the said Attorney-General, hereby undertake that all expenses and costs incurred by His Majesty by reason of the militia, or any part thereof being called out or serving in aid of the civil power pursuant to this requisition shall be paid to His Majesty by the said province.\nDated at Halifax, this eleventh day of June, 1925.\n(Sgd.) W. J. O\u2019HEARN,\nAttorney-General.\nThe District Officer Commanding,\nM.D. No. 6,\nHalifax, N.S. On behalf of the Dominion, it is contended that the effect of the pertinent sections of the Militia Act (sections 80-90 inclusive) is to prescribe certain specified duties for the militia, upon a requisition being made by the Attorney-General of a province which includes an undertaking by the province to pay the expenses and costs incurred in the execution of the prescribed duties; that these provisions constitute in effect an offer by the Dominion to the province, and that upon the acceptance of the offer, accompanied by such an undertaking, a contractual obligation arises binding the province to pay such expenses and costs.\nOn behalf of Nova Scotia, it is contended that such is not the effect of the statute, and, moreover, that the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, who signed the requisition upon which the Dominion\u2019s claim is based, had no authority to bind the Crown in right of the province by any such undertaking.\nTo deal with the second question first, I am not satisfied that the Attorney-General (whose duties, in so far as now material, include the supervision of the administration of justice within the province) had any statutory authority to undertake the payments now demanded. I think the subject matters comprised within the supervision of the administration of justice would not embrace authority to enter into such an undertaking.\nIn the view I am about to state, however, it is really unnecessary to pass upon any question as to the scope of the authority of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia. I think Mr. Geoffrion\u2019s contention is unanswerable, that the sections of the Militia Act, upon which the Dominion relies, repose certain powers in the person occupying the position of Attorney-General in the province for the time being but that the exercise of these powers does not in any way depend upon the consent of the Lieutenant-Governor, or of the provincial legislature. That, I think, is made clear by subsection 3 of section 86, which is in these words:\n(3) Every statement of fact contained in any requisition made under the provisions of this Act shall be conclusive and binding upon the province on behalf of which the requisition is made; and every undertaking or promise in any such requisition contained shall be binding upon the province and not open to any question or dispute by reason of any alleged incompetence or lack of authority on the part of the Attorney-General to make the same, or for any other reason. Obviously this statute envisages the Attorney-General, not in his capacity as Attorney-General to His Majesty as the Sovereign Head of the province, but as a person in whom certain powers are vested, and on whom certain duties are laid by the statute. The sections apply to every province and go into operation independently of the scope of the Attorney-General's authority to bind the province in respect of the expenditure of moneys for such purposes.\nIt follows that these enactments do not contemplate a duty to pay proceeding from a contract between the province and the Dominion. The Solicitor-General in his very candid argument did not contend that the duty to pay these expenses could be imposed by the Dominion on the province in invitum, and that, of course, would be a plain violation of the fundamental principle of the British North America Act. The revenues of the province are vested in His Majesty as the supreme head of the province, and the right of appropriation of all such revenues belongs to the legislature of the province exclusively.\nThe provision authorizing the deduction of moneys due by a province under these sections from the annual subsidy does not help the Dominion. Obviously such a deduction could not constitutionally be made unless the province was under an obligation to pay.\nNEWCOMBE J. (dissenting).\u2014I shall state very briefly my view, which, unfortunately, differs from that of the majority. Let it be assumed that sections 84, 86 (3) and 89 are ineffective to bind the province without provincial sanction. Nevertheless, the other provisions of the Militia Act respecting Aid of the Civil Power are independent of these, and, having regard to the facts as I interpret them, establish the liability in question. I suggest that if the sections mentioned above had been re-enacted by the legislature of Nova Scotia, the province could not have escaped responsibility upon any of the grounds which have been urged. I am not convinced that it was the purpose of Parliament to subject the province, in invitum, to a statutory charge; I do not think it is necessary to infer such an intention from any of the provisions of the Militia Act. It is, I think, on the other hand, reasonably apparent that the foundation of the Dominion provisions, as enacted in 1924, rests upon an assumed authority in the Attorney-General, existing or provincially recognized, to bind his province by the terms of his requisition.\nNow the conditions under which the military forces may become serviceable are subject exclusively to Dominion regulation, and I think it must be considered, in view of the distribution of legislative power, as it exists, that the intention of Parliament in enacting the pertinent clauses was to formulate an offer to each of the provinces, setting forth the terms upon which the requisite military aid might be had. That, I am persuaded, is the meaning\u2014the pith and substance\u2014of the statutory requirements regulating the requisition; and, although it may be that provincial legislation is desirable, in order to facilitate the proof, and to implement and give comprehensive effect to the Dominion project, I am not satisfied that it is necessarily frustrated in the absence of a provincial enactment establishing the conclusive character of the requisition; or that a province, which has in form and in fact, by the proceedings of its Attorney-General, accepted the legislative offer of the Dominion and availed itself of the services of the militia and the benefits of the Act, should, in the circumstances of this case, be permitted to evade the payment of indemnity upon the contention that the Attorney-General has exceeded his authority. If Parliament has, in some particulars, such as sections 84, 86 (3) and 89, transcended its powers, or if the Dominion executive has acted in advance of the provincial legislation which may have been contemplated, the impugned Dominion provisions are nevertheless, separable, and there are valid clauses remaining which provide all legislation that the Dominion requires to enable it to maintain the claim now under consideration.\nBy the Public Service Act of Nova Scotia, chapter 9, of the Revised Statutes of the province, 1923, section 2,\nFor the administration of the public affairs of the Province there shall be the following departments:\u2014\n(1) The department of the Attorney-General, presided over by the Attorney-General * * *. Follows the enumeration of seven other departments, namely, Crown Lands, Provincial Secretary, Provincial Treasurer, Public Works and Mines, Education, Agriculture and Highways; and, by subsection (1) of section 3, it is enacted that the Governor in Council may create other departments, not exceeding three in number, and may from time to time assign thereto such affairs as are deemed expedient. There is thus the usual distribution and delegation of executive authority. By section 4 it is declared that\nThe functions, powers and duties of the Attorney-General shall be the following:\u2014\n(1) He shall be the law officer of the Crown, and the official legal adviser of the Lieutenant-Governor, and the legal member of the Executive Council.\n(2) He shall see that the administration of public affaire is in accordance with law, and shall have the superintendence of all matters connected with the administration of justice in the province not within the jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada.\n* * * * *\n(5) Ho shall have the regulation and conduct of all litigation for o\/?\/ against the Crown or any public department in respect to any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of the Government.\n(6) He shall have the functions and powers which belong to the office of the Attorney-General of England by law or usage so far as the same are applicable to this Province, and also the functions and powers which previous to coming into force of The British North America Act, 1867, belonged to the office of Attorney-General, in the Province of Nova Scotia and which under the provisions of that Act are within the scope of the powers of the Government of the province.\nIt is, moreover, provided by section 40:\nEvery official appointed under the authority of this chapter or any other statute of the province shall have such powers and perform such duties as are specified in any statute in that behalf, or are\u2019 from time to time determined by the Governor in Council.\nThe Dominion, therefore, in naming the Attorney-General, selected the head of that provincial department of Government which is charged by the local statutes with these wide-reaching powers relating to the administration and enforcement of law and order, and with whom the provincial decision as to the propriety and necessity of invoking military intervention seems constitutionally to rest. The question submitted is based upon stated facts, and it is not suggested that the Attorney-General came to an erroneous conclusion, or that his government was in any manner misled. The military force assigned to the duty was called out and remained on service from 12th June until 24th August, a period of 72 days, when the successor in office of the requisitioning Attorney-General gave the statutory notice that the services of the militia were no longer required. We are told that there was no order of the provincial executive council for either of these proceedings, also that there was no notice repudiating the authority of the Attorney-General; but, seeing the authority which the Attorney-General had by statute as the political head to whom adequate executive power was delegated, an Order in Council was not, in my view, essential; and, of course there is the plain inference, which is irresistible, that the Government, during the long period of military activity, stood by consenting; and, as said by Lord Eldon in Dann v. Spurrier[1]:\nThe circumstance of looking on is, in many cases, as strong as using the terms of encouragement.\nThere is no evidence as to the state of the provincial appropriations for the expenses incurred, but that is an internal matter; besides, there is at least the presumption of regularity, which is not in anywise rebutted; and, if the province deny the authority of its Attorney-General in matters apparently within the scope of his powers, it must, in my opinion, in order to maintain its position, make out a case which does not appear upon this record.\nI would, with all hesitation and deference which habitually attend upon my conclusion when I am persuaded to differ from my learned brethren, answer \u201cYes\u201d to the question submitted.\nCannon J.\u2014The Governor General in Council has referred for the consideration of the Supreme Court of Canada the following question: \u201cIs the province of Nova Scotia, on the facts set out in the Order in Council, liable to pay to His Majesty in the right of the Dominion all expenses and costs incurred by reason of the calling out of part of the active militia in aid of the civil power in Cape Breton?\u201d\nThe Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, by his requisition of the 11th of June, 1925, complied with the provisions of sections 81, 85 and 86 of the Militia Act, as enacted by the Parliament of Canada, c. 57, Statutes of Canada, 1924. The requisition signed by the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia contains an unconditional undertaking that the province shall pay to His Majesty all expenses and costs incurred by His Majesty by reason of the militia being called out in aid of the civil power.\nIt is not contended by the Dominion Government that the Militia Act would bind the province of Nova Scotia to pay, but that they are liable, on the facts of the case, either (1) by express contract (a) duly authorized, or (b) ratified, or (c) enforceable by virtue of estoppel, or (2) by implied contract, or (3) by implied constitutional obligation.\nEven if such a contract had been duly signed by the Attorney-General acting as such on behalf of the province of Nova Scotia, I believe that such a contract, to be valid, and binding on the province, would have to be ratified by the Legislature, as it affects the finances and disposes of the revenues of the province; and under sections 53, 54 and 90 of the B.N.A. Act, bills for the appropriation of any part of the public revenue must originate in the House of Commons or the Legislature and must first be recommended by message of the Governor General or Lieutenant-Governor in the session in which such vote is proposed. The following remarks of Wurtele J., a well known constitutional authority, re Demers v. Reginam[2], are in point:\nThe legislature enacts laws and grants supplies, but does not administer. The Crown under the advice of its constitutional advisers, or in other words the Executive Government, administers the affairs of the country, and on it rests the responsibility for all contracts which it may be necessary to enter into. The Executive Government deals with all matters respecting the administration of the public affairs of the country as it may deem conducive to the public good when its action is not restricted by a constitutional rule or by a prohibitory statute, but it has no constitutional authority to make a contract which will bind the Legislative Assembly to supply the necessary funds for carrying it on. It may be laid down, therefore, as an axiom that before entering into a contract which requires the expenditure of public monies, it is, in general, proper and expedient that the consent of the Legislature should be first obtained. The Executive Government may however, by exception, make a contract involving the expenditure of public monies before a grant has been made by the Legislature for the purpose contemplated by such contract; but such contract is in the nature of a conditional obligation, is in fact a conditional contract, and the condition is the granting by the Legislature of the necessary funds. Until this event happens, the obligation is suspended, and if the necessary supply should be refused, then the contract is dissolved. The Legislative Assembly has the right to approve or disapprove of all such contracts, and therefore it is usual to insert a clause that they are made subject to the ratification of the Legislature, or that the payments to be made on behalf of the same will be made out of monies to be voted by the Legislature. Should the Legislative Assembly, by a resolution, expressly disapprove of a contract which has been entered into without an appropriation for its performance having been made before its execution, even when it does not contain a clause making it subject to the ratification of the Legislature or to the grant of the necessary supply, then also the contract is dissolved. But should the necessary funds be voted, then the contract acquires retroactively full legal force and should be carried out by the Government, and can be enforced by the other contracting party. Every contract entered into by the Executive Government without there being a fund out of which the payment of the price stipulated can be made, or without there being an appropriation which is available for the purpose, is made on the tacit condition that it is dependent for its validity upon the necessary supply being voted; and as every person entering into a contract with the Government is presumed to know the law, he cannot complain, in the event of a grant being refused, or having no right to claim damages for its non-fulfilment.\nAlthough such contracts are conditional, the Executive Government has no right or power of its own motion to rescind them, but, on the contrary, it should ask the Legislature to grant the necessary appropriation and await the action of the Legislative Assembly.\nI would therefore say that the province of Nova Scotia, in this case, is conditionally liable to the Dominion for these expenses.\nIt seems to me that the spirit of our constitution, properly understood and applied, after establishing independent autonomous legislatures and also a central government to look after the common interests, requires that in emergencies beyond the control of the civil power in one province, the aid of the Dominion militiamen to act as special constables might be secured; but the extra cost of such cooperation should be borne by the province within whose limits the local disturbance of the King\u2019s peace occurs. The legislation of Nova Scotia, so far, has recognized this as equitable and just and has provided for the payment by the interested municipality of such expenditure. The laws of Nova Scotia concurred with the Militia Act before the latter was amended in 1924, to levy this money from the interested municipalities. Since 1924, no concurrent legislation has been passed by Nova Scotia; and under the present state of legislation, we must say that the province is only conditionally bound to pay, because the legislature of Nova Scotia has not yet agreed to do so.\nBut I am of opinion that the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, as law officer and legal adviser to the Crown, and the Government of Nova Scotia, which is continuous, should recommend and secure from the legislature of the province the necessary funds to honour the signature given by his predecessor in office to the requisition in conformity to schedule A of the Militia Act of 1924, which requisition and undertaking by the Attorney-General of the province of Nova Scotia should not by the latter be now treated as a mere scrap of paper. Under the rule of ministerial solidarity, the act of the Attorney-General in 1925 was the act and undertaking of the government of Nova Scotia; if the Premier or his colleagues disapproved of his requisition for the aid of the militia, the Attorney-General should have been called upon to resign and his act disallowed; nothing of the sort took place and the province is in honour bound to redeem his pledge and pay the expenditure made in good faith, in their local interest, by the Dominion, as representing the other partners to the Confederation Pact. Quoting again the above mentioned judgment:\nThe Government of the Province is not the Government of the Cabinet which may be in office, and when cabinets succeed one another, this fact does not entail the consecution of one Government to another. The Government of the country is the King\u2019s Government, which has always to be carried on, and which is in fact continuous. The advisers of the Crown may be changed, and with this change there may be a change of policy. The Government, after a change of advisers, may therefore be carried on in accordance with other political views; but notwithstanding this, the Government of the country and the administration of its affairs are continuous. After a new cabinet has assumed office, the administration of public affairs may be carried on on other lines, but the Executive Government is bound by the ordinary rules of law as regards contracts which may have been entered into under a previous cabinet. Of its own will it has no right to rescind without the consent of the other contracting party a valid and binding contract, and if there should be good legal cause to annul the contract, the legal mode for doing so should be adopted.\nQuestion answered in the negative.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia: Fred. F. Mathers.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Quebec: Charles Lanctot.\n[1] 7 Vesey 235.\n[2] Q.R. 7 K.B. 447.\n",

C., s. 999\u2014Admission by accused\u2019s counsel of \u201cevery fact essential to the admission of the evidence\u201d under s. 999\u2014Extent of admission\u2014Lack of proof that evidence put in was in fact the evidence given at former trial\u2014Materiality of the evidence as affecting findings against accused\u2014New trial\u2014Warning to jury where evidence tendered under s. 999 which was given on former separate trials of persons now tried together.\nThe appellants were convicted of removing, and two of them of importing, goods of over $200 in value and liable to forfeiture, contrary to s. 193 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42. At their trial the Crown proposed to put in, under s. 999 of the Cr. Code, evidence given at previous trials (at which the juries had disagreed) by one W. Counsel for the accused admitted \u201cevery fact essential to the admission of the evidence of [W.] under s. 999 of the Code,\u201d and the evidence offered was put in.\nHeld: The admission of counsel, while it rendered unnecessary the establishment of the various facts required by s. 999 to be proved before the evidence of W. could have been admitted, did not in any way identify the documents read to the jury as the evidence given by W. on the former trials; and, there being no proof that the statements put in were in fact the evidence of W., and there being no consent that they were, they were wrongly received, and appellants were entitled to a new trial. The appellant C, convicted of removing but not of importing, was so entitled, notwithstanding that the depositions put in did not in terms incriminate him; they were important on the point that the goods in question were goods liable to forfeiture under the Act; that was an essential element of the charge and of the proof, and although C. might have been connected with it only through other evidence, it was not possible to appreciate how far the depositions on the main charge concerning the character of the goods imported might have influenced the jury in its findings.\nThe said previous trials had been, one of the appellant O. alone, and the other of the other appellants and one P. On the trial in question, at which said depositions were received, they were all tried together. One alleged ground for a new trial was that W.\u2019s evidence on either previous trial was inadmissible against any accused who had not been a defendant on the previous trial at which it was given. The Court found it unnecessary to pass upon the point, but remarked that, should similar circumstances happen at the next trial, and W.\u2019s depositions properly and legally identified be tendered, it would be most advisable for the trial judge to warn the jury that each deposition should be considered as evidence only against the accused in whose former trial such deposition purported to have been taken.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, sitting as a Court of Appeal under the provisions of the Criminal Code, dismissing the appeals of the present appellants from their convictions for violation of s. 193 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42.\nThe three appellants and one Petrie were tried together before Ross J. with a jury on an indictment containing three counts, the charges being that they, at Sydney in the County of Cape Breton, on or about the 3rd September, 1929, did knowingly and unlawfully, and without lawful excuse, assist, or were otherwise concerned in, (1) unshipping goods, (2) the importing of goods, (3) landing or removing goods; to wit (in each case): spirituous liquors over the value of $200 which said goods were liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, contrary to the provisions of s. 193, c. 42, R.S.C., 1927, and amendments thereto.\nThe jury found the appellants McDonald and O\u2019Hearn guilty on the second count (importing) and all three appellants guilty on the third count (removing). They found Petrie not guilty. The appellants were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, Conter for two years under the third count, and McDonald and O\u2019Hearn for two years under each of the second and third counts, such sentences to run concurrently. Petrie was acquitted.\nIt appeared that at a previous sittings of the court, O\u2019Hearn had been tried alone, and McDonald, Conter and Petrie had been tried together, and there were disagreements by both juries; that at each of those trials one Captain Wheeler had given evidence; and that he was now absent from Canada. At the present trial it was proposed by the prosecution to put in the evidence given by Captain Wheeler at the previous trials, under s. 999 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\nIf upon the trial of an accused person such facts are proved upon oath or affirmation that it can be reasonably inferred therefrom that any person, whose evidence was given at any former trial upon the same charge, or whose deposition has been theretofore taken in the investigation of the charge against such accused person, is dead, or so ill as not to be able to travel, or is absent from Canada, or if such person refuses to be sworn or to give evidence, and if it is proved that such evidence was given or such deposition was taken in the presence of the person accused, and that he or his counsel or solicitor if present had a full opportunity of cross-examining the witness, then if the evidence or deposition purports to be signed by the judge or justice before whom the same purports to have been taken, it shall be read as evidence in the prosecution, without further proof thereof, unless it is proved that such evidence or deposition was not in fact signed by the judge or justice purporting to have signed the same.\nCounsel for the accused made an admission in the following form\n[Names of counsel] admit every fact essential to the admission of the evidence of Captain Wheeler under section 999 of the Code.\nand the evidence offered was put in.\nAppeals taken from the convictions were dismissed by the Court of Appeal, Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting, and, pursuant to order of the Court, pronouncing separate judgments.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by Harris C.J. He held that the admission of counsel, on its face and as understood at the trial, meant that the evidence of Wheeler was to be admitted against all the defendants; that the authorities show that the consent of the accused or his counsel is binding in such cases; and the evidence of Wheeler given on the two previous trials was properly received and binding on all the defendants. He further stated:\nWe think it is proper to point out that the suggestion that the admission of the evidence was only intended to be for the purpose of making it available as against the particular defendant or defendants who had been on trial on the previous occasion is not in our opinion the meaning of the admission which contains no such limitation.\nIf that view had been maintainable it would have involved a consideration of various questions and among others as to what if any difference there was between the evidence of Captain Wheeler in the two cases and whether or not these differences affected all or any of the issues. It was strongly argued that these differences were immaterial and it was pointed out that even if they were material, none of Wheeler\u2019s evidence affected the question of the guilt, if any, of the accused under the third count of the indictment. The guilt of all the accused under that count was clearly established by other evidence and was in no way affected by the admission of Wheeler\u2019s evidence. This seems to be so, and as the same punishment was awarded upon each of the convictions to run concurrently it seems to follow that no injustice would have been done any of the prisoners even if we had reached a different conclusion as to the effect of the admission of Captain Wheeler\u2019s evidence. Another objection raised was that none of the evidence taken on the two previous trials purported to be signed by the Judge, but that objection is obviously covered by the admission of counsel.\nThe grounds of dissent of Mellish J. were \u201cthat the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter and Petrie was inadmissible in this trial as evidence against O\u2019Hearn,\u201d and \u201cthat the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of O\u2019Hearn was inadmissible in this trial as against Conter, McDonald and Petrie;\u201d that s. 999 of the Criminal Code is clearly intended to deal with evidence given on the former trial of the same defendant and the admission of counsel aforesaid was therefore \u201cwholly insufficient to allow of the reception of evidence taken on the previous trial of one party as against a different party on a later trial;\u201d further, that \u201cthere is no proof that the statements put in were in fact the evidence of Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.\u201d Carroll J. concurred with the reasons of Mellish J., and added some further reasons, including the ground (in connection with s. 999) that the evidence was not signed by the judge \u201cbefore whom the same purports to have been taken;\u201d that this fact of non-signature, apart from all other considerations, made all this evidence non-admissible.\nBy the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, now reported, the appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered as regards the three appellants.\nJ. W. Maddin K.C. and M. A. Patterson for the appellants.\nD. A. Cameron K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Court.\u2014In our opinion one ground upon which the appellants are entitled to a new trial is that taken by Mellish J., in his dissenting judgment, namely, that there is no proof that \u201cthe statements put in were in fact the evidence of Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.\u201d The admission of counsel for the appellants rendered unnecessary the establishment, by the prosecution, of the various facts required by section 999 of the Code to be proved before the evidence of Captain Wheeler could have been admitted, but that admission did not, in any way, identify the document which was read to the jury, as the evidence given by him on the former trial. It is true that the deposition of Captain Wheeler, as admitted, does not, in terms, incriminate the appellant Conter. The deposition is, however, very important on the point that the goods which the appellants were charged with having assisted or having been otherwise concerned in importing, unshipping, landing or removing were goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act; that was an essential element of the charge and of the proof, and although Conter may have been connected with it only through other evidence, it is not possible to appreciate how far the depositions of Captain Wheeler on the main charge concerning the character of the goods imported may have influenced the jury in its findings.\nOur view on the above point makes it unnecessary to pass upon the other ground of dissent, to wit: \u201cthat the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter and Petrie was inadmissible in this trial as evidence against O\u2019Hearn\u201d and \u201cthat the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of O\u2019Hearn was inadmissible in this trial as against Conter, McDonald and Petrie.\u201d We wish only to add that, should similar circumstances happen at the next trial and Wheeler\u2019s deposition properly and legally identified be tendered, it would be most advisable for the trial judge to warn the jury that each deposition should be considered as evidence only against the accused in whose former trial such deposition purported to have been taken.\nThe appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered as regards the three appellants.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant O\u2019Hearn: J. W. Maddin.\nSolicitor for the appellants McDonald and Conter: M. A. Patterson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: N. R. MacArthur (Crown Prosecutor) and D. A. Cameron (Solicitor for the Department of Inland Revenue of Canada).\n",

Co. v. The King, [1930] S.C.R. 574\nDate: 1930-06-11\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King, on The Information of The Attorney-General of Canada (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1930: February 28; 1930: March 3, 4; 1930: June 11.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Railways\u2014Telegraph lines planted by company on roadway of Government railway\u2014Alleged permission to plant and maintain them\u2014Evidence\u2014Licence\u2014Revocability\u2014Absence of formal contract\u2014Department of Railways and Canals Act, R.S.C, 1927, c. 171, ss. 7, 15.\nThe Crown took proceedings in the Exchequer Court against defendant, alleging that it had wrongfully planted and maintained its telegraph lines upon the roadway (belonging to the Crown) of the Intercolonial Railway. Audette J., [1930] Ex. C.R., 26, held that defendant was on the roadway by licence, but not an irrevocable licence, of the Crown. Defendant appealed, asserting an irrevocable licence, and the Crown cross-appealed, denying the existence of any licence. For purposes of its judgment, this Court considered the telegraph lines as in three sections, (1) the \u201cMain Line\u201d (between St. John and Halifax, with a branch from Truro to New Glasgow; built in 1888-1890), (2) the \u201cBranch Line\u201d (from New Glasgow to Sydney, built in 1893), and (3) the \u201cWestville Line\u201d (from Westville to Pictou, built in 1911).\nHeld (1) As to the \u201cmain line,\u201d on the evidence, the defence of leave and licence failed, and there was nothing to give rise to any equity in defendant\u2019s favour.\n(2) As to the \u201cbranch line,\u201d on the evidence, there was no agreement (giving leave to defendant to use the roadway) proved; or, even if otherwise, the agreement, such as it may have been, had ceased to operate in any particular, unless to negative defendant\u2019s liability to remove its poles and wires; and defendant was, when the present action began, in no better position than that of licensee whose leave was terminated or exhausted.\n(3) As to the \u201cWestville line,\u201d from the evidence it appeared that defendant built it on the roadway by consent, the parties having mutually in view the negotiation of a contract, with adequate sanctions, to regulate their rights and obligations; and, with nothing more definite, defendant had ever since maintained and used the line without notice or warning of intention by the Government to withdraw the licence. The licence was revocable, but the right to revoke should be exercised reasonably; in the circumstances, an abrupt determination, without demand or notice, was unjustifiable. Therefore, as to this line, there was no cause of action when the proceedings were commenced, and the action must fail. The King v. Inhabitants of Horndon-on-the Hill, 4 M. & S., 562, at p. 565; Cornish v. Stubbs, L.R. 5 C.P., 334, at pp. 337-340; Coleman v. Foster, 1 H. & N., 37, at pp. 39, 40; Kerrison v. Smith, [1897] 2 Q.B., 445, and other cases, cited. (Anglin, C.J.C., dissenting on this point, held that failure to give notice of revocation was not necessarily fatal to the action; on the contrary, inasmuch as defendant asserted that its licence as to this line was irrevocable and contested the Crown\u2019s claim to exclude it on the merits, the bringing of the action itself should be regarded as sufficient notice, subject only to the question of costs and allowance of a reasonable time to defendant to remove its poles and wires. Cornish v. Stubbs supra, Coleman v. Foster supra, and other cases referred to).\n(4) As to all the lines generally, apart from other considerations, the contracts alleged by defendant were ineffective for non-compliance with statutory requirements (Department of Railways and Canals Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 171, ss. 7, 15, referred to; The Queen v. Henderson, 28 Can. S.C.R., 425, discussed and distinguished). The telegraph rights claimed by defendant in perpetuity with respect to the railway lands in question could not be acquired for defendant\u2019s accommodation by the mere laches, acquiescence or tolerance of the executive officers and employees, charged under the Minister with the administration or working of the railway. It was contemplated that whatever concessions might be authorized should be contracted for by the Crown, represented by the Minister, and defendant knew, or is presumed to have known, the statutory requirements. Moreover, as to defendant\u2019s claim that it had acquired in perpetuity, and in the manner contended for, the right to use the Government railways for its telegraph lines, effect must be given to the principles expressed in Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald, 8 App. Cas., 623 (see at pp. 634, 639). When planting its poles on the Government railway, defendant must have realized the facts of the case and the risks to be encountered, and the desirability of securing permanent concessions, if possible, or if they could or would be granted by the executive authorities; and there was no foundation upon which to apply the doctrine of estoppel. In so far as any contract competent to the parties could answer the purpose, the defendant neglected entirely the most elementary requirements as to the ascertainment of the terms, and the statutory essentials of form and sanction. (Reference also to Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, 13th ed., p. 1086, and to Blanchard v. Bridges, 4 Ad. & El. 176, at pp. 194195).\nJudgment of Audette J. (supra) reversed in part in favour of the Crown.\nAPPEAL by the defendant (the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.) and cross-appeal by the plaintiff (the Crown) from the judgment of Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1].\nThe Attorney-General of Canada, on behalf of His Majesty the King, took action by information of intrusion in the Exchequer Court, alleging that defendant wrongfully entered and intruded in or upon the plaintiff\u2019s possession of certain lands situate in the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and comprising the right of way, yards and station grounds of the Intercolonial Railway at and between certain points, and constructed and operated thereon a telegraph line; and (including amendments at the trial) claiming (1) possession, (2) a sum for the issues and profits of the lands, or, in the alternative, a sum for damages for trespass, and (3) \u201cin the alternative a declaration as to the rights, if any, of the defendant in said lands in respect of the said line of poles and wires.\u201d\nAudette J.[2] concluded his judgment as follows:\nThe trial was proceeded with only upon the question of law, or, at any rate, leaving the question of damages to be dealt with after the rights of the parties had been determined, and hope was then expressed by counsel that once the rights were determined the terms and conditions could be agreed upon by the parties.\nIn the result, the prime and controlling issue to be determined by these proceedings is what right, if any, has the defendant on the right of way? Answering the same I find that the defendants are and have been on the right of way from the beginning by the licence of the plaintiff\u2014but not an irrevocable licence, which would be tantamount to an alienation of the property of the Crown.\nI do not think that I should be called upon in my judgment to determine more than that; but if I can assist the parties to a full and complete settlement of their difficulties I shall be glad to have them, or either of them, apply, upon notice, for further directions.\nThere will be judgment accordingly. The question of costs is reserved.\nThe defendant appealed upon the grounds, that the trial judge was in error in holding that the licence was not irrevocable; and that on the facts as disclosed in the evidence and as found by the trial judge the action should have been dismissed with costs. The plaintiff cross-appealed, contending that the defendant had not been on the right of way under a licence, but was a trespasser, or, in the alternative, that the licence, if any, had been revoked.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Newcombe J., now reported. As to the \u201cMain Line\u201d and the \u201cBranch Line,\u201d the defendant\u2019s appeal was dismissed with costs, and the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal allowed with costs. As to the \u201cWestville Line,\u201d the defendant\u2019s appeal was allowed with costs, the Court holding that, in the circumstances, the action must fail in this particular, but holding also that the licence with respect to the line was revocable; Anglin, C.J.C., dissenting as to the dismissal of the action with respect to this line. W. N. Tilley K.C., W. L. Scott K.C. and E. P. Flintoft K.C. for the appellant.\nW. P. Jones K.C. and I. C. Rand K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Attorney-General proceeded by information of intrusion, filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada, on 15th September, 1926, claiming to recover possession of lands acquired for railway purposes of the Crown in the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; the intrusion alleged consisting in the wrongful planting and maintenance upon the roadway of the Intercolonial Railway by the defendant of its lines of telegraph from Saint John to Moncton (90 miles); from Moncton to Halifax by way of Truro (190 miles); from Truro to New Glasgow (43 miles); from New Glasgow to Sydney (163 miles); and from Westville, near New Glasgow, to Pictou (10 miles); in all a mileage of 496 or thereabouts.\nThe Attorney-General by his pleading, as amended by leave at the trial, claimed possession, issues and profits, and, in the alternative, a declaration as to the defendant\u2019s rights, if any. The defendant pleaded a comprehensive denial, and estoppel by laches and acquiescence, also leave and licence; and the latter constitutes the chief defence upon which the defendant relied at the hearing. There was considerable oral testimony and many exhibits, extending to nearly five hundred printed pages in the case. There is no dispute as to the Crown\u2019s title to the lands claimed, nor as to the defendant\u2019s occupation of these lands for the purposes of its telegraph lines.\nThe case was tried in January, 1929, by Audette J., and his findings and conclusion are expressed thus[3]:\nThe trial was proceeded with only upon the question of law, or, at any rate, leaving the question of damages to be dealt with after the rights of the parties had been determined, and hope was then expressed by counsel that once the rights were determined the terms and conditions could be agreed upon by the parties.\nIn the result, the prime and controlling issue to be determined by these proceedings is what right, if any, has the defendant on the right of way? Answering the same I find that the defendants are and have been on the right of way from the beginning by the licence of the plaintiff\u2014but not an irrevocable licence, which would be tantamount to an alienation of the property of the Crown.\nI do not think that I should be called upon in my judgment to determine more than that; but if I can assist the parties to a full and complete settlement of their difficulties I shall be glad to have them, or either of them, apply, upon notice, for further directions.\nThere will be judgment accordingly. The question of costs is reserved.\nThe defendant appealed upon the grounds:\n1. That the learned trial judge was in error in holding that the licence referred to was not irrevocable.\n2. That on the facts as disclosed in the evidence and as found by the learned trial judge the action should have been dismissed with costs.\nThe Attorney-General cross-appealed against the finding which maintained an existing revocable licence, and he submitted that the defendant was a trespasser, or, in the alternative, that its licence, if any, had been revoked.\nThe telegraph lines in question naturally divide themselves into three sections or parcels, and they must necessarily be considered separately; namely, the lines between St. John and Halifax, with a branch from Truro to New Glasgow, which were constructed in 1888, 1889 and 1890, and which, for convenience, will be hereinafter described as the \u201cMain Telegraph Line\u201d; the line from New Glasgow to Sydney, known in the case as the \u201cBranch Telegraph Line,\u201d constructed in 1893, and the short line running from Westville to Pictou, built in 1911, which I shall call the \u201cWestville Telegraph Line.\u201d\nThe facts with regard to these present differences which should be realized, and, in the view which I take, the learned trial judge must have arrived at different results, if he had properly appreciated and applied the evidence in relation to each of these lines, respectively.\nThere are, as I have said, three separate cases, depending upon different considerations of fact, and I shall consider them separately in the order which I have mentioned.\nthe main telegraph line\nThe correspondence shows that, when, in 1887 or 1888, the defendant was contemplating to undertake the construction of its telegraph system east of St. John, it applied to the Government for permission to construct an extension of its telegraph line along the Intercolonial Railway from St. John to Halifax via Moncton. Upon considering this request, it was found that the granting of it would create conflict with exclusive rights already conceded by the Government to the Montreal Telegraph Company, a corporation which, along with the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company, was controlled by the Western Union Telegraph Company, then the principal operator of telegraphs in the maritime provinces. The application was refused, and the defendant, in consequence, built its line outside of the plaintiff\u2019s railway; having, as it claims, secured a right of way from the proprietors abutting upon the railway; but this location was, for obvious reasons, less advantageous and more expensive for construction and maintenance than that which would have been afforded by use of the Government roadway itself, and, in places where outside construction was difficult, the defendant, notwithstanding the absence of any permission, took the liberty of planting its poles on the roadway acquired and used by the Government, and even within the railway fences. These acts of trespass were discovered and led to complaints. Mr. Schreiber, the Chief Engineer of Government Railways, had written to Mr. Hosmer, the defendant\u2019s Superintendent of Telegraphs at Montreal, on 21st June, 1889, stating that in construction of the defendant\u2019s line of telegraph between Saint John, Halifax and New Glasgow, via Truro, \u201coutside and near to the Intercolonial Railway fence,\u201d the Government would grant all reasonable facilities, as regards the distributing of poles and other materials, the movement of the defendant\u2019s boarding and supply cars, and the running of hand-cars; and Mr. Richardson, who was in charge of the construction for the defendant, had written to Mr. Hosmer, on 13th August, 1889:\nAs there is no injunction could we not put our poles on the railway side of the fence on the quiet through some of these backwoods places, without any serious consequences? In many places they would not be noticed.\nA subsequent example of the zeal displayed on behalf of the defendant in the establishment of its telegraph lines upon the railway reserve is to be found in the correspondence of 1892, when, on 4th July, Mr. Kent, the defendant\u2019s Superintendent of Telegraphs, wrote to Mr. Hosmer, requesting him to get permission from the Government to put up about one mile of poles on the Intercolonial Railway\u2019s right of way between Stellarton and New Glasgow. Our present route is along the highway and liable to frequent interruptions.\nAnd Mr. Pottinger wrote Mr. Snider on 11th August, refusing this permission. But these poles had already been installed upon the railway; and, on 16th August Mr. Snider wrote Mr. Kent, saying:\nThe line is there all the same, and we have a good job but I would not like to swear whose property we are on.\nSimilarly, on 22nd September, 1892, Mr. Snider telegraphed to Mr. Kent:\n* * * We have moved about 200 poles this summer in different places to straighten out line and I have ordered the men to keep on with the work unless they are stopped. If they leave us alone long enough we will have a moderately good line east soon.\nMr. Hosmer had written to Mr. Bradley, the Secretary of the Department of Railways, on 18th September, 1889:\nYou are I presume aware that owing to the exclusive contracts on the Intercolonial Railway our Company has been delayed in the construction of its lines, and we are now obliged to build them outside of the Railway right of way.\nNevertheless, by 14th October, 1889, some of the defendant\u2019s poles had been set upon the roadway, and, on that date, Mr. Hosmer wrote to Mr. Richardson:\nI might say privately that I have brought the matter to Mr. Van Horne\u2019s attention and have asked him to use his influence at Ottawa to try and get the Government not to disturb any poles that are now erected.\nOn 7th January, 1890, Mr. Bradley wrote to Mr. Drink-water, the defendant company\u2019s secretary:\nBy direction I have to call your attention to the fact that at certain points along the Intercolonial Railway between St. John and Halifax telegraph posts have been erected by your Company on the Government property.\nIn view of the terms of the agreement at present existing between the Government and the Montreal Telegraph Company the concession of such a privilege as this would imply, were the posts in question allowed to remain, cannot be granted to your Company and I am accordingly to request that they be at once removed.\nThere was further correspondence; Mr. Hosmer called for a report from Mr. Richardson and was informed, by letter of 1st March, 1890:\nThe number of poles we have erected upon I.C.R. property east of St. John is, to the best of my knowledge, as follows: Outside\nfence but\nInside in Ry.\nfence Limits Total\nBetween St. John & Moncton . . . . . . 12 214 226\nBetween Moncton & Truro . . . . . . . . 6 4 10\nBetween Truro & Halifax . . . . . . . . . . 29 \u2026 29\nBetween Truro & New Glasgow . . . . . 7 \u2026 7\n54 218 272\nTime passed, but nothing was done, although the Department was insisting upon the removal of these poles; proceedings were threatened to enforce their removal, and Mr. Hosmer, on 5th September, 1890, wrote Mr. Dwight, the General Manager of the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company at Toronto, explaining the situation, and saying:\nWe have inside the fence along the Intercolonial Railroad between St. John and Halifax and New Glasgow, a few poles which it was absolutely necessary to put there, and the Government are urging us to remove them, threatening us with legal action, etc.\u2014I understand that the proceedings they are taking are being instigated by your Company, and I thought it but right to call your personal attention to the matter. The few poles we have on the Railroad cannot possibly be of any damage to your Company or the Western Union, and if we are forced to move them we must consider that it is done simply to annoy us. You know that your Company have several hundred miles of poles on Railroads owned by this Company (with which you have absolutely no contract rights) and that we have never sought to annoy you or obstruct you in their maintenance in any way. In fact, we have gone out of our way to instruct our men to render your repairers every possible assistance. I think, under those circumstances, you can well afford to treat us in a similarly liberal manner. I write you personally rather than officially, as I can understand that there may be reasons why you would not want a precedent established in a matter of this kind.\nFive days later the Attorney-General filed an Information in the Exchequer Court for the removal of the defendant\u2019s poles, which had thus found their way to \u201cthe roadbed and right of way of the Intercolonial Railway.\u201d Mr. Dwight replied to Mr. Hosmer, on 16th September, that his company had made no complaint whatever\nand you may consider yourself welcome, so far as we are concerned, to any such accommodation of the kind as you may need anywhere along the route. I think we have both reached a period in our experience when we may consider it scarcely worth while to take any action simply for the purpose of annoying each other. If there is anything you wish me to do respecting the matter to prevent any further annoyance please let me know. I will write to Superintendent Clinch, St. John, in regard to the matter, and see what he knows about it.\nThen Mr. Van Home, the President of the defendant company, sent a copy of the correspondence to Sir John A. Macdonald, the Prime Minister, and, on 24th September, Sir John sent a note to the Minister of Justice, saying:\nPlease stay proceedings\u2014It won\u2019t do to have any further difference with the C.P.R. just now. This is an unimportant matter.\nThe Minister of Justice called for a precis of the case from his Department, and returned it with the following endorsement:\nTelegraph Suit vs. C.P.R. Let it go on.\nFinally, on 9th October Sir John A. Macdonald replied to Mr. Van Home:\nI have yours of the 22nd ult. and return you the papers therein enclosed, as you desire. The Government have not the slightest objection, so far as they are concerned, to the C.P.R. planting telegraph poles along the line of the I.C.R. The trouble is that long ago, by an absurd agreement, the Montreal Telegraph Company was given the exclusive right to plant poles and wires along the line of the I.C.R. Such being the case, the Government Officials gave notice to your people not to plant poles but the warning was utterly disregarded. The proceedings were taken lest the Government might be held responsible by the Montreal Telegraph Co. for breach of agreement and consequent damage. Dwight\u2019s letter to Hosmer is satisfactory enough, but it is not, I take it, binding on the Company, especially if under the control of Wiman. However, if the C.P.R. will stand between the Government and all harm in the event of proceedings being taken, we will not interfere with your telegraph poles.\nI have referred, more fully perhaps than is necessary, to the facts leading up to the Prime Minister\u2019s letter, because that letter is now put forward by the defendant most prominently as its justification for the removal, several years later, of substantially the whole of its main telegraph line from its original place to the roadway of the Intercolonial Railway, within the fences, the location now in controversy; and thus the conditional promise, given by the Prime Minister in 1890, not to interfere with what is described in Mr. Hosmer\u2019s application as \u201ca few poles which it was absolutely necessary to put there,\u201d is invoked, even though the condition was never expressly fulfilled, to justify the transplanting of the whole of the main line, for a distance of more than three hundred miles. I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion, and I think it is obvious, that this contention utterly fails. Then it is said upon evidence of a witness, named Mersereau, who, in 1904, was working for the defendant on its telegraph line between Saint John and Moncton, making repairs under the direction of Mr. Snider, the defendant\u2019s Superintendent of Telegraphs at Saint John, that he, Mersereau, found it convenient to move some of the poles, which were under repair, across the fence to the railway, and that he had been stopped by one of the Government\u2019s section foremen. He says he went to Moncton and spoke to Mr. Pottinger, who was then the General Manager of the Intercolonial Railway. This is the conversation, as stated by Mr. Mersereau:\nQ. Well what did you state to him?\u2014A. I told him we were stopped moving the poles over on the I.C.R. that Mr. Snider had informed me I could do, by a section foreman; and he listened until I was done, and he told me I could go back to my work, he would see that the man was informed to let the C.P.R. alone.\nQ. That is practically the whole conversation?\u2014A. The whole conversation.\nMr. Pottinger\u2019s testimony concerning this incident is as follows:\nQ. Do you recollect at any time any requests being made to you with reference to putting poles on the right of way of the Government Railway?\u2014A. There was once a request of that kind made to me.\nQ. By whom, do you remember?\u2014A. By Mr. Snider, who was Superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.\nQ. At Saint John?\u2014A. His headquarters were Saint John, yes.\nQ. You remember about what year that was in?\u2014A. I am afraid I do not.\nQ. Was it verbal or in writing?-A. It was verbal.\nQ. What was it?\u2014A. Well, he came to me one day and he said, I am rebuilding our line, and part of it runs through bush, and the trees have given me a great deal of trouble, and I would like to move a few of the poles which are outside of the railway fence inside the fence to get past this clump of trees. And I gave him my verbal permission.\nQ. Do you recollect anywhere near about the time that was?\u2014A. I am afraid I could not say what time it was.\nHis Lordship: Do you remember about what space that would cover, or how many poles?\u2014A. No, but it was a definite request for a small concession as I understood, I imagine it would be about five, but not exceeding ten miles.\nMr. Jones: Do you recollect what section of the railway it referred to?\u2014A. I do not know whether he mentioned any section or not, but I was under the impression that it was between Moncton and Saint John. I had seen their line there in a tree-covered area just outside of the railway fence, and I supposed it was that.\nQ. Do you know whether or not he did put some poles in on the right of way?\u2014A. I never thought about the matter again, and I never inquired whether he moved the poles or not. Q. Was that the only request made to you in reference to the matter of putting poles on?\u2014A. That is the only one I remember, I do not think there was any other ever made.\n* * * * *\nQ. Did you ever at any time give permission to any one connected with the Canadian Pacific to place their line as a line upon the right of way?\u2014A. I did not. I never was asked by any one for that permission.\nQ. Or to rebuild their line upon the right of way?\u2014A. No, excepting in that instance of Mr. Snider.\nQ. Do you remember at any time when a Mr. Mersereau, David W. Mersereau, was working for the Canadian Pacific?\u2014A. The name is familiar, but I cannot recall meeting him in any way.\nQ. You do not recall having any conversation at all with him?\u2014A. I do not remember any.\nQ. Do you recollect any person asking you to see that certain section men on the railway did not interfere with the building of a telegraph line by the Canadian Pacific?\u2014A. I have no recollection of that.\nQ. I think you have already said you were not approached by Mr. Snider in connection with transferring their whole line to the right of way.\u2014A. I was not.\nAlso a letter from J. McMillan, who had become the defendant\u2019s Manager of Telegraphs at Montreal, dated 28th December, 1916, to A. C. Fraser, the defendant\u2019s Superintendent of Telegraphs at Saint John, and Mr. Fraser\u2019s reply of 1st January, 1917, have been admitted into the record. Mr. Pottinger had retired from the railway service in 1913, and it was at the end of 1916, when he was living at his summer home at Cape Tormentine, that Mr. Fraser went to see him, at Mr. McMillan\u2019s request, and at the trial, Mr. Fraser, refreshing his memory by his letter, says:\nI have seen Mr. Pottinger in connection with permission granted for any rebuilding to be made on the railroad property. He was approached by the late Mr. Snider in connection with the transferring of line to the right of way. Mr. Pottinger saw no objectionable features and permission was granted verbally. He was in Ottawa a few days later and advised the Minister of Railways and Canals that he had granted the Canadian Pacific Telegraph the right to do their rebuilding on the Intercolonial right of way. The Minister stated that it was quite right and that he could see no reason why the permission should not be granted.\nWith reference to the line between New Glasgow and Sydney, Mr. Pottinger is not quite clear as to why this line was permitted on the right of way. His recollection is that there was some kind of an agreement whereby the telegraph company, if called upon, were to perform a certain service gratis. He has a clear recollection, however, that the telegraph people had the necessary permission and that there was a quid pro quo, the nature of which he is unable to recollect.\nMr. Pottinger has no recollection of the Mersereau incident, but states that had the sectionmen interfered with the telegraph gang he would certainly have taken action, as the work was being prosecuted with his own and the Minister\u2019s consent. Mr. Pottinger is emphatic in his denial. Mr. Fraser\u2019s letter is shown to Mr. Pottinger and he testifies:\nA. Mr. Fraser evidently is mistaken in what he says here about my statement. It is a misunderstanding of some kind, because he states it in general terms here. The permission I gave was a specific one for a very small affair, to help out Mr. Snider in his difficulties in operating his line, and there was no general movement spoken of at all at any time.\nHe goes on to say that I was in Ottawa a few days later and advised the Minister of Railways. Well I never reported to the Minister, I reported to Mr. Schreiber. I mean any general business. He was the one I made all reports to. I made no report of this concession given to Mr. Snider, I did not think it was worth while mentioning, and I dismissed it from my mind after the interview was over with Mr. Snider. As for speaking to the Minister about it, I never had the slightest communication with any Minister in regard to it at all. He is mistaken in regard to that.\nQ. I think you have said that you never even reported it to Mr. Schreiber?\u2014A. I never reported it to Mr. Schreiber, but I may have said to Mr. Fraser that it was possible that I may have spoken to Mr. Schreiber about it when I saw him.\nQ. But you never made any report whatever about anything to the Minister, you say?\u2014A. Never. I never saw the Minister about anything unless he sent for me and wanted to speak to me.\nQ. You will notice that Mr. Fraser says you told him that you advised the Minister of Railways and Canals that you had granted the Canadian Pacific Telegraph the right to do their rebuilding on the Intercolonial right of way.\u2014A. Well he is entirely mistaken in regard to that.\nQ. Then he goes on to say that you said that the Minister stated it was quite right, and that he could see no reason why the permission should not be granted.\u2014A. Well he is certainly mistaken in what I said.\nMr. Pottinger was a most trustworthy, careful and capable officer and a successful administrator, as shown by his lifelong employment and promotion to the top in the service of the Government railways; and the suggestion that he, advised as he was, and well knowing that the Montreal Telegraph Company had exclusive privileges upon the main line, would permit, still less authorize, the use of the Intercolonial Railway, as the base of a competing line, thereby also reversing the policy to which the Government had deliberately committed itself and which he was directed to enforce, is too improbable for me to entertain. I have no hesitation to accept Mr. Pottinger\u2019s testimony as he gave it, and I do not see anything to the contrary in the findings of the learned trial judge.\nOne easily perceives, upon reading the evidence, that the defendant coveted the right to place its telegraph fixtures upon the lands which the Government had acquired, appropriated and fenced for the Intercolonial Railway, because it was convenient and easy of inspection and access; also that, whether or not, in the absence of the Montreal Telegraph Company\u2019s agreement, the Government might have been willing to concede the liberty sought, upon terms to be stipulated, certain it is that the Government consistently throughout refused any concession, for the ostensible reason that it was precluded by the agreement, although in view of the considerations to which the Prime Minister alluded, it was not unwilling to tolerate occasional transgressions, upon terms of indemnity, where, by reason of the difficulties of the ground, it might otherwise, in what the Prime Minister not unnaturally characterized as an \u201cunimportant matter,\u201d have been subject to an imputation of unneighbourly conduct. Some ingenuity was manifested for the purpose of showing that there were local, or even national, advantages to be served which might have influenced the Government to adopt a more generous attitude, but for the reality of any such motive, there is not the least evidence.\nIn the years 1905, 1906 and 1907, it had become necessary to rebuild, and the defendant moved 59 miles of its telegraph line, between Truro and Halifax, from the outside to the inside of the railway fences. There was no communication with the Government respecting this rebuilding. Mr. Pottinger says it was done without his knowledge. In 1910, the defendant, in rebuilding portions of its line between Moncton and Truro, transferred its line to the Government roadway for a distance of 23 miles; in 1911, it similarly rebuilt 59 miles, and in 1912, 43 miles. This is shown by the defendant\u2019s exhibit No. 3, at page 482 of the case. No permission for any of these encroachments is disclosed, and it was apparently not until 1915, when Mr. Gutelius was General Manager of Government Railways, that it was discovered that the defendant had substantially rebuilt its main line upon the Government roadway.\nAfter 5th May, 1913, when Mr. Gutelius became General Manager, in substitution for the Managing Board, of which Mr. Pottinger had been a principal member, discussion arose as to the terms of transport upon the Intercolonial Railway of the defendant\u2019s boarding cars, men and material, and it was then that Mr. Gutelius appears to have ascertained the fact, which had not previously been realized on the part of the Government management, that the defendant had transferred its line of telegraph generally to the Government roadway. This was one of the matters which Mr. Gutelius considered with Mr. McMillan, the manager of the defendant\u2019s telegraphs at Montreal, on or before 6th March, 1916, when Mr. McMillan passed to Mr. Gutelius a memorandum signed by the former, in which he said:\nAfter careful checking I find that the Canadian Pacific have along the line of the Canadian Government Railway in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, pole line on the Government Railway for a distance of 499 (437) miles, leaving a gap of 46 miles where the line is built outside of the right of way, close to the fence, where when having all this rebuilt, we would like to transfer to the side of the right of way. From what I understand from the members of the staff now in Montreal, there was some agreement or understanding between the former Manager of Telegraph and some of your officials that this line would be permitted along your right of way, rent free. Regarding this, I would be glad if you would let me have further information, as it is hardly likely that the line would have been permitted to be placed on your right of way without some mutual understanding.\nAfter enquiry Mr. Gutelius wrote to Mr. McMillan, on 31st October, 1916:\nI find upon investigation that the Canadian Pacific Railway Telegraphs are trespassers with their poles on the right of way of the Canadian Government Railways to the extent of 452 miles.\nAnd he sent a copy of his letter to the Minister of Railways, who answered:\nI have yours of November 14th enclosing copy of your letter to the Manager of C.P.R. Telegraphs in reference to their poles, wires, etc., on our right of way and the joint use of the station for telegraph purposes at St. John.\nI trust you will not permit this matter to drop, and, if they do not give you an answer within a reasonable time, I wish you to follow it further and keep me advised.\nSome interesting correspondence followed, but it is unnecessary to quote it here; it was in this connection that Mr. Fraser made the enquiry of Mr. Pottinger, to which I have already alluded. There were negotiations for settlement, and Mr. McMillan submitted to Mr. Gutelius a draft proposal, and, finally, a formal agreement was prepared under date of 29th May, 1917, between the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, of the one part, and the Canadian Pacific Railway, of the other part. This draft was initialed by Mr. Gutelius and by Mr. Beatty, the defendant\u2019s General Counsel, and executed on behalf of the defendant company. Mr. Gutelius resigned his office a day or two afterwards, on 1st June, 1917, and, by Order in Council of 5th idem, his resignation was accepted and Mr. Hayes, the General Traffic Manager of the Intercolonial Railway, was promoted to the office which Mr. Gutelius had quitted. The Minister was not satisfied with the initialed agreement, which had evidently been sent forward for his consideration, and he wrote Mr. Hayes upon the subject, to which Mr. Hayes on 11th June sent the following significant reply:\nYours 6th June.\nIt will be necessary for me to have a little time to enquire into this matter.\nMy general understanding of the situation is that the Telegraph Co. had been enjoying for a long period all of the privileges granted them by the proposed agreement but without there being any agreement in existence outlining the privileges granted or defining the obligations of either party and Mr. Gutelius had simply endeavoured to get a written undertaking to more clearly define the status of both parties.\nYou ask \u201cWhy should they have these privileges for nothing.\u201d I will consider that suggestion although it is my impression the poles of the Telegraph Co. are quite generally placed just outside our right of way line although there are some spots where they encroach on the railway property.\nOn 17th July, 1917, Mr. Hayes informed Mr. McMillan personally at Montreal, that the Minister had declined to approve the agreement. The correspondence was prolonged. On 3rd August, 1917, Mr. Hayes wrote Mr. McMillan:\nAs the draft agreement that has been prepared does not seem to provide for these railways a sufficient consideration for the privileges you enjoy we shall be obliged to review and submit a revised proposition for your consideration.\nAnd, on 29th September, he wrote again, enclosing a revised draft; but this, although considered, was not accepted, and, on 20th March, 1924, the Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice notified the president of the defendant company that\nthe wires and poles must be removed from off the Government Railways\u2019 lands.\nThis intimation was repeated by Mr. Edwards\u2019 letter to Mr. Flintoft of 29th January, 1926, although the action was not instituted until 15th September of that year.\nAs to the main line, therefore, the defence of leave and licence fails, and I see nothing to give rise to any equity in favour of the defendant. There was no mistake of title, no misleading conduct on the part of the Government, nothing in the way of invitation or encouragement, nor even of acquiescence or tolerance, except, in the time of Mr. Gutelius, during the period of negotiations for settlement.\nIf there be evidence of any of these things, I have failed to appreciate it. The defendant\u2019s occupation began in trespass, and I see no reason to doubt that it so continued and remains.\nthe branch telegraph line\nWhen the defendant began to construct its line from New Glasgow to Sydney, it applied for leave to use the Government roadway. On 9th March, 1893, Mr. Hosmer wrote to Mr. Schreiber, the Deputy Minister of Railways:\nThe Canadian Pacific contemplate the construction of a telegraph line between New Glasgow, N.S., and Sydney, C.B., and desire to know if the Government are free to allow the line to be built along the Intercolonial Railway right of way between these two points. I understand that when the contract for the existing lines was entered into between the Government and the Western Union Telegraph Company the Government reserved the right of allowing another line to be built having in view the fact that our system would be extended between these points.\nAnd on the following day, Mr. Schreiber replied:\nI have yours of the 9th inst. in which you state that the C.P. contemplate the construction of a telegraph line between New Glasgow and Sydney, and asking if the line can be built along the Intercolonial Railway right of way between these two points.\nThere will be no difficulty about this, but it will be necessary for you to enter into a written agreement similar to the Western Union Telegraph Company.\nOn 20th March, 1893, Mr. Hosmer wrote the Superintendent of the Commercial Cable Company at Canso:\nI might say to you privately that we intend constructing a telegraph line from New Glasgow, N.S., to Sydney, C.B., this summer and that we expect to get permission from the Intercolonial Railway to build along the line of their road between these two points.\nCopy of the Government\u2019s agreement with the Western Union Telegraph Company, dated 16th October, 1889, is in evidence, also an amending agreement of 12th January, 1891. Apparently a draft contract with the defendant company was prepared, by or under instructions of the Department of Railways, submitted for Mr. Pottinger\u2019s consideration, and, on 27th May, 1893, duplicate copies were despatched to the defendant by the Department, with a request:\nBe pleased to return the same to this Department as soon as they have been duly signed and sealed on behalf of the Company. By letter of 25th July, 1893, the defendant wrote to the Department:\nI beg to enclose agreement in duplicate, executed by this Company providing for the construction of a telegraph line on the Intercolonial Railway between New Glasgow and Sydney. Will you please return one copy to me when executed by the Minister of Railways.\nOn 27th August, Mr. Richardson, in charge of the construction, wrote to Mr. Kent, then the defendant\u2019s Superintendent at Montreal:\nOffices should be decided upon immediately including our right to enter Railway stations as it is very unsatisfactory building line without knowing where offices are to be located.\nMr. Kent wrote to Mr. Richardson on 19th September:\nThe Government has not yet signed their agreement and of course until this is done we cannot enter the stations.\nMeantime the following telegrams had passed between Mr. Pottinger at Moncton and Mr. Schreiber at Ottawa:\nAugust 9th, 1893.\nDated Moncton\nTo C. Schreiber,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe men in charge of construction of C.P.R. Telegraph line in Cape Breton ask to be allowed to put wire into Mulgrave station is this to be done.\nD. Pottinger.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1893.\nD. Pottinger, Moncton.\nMessage received\u2014Council has not yet been asked to authorize the Minister to sign agreement permitting Canadian Pacific Telegraph Co. to place their line between New Glasgow and Mulgrave.\nC. Schreiber.\nIn fact, no recommendation was, at any time, submitted to Council, and the agreement was not authorized or executed on behalf of the Government. The draft which the defendant had executed and returned was sent by the Department to Mr. Pottinger at Moncton for consideration, where it was lost with the file relating to it, probably destroyed in a fire, and now the evidence of its contents is sought to be derived from the Western Union agreement, by reason of Mr. Schreiber\u2019s letter of 10th March, already quoted, in which he says:\n* * * it will be necessary for you to enter into a written agreement similar to the Western Union Telegraph Company.\nNow the Western Union Telegraph Company\u2019s agreement extends to five printed pages and contains twenty-seven clauses, not counting the amending document, and it is not reasonable to suppose that either Mr. Schreiber or the company meant to adopt all these stipulations and details, or that an agreement with the defendant would become definite until the terms to be applied were defined and assented to by both parties. On behalf of the Government, the party to the Western Union agreement was Her Majesty the Queen, represented by the Minister, and it must have been assumed that the agreement in contemplation with the defendant company would require the sanction of the Government. This was, in fact, never obtained; moreover, the Western Union agreement was, by express limitation, to continue in force for twenty years, and afterwards\nuntil the expiration of one year after written notice shall have been given after the close of said term by either party to the other of an intention to terminate the same,\na period which I take to have been terminated by the notices and facts in proof.\nThe defendant relies upon clause 25 of the Western Union agreement, which, it contends, must presumptively have been incorporated in the lost draft. This clause provides:\n25. When this agreement expires, either by lapse of time or pursuant to notice terminating this contract as in the preceding clause stated, the Company shall not be required to remove its poles and wires erected under this agreement from the Railway property, but all other rights herein granted shall thereupon cease and determine.\nAnd the defendant urges that it must, therefore, be deemed to have a perpetual franchise; but I do not so interpret the meaning. Assuming that, upon expiry of the agreement, the Government could not compel the company to remove its poles and wires, nevertheless the company can no longer maintain or operate them, or successfully resist their removal by the Government, whose proprietary rights remain unaffected. The purpose of the clause was, if I do not misunderstand it, that, as the parties had contracted substantially for the life of the poles, it should be optional with the company to remove or abandon the salvage.\nTherefore, there is, in my opinion, no agreement proved; or, even if otherwise, the agreement, such as it may have been, has ceased to operate in any particular, unless to negative the defendant\u2019s liability to remove its poles and wires; and the defendant was, at the beginning of this action, in no better position than that of licensee whose leave was terminated or exhausted. Evidently the advantages which the defendant enjoyed by use of the roadway, and the prospect that somehow it would not be disturbed, led it to disregard the consequences of the risk which, failing an authorized concession, it seems to have been willing to assume.\nthe westville telegraph line\nThere was some preliminary correspondence, and, on 10th March, 1911, at a meeting of the Government Railways Managing Board held at Moncton, the following Minute was recorded:\nMinute 1185. Request from the Canadian Pacific Railway Telegraph Company for permission to string their wires from Westville to Pictou on our right of way. Question as to whether we can permit this on account of our contract with the Montreal Telegraph Company. The Department of Justice advise that there is nothing to prevent us from granting this request.\nThe Board decided to grant the request; the Telegraph Company to give us the use of the line and to put the same into our stations at Westville and Pictou.\nOn 20th March, 1911, Mr. McNicoll, Vice-President of the defendant company, wrote Mr. Pottinger:\nI understand that Mr. E. M. Macdonald, M.P., has been in communication with you with regard to giving us right of way for building telegraph line from Truro to Pictou Junction and that you have decided to grant us this permit on an agreement to be executed by us.\nWill you kindly confirm this and let me have draft of agreement so that I may arrange for the building of the line.\nAnd, on 7th April, Mr. Pottinger replied:\nI duly received your letter dated March 20th, with reference to building a telegraph line from Truro to Pictou Junction. What was asked by your telegraph officials was for right of way to build a line from Westville Station to Pictou, a distance of 10\u00b759 miles.\nAs I told you verbally when in Montreal it will be all right for you to go on and build this line, and we will arrange about the agreement at a later period.\nInstructions have been given to our Track Department to permit the building of the line. There is a long trestle bridge over a portion of Pictou Harbour and there the wires will have to be attached to the bridge. The position of the poles of the telegraph line on the land and the position of the wires on the bridge can be arranged between the telegraph officials and our Roadmaster. There is a telegraph line of the Western Union Telegraph Company along that part of the Railway and your line of course will be placed so as not to interfere with the Western Union line.\nThese are the circumstances in which the defendant constructed and maintains and operates the Westville line. The plaintiff\u2019s answer is that the request was for a revocable licence, and that nothing more is implied by the Minute of the Managing Board and the letter from Mr. Pottinger to Mr. McNicoll. There is, however, no dispute that the defendant used the Government railway from Westville to Pictou by consent, the parties having mutually in view the negotiation of a contract, with adequate sanctions, to regulate their rights and obligations.\nAs I told you verbally when in Montreal it will be all right for you to go on and build this line, and we will arrange about the agreement at a later period,\nwrites Mr. Pottinger to Mr McNicoll; and the defendant, with nothing more definite, built its line in 1911, and has ever since maintained and used it, apparently without any notice or warning of intention on the part of the Government to withdraw the licence so granted. It is true that this line of telegraph, or most of it, is included in the Information under the words:\n* * * between the following points, namely * * * Stellarton, in the said province, and Pictou, in the said province, a distance of 10\u00b715 miles.\nBut I am not sure that this did not happen by inadvertence, because there seems to have been no preliminary discussion or disclosure of any points of difference, and the Westville to Pictou line is not mentioned or included in the demand for removal evidenced by the letters from the Department of Justice of 20th March, 1924, and 29th January, 1926. I do not think, therefore, that the Government had a cause of action to enforce the removal of this line when the Information was filed, although I agree with the learned trial judge that the licence is revocable. The defendant saw fit to proceed with its construction, leaving everything about the agreement at loose ends; nevertheless, it presumably anticipated that there would be no difficulty in negotiating the terms, and it seems unjustifiable, in these circumstances, to attempt abruptly to terminate the permission without demand or notice. Consequently I think the action must fail in this particular; although, if the parties be unable to conclude an agreement, I do not doubt that the licence may be reasonably revoked. I refer to the following authorities: The King v. The Inhabitants of Horndon-on-the-Hill[4]; Coleman v. Foster[5]; Cornish v. Stubbs[6]; Mellor v. Watkins[7]; Aldin v. Latimer Clark, Muirhead & Co.[8]; Kerrison v. Smith[9]; Lowe v. Adams[10]. all lines\nWhat remains to be said applies generally to the three lines or groups of lines which have been separately considered.\nThe lands in question were acquired by the Government under legislative authority for the construction, maintenance and operation of Dominion railways, and are devoted to that purpose\u2014a large part of the mileage at least belonging strictly to the railway which Canada was required to construct under the terms of Confederation, as provided by section 145 of the British North America Act, 1867; and the defendant\u2019s case assumes that the telegraph rights, which the defendant claims in perpetuity with respect to these railway lands, can be acquired for the defendant\u2019s accommodation by the mere laches, acquiescence or tolerance of the executive officers and employees, charged under the Minister with the administration or working of the railway, and, moreover, that it is unnecessary to comply with statutory provisions. It is provided by section 7 of the Department of Railways and Canals Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 171, that:\nThe Minister shall have the management, charge and direction of all Government railways and canals, and of all works and property appertaining or incident to such railways and canals * * * and of the officers and persons employed in that service.\nAnd, by section 15,\nNo deed, contract, document or writing relating to any matter under the control or direction of the Minister shall be binding upon His Majesty, unless it is signed by the Minister, or unless it is signed by the Deputy Minister, and countersigned by the Secretary of the Department, or unless it is signed by some person specially authorized by the Minister, in writing for that purpose: Provided that such authority from the Minister, to any person professing to act for him, shall not be called in question except by the Minister, or by some person acting for him or for His Majesty.\nWith respect to the telegraph lines from New Glasgow to Sydney and from Westville to Pictou, and also as to the main line, so far as concerns the settlement recommended by Mr. Gutelius, it was contemplated that whatever concessions might be authorized should be contracted for by the Crown, represented by the Minister, and the defendant knew, or is presumed to have known, the statutory requirements, and yet there was no pretence of compliance. When, in 1898, section 23 of R.S.C., 1886, chapter 37, which corresponds with the above quoted section 15, was considered by this Court in The Queen v. Henderson[11], there was a difference of opinion as to its application, and their Lordships, by a majority of three to two, held that the section did not apply in the particular circumstances of that case. Taschereau, J., who pronounced the judgment of the majority, saying, at page 432:\nThe word \u201ccontract\u201d therein, means a written contract. Here the lumber claimed for was delivered under verbal orders from the Crown officers, and the statute does not apply to goods actually sold, delivered and accepted by the officers of the Crown, for the Crown.\nBut I find nothing in the learned Judge\u2019s reasons which would recognize, as a contract, terms which, if accepted, were intended to be stipulated expressly and formally with His Majesty in writing, and which were never signed or sealed by anybody for the Crown; never authorized by the Governor in Council, and which, as the case shows, the Minister was unwilling to recommend for approval. Therefore, I think that, apart from the other considerations which I have mentioned, the contracts which the defendant alleges are ineffective for non-compliance with the statute.\nMoreover, as to the defendant\u2019s claim that it has acquired in perpetuity, and in the manner for which it contends, the right to use the Government railways for its telegraph lines, effect must be given to the principles expressed in Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[12]. Lord Blackburn says at page 634:\nI think that where the legislature confers powers on any body to take lands compulsorily for a particular purpose, it is on the ground that the using of that land for that purpose will be for the public good. Whether that body be one which is seeking to make a profit for shareholders, or, as in the present case, a body of trustees acting solely for the public good, I think in either case the powers conferred on the body empowered to take the land compulsorily are entrusted to them, and their successors, to be used for the furtherance of that object which the legislature has thought sufficiently for the public good to justify it in intrusting them with such powers; and, consequently, that a contract purporting to bind them and their successors not to use those powers is void. This is, I think, the principle on which this House acted in Staffordshire Canal v. Birmingham Canal[13], and on which the late Master of the Rolls acted in Mulliner v. Midland Ry. Co.[14]. In both those cases there were shareholders, but, said the Master of the Rolls, at p. 619, \u201cNow for what purpose is the land to be used? It is to be used for the purposes of the Act, that is, for the general purposes of a railway. It is a public thoroughfare, subject to special rights on the part of the railway company working and using. But it is in fact a property devoted to public purposes as well as to private purposes; and the public have rights, no doubt, over the property of the railway company. It is property which is allowed to be acquired by the railway company solely for this purpose, and it is devoted to this purpose.\u201d\nAnd Lord Watson, at page 639, referring to specific provisions of the Ayr Harbour Act, and the purposes for which the land in question was to be used, says:\nThe Lord Advocate ingeniously argued that these enactments are permissive, and not imperative, and consequently that the powers which they confer might be waived by the trustees; but the fallacy of such reasoning is transparent. Section 10 is permissive in this sense only, that the powers which it confers are discretionary, and are not to be put in force unless the trustees are of opinion that they ought to be exercised in the interest of those members of the public who use the harbour. But it is the plain import of the clause that the harbour trustees for the time being shall be vested with, and shall avail themselves of, these discretionary powers, whenever and as often as they may be of opinion that the public interest will be promoted by their exercise.\nIt is laid down in Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, 13th Ed., at p. 1086, that\nA licence from A. to B. to enjoy an easement over the land of A.; e.g., to enjoy the use of a drain (Cocker v. Cowper[15]), or a pew (Adams v. Andrews[16]), or to come upon his land for any other purpose (See Roffey v. Henderson[17]), is countermandable at any time, although it has been acted upon, or a valuable consideration paid for it, which has not been returned (Wood v. Leadbitter[18]). Although a parol licence may be an excuse for a trespass, until such licence is countermanded; yet a right and title to have a passage for water over another\u2019s land, being a freehold interest (or rather being an incorporeal hereditament), requires a deed to create it (Hewlins v. Shippam[19]).\nThe situation which exists seems to have been brought about deliberately by the defendant company, realizing, as it must have done, the facts of the case and the risks to be encountered by the planting of its telegraph lines upon the Government railway, and the desirability of securing permanent concessions, if possible, or if they could or would be granted by the executive authorities; and there was no foundation upon which to apply the doctrine of estoppel. In so far as any contract competent to the parties could answer the purpose, the defendant neglected entirely the most elementary requirements as to the ascertainment of the terms, and the statutory essentials of form and sanction.\nThe following observations of Patteson, J., pronouncing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Blanchard v. Bridges[20], are apt for this occasion.\nIt is far more just and convenient that the party, who seeks to add to the enjoyment of his own land by any thing in the nature of an easement upon his neighbour\u2019s land, should first secure the right to it by some unambiguous and well understood grant of it from the owner of that land, who thereby knows the nature and extent of his grant, and has a power to withhold it, or to grant it on such terms as he may think fit to impose, than that such right should be acquired gradually as it were, and almost without the cognizance of the grantor, in so uncertain a manner as to create infinite and puzzling questions of fact to be decided, as we daily see, by litigation.\nIf a party, who has neglected to secure to himself rights so important by previous express licence or covenant, relies for his title to them upon any thing short of an acquiescence for twenty years, we think the onus lies upon him of producing such evidence as leads clearly and conclusively to the inference of a licence or covenant. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to define the necessary amount of such evidence; but we are of opinion that the amount in the present case is clearly insufficient.\nI would, therefore, as to the main line and the branch line, dismiss the appeal and allow the cross appeal with costs, and remit the case to the learned trial judge, so that he may proceed with the trial; but, as to the Westville line, the appeal should be allowed with costs, to be set off. The plaintiff also should have the costs heretofore incurred in the Exchequer Court, except with respect to the Westville line, as to which the defendant should have its costs, also to be set off.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting in part).\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the elaborate and carefully prepared judgment of my brother Newcombe. I entirely agree with the views expressed by him as to the \u201cmain line\u201d and the \u201cbranch line.\u201d As to the Westville branch, however, while I accept his conclusion that the appellants were, at the highest, holders of a revocable licence to erect and maintain their telegraph lines on the right of way of the railway company (Kerrison v. Smith[21]), I cannot accept his further conclusion that failure to give notice of such revocation is necessarily fatal to this branch of the plaintiff\u2019s action. On the contrary, it seems to me that, inasmuch as the defendants asserted that their licence in respect to this particular part of their line was irrevocable and contested the claim of the Crown to exclude them on the merits (Coleman v. Foster[22]), the bringing of the action itself should be regarded as sufficient notice, subject only to the question of costs and to a reasonable time being allowed the defendants to remove their poles and wires from the right of way. (Cornish v. Stubbs[23]; Aldin v. Latimer Clark, Muirhead & Co.[24]).\nIt seems to me entirely reasonable that this view should prevail, since, under a judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action as to the Westville branch on the ground of want of notice, the result would be the giving of formal notice and the bringing of another action for the same relief which, according to the judgment of Newcombe J., must necessarily succeed. The better course seems to me to be to allow to the defendants their costs of defence so far as the intrusion upon the Westville branch line is concerned, to be set off against the other costs, just as my brother Newcombe has done, and in addition, to direct the trial judge to fix a reasonable time within which the poles and lines of the defendant should be removed from the right of way of the Westville branch.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross-appeal allowed with costs, as to \u201cMain Line\u201d and \u201cBranch Line.\u201d Appeal allowed with costs as to \u201cWestville Line.\u201d\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

The great majority of the people in the municipality are Roman Catholics, and therefore the school commission of St. Romuald is a Roman Catholic body. There also exists a dissentient school corporation composed of those who have dissented and it is this school body that the respondent has sued to have his children educated in their school. The respondent, who professes to be a Protestant, is married to a Roman Catholic and has several children, three of whom are old enough to attend school. The fact of the dissidence of the respondent was admitted on the pleadings. The appellants who are operating a small school in St. Romuald for the Protestant children there, refused in 1927, to accept in their school the children of the respondent, whom they knew to be Roman Catholics. They, furthermore, advised the respondent that, as his children professed a religion different from his own, they were not entitled to consider him as a dissentient, and to collect school taxes from him, and that they had struck him from the dissentient roll, and that he should pay his taxes to the school commissioners in conformity with section 250 of the Education Act. In December, 1928, the respondent sought in a writ of mandamus against the appellants to force them to receive his children in their school. The appellants pleaded that they were not obliged to receive his children because the latter were not Protestants; that they had struck him from the roll of dissentient taxpayers and that the appellants, trustees of the dissentient school of the parish of St. Romuald, were entitled to exclude from their school children of the Roman Catholic faith.\nB. Devlin K.C. for the appellants.\nNoel Belleau K.C. and Laetare Roy K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The key to the question raised by this appeal is to be found in sections 99 and 103 of the statute under consideration (chapter 133, R.S.Q., 1925). These sections are as follows:\u2014\n99. In any school municipality, any number of property owners, occupants, tenants or ratepayers, professing a religious belief different from that of the majority of the ratepayers of such municipality, may give to the chairman of the school commissioners or to their secretary, a notice in writing informing him of their intention to withdraw from the control of the school commissioners in order to form a separate corporation under the administration of school trustees.\n103. As soon as such trustees are elected, every rate payer of the municipality belonging to the religious denomination of the dissentients, and who has either given the notice mentioned in sections 99 and 100, or who thereafter gives a notice in writing to the chairman of the school commissioners and to the Superintendent that he withdraws from the control of the school commissioners, shall be deemed to be a dissentient, and shall, for school purposes be under the control of the trustees. So soon as the ratepayers who have signed one of the notices mentioned in the first paragraph of this section shall amount to two-thirds of the ratepayers of the municipality professing a religion different from that of the majority of the inhabitants thereof, then all the ratepayers of the municipality of the religious denomination of such dissentients, who have not given such notice, and who did not send their children to a school under the control of the school commissioners, shall also be deemed dissentients.\nThis section shall apply to cases where school trustees are elected under the provisions of sections 105, 109 or 112. R.S. (1909), 2620.\nA \u201cdissentient\u201d is a ratepayer who, \u201cfor school purposes, is under the control of the trustees,\u201d and, by section 106, he is not liable to taxes imposed by the \u201cCommissioners,\u201d and, by section 124, he is not eligible for election as a School Commissioner. School trustees elected by such dissentient inhabitants form a corporation for the purposes of the dissentient schools of the municipality, and, by section 310, trustees of dissentient schools\nshall alone have the right to impose and collect the taxes to be levied upon the dissentient inhabitants.\nA dissentient may cease to be such by giving notice\nthat he professes the religion of the majority and that he therefore desires to be under the control of the School Commissioners. (Section 116.)\nI agree with the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the fact of the dissidence of the respondent is admitted on the pleadings.\nAs a dissentient, he could, as mentioned above, bring himself under the jurisdiction of the Commissioners by declaring that he professes the religion of the majority; this, he says, would be untrue.\nIn these circumstances I agree with the decision of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The plan of the statute, so far as concerns this case, is to provide for the establishment of dissentient schools, which are to be under the control of a board of trustees elected by the \u201cdissentient inhabitants\u201d, who are subject to taxation for the support of these schools. The dissentients themselves must be of a common religious faith, but the statute does not appear to contemplate an investigation by the Board of Trustees into the religious faith of the children of any dissentient whom he wishes to attend the school he is supporting.\nThe statute appears to assume the authority of the parents, in respect of the education of their children, during the statutory school years. Section 250 has no application to a case of this kind. It is probably intended to meet cases where the parents desire some of the children to be educated in one kind of religious atmosphere and others in another. Its precise effect in particular circumstances may be matter for debate; but, at all events, it does not point to an intention to enable the trustees of a dissentient school to deny the right of a dissentient ratepayer to have his children educated at the dissentient school for the support of which he is taxed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Laetare Roy.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 47 K.B. 242.\n[2] (1929) Q.R. 67 S.C. 263.\n",

The latter denied his liability on the ground that the property could not be transferred to him by the vendor as it had been sold for unpaid taxes; but the vendor contended that the purchaser was still bound because the sale of the property for taxes was due to the failure by the purchaser to pay them as covenanted.\nHeld that the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed. The vendor was aware that the taxes had not been paid and was looking to the purchaser for the money wherewith to pay them; he had already collected some rent for the property which he was holding as credit against the taxes and it can be inferred that the vendor anticipated that payments on account of taxes, when made, would pass through his hands. When, therefore, the property was sold for taxes, it was not because the vendor was misled into a belief that the purchaser had paid or intended to pay the taxes; the vendor had been notified, previously to the sale for taxes, that the purchaser repudiated the contract and was looking for a refund of his payments, and in withholding payment of the municipal claim the vendor acted deliberately, with a full knowledge of the facts. Moreover, effect must be given to the language of the contract, according to the whole scope of the instrument. The vendor, as the owner, is primarily liable for the taxes, and the covenant, whereby the purchaser becomes bound to pay, while it serves to oblige the purchaser to indemnify the vendor, does not create any direct obligation as between the purchaser and the municipal authorities. The direct or proximate cause of the municipal sale, being the non-payment of the taxes required by the Assessment Act, was not any act or default of the purchaser or his representatives; they had the faculty to\u2019 pay, but they were in no sense agents or actors in effecting the sale; nor did the sale follow as a consequence of their neglect. The law ascertains the damage for breach of the covenant according to the measure indicated by Lethbridge v. Mytton (2 B. & Ad. 772) and Loosemore v. Radford (9 M. & W. 657): when a purchaser covenants to pay the taxes, the vendor may, at any time, when unpaid taxes are overdue, maintain an action against the purchaser for the amount.\nAPPEAL, per saltum, from the judgment of the Superior Court for the province of Quebec, Martineau J., maintaining the respondent\u2019s action for $48,860 and costs, as the balance of the price of sale and accrued interest under an agreement to purchase land in the province of Ontario.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nW.

Weldon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014Mr. Donald Hogarth, of the city of Port Arthur, Ontario, real estate agent, party of the first part, entered into an agreement, under seal, dated 15th June, 1912, with Captain Francis Chattan Stephens, of the city of Montreal, stock broker, party of the second part, whereby the party of the first part agreed to sell to the party of the second part, who agreed to purchase, a certain parcel of land situate at Port Arthur, and particularly described in the agreement, for the sum of $40,000, to be paid, $12,000 on the execution of the agreement, the receipt whereof was acknowledged; a like sum on 15th of June, 1913; $4,500 on 15th of June, 1914; $4,500 on 15th June, 1915, and the balance, $7,000, in seven equal payments of $1,000 each; with interest, at the rate of seven per cent, per annum, payable yearly, with each of the instalments:\nprovided that the party of the second part may pay off the whole or any additional (sic) part of the amount hereby secured at any time without notice or bonus.\nThe party of the second part covenanted well and truly to make the payments above mentioned, and to pay the interest as aforesaid, and also that he\nshall and will pay and discharge all taxes, rates and local improvement assessments, wherewith the said land may be rated and charged from and after the 15th June, 1912,\nand the vendor in like manner covenanted, upon payment of the consideration money with interest as stipulated, to convey the premises to the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, by good and sufficient deed in fee simple. These clauses follow:\nBut subject to the conditions and reservations expressed in the original grant thereof from the Crown; and such deed shall be prepared at the expense of the said party of the first part, and shall contain the following covenants namely: the usual statutory covenants.\nAnd also shall and will suffer and permit the said party of the second part his heirs and assigns to occupy and enjoy the same until default be made in the payment of the said sums of money above mentioned, or the interest thereon or any part thereof on the days and times and in the manner above mentioned; subject nevertheless to impeachment for voluntary or permissive waste.\nAnd it is expressly understood that time is to be considered the essence of this agreement, and unless the payments are punctually made at the times and in the manner above mentioned, these presents shall be null and void and of no effect and the said party of the first part shall be at liberty to re-sell the land.\nIt is also stipulated that the vendor\nis to pay off the present registered mortgage, as follows:\u2014\nTo Franklin W. Wiley............................. $ 4,000 00\nTo Ruttans Estates Ltd.......................... 11,000 00\nTo James Conmee ............................... 11,250 00\nand if the same are not paid, according to the terms thereof, the party of the second part shall have the privilege of taking up the said mortgages as they become due, and deducting the amount so paid on such mortgages from the payments due under this agreement to the party of the first part.\nThe purchaser paid $12,000 down and $1,960 plus $3,000 by two payments in 1913. These are the only payments; but, in addition, it is acknowledged that the vendor, who, notwithstanding the provision of the agreement as to possession, appears to have been in receipt of the rents, received $775, which amount is credited to the purchaser.\nCaptain Stephens went to the war and came home wounded at the beginning of 1916. He died on 16th October, 1918. After his return he consulted and instructed his solicitor with respect to the transaction in question. The latter, Mr. McMaster, of Montreal, had correspondence with Captain Stephens in 1916. Mr. Hogarth, of J. J. Carrick and Company, Limited, of Port Arthur, wished to enforce the agreement, and there were negotiations for settlement. On behalf of Mr. Hogarth, it had been represented that he was interested under the agreement only as the agent or trustee of the Carrick Company. There is among the plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits an affidavit of Mr. Hogarth sworn in England 16th February, 1917, wherein the deponent disclaims any beneficial title and says that he is interested only as trustee for J. J. Carrick. There is also in evidence a deed of 26th October, 1917, whereby he conveyed the property, in consideration of $1, to that company. This deed, however, was not registered until 13th November, 1918.\nOn 11th August, 1916, Mr. McMaster wrote to the Carrick Company, saying:\u2014\nCaptain F. C. Stephens has placed before us the correspondence you have had with his father-in-law, the Honourable Mr. Kemp, and we have now before us your letter of the 26th of June.\nCaptain Stephens instructs us to say that he is prepared to adjust the matter in the manner suggested in this letter, and will be pleased to forward cheques for $8,921.34 as requested.\nWe propose to deal with the matter in the following manner, which we trust will meet with your approval:\u2014\nWe will ask you to cause the three mortgages to be prepared directly from Captain Stephens to the three mortgagees, and also a deed of sale from Mr. Hogarth or whoever is now the registered proprietor of the property to Captain Stephens. You will then send these documents to us or to any one in Montreal whom you may prefer, and Captain Stephens will complete the documents and hand over the money. If you care to send the documents to us we undertake that they shall not go out of our possession until Captain Stephens has executed them and placed certified cheques for the amount in our hands. Captain Stephens is doing this, of course, on the assumption that the title of the property is in order and we are to-day writing to a practitioner in Port Arthur asking him to look into this question for Captain Stephens on our behalf.\nAnd three days later, the Carrick Company answered as follows:\nWe have yours of the 11th inst., stating that your client, Capt. F. C. Stephens, has agreed to comply with the suggestions outlined in our communication of June 26th. We are preparing all the necessary papers in this connection and shall arrange to have the documents forwarded not later than the 16th inst.\nThe title to the property is free from any encumbrance or defects, and there should be no difficulty in having the matter completed at an early date. The title to the property was searched by D. J. Cowan, barrister of Port Arthur, for Mr. Stephens at the time of the purchase and since that time, there have not been any changes, of which we have any knowledge.\nWhen the documents are completed, we shall arrange to forward them to your firm and you may arrange with Mr. Stephens for the payment of monies as outlined in the communication mentioned herein.\nMeantime Mr. McMaster had instructed Messrs. Keefer and Towers, his agents at Port Arthur, to search the title, and, in due course, 5th September, 1916, they reported that there was an execution, amounting to $50,000, against the property; whereupon Mr. McMaster wrote the Carrick Company, enclosing copy of his agents\u2019 report, and saying:\nWe send you herewith copy of a letter we have just received from Messrs. Keefer, Keefer & Towers whom we asked to search the title of the above property for us.\nYou will see that according to Messrs. Keefer, Keefer and Towers there is registered against the property an execution for $50,623.68 with costs which according to an official statement from the sheriff aggregate $76.60. There are also back taxes amounting to $2,237.05 up to the 31st of December, 1916, and we would be glad to know what proportion of these taxes should be borne by Captain Stephens and what by Mr. Hogarth.\nIn reply it was stated, on behalf of the Carrick Company, by letter of 8th September, 1916, in effect, that Captain Stephens was responsible for the taxes, up to and including 1916, subject to a credit of $875 received by the Carrick Company for rent; and that, as to the execution, they had referred the matter to Mr. A. J. McComber, their solicitor, who considered that the execution\nwould have no bearing on this property, as the property had already been transferred by agreement of sale to Mr. F. C. Stephens prior to the execution coming into force.\nThe Carrick Company, by this letter, proceeded to say:\nWe might add that although Mr. Hogarth was the registered owner of this property he never had at any time any personal interest in the land. The rightful owner of the property was J. J. Carrick and on the formation of the J. J. Carrick Company Limited, we took over this property, which had been in Mr. Hogarth\u2019s name, and we have been the owners of the land since Feb. 1, 1914.\nProviding that our solicitor cannot convince you that the writ of execution is null and void in so far as this property is concerned, there are many ways in which the title can be perfected, and the writ of execution cancelled, and as mentioned above, if our solicitor is unable to satisfy you, we will stand the expense of having the title cleared up to your satisfaction On the same date, Mr. McComber wrote Mr. McMaster, arguing and expressing his opinion that, as the execution against Mr. Hogarth was subsequent to the sale to Captain Stephens, it did not affect the land sold. There was further correspondence, but it failed to satisfy either Mr. McMaster or his agents, and, on 20th December, 1916, the Carrick Company wrote Mr. McMaster, enclosing a statement, and saying:\nWe anticipate being able to advise your Port Arthur solicitors that the title to the Arthur Street property is free from all encumbrance, including the execution to which you have made objection not later than the 10th of January, 1917, and we are forwarding this statement at this time so as to give you ample time to get in touch with Mr. Stephens and have him arrange to have the monies in your possession so that as soon as you are satisfied as to the title of this property, you will be in a position to complete the transaction without any further delay.\nMeanwhile proceedings had been taken on behalf of the vendors, under the Ontario Vendors\u2019 and Purchasers\u2019 Act, for the purpose of having it adjudged that the property was not bound by the execution. These proceedings were contested by the execution creditor, and they dragged; in fact, they never came to trial; and, on 12th June, 1917 Messrs. Keefer and Towers, Mr. McMaster\u2019s agents at Port Arthur, by letters addressed to Mr. Hogarth and to J. J. Carrick & Company Limited, gave notice, on behalf of Captain Stephens, that\nby reason of your inability to furnish title to him in fee simple, by reason of the execution above referred to and the mortgages above set out, Francis Chattan Stephens repudiates the contract of purchase and rescinds same, and demands refund of all moneys paid under said agreement for sale and purchase, together with legal interest.\nThe answer, dated 20th June, 1917, came from Mr. McComber, who stated that Mr. Hogarth had left Canada for the Old Country, and would not receive Messrs. Keefer and Towers\u2019 letter for some time, but that he could not accept \u201cMr. Stephens\u2019 repudiation and rescission of the contract\u201d; and he said,\nAt any time after he tenders his money in full, I will be prepared to see that he gets a deed clear of mortgages and the execution. As he is in default with his payments, he cannot blame Col. Hogarth for being in default with his payments. I might also point out that Mr. Stephens has not paid the taxes on the property as called for by the contract and the arrears amount to a large sum. Col. Hogarth and the J. J. Carrick Company Limited look to Mr. Stephens to carry out his agreement.\nIt appears by Mr. McComber\u2019s evidence and the certificates of title, that the lands were sold in 1918 for taxes and redeemed. Subsequently they were sold again for taxes, and not redeemed. Mr. McComber was asked in his cross-examination:\nQ. As to the suggestion of his Lordship, if the Estate Stephens were now to pay fifty odd thousand dollars to the Port Arthur and Fort William Mortgage Company, what chance would they have of getting title to that property?\u2014A. They would get a complete title outside of the tax sale.\nQ. Would they get the property?\u2014A. I don\u2019t know. They might attack the tax sale and set it aside.\nQ. That is to say, that the only recourse the Stephens Estate would have, if they now paid their money, would be to take an action to set aside the tax sale, in order to get that property which Hogarth undertook to deliver?\u2014A. Not necessarily. They might be able to get it back from the present owner.\nQ. Well then, it comes to this, that even though the court should render judgment in favour of the plaintiff, then the Stephens Estate would be left to go and fight for that property somehow and get it?\u2014 A. Yes, because we claim, of course, it was through their default that the property was allowed to go to tax sale.\nA title in this condition is something very different from that which the purchaser contracted to receive upon payment of the purchase money, and the question is whether he is, nevertheless, bound by reason of his failure to pay the taxes as covenanted. Other points were taken and debated at the hearing; but in the view which I take, it is unnecessary to consider these.\nThe action was commenced on 13th June, 1927, and the amended declaration upon which the parties went to trial was filed on 21st June, 1928. The plaintiff, by this declaration, claims as liquidator, under the Winding Up Act, of the Port Arthur and Fort William Mortgage Company Ltd., for the balance of purchase money and interest, amounting as shewn by his particulars, to $48,680, alleging that Hogarth was trustee for the Carrick Company, and, being indebted in a large amount to the Port Arthur and Fort William Mortgage Company Limited, sold and conveyed to that company by deed of assignment of 15th April, 1926, all his right, title and interest in the land, subject to the agreement, and all his right and claim against the estate of the late Captain Stephens and against the defendants as his executors and trustees.\nThe plaintiff put in evidence at the trial a deed, dated 22nd April, 1926, from J. J. Carrick Company Limited to the Port Arthur and Fort William Mortgage Company Limited (in liquidation), conveying the lands described by the agreement.\nThe action was brought and tried in the province of Quebec, but it is admittedly regulated by the law of Ontario, and evidence was introduced at the trial as to the law of the latter province.\nThe trial judge found that the purchaser was entitled to require the removal of the execution, and that finding is not, as I understand the case, in question upon this appeal. But the learned judge also found, by his tenth consid\u00e9rant, that the sale of the property for taxes was made by reason of Captain Stephens\u2019 default to pay them, and that the \u201cdefendants alone are responsible for its consequence.\u201d The learned judge moreover says, in his notes or reasons for judgment:\nThe sale of the property for taxes cannot be a bar to plaintiff\u2019s action. If the repudiation was invalid, Stephens should have paid them, and if he has not done so, he is also responsible for the consequences.\nIf he mean that Captain Stephens or the defendants are responsible for the selling of the land, I do not agree, and for the reasons which I shall state.\nThe chief end of the agreement between the parties, and the reason for which it was called into being, was the sale and purchase of the lands described; and, while the purchaser had covenanted to pay the purchase money with interest as provided, the vendor had, in like manner agreed, on payment of the purchase money, to convey and assure the premises to the purchaser by good and sufficient deed in fee simple. The terms are therefore dependent. In Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, 14th ed., p. 241, the venerable and learned author, who tells us that he wrote and revised every line of this edition, says:\nBut an agreement to buy an estate and pay for it on a certain day, implies that the seller is to convey the estate at the same time to the purchaser; the one thing is to be exchanged for the other. And the mere postponement of the time for performance will not alter the effect of the prior stipulation, which is that the money shall be paid upon the execution of the conveyance.\nIt is true that the purchaser covenants to pay the taxes, and, for breach of that covenant, the vendor may at any time, when unpaid taxes are overdue, maintain an action against the purchaser for the amount. Lethbridge v. Mytton[1]; Loosemore v. Radford[2]. It is also to be observed that, according to the Carrick Company\u2019s letter to Mr. McMaster of 8th September, 1916, advising that there were taxes of some $2,200 chargeable to the property, it is stated that\nBoth Mr. Stephens and Mr. Kemp (the former\u2019s father-in-law) have had this information from time to time, and we have at different times requested cheque in order to pay these taxes and save additional percentage charges.\nEvidently, therefore, the Carrick Company was aware that the taxes had not been paid, and was looking to Captain Stephens for the money wherewith to pay them; and, moreover, as the letter shews, had already collected rent for the property to the amount of $875, which it was holding as a credit against the taxes; and, so far as the situation is explained or made intelligible, I would infer that the Carrick Company anticipated, as seems most natural, that payments on account of taxes, when made, should pass through its hands. When, therefore, the property was sold for taxes, it was not because the vendor was misled into a belief that the purchaser had paid or intended to pay the taxes. The vendor had been notified, as early as 12th June, 1917, that the purchaser repudiated the contract and was looking for a refund of his payments, and in withholding payment of the municipal claim the vendor acted deliberately, with a full knowledge of the facts.\nThe correspondence is not complete; only a portion of it is in evidence; but there is enough to shew that the parties had agreed upon new terms in 1916, which would perhaps have resulted in a final settlement if it had not been for the execution, which was discovered upon the search preparatory to the carrying out of the new agreement. And, while it is stipulated by the earlier agreement that, if the purchase money be not punctually paid, the instrument shall be null and void, and the vendor shall be at liberty to resell the land, there is no provision, either by the original agreement or the subsequent correspondence, for default or delay in the payment of taxes, a condition which, it may be supposed, would have been visited with less severe consequences.\nThe case of New Zealand Shipping Co., Ltd. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ateliers et Chantiers de France[3], was cited, but I do not think that the sale of the property for taxes resulted from the non-payment of the taxes by the purchaser, nor was it the cause or \u201cmean\u201d of the sale within the meaning of that case and the authorities upon which it depends. Effect must be given to the language of the contract, according to the whole scope of the instrument. It must be realized that the vendor, as the owner, is primarily liable for the taxes, and that the covenant, whereby the purchaser becomes bound to pay, while it serves to engage the purchaser\u2019s indemnity for the vendor, does not create any direct obligation as between the purchaser and the municipal authorities. The direct or proximate cause of the municipal sale, if it were the non-payment of the taxes as required by the Assessment Act, was not any act or default of the purchaser or his representatives; they had, it is true, the faculty to pay; but they were in no sense agents or actors in effecting the sale; nor did the sale follow as a consequence of their neglect; and the law ascertains the damage for breach of the covenant according to the measure indicated by the cases above cited.\nThe plaintiff, nevertheless, now denies the purchaser\u2019s right to object to the maintenance of the action after the property has been sold for taxes, and so has passed out of the plaintiff\u2019s power to convey; and it is said that, inasmuch as the purchaser failed in performance of his covenant to pay the taxes, the defendants are now invoking their own default or that of the deceased as a means of escape; but I do not agree. It would be, in my opinion, very unreasonable to suppose that the parties ever contemplated that, in addition, or in lieu of the indemnity for which the law provides by way of damages, the purchaser or his estate should lose the benefit of his contract while still remaining subject to its burden, which is the result now sought to be accomplished.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both in the Superior Court and here.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Casgrain, McDougall & Demers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. W. Weldon.\n[1] (1831) 2 B. & Ad. 772.\n[2] (1842) 9 M. & W. 657.\n[3] [1919] A.C. 1.\n",

By an amending Act of 1870 (35 V., c. 58, s. 1), the capital was reduced to one million dollars with power to increase the same, in sums of not less than one million dollars, to a sum not exceeding four million dollars. The business of the company was to be carried on in two distinct branches: Life and Accident insurance business to be known as the Life Branch and other forms of insurance to be known as the General Branch business. The capital stock of one million dollars was to apply to the Life Branch only, with power to increase the same to two million dollars; and authority was given to raise one million dollars for the purposes of the General Branch business with power to increase the same to two million dollars. In 1871, the powers of the company were by statute (34 V., c. 53) \u201crestricted to Life and Accident insurance\u201d (s. 3) and it was further provided (s. 4) that \u201cAll provisions of the Act of Incorporation of the said company, and the Act amending the same which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby repealed.\u201d In its report to the Department of Insurance the company stated its capital to be four million dollars, and the Superintendent of Insurance ruled that it could only be two million dollars and, exercising the power conferred by s. 68 (2) of the Insurance Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 101, amended the report accordingly. The appellant consequently appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada under the provisions of subsections 5 and 6 of s. 68 of the Insurance Act and the ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance was upheld by that court. Hence the present appeal.\nHeld, Duff and Smith JJ. dissenting, that the capital of the appellant company for Life and Accident insurance business was fixed at two million dollars by the Act of 1870 and had not been altered by sub- sequent legislation. The ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance was consequently upheld and the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J.\u2014There is no inconsistency between the restricting of the company\u2019s powers by s. 3 of the statute of 1871 to life and accident insurance and the reduction of the limit upon the capital stock to be devoted to that purpose imposed by the Act of 1870. Consequently the repealing section (s. 4 of the Act of 1871) did not have the effect of doing away with the limitation imposed by s. 4 of the Act of 1870 on the amount of capital which might be devoted to the life insurance business. As a consequence of the company\u2019s activities being so restricted, s. 2 of the Act of 1865 and s. 1 of the Act of 1870 should be deemed to have been pro tanto repealed, or so modified by s. 3 of the Act of 1871 that the total authorized capital of the company shall be two million and not four million dollars.\nPer Duff and Smith JJ. dissenting: Section 1 of the Act of 1870, which authorizes the increase of capital to four million dollars, must be given its full effect as there is nothing in it inconsistent with any enactment of the Act of 1871; and, moreover, if the intention of Parliament had been to reduce the capital to two million dollars, such intention should have been expressly stated.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J.\u2014The Supreme Court of Canada is without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. No \u201cactual amount\u201d is \u201cin controversy\u201d and no tangible property possessing a money value is at stake in this appeal nor will rights of shareholders be legally affected by its determination (ss. 82 and 83 of the Exchequer Court Act). Moreover, by giving under subs. 5 of s. 68 of the Insurance Act a right of appeal to the Exchequer Court \u201cin a summary manner\u201d from the ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance, the Parliament intended to make that court curia designata for the purpose of supervising acts of an official and the summary jurisdiction to be thus exercised by the court so designated should be final and conclusive.\nPer Duff and Smith JJ.\u2014An appeal lies to this court from the judgment of the Exchequer Court. The right of appeal from that court does not exist only when the judicial proceeding involves a pecuniary demand: the construction of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act should be determined by the decisions rendered by this court under s. 46 (c) of the old Supreme Court Act; and it has been held that, when the matter in controversy was, for example, the right to pass a by-law and so to nullify a contract, there was jurisdiction if the right immediately involved amounted to $2,000. Moreover, the proceeding in the Exchequer Court was a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and the adjudication by that court was a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of sections 82 and 83 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1930] Ex. C.R. 21) affirmed, Duff and Smith JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], affirming the ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance which had amended the annual report of the appellant company made to the Department of Insurance under the provisions of the Insurance Act. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and J. A. Ewing K.C. for the appellant.\nL. Cannon K.C. and F. P. Varcoe for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. were delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014Exercising the power conferred by s. 68 (2) of the Insurance Act (R.S.C., c. 101), the Superintendent of Insurance \u201ccorrected\u201d the annual statement furnished by the appellant company for the year ending December 31, 1927 (filed on the 24th of February, 1928) by changing the figure \u201c4\u201d to the figure \u201c2\u201d in the item thereof purporting to give the amount of the authorized capital stock of the company, thus making the authorized capital stock appear as $2,000,000 instead of $4,000,000, as set out in the filed statement.\nHe also made two changes in the appended \u201cNotes re capital stock\u201d so that one item read:\nCapital stock forfeited for non-payment of calls not to be included.\ninstead of, as it appeared in the document filed:\nCapital forfeited for non-payment of stock not to be included,\nNo complaint is made of the last mentioned alterations; but it is asserted that the alteration reducing the amount of the authorized capital stock from $4,000,000 to $2,000,000 was wrong.\nSubsections 5 and 6 of s. 68 of the Insurance Act read as follows:\n5. An appeal shall lie in a summary manner from the ruling of the Superintendent as to the admissibility of any asset not allowed by him, or as to any item or amount so added to liabilities, or as to any correction or alteration made in any statement, or as to any other matter arising in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act, to the Exchequer Court of Canada, which court shall have power to make all necessary rules for the conduct of appeals under this section.\n6. For the purposes of such appeal the Superintendent shall at the request of the company interested give a certificate in writing setting forth the ruling appealed from and the reasons therefor, which ruling shall, however, be binding upon the company unless the company shall within fifteen days after notice of such ruling serve upon the Superintendent notice of its intention to appeal therefrom, setting forth the grounds of appeal, and within fifteen days thereafter file its appeal with the registrar of the said court and with due diligence prosecute the same, in which case action on such ruling shall be suspended until the court has rendered judgment thereon. Sections 82 and 83 of the Exchequer Court Act, so far as material (R.S.C., c. 34), are in these terms:\n82. Any party to any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars, who is dissatisfied with any final judgment, or with any judgment upon any demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings, given therein by the Exchequer Court, in virtue of any jurisdiction now or hereafter, in any manner, vested in the Court and who is desirous of appealing against such judgment, may, within thirty days from the day on which such judgment has been given, or within such further time as the Judge of such Court allows, deposit with the Registrar of the Supreme Court the sum of fifty dollars by way of security for costs.\n* * *\n4. A judgment shall be considered final for the purpose of this section if it determines the rights of the parties, except as to the amount of the damages or the amount of liability.\n83. No appeal shall lie from any judgment of the Exchequer Court in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, wherein the actual amount in controversy does not exceed the sum or value of five hundred dollars, * * *\nCounsel for the appellant stated that it had intended immediately to issue $1,000,000 of capital stock in addition to the capital stock already subscribed, amounting to $2,000,000, and that the action of the Superintendent made it impracticable to put such additional stock on the market and is calculated to do the company considerable injury. But \u201cno actual amount\u201d is \u201cin controversy\u201d, and no tangible property possessing a money value is at stake in this appeal; nor will rights of shareholders be legally affected by its determination. The words governing the right of appeal from the Exchequer Court above quoted, viz.,\nin which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars,\ndiffer very materially from those defining the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, viz.,\nwhere the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars, (R.S.C., c. 35, s. 39).\nAccording to our decision in Orpen v. Roberts[2], the subject matter of the appeal in a case such as this should, for the ordinary jurisdictional purposes of this court, be regarded as the right of the appellant to have its capital stock appear in its statement at the figure at which it was put in by it, viz., $4,000,000, and the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal would accordingly be considered to be the value of that right, i.e., the loss which its denial would entail in the company. That amount would, no doubt, exceed five hundred dollars. But the words, \u201cthe actual amount in controversy,\u201d seem rather to require that in appeals from the Exchequer Court there should be a pecuniary sum of more than five hundred dollars, or, at least, tangible property, exceeding that amount in actual value, at stake, the right to recover which is directly in issue in the \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d That condition of the right of appeal to this court does not seem to be satisfied in this case.\nThere is, moreover, a serious objection to our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, arising from the terms in which the right of appeal to the Exchequer Court is conferred by s, 68 (5) of the Insurance Act and the nature of the subject matter of the appeals thereby given. It is true that, by s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, any final judgment of that court pronounced,\nin virtue of any jurisdiction now or hereafter, in any manner, vested in the court,\nin a judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars, is made appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada; but this general provision is, according to well known principles of construction, notwithstanding the comprehensive character of the terms in which it is couched, subject to any restriction on the right of further appeal expressed or implied in the particular statute which confers jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court.\nA \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d is not defined in the Exchequer Court Act; but, in the Supreme Court Act, the definition of that term excludes any\nproceeding in disposing of which the court appealed from has exercised merely a regulative, administrative or executive jurisdiction. (R.S.C., c. 35, s.2(e)).\nWhile not governing appeals from the Exchequer Court, this interpretative section serves to indicate the class of matters which Parliament thought should be excluded from the appellate jurisdiction of this court.\nSubsection 5 of s. 68 of the Insurance Act gives a right of appeal to the Exchequer Court from any\nruling of the Superintendent as to the admissibility of any asset not allowed by him, or as to any item or amount so added to the liabilities, or as to any correction or alteration made in any statement, or as to any other matter arising in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act. Many such matters must be purely of an administrative character and the Exchequer Court in supervising the action of the Superintendent in regard to them must necessarily be exercising a \u201cregulative jurisdiction.\u201d\nThat Parliament intended to give a further right of appeal, in all such matters where the value of the right in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars, from decisions of the Exchequer Court thereon to the \u201cGeneral Court of Appeal for Canada\u201d (B.N.A. Act, s. 101) established by it, seems scarcely credible. Yet, if there be jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal, that would seem necessarily to follow. When we consider the character of the functions of the Superintendent, not in this particular case, but in making other corrections and alterations within s. 68 of the Insurance Act, it seems clear from the language of subsection 5 that a right of appeal beyond the Exchequer Court was not meant to be conferred. On the contrary, by giving the right to appeal to the Exchequer Court \u201cin a summary manner\u201d and subject to the special provisions made in subsection 6 for short delays in prosecuting such appeals, it seems reasonably certain that Parliament intended to make that court curia designata for the purpose of supervising acts of an official (the Superintendent of Insurance) and that the summary jurisdiction to be thus exercised by the court so designated should be final and conclusive. See Gosnell v. Minister of Mines (No. 3283, March 7, 1913) where the Supreme Court of Canada quashed an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, which had dismissed an appeal from the Chief Justice of British Columbia upholding a ruling by the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands. Section 107 of the Land Act (8 Edw. VII, c. 30) gave an appeal in a summary manner to the Supreme Court of British Columbia from\nany decision of a stipendiary magistrate, justice of the peace or commissioner under this Act,\nand provided for such appeal a special procedure.\nThat no appeal lies to this court where the court a quo has acted as curia designata, is well established. The appeal given in this case to the Exchequer Court is not unlike that given by the Railway Act from the award of an arbitrator fixing compensation for lands expropriated, where it is said that the courts which may be appealed to are \u201cdesignated by the statute to be special tribunals * * *.\u201d See James Bay Railway v. Armstrong[3]. See also St. Hilaire v. Lambert[4].\nBut while for these reasons, we are inclined to the opinion that this court is without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, at least two of our learned brothers, we understand, hold the contrary view. Subject to the question of jurisdiction, argument was fully heard on the merits of the appeal. It will, accordingly, probably be better that they should be disposed of.\nBy its Act of Incorporation of 1865 (28 V., c. 43), The Sun Insurance Company\u2019s capital stock was fixed at $2,000,000; and provision was made for its increase, to a sum not exceeding $4,000,000, by resolution of a majority of the stockholders at a meeting to be expressly convened for that purpose. By s. 6 the company was empowered to do fire, marine, life, accident, fidelity insurance, etc. By an amending Act of 1870 (33 V., c. 58), passed, as the recital shows, on the petition of the Company, it was provided that the capital stock of the Company should be $1,000,000, with power to increase the same, under the provisions of its Act of Incorporation, in sums, of not less than $1,000,000, to a sum not exceeding $4,000,000 (s. 1). Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of the Act of 1870 read as follows:\n3. The business of Life and Accident Assurance, which the said company is authorized to transact, shall include power to effect contracts of assurance, with any persons or bodies corporate, upon lives, or in any way dependent upon lives, and to grant or sell annuities, either for lives or otherwise, and on survivorship, and to purchase annuities, to grant endowments to children or other persons, and to receive investments of money for accumulation, to purchase contingent rights, whether of reversion, remainder, annuities, life policies or otherwise, and generally to enter into any transaction depending upon the contingency of life or accident to the person, whether by land or sea, usually entered into by life or accident assurance companies, including re-assurance, and shall be established, maintained and prosecuted by the said company, as a distinct branch of its business, under the corporate name of the said company, with the addition thereto of the words \u201cLife Branch.\u201d\n4. The capital stock of one million of dollars shall be applied solely to the \u201cLife Branch\u201d of the said Company, but may be increased under the terms of the Act of Incorporation to two millions of dollars.\n6. The general business which the said company is authorized to transact in fire insurance, as well as in marine and guarantee insurance, and the re-insurance of any risks thereunder, shall be established, maintained, and prosecuted, as a distinct branch of the business of the said company, under the corporate name of the said company, with the addition thereto of the words \u201cGeneral Branch.\u201d\n7. One million of dollars may be raised for the purposes of the said \u201cGeneral Branch,\u201d which may be increased to two millions of dollars, and so soon as at least five thousand shares of the capital stock of the said company shall have been subscribed and allotted to the \u201cGeneral Branch\u201d of the said company, and fifty thousand dollars paid in on account of the same, it shall be lawful for the said company to commence the business of insurance included under the branch styled the \u201cGeneral Branch.\u201d\n8. The said company shall maintain separate accounts of the stock subscribed and allotted, and of the business transacted by it, under the \u201cLife Branch\u201d and \u201cGeneral Branch,\u201d and of the expenses, profits and claims, losses, liabilities and assets, under each of the said branches respectively; and all instruments representing investments made of such assets shall specify for which branch such investments are so made, and shall be held for such branch.\n9. The capital stock of the said company so subscribed and allotted to the \u201cLife Branch\u201d and \u201cGeneral Branch\u201d respectively, shall be liable only for the expenses, losses and liabilities incurred by the branch to which the same has been allotted, and entitled only to the profits and claim arising in, and proceeding from, such branch.\n11. No director or other officer of the company shall become a borrower of any portion of its funds, nor become surety for any other person who is or shall become a borrower from the company, nor shall the funds of one branch be applied to or borrowed for the purposes of the other.\n12. The failure of the Life Branch or of the General Branch to meet its obligations shall not necessitate the suspension of its business by the other branch, or subject such other branch to the provisions of the Act respecting Insurance Companies, in relation to companies becoming insolvent.\nApparently at the time this amending Act was passed, Parliament regarded $2,000,000 as the maximum amount of capital that was required for, or should be allowed to be used in the life insurance business of the company\u2014including therein, accident insurance and other business set out in s. 3, above quoted.\nIn 1871 there was a further amending statute, again enacted at the instance of the company (34 V., c. 53), by which its corporate name was changed to \u201cThe Sun Mutual Life Insurance Company of Montreal.\u201d By s. 3\nThe powers of the said company (were) restricted to Life and Accident insurance.\nS. 4 reads as follows:\nAll provisions of the Act of Incorporation of the said company and of the Act amending the same, which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby repealed. On the purview and application of s. 4 depends the decision on the merits of this appeal. I find nothing in those provisions of the statute of the previous year (1870) which limited the capital stock of the company to be used for life and accident insurance purposes to $2,000,000, inconsistent with the abandonment in 1871 by the company of its intention to do other insurance business, or with the restriction of the powers of the company to life and accident insurance then imposed. Parliament, which had, in 1865, in a statute enabling the company to do all sorts of insurance business, including fire and marine insurance, authorized an original capital of $2,000,000, to be increased to $4,000,000, saw fit, in 1870, to determine that a capital of $2,000,000 would suffice for the branch of the company\u2019s business doing life insurance business, if exclusively applied to it, and that a further $2,000,000 authorized should (if raised) be used, likewise exclusively, in the other branch of the company\u2019s business. In other words, by the Act of 1870, Parliament said to the company, \u201cIf you do life and accident business only, you shall not employ more than $2,000,000 of capital for that purpose. If you choose to extend your business to other branches, you may raise an additional $2,000,000 of capital for those purposes.\u201d Neither by the statute of 1865, nor by that of 1870, was the company obliged to engage in any business; but, if it should do business after 1870, it must devote the $1,000,000 of capital, then authorized to be raised without resorting to increase by stockholders\u2019 meeting, to the business of life and accident insurance exclusively; and in addition thereto it was empowered to raise and use, for that purpose, a further $1,000,000 of capital and no more. It seems to us to be more conformable to the intention of Parliament, as therein indicated, to construe the Act of 1871 as contemplating the continuance of the restriction of the company\u2019s capital to the $2,000,000 authorized in 1870 to be used for life insurance purposes. A passage from Maxwell\u2019s Interpretation of Statutes (7th ed.), p. 136, cited on behalf of the appellant, fully supports this view:\nThe language of every enactment must be construed, as far as possible in accordance with the terms of every other statute which it does not in express terms modify or repeal. The law, therefore, will not allow the revocation or alteration of a statute by construction when the words may be capable of proper operation without it. The words of s. 4 of the Act of 1871 are fully capable of proper operation by confining the repeal which they enact to those provisions of the Act of 1870 which dealt with the operation of \u201cthe general branch,\u201d leaving intact, those which provided for \u201cthe life branch\u201d and its limitations.\nIf, by the Act of 1871, the promoters of the appellant company intended to take authority for the issue of any amount of stock for life and accident insurance purposes in excess of the $2,000,000 authorized by the Act of 1870 to be used by it for these purposes, it was incumbent upon them to see that the restricting provisions of the Act of 1870 were clearly modified or repealed so as to permit of that being done. Indeed, if that was intended, having regard to s. 19 (a) of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., c. 1), the Act of 1871 should probably have contained an express provision reviving the right of the appellants, as it existed under the charter of 1865, to issue and use $4,000,000 of stock for any purpose of the company, including life and accident insurance.\nThere is, as already stated, no inconsistency between the restricting of the company\u2019s powers by s. 3 of the statute of 1871 to life and accident insurance and the reduction of the limit upon the capital stock to be devoted to that purpose imposed by the Act of 1870. Consequently, in our opinion, the repealing section (number 4 of the Act of 1871) did not have the effect of doing away with the limitation imposed by s. 4 of the Act of 1870 on the amount of capital which might be devoted to the life insurance business of the company.\nAs a consequence of its activities being so restricted, s. 2 of the Act of 1865 and s. 1 of the Act of 1870 should be deemed to have been pro tanto repealed, or so modified by s. 3 of the Act of 1871 that the total authorized capital of the company shall be $2,000,000 and not $4,000,000 as therein stated. Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nNewcombe J. agrees with the conclusion of the judgment of Anglin C.J.C. The judgment of Duff and Smith JJ. (dissenting) were delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The right of appeal now challenged turns upon the construction of sections 82 and 83 of the Exchequer Court Act. I quote section 82 in full:\n82. Any party to any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars, who is dissatisfied with any final judgment, or with any judgment, upon any demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings, given therein by the Exchequer Court, in virtue of any jurisdiction now or hereafter, in any manner, vested in the Court, and who is desirous of appealing against such judgment may, within thirty days from the day on which such judgment has been given, or within such further time as the judge of such Court allows, deposit with the Registrar of the Supreme Court the sum of fifty dollars by way of security for costs.\nThe first point to consider is, whether or not (a point to which some colour is given by the language of section 82) the right of appeal exists only when the judicial proceeding in the Exchequer Court involves a pecuniary demand. This point seems to be disposed of by the decisions under section 46 (c) of the old Supreme Court Act, where the words were \u201camounts to the sum or value of $2,000,\u201d which do not differ pertinently from the words in section 83, \u201cactual amount in controversy does not exceed the sum or value of $500.\u201d It is clear to my mind that section 83 must be read with section 82, and having regard to the general scope of the sections, it must be held that in this particular respect the conditions of jurisdiction do not differ from those laid down by section 46 (c). In respect of this last mentioned section, where the matter in controversy was, for example, the right to quash a by-law and so to nullify a contract, it was held by this Court that the jurisdiction existed if the right immediately involved amounted to the value of $2,000. Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. v. Shawinigan Water and Power Co.[5], per Anglin J. at p. 662.\nThe next question is whether the proceeding in the Exchequer Court was a judicial proceeding, and the adjudication a judgment, within the meaning of sections 82 and 83.\nThe certificate of the ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance is in the following words: Whereas, under the provisions of section thirty-one of the said Act, the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada is required to deposit with the Department of Insurance, within two months after the first day of January in each year, an annual statement of the conditions and affairs of the said Company as at the thirty-first day of December next preceding; and\nWhereas the form of statement prescribed by the Schedule to the said Act includes a statement of the amount of authorized capital stock of the Company as at the said thirty-first day of December; and\nWhereas the said Company deposited in the said Department on the twenty-fourth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight, its annual statement as at December thirty-first, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven; and\nWhereas in the said statement the amount of capital stock authorized as at the thirty-first day of December, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, is stated to be an amount in excess of two million dollars; and\nWhereas section sixty-eight of the said Act provides, in subsection two thereof, that the Superintendent of Insurance shall make, in his annual report prepared for the Minister under the provisions of paragraph (e) of section thirty-eight of the said Act, all necessary corrections in the annual statements made by the companies; and\nWhereas the Superintendent of Insurance has, in his report to the Minister for the business of the year one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, made the necessary correction in the annual statement aforesaid by stating the amount of the authorized capital stock appearing in the said statement as being two million dollars; and\nWhereas the said Company has requested from the said Superintendent a certificate in writing setting forth the change made for the purpose of an appeal thereagainst as in the said section sixty-eight provided;\nNow therefore, this is to certify that the Superintendent of Insurance has in the said annual statement aforesaid of the said Company made correction therein by stating the authorized capital stock of the Company at two million dollars, and hereby makes a ruling that the said authorized capital stock is and is limited to the sum of Two million dollars for the reason that by the charter of the Company the capital stock is limited to two million dollars without power in the Company to increase the capital stock beyond that amount.\nGiven under my hand and seal this twenty-second day of March, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine.\n(Seal) G. D. FINLAYSON,\nSuperintendent of Insurance.\nThe appeal to the Exchequer Court is given by section 68, subsections 5 and 6 of the Insurance Act, as follows:\n5. An appeal shall lie in a summary manner from the ruling of the Superintendent as to the admissibility of any asset not allowed by him, or as to any item or amount so added to liabilities, or as to any correction or alteration made in any statement, or as to any other matter arising in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act, to the Exchequer Court of Canada, which Court shall have the power to make all necessary rules for the conduct of appeals under this section.\n6. For the purposes of such appeal the Superintendent shall at the request of the Company interested give a certificate in writing setting forth the ruling appealed from and the reasons therefor, which ruling shall, however, be binding upon the company unless the company shall within fifteen days after notice of such ruling serve upon the Superintendent notice of its intention to appeal therefrom, setting forth the grounds of appeal, and within fifteen days thereafter file its appeal with the registrar of the said Court and with due diligence prosecute the same, in which case action on such ruling shall be suspended until the Court has rendered judgment thereon. 1917, c. 29, s. 73. (Vol. 3, Rev. Statutes, 1927, page 38, chap. 101.)\nThe pronouncement of the Exchequer Court in disposing of the appeal is treated as a \u201cjudgment\u201d in subsection 6. These further points should be underlined. It was the statutory duty of the appellants to give correctly the amount of their authorized capital; it was consequently their right to do so. Any correction by the Superintendent, substituting an erroneous or inaccurate statement (by which, under the statute, they would be bound) would be an invasion of the right of the company, a right, however, in respect of which the company would have no redress except through the proceedings in appeal authorized in the enactment quoted above. On the appeal the controversy was whether the ruling was a lawful ruling or one which constituted an invasion of the rights of the company. It seems pretty clear that if a company having an authorized capital of $3,000,000 is about to procure working capital by disposing of shares in excess of, say, $2,000,000, it is of some practical importance to them that they should be committed by statutory compulsion to an official statement giving their authorized capital as $2,000,000. Not only would it be an invasion of their right to have any public statement of their affairs, avouched by them, or made \u201cbinding\u201d on them by statute, accord with the truth; it might very seriously impair in practice their actual rights in respect of the allotment of new capital, if it did not indeed in practice render those rights valueless. The nature of the proceeding, however, in the appeal to the Exchequer Court can be most conveniently illustrated by reference to section 42, subsection 2, which is in these words:\n2. In the case of any violation of any of the provisions of this Act by a company licensed thereunder to carry on business within Canada, or in the case of failure to comply with any of the provisions of its charter or Act of Incorporation by any Canadian company so licensed, it shall be the duty of the Superintendent to report the same to the Minister, and thereupon the Minister may, in his discretion, withdraw the company\u2019s licence or may refuse to renew the same or may suspend the same for such time as he may deem proper. Obviously this section could be brought into play if a company to which it applied were to attempt to allot shares in excess of its authorized capital. In such a case it would be the duty of the Superintendent, who by section 46 is required to inform himself fully as to all matters connected with the company\u2019s \u201cbusiness or transactions,\u201d to report the ultra vires acts of the company, and in such a case it would, under the statute, be within the power of the Minister to withdraw the company\u2019s licence or suspend the same. A report to such effect by the Superintendent would no doubt be a ruling upon \u201ca matter arising in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act\u201d from which an appeal would lie under section 68. The matter in controversy in such an appeal would be the question whether or not the company had been acting in excess of its powers; in other words, what was the amount of the authorized capital of the company and by what acts the company had exceeded its powers in relation thereto? It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of such a question, when raised under section 42, involving, as it would, the question of the jurisdiction of the Minister to put into operation his powers of forfeiture under that section. The right involved in such a case would be the private right of the company. And I am quite unable to see upon what grounds it can be contended that a proceeding in the Exchequer Court between the company on the one hand and the Superintendent on the other, involving the binding determination of the existence or non-existence of that right, would not be a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d or why the adjudication (which is treated as a \u201cjudgment\u201d in section 69, subsection 6, of the Insurance Act) would not also be a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of the Exchequer Court and the Supreme Court Acts. There are other questions as indicated in subsection 5 of section 68, in respect of which an appeal is given eo nomine where the ruling might, if adverse, be just as destructive a blow to the private rights and interests of the company.\nTo revert, then, to the ruling in question on this appeal. The ruling is, subject to appeal, declared by section 68 to be binding on the company. I do not intend to express any precise opinion as to the meaning of this. It is susceptible of a construction by which the ruling fixes the capital of the company. That is a little startling, at first sight, but not altogether out of harmony with the spirit of some of the provisions of this most amazing enactment. Again it is susceptible of an interpretation by which the ruling would be binding as against the company, as between the company and the Crown, so that in proceedings by the Attorney-General, alleging ultra vires acts by the company in respect of the allotment of shares, the company would be concluded by the ruling. I express no final opinion whether this is in truth the effect of the enactment of section 68. I can see no reason for holding that by force of the enactment of 68 (6) a ruling on any matter arising in course of the execution of the Act is not binding on the company as between it and the Department in any controversy in course of the exercise by the Department of any of its powers under the Act.\nThe ruling therefore now under debate is a ruling decisive at least for the purposes of section 42, under the private right of the company to raise capital by disposing of shares to an amount in excess of $2,000,000.\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the judgment of the Exchequer Court is a judgment in a judicial proceeding and appealable to this court.\nI now turn to the question of substance. We are concerned with three special Acts of the appellants, 1st, the Act of Incorporation of 1865, 2nd, the Act of 1870, and 3rd, that of 1871.\nBy the second of these statutes, if it had ever gone into practical operation, a considerable change would have been introduced into the regulations for the conduct of the company\u2019s business. The company was, by its provisions, to have carried on its business under two branches, styled respectively \u201cthe Life Branch\u201d embracing life and accident insurance, and the \u201cGeneral Branch\u201d embracing fire, marine, and guarantee insurance.\nThe company was to carry on the business of each branch separately under the corporate name of the company with \u201cLife Branch\u201d or \u201cGeneral Branch\u201d added thereto. Separate accounts were to be kept of the share capital \u201csubscribed and allotted\u201d for each branch; of the business transacted, of the liabilities, profits, losses and investments of each. The share capital \u201callotted\u201d to each was to be subject only to the liabilities and losses incurred, and entitled only to the profits earned, in its business.\nThe business of the company was to be managed as before by a board of directors with very extensive powers; and the shareholders were to act as a single body in the election of directors and otherwise; whether or not the general assets of the company were to continue liable for all debts incurred by either branch, is left a little obscure; the prima facie liability is not in express terms negatived, but there is some ground for saying that it is so inferentially.\nBy the Act of 1865, the nominal share capital of the company was $2,000,000, with power in the shareholders to increase it to $4,000,000. By the Act of 1870, the initial capital was reduced to $1,000,000, with power to augment it, under the provisions of the Act of 1865, in successive increments of $1,000,000, to $4,000,000. Provision was made by the later Act for the application of the subscribed capital for the purposes of the respective branches. The initial $1,000,000, when subscribed, was to be applied to the purposes of the business of the Life Branch, the company having a discretionary authority to devote another $1,000,000 of subscribed capital to the same purposes. The company was authorized to appropriate to the business of the General Branch $1,000,000, and afterwards another $1,000,000, if thought desirable.\nThis enactment as a whole never went into practical operation; within a year (and before, as we were informed on argument, any capital had been suscribed) the substratum of the new scheme had been swept away by the third Act we have to consider, the Act of 1871. By that Act, in its 3rd section, the business of the company was re-defined as that of Life and Accident Insurance.\nThat, I think there can be no doubt, was the effect of the 3rd section\u2014neither more nor less. By a complementary section (the 4th), anything in existing legislation inconsistent with the Act of 1871 was repealed.\nThe meaning of section 3, I think, becomes perfectly clear when the Acts of 1865 and 1870 are considered. The Act of 1865, the Act of Incorporation, contains as usual one section in which the scope of the company\u2019s business or undertaking is defined, and it is defined in this way, \u201cThe corporation hereby erected shall have power and authority to make and effect contracts of assurance\u201d of various kinds; \u201cto make and effect assurances oh life or lives,\u201d and so on; to enter into contracts of re-insurance; and generally to do and perform all other necessary matters and things connected with, and proper to promote, those objects. Subsidiary capacities of various kinds, concerned mainly with the management of the company\u2019s affairs are given in various sections, but the word \u201cpower\u201d is nowhere throughout the Act used in relation to these subsidiary authorities in connection with the company. Then in the Act of 1870, in section 3, where the business of Life and Accident Assurance \u201cwhich the company is authorized to carry on\u201d is further defined, the same form of expression is used. During the years when these Acts were passed, it will be found on examination of Special Acts of this general character that this was the most common form of phraseology for declaring the scope of the business or the undertaking of the company incorporated. I have looked through the Special Acts of that period, and I find that the definition of the company\u2019s business or undertaking usually comes under the heading of \u201cpowers,\u201d and that the expression \u201cshall have power and authority\u201d is the form almost invariably used in Special Acts incorporating Insurance Companies (and there appears to have been a large number of them enacted at that time), to define the scope of the company\u2019s business. Moreover, the form of the section itself shews that the subject matter with which the legislature was dealing in section 3, was the scope of the company\u2019s authorized business. A comparison of the language of section 3 of the Act of 1871 in the French version, with that of section 6 of the Act of 1865 of the same version, is useful.\nThe intention necessarily implied by this statute (1871) is, as I have said, that the system of the Act of 1870, by which the business of the company was divided into, and conducted through, separate compartments, should disappear. Life and Accident Insurance, it was finally settled, was to be the business of the company, not a branch of its business. All the devices, then, which had been conceived for giving effect to the plan now abandoned lose their utility and are bereft of their functions; and the provisions of the Act of 1870, such as that requiring Life and Accident business to be conducted under the corporate name with the addition \u201cLife Branch\u201d, that requiring separate accounts for shares allotted to the several branches, for their several profits and investments; that limiting the liability of shares to liabilities incurred by the \u201cbranch\u201d to which the share had been \u201callotted\u201d; all such provisions become meaningless and inoperative. So, also, as to the provisions for the appropriation of share capital to the several \u201cbranches\u201d. It is to be observed that with one exception, which I am about to refer to, this was not affected by the statute. It was to be left to the discretion of the company, and, as applied to the situation created by the Act of 1871, enactments upon that subject could of course have no force. The enactment that the initial capital of $1,000,000 was to be applied to the \u201cLife Branch\u201d ceased, under the Act of 1871, to have any significance; because, after the change effected in the objects of the company by that Act, no part of the company\u2019s capital could lawfully be applied to anything but the business of Life and Accident Insurance; the remaining provision of that section, in the same way, became equally otiose, because under section 1, which as I shall point out, is not affected by the Act of 1871, the nominal capital, as already observed, may be increased to $4,000,000 in successive increments of $1,000,000, which, under last mentioned Act, can only be employed for the objects of the company, as defined therein.\nSection 4 of the Act of 1870 must be viewed as one element in the group of provisions beginning with the latter part of section 3 and extending to section 9. All these provisions presuppose a company the authorized business of which includes Life and Accident, as well as other branches of insurance, and which is to be carried on in two branches under the regime of the Act of 1870. Section 4 can have no operation, first, because in addition to what has already been said, there is no \u201cLife Branch\u201d to which it can apply, secondly, because everything found in section 4 is, in view of the new definition of the company\u2019s undertaking in the Act of 1871, already in section 1. Section 1 stands, because there is nothing in it inconsistent with any enactment of the Act of 1871; and I may add that if the intention had been to reduce the capital to $2,000,000, I should have expected to find that expressed.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the ruling set aside with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

V (N.B.), c. 59.\nPlaintiffs, as representing all communicants, pewholders and adherents of St. James Presbyterian Church, Newcastle, N.B., not concurring in church union (under c. 100 of 14-15 Geo. V, Dom., and c. 59 of 14 Geo. V, N.B.), claimed the church property (or a share therein), attacking the legality of the congregational votes (one taken under the provincial Act and the other under the Dominion Act, aforesaid) in favour of union, and contending that, in any case, the property fell within s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., and therefore, there having been no \u201cconsent\u201d under that section, the property had not vested in the United Church but belonged to the continuing Presbyterians of the congregation. Held: The congregation not having passed a vote of non-concurrence, it became, by statutory operation, a congregation of the United Church, and, (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. dissenting), even if the property fell within s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B. (and corresponding s. 8 of c. 100, 14-15 Geo. V, Dom.), yet, after the Union, it was held for the benefit of the congregation as a congregation of the United Church; the absence of consent under s. 6 merely leaving the property unaffected by the (trusts, and not subject to the terms and conditions, set out in the \u201cModel Deed\u201d (schedule A of the provincial Act; schedule B of the Dominion Act).\nPer Duff J., further: The property did not come within s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B. (s. 8 of c. 100, 14-15 Geo. V, Dom.). In view of the interest created in favour of the denomination by 7 Edw. VII (N.B.), c. 79, s. 6, it could not be said that the property was held solely for the benefit of the congregation and that the denomination had \u201cno right or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d therein (the ejusdem generis ru\/?\/e, and the meaning to be given the words \u201creversionary interest,\u201d discussed at length, and authorities cited; the scope of the phrase \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d is not controlled by the strict sense of the term \u201creversion\u201d, as understood in property law; the phrase \u201creversionary interest\u201d is comprehensive enough to include any interest in real property, vested or contingent, the enjoyment of which is postponed, such as a reversion or a remainder, and analogous interests in personal property). S. 29 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., having regard to its part in the design and procedure of all the legislation, was valid and effective (Hodge v. The Queen, 9 App. Cas. 117, at p. 132, cite\/?\/.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. (dissenting): Plaintiffs could not succeed on the ground of illegality of the votes; the franchise of the voters (a question in issue) was governed, as to the one vote, by s. 8 (b) of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., and as to the other, by the corresponding s. 10 (b) of c. 100, 14-15 Geo. V, Dom., the requirements of which in that regard were fully complied with; the vote under the Dominion Act, which was taken by signed ballot, was not a vote \u201cby ballot\u201d as required by s. 10 (a) of that Act (the method adopted lacking the essential of secrecy: The Maple Valley case, [1926] 1 D.L.R. 808); and quaere whether said requirement of voting \u201cby ballot\u201d did not apply also to the vote under the provincial Act (which was taken by roll call); but, under the circumstances, the validity or invalidity of either or both of the votes was immaterial; each gave a majority for union; and if neither was validly taken the result was merely that non-concurrence was not established, and, therefore, the congregation having been placed in the United Church by s. 4 of the Dominion Act, in the absence of a vote of non-concurrence, it remained there, and it must now so remain, as the time for taking such a vote had expired. But the property of the congregation fell within s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., as being property held \u201csolely for (the congregation\u2019s) own benefit, and in which the denomination to which such congregation belongs has no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d; under earlier New Brunswick legislation (1 Wm. IV, c. 11, 2 Wm. IV, c. 18, 3 Wm. IV, c. 15, 38 Vic., c. 48, 38 Vic., c. 99) the property of St. James Presbyterian Church had been vested absolutely in the trustees of that church; and the mere possibility of a future interest created by 7 Edw. VII (N.B.), c. 79, s. 6, was not such a \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d in the denomination (Presbyterian Church in Canada) as was contemplated by s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B. (the meaning of \u201creversion\u201d; and of \u201cotherwise\u201d, with regard to the ejusdem generis rule, discussed at length and authorities cited; and the interpretation of said phrase discussed with regard to the legislation in question). The result was that, there having been no consent within s. 6 of c 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., the property did not pass, under ss. 3 and 4, to the United Church, but (until otherwise determined at a meeting called for the purpose of s. 6) continues in the trustees for the benefit of the congregation as it was prior to June 10, 1925 (when the United Church Acts came into force), including those members thereof who have since become members of the United Church. As to plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the constitutionality of certain sections of the Dominion Act and the efficacy of s. 29 of the provincial Act, this judgment proceeded on statutory provisions not open to challenge in that regard, and consideration further of the point was unnecessary.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, affirmed in the result (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. dissenting).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which allowed the defendants\u2019 appeal, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal, from the judgment of Hazen, C.J. N.B.\nAt a meeting of the congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church at Newcastle, New Brunswick, on June 29, 1925, called for the purpose of taking a vote under c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., a vote was taken which resulted in favour of church union. At a subsequent meeting of the congregation, on July 25, 1925, called in pursuance of a requisition made by certain members of the church, provision was made for taking a vote under c. 100, 14-15 Geo. V, Dom., which vote was taken between July 25 and August 12, 1925, and resulted in favour of church union.\nThe plaintiffs, four in number, sued for themselves and all persons having the same interest, to wit: all communicants, pewholders and adherents of St. James Presbyterian Church not concurring in or agreeing to church union under the said Acts. The defendants, fourteen in number, were the joint ministers and certain officials of the Newcastle United Church, including the former minister and certain former officials of the St. James Presbyterian Church; and one or two persons who had been officials of St. James Church and were now members of the United Church, but who apparently did not hold office in it. The defendants were made defendants \u201cas well personally as in their said respective official capacities.\u201d\nIn their statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged (inter alia) that the voting at the first meeting was taken by roll-call (which was admitted); that the names of many pewholders were not called and that the voting was not confined to male communicants of the full age of 21 years and pewholders according to Acts of New Brunswick in such case made and provided; that many pewholders were, by refusal to call their names, deprived of their right to vote on the disposition of the property of St. James Church; that in the second vote (provided for by the meeting on July 25) ballots were accepted from female voters and from male voters not of the full age of 21 years, and pewholders as such were not permitted to vote and unsigned ballots were not accepted; that the said meetings were wrongfully and illegally constituted and held and the said votings were wrongful and illegal and not in accordance with the laws governing St. James Church, and that by such wrongful and illegal act the defendants and each of them had deprived the plaintiffs of their right in the said church and congregation and in the property thereof. The statement of claim also referred to certain subsequent proceedings taken or conducted in regard to the alleged local union of St. James Presbyterian Church aforesaid and St. John\u2019s Methodist Church at Newcastle and in regard to the alleged United Church of Canada at Newcastle thereby formed; and to the property of St. James Presbyterian Church. The plaintiffs claimed: the setting aside of said votes; a declaration of nullity of the alleged union of St. James Presbyterian Church and St. John\u2019s Methodist Church, and that certain defendants who had assumed offices and duties under the alleged union had illegally mixed in and interfered with the affairs and property of St. James Presbyterian Church; a declaration that the defendants hold their offices illegally and any acts done by them in their several capacities as ministers, elders and stewards in connection with the property and assets of St. James Presbyterian Church were illegal and null; a declaration as to the rights of the plaintiffs in the property and assets of the said church; prevention of waste, etc., an account, mandamus, injunction, and mesne profits. The case was tried before Hazen, C.J. N.B. In the course of his judgment, he referred to earlier legislation of New Brunswick affecting St. James Presbyterian Church (1 Wm. IV, c. 11; 2 Wm. IV, c. 18; 3 Wm. IV, c. 15; 14 Vic., c. 9; 38 Vic., c. 48; 38 Vic., c. 99; 8 Edw. VII, c. 84), dealt with the United Church of Canada Acts (14 Geo. V, c. 59, N.B.; 14-15 Geo. V, c. 100, Dom.), and considered the evidence in the case (which included the \u201cRules and Forms of Procedure of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\u201d from Rules 14 and 63 of which he quoted). He held that the persons who had the right to vote at the votings in question were those who were in full membership and whose names were on the roll of the church at the time s. 8 of c 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., came into effect; that neither of the meetings or votes was illegal, but that they were held in accordance with the law governing such elections and laid down in the Statutes; and that on this point the plaintiffs failed. But he held in favour of a further contention of the plaintiffs, namely: that down to the time of the Church Union Act of 1924 the Presbyterian Church in Canada had no interest in any property of St. James Church, and that the property in dispute was held entirely by that church for that congregation under c. 48 of 38 Vic., N.B.; that there never had been any vote taken affecting the property of St. James Church as contemplated by s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B.,* and that the congregation had never at a meeting regularly called for the purpose consented that the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 should apply to the property of St. James Church; that the property was purely congregational, i.e., held for the use of the congregation, and could only be taken over by the United Church if the congregation voted in favour of so\n* S. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., reads as follows:\n6. Any real or personal property belonging to or held by or in trust for or to the use of any congregation, whether a congregation of the negotiating churches or a congregation received into The United Church after the coming into force of this section solely for its own benefit, and in which the denomination to which such congregation belongs has no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 hereof or to the control of The United Church, unless and until any such congregation at a meeting thereof regularly called for the purpose shall consent that such provisions shall apply to any such property or a specified part thereof. doing; in other words, to complete the union and transfer all the property there would have to be two votes, one for the union of the churches, and the other for the transfer of the property. On this point his Lordship concluded as follows:\u2014\nIf this is not the case I do not see what meaning is to be attached to s. 6, and I have come to the conclusion that the property of St. James Church held for the use of the congregation of that church did not become transferred to the United Church as the preliminary of the consent of the congregation of St. James Church passed at a meeting thereof regularly called was not complied with. On this ground I am of opinion that the plaintiffs must succeed.\nand on this ground he gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed against that part of the judgment of Hazen, C.J. N.B., in which he held in favour of the legality of the votes.\nBy the judgment of the Appeal Division the defendants\u2019 appeal was allowed with costs and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal was dismissed with costs, and the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was dismissed with costs. Grimmer J. and Barry, C.J. K.B, each delivered a written judgment, and White J. agreed in the result with them both. Both Grimmer J. and Barry, C.J. K.B., held (agreeing with the trial judge in this respect) that the votes were legal and proper votes. They also held that, by virtue of 7 Edw. VII, c. 79, s. 6 (N.B.), the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the denomination to which the St. James Church belonged, had a \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d in the congregational property, within the meaning of s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., and therefore the property was excluded from the operation of that section; that the property went with the congregation into the Union, and that the plaintiffs, who had not concurred in the Union and had separated themselves from the congregation, had no claim to the property. Grimmer J. held, further, that it never was intended by s. 6 of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B., that, if a congregation whose property was held by it solely for its own benefit decided to remain in the Union, it was required to vote to retain its property, under penalty of having the same forfeited if it did not do so, or that, the congregation having voted in favour of entering the Union, there must be a second vote to carry the property with it; s. 6, where it applied, meant that the property was to be held for the use of the congregation in the United Church, but (in the absence of consent under s. 6) to be vested in the local church corporation for the use of the congregation, instead of being brought under the trusts contained in the Model Deed (Schedule A of c. 59, 14 Geo. V, N.B.) for the use of the congregation. Barry, C.J. K.B., in his judgment, referred to the fact that neither the corporation created by The United Church of Canada Act (c. 100, 14-15 Geo. V, Dom.) nor the corporation of \u201cThe Trustees of St. James Presbyterian Church, Newcastle,\u201d a body corporate and politic under and by virtue of 2 Wm. IV, c. 18, and confirmed by subsequent legislation, was joined as a party to the action, and referred to defendants\u2019 objection that, since the legal title to the property and temporalities of St. James Church must rest in one or the other of those corporations and because (as was said) they could not be bound by a judgment pronounced in an action to which they were neither parties nor privies, the plaintiffs should not be permitted further to maintain the action, but that the same should be dismissed. He pointed out that the objection did not seem to have been raised in the court below, nor (as he held) was it raised in the statement of defence. In any case, as the appeal was determinable on other and meritorious grounds (referred to above), he preferred to dispose of it on those grounds.\nFrom the said judgment of the Appeal Division the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGregor Barclay, K.C., and A. B. Gilbert for the appellants.\nP. J. Hughes, K.C., and G. W. Mason, K.C., for the respondents.\nAnglin C.J.C. (Rinfret J. concurring) (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, reversing in part the judgment of Hazen, C.J. N.B., who tried this action.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and others, pewholders and communicants of the St. James Presbyterian Church at Newcastle, N.B., who did not concur in, or agree to, Church Union, under the Act of Canada, 14-15 Geo. V, c. 100 (assented to on the 19th of July, 1924, and which came into force on the 10th of June, 1925, hereinafter called the \u201cDominion Act\u201d), and the Act of the Province of New Brunswick, 14 Geo. V, 1924, c. 59 (assented to on the 17th of April, 1924, which also came into force on the 10th of June, 1925, hereinafter called the \u201cProvincial Act\u201d). The plaintiffs sued to set aside certain votes upon the issue of Church Union, taken, one on the 29th of June, 1925, under the Provincial Act (s. 8 (a)), and the other between the 25th of July and the 12th of August, 1925, under the Dominion Act (s. 10 (a)); for a declaration of the nullity of the alleged Union of St. James Presbyterian Church and St. John\u2019s Methodist Church, and in regard to some consequential matters; for a declaration that the defendants hold office illegally; for a declaration as to the rights of the plaintiffs in the property and assets of the said St. James Presbyterian Church, and for consequential relief, including prevention of waste; for an account; for a mandamus requiring the defendants to suffer and permit the plaintiffs to use the church and church buildings, etc.; for an injunction to restrain the defendants from using the church and church buildings, etc.; and for mesne profits.\nThe action was tried before Hazen C.J., on the 26th of March, 1929, and following days, and he gave judgment on the 30th of April, 1929, upholding the validity of both of the votes which resulted in large majorities for Church Union, but declaring, in the plaintiffs\u2019 favour, that the property of the St. James Presbyterian Church was property held solely for the benefit of that church and that in it the denomination, to which the congregation thereof belonged, had \u201cno right or interest, reversionary or otherwise.\u201d Accordingly, he held that, by virtue of s. 6, that property did not vest in the United Church under the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Provincial Act, no meeting, regularly called for that purpose, having consented that those provisions should apply thereto, or to any part thereof; and that the plaintiffs (presumably), as \u201ccontinuing\u201d members of the said St. James Presbyterian Church, were entitled to the possession of it, and to other relief claimed in respect thereof, including an account of receipts and ex- penditures and mesne profits, as prayed; and further directions were reserved.\nFrom this judgment an appeal and cross-appeal, taken to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, were heard by White J., Grimmer J., and Barry C.J. K.B.\nAgreeing with the Chief Justice of New Brunswick that the two votes on the question of Church Union, taken under the Provincial Act and the Dominion Act respectively, were valid, the court dismissed the cross-appeal of the plaintiffs on that aspect of the case. On the other hand, the appeal of the defendants, in so far as the property in question had been held not to be vested in the United Church of Canada pursuant to the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Provincial Act, was allowed, the Appeal Division taking the view that, by virtue of a statute of New Brunswick of 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 79, s. 6), the Presbyterian Church of Canada, Eastern Section, to which the congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church belonged, had a reversionary interest in the several properties belonging to St. James Church and that, accordingly, those properties were not excepted by s. 6 of the Provincial Act from the operation of ss. 3 and 4 of that statute, and, therefore, that no formal consent of the congregation at a meeting regularly called for that purpose was necessary to effect a transfer of such property to the United Church or to the application thereto of ss. 3 and 4.\nThe present appeal is brought against this judgment by the plaintiffs.\nDealing first with the question of the efficacy of the two votes on Church Union: The first vote, that of the 29th of June, 1925, was taken under the Provincial Act. The only objection made to the regularity of this vote, which, as provided by s. 8 (a), was taken within six months after the Provincial Act came into force, is as to the franchise of the voters. The claim of the appellants is that certain pewholders and others not upon the roll were entitled to vote. The Provincial Act, however, is conclusive against that claim, since, by clause (b) of s. 8, it provides that\n(b) The persons entitled to vote under the provisions of the first clause of this section shall be only those persons who are in full membership and whose names are on the roll of the church at the time of the coming into force of this section.\nWe entirely agree with the view, which prevailed below, that clause (b) governed the franchise at the meeting in question and that its requirements were fully complied with. This opinion is confirmed by s. 30 of the statute which enacts that\n30. All Acts and portions of Acts of the Legislature of this Province inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed in so far as may be necessary to give full effect to this Act.\nAs to the vote under the Dominion Act, however, two objections are taken. S. 10 of that statute, so far as material, reads as follows:\n(10) (a) If any congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches shall, at a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held at any time within six months before the coming into force of this Act, or within the time limited by any statute respecting The United Church of Canada passed by the legislature of the Province in which the property of the congregation is situate, before such coming into force, decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat not to enter the said Union of the said Churches, then and in such case the property, real and personal, belonging to or held in trust for or to the use of such non-concurring congregation shall remain unaffected by this Act * * *. The vote herein provided for shall be taken by ballot in such form and manner and at such time within the limit prescribed by this subsection as the congregation may decide: Provided that not less than two weeks shall be allowed for the taking of said vote by ballot as aforesaid.\n(b) The persons entitled to vote under the provisions of the first clause of this section shall be only those persons who are in full membership and whose names are on the roll of the Church at the time of the passing of this Act. * * *\nThe same question is raised with regard to the franchise of the voters and must be determined in the same way as under the Provincial Act, since the governing franchise is declared, by clause (b) of s. 10 of the Dominion Act, in terms identical with those of s. 8 (b) of the Provincial Act.\nAnother, and a more formidable objection, however, which does not appear to have been taken in the provincial courts, is that s. 10 (a) ordains that the vote therein provided for shall be taken \u201cby ballot.\u201d The congregation determined to vote \u201cby signed ballot\u201d; and the vote was taken accordingly. It seems to me abundantly clear that the vote by signed ballot was not a vote \u201cby ballot\u201d within the meaning of section 10 (a). It lacked the essential of secrecy (The Maple Valley case[1]). Although this objection was taken at a very late stage of the proceedings, it might, but for the considerations presently to be noticed, have been most material.\nThis vote, however, was not taken \u201cwithin six months before the coming into force\u201d of the Dominion Act. It, therefore, was not a vote within clause 10 (a) of that statute. But the effect of invalidity of that vote would be merely to render it null, with the result that, so far as it was a factor, the congregation of St. James would remain in the United Church of Canada, having been placed therein by s. 4 of the Dominion Act, and there having been no vote by which it became a \u201cnon-concurring\u201d congregation under section 10.\nMoreover, it would seem at least arguable that the requirement that the vote should be \u201cby ballot\u201d applied also to the vote taken under the Provincial Act (which was \u201cpassed * * * before (the) coming into force\u201d of the Dominion Act), if that vote is to be relied on as a vote for Church Union made effective by s. 10 (a) of the Dominion Act, being, in that aspect, a \u201cvote (t)herein provided for\u201d. That it should be so regarded seems necessary to its affecting the determination of the question whether the congregation of St. James Church should enter the United Church of Canada, which is a Dominion corporation (s. 2 (i) N.B.), or should be outstanding as a \u201cnon-concurring congregation\u201d (s. 3 (i) D).\nBut a conclusive answer to the appellants on this branch of their case appears to be this: Either one of the votes\u2014that of the 29th of June or that of the 25th of July-12th of August\u2014was validly taken under s. 10 (a) of the Dominion Act, in which event the plaintiffs must fail since a majority on each of these votes clearly favoured St. James Congregation entering the Union; or neither of those votes was vadily taken, with the result that non-concurrence of St. James congregation was not established; and, having been placed in the United Church by s. 4 of the Dominion Statute, in the absence of a vote of non-concurrence under s. 10 (a), that congregation remained in the United Church; and it must now so remain, since no further vote on that question can be taken, the periods therefor respectively named in s. 8 (a) of the Provincial Act and in s. 10 (a) of the Dominion Act having both long since expired. In this view, the plaintiffs likewise fail in this branch of their case. It seems immaterial, therefore, to consider further the validity or invalidity of these two votes, interesting though the questions raised in regard to them may be.\nIt follows that the property of the St. James congregation became vested in the United Church under the provisions of s. 4 of the Provincial Act, unless, and except in so far as, it fell within s. 6, to the provisions of which s. 4 was expressly made subject. This s. 6, which is the vital provision to be considered, reads as follows:\n6. Any real or personal property belonging to or held by or in trust for or to the use of any congregation, whether a congregation of the negotiating churches or a congregation received into The United Church after the coming into force of this section solely for its own benefit, and in which the denomination to which such congregation belongs has no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 hereof or to the control of the United Church, unless and until any such congregation at a meeting thereof regularly called for the purpose shall consent that such provisions shall apply to any such property or a specified part thereof.\nBy earlier legislation of the province of New Brunswick, set forth at length by the Chief Justice in his judgment, to wit, c. 11, 1 William IV, (1831), c. 18, 2 William IV, (1832), c. 15, 3 William IV, (1833), c. 48, 38 Vic., (1875), and c. 99, 38 Vic., (1875), it was made abundantly clear that the property of St. James Presbyterian Church at Newcastle was vested fully and absolutely, and to all intents and purposes, and without qualification, in the Trustees of that church. It is said, however, for the respondents, that by a New Brunswick Act of 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 79), a reversionary right or interest therein was created in \u201cThe Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Eastern Section,\u201d because of the provision, that\n6. All lands and premises which have been or shall hereafter at any time be held by any trustee or trustees for any congregation which shall have ceased to exist, or has become disorganized, shall vest in the said board of trustees in trust to sell the same, and pay over the proceeds of the said sale to the treasurer of the said church for the benefit of the Home Mission scheme thereof, or as may be otherwise determined by the Synod of the said church. We are, however, unable to regard the mere possibility of a future interest thus created in favour of the Home Mission Scheme, or other object to be selected by the Synod of the Church, (assuming it to be in favour of \u201cthe denomination\u201d to which the St. James Congregation belonged), as such a \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise,\u201d as is contemplated by s. 6 of the Provincial Act.\nThat the possibility of some right or interest in the property in question arising in favour of the Home Mission Scheme, or other body to be designated by the Synod of the Presbyterian Church, was not a reversionary interest seems abundantly clear. In the first place, a reversion is an undisposed of estate in property, left in a grantor after he has parted with some particular interest less than the fee-simple therein. In the second place, it is an estate which returns to the grantor after the determination of such particular estate (1 Plowd. 160a). The derivation of the word from the Latin verb revertor, makes this perfectly clear (Co. Litt. 142b). \u201cThere cannot, in the usual and proper sense of the term, be a reversion expectant upon an estate in fee-simple.\u201d (Per Selborne, L.C., in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[2]). That St. James Church held the fee-simple in these properties is not questioned.\nTo quote from Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary, p. 1754,\nThe reversion is what is left; and the remainder is that which is created by the grant after the existing possession. Both words are technical phrases. And though it is said in the Touchstone (p. 249) that \u201ca reversion may be granted by the name of a remainder, or a remainder by the name of a reversion\u201d; yet it needs a very strong context for such a construction.\nIn Symons v. Leaker[3], we find Field J. using the following language:\nAs Lord Redesdale says in Mason v. Wright[4]: \u201cIt is dangerous where words have a fixed legal effect to suffer them to be controlled without some clear expression or necessary implication.\u201d Reversion is a well known legal expression, and its meaning and the distinction between it and a remainder is clearly pointed out in the passage from Williams on Real Property (14th Ed., p. 255) to which we were referred by the counsel for the defendants. This Act of Parliament is dealing with a technical subject. The words used in it have a technical and legal meaning, and I cannot see why the words \u201cperson entitled to any reversion\u201d in s. 8 of the Prescription Act should be construed to apply to a remainderman.\nAnd Manisty J., at p. 633 of the same case, said,\nAs to the construction of that section, I cannot bring myself to believe that the experienced lawyers who framed this highly technical Act * * * could have meant a remainderman when they used the term \u201creversioner.\u201d One cannot help seeing how easy it would have been to have said \u201creversion or remainder\u201d if that was meant.\nA like view was taken by Jessel, M.R., in Laird v. Briggs[5], when, speaking of s. 8 of the Prescription Act, he said,\nThe whole of the section and the whole of the Act is of a strictly technical character from beginning to end. As far as I can see, technical words are used in their proper technical senses * * * Prima facie it appears to me that the rule applies that technical words must have their technical meaning given to them unless you can find something in the context to overrule them. * * * A reversion in law is not a remainder, the difference being that the reversion is what is left and the remainder is that which is created by the grant after the existing possession. I am not prepared to say that I can find anything in the nature of the case or in the context which would allow me to alter the meaning of the word \u201creversion\u201d\nThe application of these authorities to the case at bar is obvious. The statute in question was carefully revised by experienced counsel representing the interests of the United Church of Canada. There is no reason to suppose that these lawyers were not fully aware of the meaning of the word \u201creversionary\u201d or that, having such knowledge, they used that word in any other than its technical sense.\nIf, then, the interest conferred on \u201cThe Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Eastern Section,\u201d by the Act of 1907, be not \u201creversionary,\u201d but a mere possibility, probably introduced to obviate any question of escheat, and which can take effect, if not as a contingent remainder (Purefoy v. Rogers[6]), only, by virtue of the statute, as something akin to a \u201cspringing use\u201d in the legal sense, can it be said that it is a \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d without giving to the word \u201cotherwise\u201d an application to something entirely distinct in its nature and character from a reversion? We think not. Whether such extension should, under some circumstances, be given to the word \u201cotherwise\u201d may be an arguable question. Sutton v. London, Chatham and Dover Ry. Co.[7]; Brain v. Thomas[8]. But there can be no doubt that the general rule is that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d should receive an ejusdem generis interpretation much the same as the word \u201cother\u201d. (Haren v. Archdale[9]; Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary, p. 1370). Indeed, in the Act now before us, the adverb \u201cotherwise\u201d appears to be used in the sense of the adjective \u201cother\u201d: the phrase would be grammatically more accurate if it read \u201creversionary or other.\u201d As to this general rule no authority is necessary (per Cleasby B., in Monck v. Hilton[10]), and it is equally clear that s. 6 of the Provincial Act cannot be read as if the words \u201creversionary or otherwise\u201d were entirely deleted therefrom, so as to make it apply to any right or interest whatsoever (ibid, at p. 275). As put by Pollock B., in the same case (pp. 278-9), the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d should be taken as meaning something \u201cof the same general character as is indicated by the earlier words of the section.\u201d\nAgain, in Parkinson v. Dashwood[11], dealing with a marriage settlement containing the words \u201caccruer, survivorship or otherwise\u201d, Romilly M.R. held that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d, \u201cmust be restricted to an acquisition * * * in a mode similar to that by survivorship or accruer.\u201d\nIn In re Clark[12], it was held by the Court of Appeal that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d in s. 3 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1882, which occur in the phrase, \u201cAny money or other estate of the wife lent or entrusted by her to her husband for the purpose of any trade or business carried on by him, or otherwise * * *,\u201d did not include a loan by a wife to her husband for purposes unconnected with the trade or business. This decision approved that of Cave J. in In Re Tidswell[13]. See also Mackintosh v. Pogose[14]; compare Alexander v. Barnhill[15].\nSo, in Cheese v. Lovejoy[16], the Court of Appeal held that a will was not revoked where the testator had written over it \u201cThis is revoked\u201d and thrown it among a heap of waste papers in his sitting-room, from which a servant took it up and put it on a table in the kitchen where it remained till the testator\u2019s death, because that was not \u201cotherwise destroying\u201d the will within the meaning of the phrase \u201cburning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same.\u201d See also Doe v. Harris[17].\nAgain, in Owners of Cargo on Board SS. Waikato v. New Zealand Shipping Co. Ltd.[18], the Court of Appeal, affirming Bigham J., held that a defect, obvious from the commencement of the voyage, was not within an exemption from liability for \u201cdefects latent on beginning voyage or otherwise.\u201d\nHaving regard to the fact that the respondents are seeking a construction of the statute which would have the effect of vesting in themselves, to the exclusion of the plaintiffs, all property belonging to St. James Presbtyerian Church, and thus depriving the latter of a substantial interest in property which they had enjoyed and of advantages to be derived therefrom, the statute invoked, revised as it was by counsel representing the United Church, must be strictly construed. Upon no construction that I can conceive of could the words \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise,\u201d include a mere possibility which, if it should come into effect, could only do so as a remainder, unless one should read out of the statute entirely the words \u201creversionary or otherwise\u201d, so that it would cover any interest or right whatever. The legislature must be credited with the intention of placing some restriction upon the nature of the right or interest in the denomination, which was to deprive the non-concurring members of the congregation of their property rights, when it placed the qualifying words, \u201creversionary or otherwise\u201d, in the statute. The only possible operation which can be given to these words is by reading them as restricting the right or interest held by the denomination, which would have the effect of taking away the plaintiffs\u2019 right in the properties in question, to a vested right or interest reversionary in its nature, or of the same general character as such a reversionary right or interest. That the possibility created in favour of the Home Mission Scheme, or other object to be designated by the Synod, was not of that character, would seem beyond question. On a proper construction of the statute (s. 6 of the Provincial Act) a contingent future interest, or postponed possibility, such as that now under consideration, must fall within the second limb of the condition (i.e., must be reversionary in character), in order to prevent the property of the congregation being regarded as not held by it \u201csolely for its own benefit,\u201d within the purview of the first limb of the condition.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that, there having been no meeting of the congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church, regularly called for the purpose of giving consent under s. 6, and the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Provincial Act therefore not applying to its property, or to any part thereof, because excluded by s. 6, such property continues vested in the Trustees, who hold it for the benefit of that congregation, as it was prior to the 10th of June, 1925, and did not pass under sections 3 and 4, to the United Church of Canada. See Trustees of St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Congregation of Salt Springs v. Cameron[19].\nIt does not, however, at all follow that the plaintiffs are entitled to the use of the property to the exclusion of the defendants or others who were members of the congregation, as it existed prior to the 10th of June, 1925, and who have become members of the United Church. On the contrary, until, at a meeting, regularly called for the purpose, it is otherwise determined as to the \u201cproperty, or a specified part thereof,\u201d the property real and personal, as a whole, remains in the hands of the Trustees for the benefit of the entire congregation as it existed up to the 10th of June, 1925, including many of the defendants as well as the plaintiffs. It follows that, while the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that their rights in the property in question remain intact, as they were before the Statute effecting Church Union came into force, and that such property did not pass under sections 3 and 4 of the Provincial Act, they are not entitled to the further relief prayed for\u2014and granted by the Chief Justice of New Brunswick.\nThe judgment on appeal should be modified accordingly.\nThe question raised as to the necessity for having before the court the corporation created by the United Church of Canada Act (14-15 Geo. V, c. 100 (D.)), and the Corporation of the Trustees of the St. James Presbyterian Church of Newcastle, (2 Wm. IV, c. 18), is dealt with by Barry, C.J. K.B., in his judgment in the Court of Appeal. In view of the conclusions reached here, it does not seem necessary further to consider it.\nThe same observation applies to the questions presented by counsel for the appellant as to the constitutionality of ss. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 of the Dominion Act and the efficacy of s. 29 of the Provincial Act. As will be noted, this judgment proceeds upon a specific provision of the Dominion Act (s. 10), so far as concerns the entry into the United Church of the St. James Presbyterian Church congregation, the validity of which in that regard cannot be challenged; and, so far as the disposition of the property in question is concerned, it proceeds upon section 6 of the Provincial Act, which likewise is not open to challenge. As to the propriety of passing s. 29 of the Provincial Act, which is spoken of as an anticipatory attempt to validate impugned sections of the Dominion Act, then not yet enacted, it is unnecessary to express any view. We can scarcely doubt, however, that the Legislature had before it a draft of the provisions of the Dominion Act which it purported by s. 29 to declare should \u201chave full force and effect with respect to any property or civil rights within this province.\u201d\nUnder all the circumstances, there should be no order as to the costs of this appeal.\nDuff J.\u2014I shall first assume that the property in question held in trust for the congregation of St. James Church was, as the appellants contend, property falling within section 8 of the Dominion Act and section 6 of the New Brunswick Act. Where the congregation of one of the negotiating churches was entitled to property within these sections, two courses were apparently open to the congregation on entering the United Church. It might, if it so desired, give its consent to the property being held upon the trust, subject to the terms and provisions set forth in schedule A of the New Brunswick Act and schedule B of the Dominion Act, or it might withhold such consent and retain the property under the terms of section 6 (8), by which it was not to be affected by the trusts, or subject to the terms and conditions in the schedule mentioned. In the last mentioned case, I can see no reason whatever for supposing that the congregation would not be entitled to make use of such property for congregational purposes as a congregation of the United Church. Indeed that seems to be the necessary result of the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for the union of the three churches, which, as united, are to constitute the United Church of Canada, and the churches, so united, include all congregations who do not vote themselves out under the provisions of the Act. I do not propose to discuss the question of the validity of the votes taken. The judgments below have dealt with the subject fully, and it seems quite clear that the congregation of St. James Church did not become a non-concurring congregation within the meaning of the Act.\nBy section 28 of the Dominion Act it is declared:\n(a) That the said union of the negotiating churches has been formed by the free and independent action of the said churches through their governing bodies and in accordance with their respective constitutions, and that this Act has been passed at the request of the said churches in order to incorporate the United Church and to make necessary provision with respect to the property of the negotiating churches and the other matters dealt with by this Act.\nBy section 20 (a) of the Provincial Act it is declared that\nEach Board of Trustees now or hereafter holding any property in trust for the use or benefit of any congregation in connection with The United Church referred to in section 4 of this Act, and their successors, shall be a body corporate by the name of The Trustees of The United Church of Canada (at the place where, etc.) * * * and by that name shall hold the property heretofore held by them as Trustees, and shall have the power and capacity of taking, holding and dealing with any property, real or personal, and all instruments requiring the seal thereof to be affixed thereto shall be executed by such officer or officers as may be authorized thereto by the said body corporate. Provided that in the exercise of such rights, powers and privileges the said body corporate shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and the trusts, terms and provisions set out in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto, or Schedule \u201cB\u201d of the Act of Incorporation or to any amendment to said Schedule \u201cB\u201d made by any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe proviso, by force of the last sentence of sub-section (b), has no relation to property within section 6 (8).\nSection 13 of the New Brunswick Act and section 15 of the Dominion Act provide as follows\nWhere, prior to the coming into force of this Section, any existing trust has been created or declared in any manner whatsoever for * * * the support, assistance, or maintenance of any congregation * * *or for the furtherance of any * * * congregational * * * purpose, in connection with any of the negotiating churches * * * the entry of any congregation into The United Church shall not be deemed a change of its adherence or principles or doctrines or religious standards within the meaning of any such trust.\nThe application of these provisions to the case of St. James Church seems to present no difficulty. The congretion became a congregation connected with the United Church by force of the agreement and the legislation, and section 20 (a) plainly contemplates that the trustees in whom the property is vested shall continue to hold it as a body corporate as trustees of the United Church of Canada (at the place where, etc.); and, that this provision of section 20 (a) applies to property within section 6 (8) seems to be put beyond doubt by the provision of s. 20 (b), by which such property is exempted from the operation of the proviso. Then section 13 (15) quoted above also makes it clear that, in point of law and for the purpose of the execution of the trusts under which the property was held, St. James congregation did not, by entering the United Church, cease to be a Presbyterian congregation within the meaning of the trusts.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the principal contention advanced by the appellant. On this aspect of the case I entirely agree with my brethren Newcombe and Lamont. But it is right to add that I am unable to accept the contention that the trusts upon which the property in question is held are of such a character as to bring the trust property within section 6 (8). Section 4, were it not for section 6 (8), would clearly embrace that property. It is for the appellants to shew that it comes within the terms of section 6 (8). There are two indispensable conditions which must be fulfilled in order to justify that conclusion; first, that the property, when the legislation came into force, belonged to, or was held by, or in trust for, or to the use of, the congregation of St. James \u201csolely for its own benefit\u201d; and second, that the denomination to which the congregation belonged had then no \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise\u201d, in the property.\nAt the time the United Church Act took effect, the property was vested in the Board of Trustees of St. James Church, incorporated by statute in 1832, in trust for the congregation, as a congregation in connection or communion with the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The trustees had power to sell or let pews, but no power to alienate land except for a term not exceeding twenty-one years. By a statute passed in 1907, the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Eastern Section, was incorporated, and by the same statute, it was enacted as follows:\n6. All lands and premises which have been or shall hereafter at anytime be held by any trustee or trustees for any congregation which shall have ceased to exist, or has become disorganized, shall vest in the said board of trustees in trust to sell the same, and pay over the proceeds of the said sale to the treasurer of the said church for the benefit of the Home Mission scheme thereof, or as may be otherwise determined by the said Synod of the said church.\nThe property now in question was one of the properties affected by this enactment.\nTherefore, in 1924, when St. James Church entered the Union, the property was vested in the Board of Trustees in trust for the congregation, as a congregation in connection or communion with the Presbyterian Church in Canada; and by force of the statute of 1907, upon the congregation ceasing to exist as an organized body, the property was to pass to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to be held by them on the trusts declared in that statute.\nThe appellants describe the interest of the Presbyterian Church in Canada in the property as a contingent remainder. Remainder it certainly was not. The trustees for the congregation had an estate in fee and no remainder could, of course, be limited upon such an estate. And although the event upon which the property was to pass to the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada would be described, in popular language, as a contingency, it is not a contingency of the character contemplated by property law in the distinction between vested and contingent estates; since the transfer would take place upon the very events which would bring the trust for the congregation to an end by the failure of the objects of that trust, and, since \u201cthe present capacity for taking effect in possession, if possession were to become vacant\u201d (Fearne, Contingent Remainders, 216) always characterized the interest of the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada from the enactment of the statute of 1907. In truth, the rights and interests affecting this property are so largely the creatures of statute, that it would seem to be of small utility to attempt to assign them to precise categories in conformity with the strict definitions of property law.\nOn behalf of the appellants the view advanced is that the interest of the Presbyterian Church of Canada arising out of the trust, upon the dissolution or disorganization of the congregation, is not an interest within the meaning of section 6 (8), and, consequently, it is said, that section applies.\nI have already observed that there are two conditions upon which the application of section 6 (8) depends. It makes no difference whether these be treated as distinct conditions, or two different forms of words intended to embody the same condition. If they are distinct, I do not see how it can be said that this property was held solely for the benefit of the congregation. I think that condition excludes any other beneficiary, contingent or not. On the other hand, if we are to treat the two forms of expression as mutually explanatory statements of the same condition, the words \u201cheld * * * in trust for * * * any congregation * * * solely for its own benefit\u201d seem to throw some light upon the subsequent expression \u201cin which the denomination * * * has no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise.\u201d I shall revert to this later.\nThe substance of the appellants\u2019 point is this: \u201cright or interest, reversionary or otherwise takes its significance, they say, from the word \u201creversionary which must control the scope and purport of \u201cotherwise\u201d, which appears to be used here as an adjective, and may be treated as intended for \u201cother\u201d. Then, the argument proceeds, \u201creversionary\u201d must be read as taking its meaning from \u201creversion\u201d in the strict sense of real property law, which the interest of the Presbyterian Church in Canada in this property was not, and which it is said, also, it did not resemble. Lest I should fail to do justice to the argument, I quote the passage from the appellants\u2019 factum in which the point is, I think, stated as the appellants would desire it to be:\nSection 6 merely gives the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Eastern Section, a contingent remainder in trust to sell. It is not a reversion since the latter is a vested interest in him by whom the particular estate was created. None of the property of Saint James Church was acquired from the denomination but was all purchased by private contribution or devised or bequeathed to the Church. The words \u201creversionary or otherwise\u201d in Section 6 of The United Church Act (N.B.) clearly contemplate a right or interest in the nature of a reversion, that is, a vested interest. The words \u201cor otherwise\u201d are usually given an ejusdem generis construction depending on the preceding words.\nThe rule ejusdem generis does not, I think, assist the appellants. It is commonly stated in the form in which it was put by Lord Campbell in Clifford v. Arundell[20]:\nWhere, after a specific enumeration of different subjects, general words are added, the general words are to be confined to subjects ejusdem generis.\nA view has been taken of the purport of the rule which I can best state in the words of an extract from Scrutton on Charter Parties (12th ed.), page 248:\nIt must be remembered that the question is whether a particular thing is within the genus that comprises the specified things. It is not a question (though the point is often so put in argument), whether the particular thing is like one or other of the specified things. The more diverse the specified things the wider must be the genus that is to include them: and by reason of the diversity of the specified things the genus that includes them may include something that is not like anyone of the specified things.\nThis view has the support of the Court of Appeal in Tillmanns & Co. v. SS. Knutsford Ltd.[21], in which Farwell L.J. said (at p. 403): \u201cUnless you can find a category there is no room for the application of the ejusdem generis doctrine.\u201d To the same effect are the judgments of Vaughan Williams L.J., at page 395, and of Kennedy L.J., at page 406. In Larsen v. Sylvester & Co.[22], Lord Loreburn appears to have acted upon this principle; the words to be construed, he said, \u201cfollow certain particular specified hindrances, which it is impossible to put into one and the same genus\u201d. If this be the true view, it is not so easy to apply the rule where there is no specific enumeration but where there is a description in a single phrase of a class of things of more or less restricted scope followed by wider general words. In such a case it would, in the abstract, be difficult to put a limit to the number of possible genera. Another view, however, has been taken and it is this. It is not necessary to define or ascertain the genus or category which describes all the specified cases; it is sufficient to bring a given case under the general words that it be a case \u201cakin to\u201d or \u201cresembling\u201d or \u201cof the same kind as\u201d those specifically mentioned. This appears to be the test contemplated in the judgments of Lord Halsbury, Lord Herschell and Lord Macnaghten in Thames and Mersey Marine Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Hamilton, Fraser & Co.[23]. Long before, Lord Ellenborough in Cullen v. Butler[24], had said that the question to be answered is: \u201cIs the alleged exception of the like kind with those specially enumerated and occasioned by similar causes?\u201d This view of the rule was adopted by Greer J. in Aktieselskabet Frank v. Namaqua Copper Co. Ltd[25], and in Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd. v. The King[26].\nOf course, upon either view there may be great difficulty in applying the test; and if the maxim were to be treated as supplying in itself the means of ascertaining the effect of the words to which it is to be applied its application may always be attended with not a little risk of miscarriage. In the abstract, there will usually be more than one category or genus to which the enumerated cases could be referred according to the aspect in which the particular cases are viewed, and, as already said, where the general words are preceded by only one description of less general import, the possible number of categories may be indefinitely great. Under the form of the rule favoured by Greer J., there is still the question to be asked, likeness in what respect? In practice, of course, these questions must be capable of an answer by reference to subject matter and context, as, for example, in Chung Chuck v. The King[27], or the rule is valueless. As Hamilton J. said in Thorman v. Dowgate Steamship Co. Ltd.[28]: \u201cThe ejusdem generis rule is a canon of construction only. The object of it is to find the intention of the parties. The instrument, the nature of the transaction, and the language used must all have due regard given to them,\u201d and the intention of the parties is to be ascertained by the consideration of their language in accordance with its ordinary and natural meaning.\nIn Larsen v. Sylvester & Co.[29], Lord Loreburn and Lord Ashbourne repeated the warning of Fry J., that in loosely applying the doctrine ejusdem generis there may be great danger in \u201cgiving not the true effect\u201d to the words used \u201cbut a narrower effect than they were intended to have.\u201d In Anderson v. Anderson[30], Rigby L.J. says: \u201cThe doctrine has, I think, frequently led to wrong conclusions on the construction of instruments\u201d. In the Earl of Jersey\u2019s case[31], Bowen L.J. says the rule \u201cis after all but a working canon to enable us to arrive at the meaning of the particular document\u201d. In In re Stockport[32], Lindley M.R. says: \u201cI am quite aware that there have been cases * * * where the court has protested against pushing the doctrine of ejusdem generis too far. It is very often pushed too far.\u201d\nPrima facie, general words are to be given their natural meaning. In Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[33], Lord Selborne says: \u201cIt is a sound maxim of law that every word ought, prima facie, to be construed in its primary and natural sense, unless a secondary or more limited sense is required by the subject or the context\u201d, and this principle was applied by the Court of Appeal in Anderson v. Anderson[34], where Lord Esher said, in dealing with construction of general words appended to an enumeration of particulars, \u201cI reject the supposed rule that general words are prima facie to be taken in a restricted sense.\u201d The appellants restrict \u201creversionary interest\u201d to an interest which is of the nature of a reversion in the sense that it is something reserved to the grantor. But every postponed interest is like a reversion in the sense that it is a postponed interest. When one considers the first condition of section 6 (8), namely, that the property shall be held by the congregation \u201csolely for its own benefit\u201d, one has some difficulty in understanding why the operation of that section should be limited to cases in which the denomination has no reversionary interest in the sense argued for. According to the contention, if the denomination had an interest which was reversionary in that sense, section 6 (8) does not operate and the property passes under section 4. But if it has an interest which is in the nature of a remainder, and therefore, according to the argument, not \u201creversionary\u201d, section 6 operates and the property does not pass. Why, for the purposes of the statute, such a distinction should be drawn, it is difficult to understand. In truth, I should think that the word \u201creversionary\u201d was inserted ex majore cautel\u00e2 to make it clear that interests in reversion, and especially perhaps contingent interests in reversion, are interests within the meaning of the section; in other words, that \u201creversionary or otherwise\u201d might accurately be paraphrased: \u201cincluding those which are reversionary,\u201d or \u201creversionary or not.\u201d\nIn truth, the whole argument is founded on a mis-reading of the term \u201creversionary\u201d. \u201cReversionary interest\u201d and \u201cinterest in reversion\u201d are phrases quite broad enough to comprehend such an interest as that confronting us here. The strict technical sense of the word \u201creversion\u201d, as used in property law, does not at all govern the sense of these expressions. That such is not the case in respect of the expression in section 6 (8), should be sufficiently evident from the circumstances, first, that the enactment deals with personal property as well as real property, and, more important still, that it applies to property in Quebec no less than to property situated elsewhere. It is not necessary, however, to rely upon this last consideration. The common law knew no such thing as a remainder or reversion of a chattel. Successive interests in chattels may, of course, be created in equity and postponed interests under settlements of shares, choses in action, and other chattels personal, as well as in chattels real, are referred to commonly and indeed usually as \u201creversionary interests\u201d. \u201cAll leases which are not to take effect in possession immediately, but from a future day, are considered as reversionary leases, within the meaning of powers to grant leases in possession and not in reversion.\u201d Woodfall\u2019s Law of Landlord and Tenant, 22nd ed., p. 254. \u201cIn legal acceptance, a future lease and a lease in reversion are synonymous. If a man make a lease for life, and afterwards grant the lands to another for 21 years after the death of the tenant for life, these words are sufficient to pass a reversionary interest by way of future lease.\u201d Woodfall, page 255.\nThe term \u201creversionary interest\u201d is commonly used in text books and in reports of cases under various topics of the law, to describe future interests in real as well as personal property which are not by operation of law or otherwise interests reserved to the grantor or donor; but are merely interests which take effect at the expiration of a preceding estate or interest, or, as in the passage relating to leases quoted above from Woodfall, to interests which simply take effect in the future. It is perhaps superfluous to exemplify this. Osborne\u2019s \u201cConcise Law Dictionary\u201d defines \u201creversionary interest\u201d as \u201cany right in property the enjoyment of which is deferred, e.g., a reversion or remainder or analogous interests in personal property.\u201d This definition is too narrow if it implies that the term embraces only vested interests. Examples of this usage\u2014they could be multiplied indefinitely\u2014are to be found in: Fry v. Lane[35]; Honner v. Morton[36]; Caldwell v. Fellowes[37]; Purdew v. Jackson[38]; Spring v. Pride[39]; Butcher v. Butcher[40]; Rose v. Cornish[41]; Re Roy\u2019s Settlement[42]; In Re Owen[43]; Hugill v. Wilkinson[44]. The application of the phrase to interests which are contingent is illustrated in: Hughill v. Wilkinson[45]; In re Owen[46]; Lloyd v. Prichard[47]. It is necessary to add an observation with regard to section 29 of the New Brunswick Statute. It is in these words:\nThe provisions of the Act of Incorporation shall have full force and effect with respect to any property or civil rights within this Province.\nOn behalf of the appellants, it is denied that this section can legally take effect. The argument is stated thus, in the factum:\nThe Provincial Act was passed April 17, 1924, and at that time there was no Act of Incorporation, because the Dominion Act was not passed until July 19, 1924. Virtually, the Provincial Legislature attempted to give up its entire legislative authority to the Parliament of Canada without even seeing the terms of the legislation which Parliament intended to enact. Such a delegation of legislative authority is entirely contrary to the terms of the Act of Confederation.\nThe meaning of the phrase \u201cAct of Incorporation\u201d is made clear by reference to the preamble, the first paragraph of which is as follows:\nWhereas, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, The Methodist Church and the Congregational Churches of Canada have by their petition represented that they have agreed to unite and form one body or denomination of Christians under the name of \u201cThe United Church of Canada,\u201d in accordance with the terms and provisions of a Basis of Union agreed upon by them, and whereas they have petitioned the Parliament of Canada for an Act to incorporate the Church to be formed by the said Union under the name \u201cThe United Church of Canada.\u201d\nIt may be assumed that the Legislature of New Brunswick had before it not only the Basis of Union, but the Act of Incorporation as well, substantially in the form in which it eventually passed. Indeed, the very basis, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the New Brunswick Act was the contemplated Act of Incorporation. The design of creating the ecclesiastical corporation, the United Church, which was the subject of all the legislation, Dominion and provincial, was one which required in order to give it legal efficacy, the cooperation of the Dominion and provincial legislatures. The procedure was quite well understood. As far as its powers enabled it to do so, the Dominion Parliament was to give the sanction of law to the Act of Incorporation and the several provinces were, so far as their powers extended, to give legal effect to that enactment in respects in which the powers of the Dominion might fall short. I cannot doubt the validity, under the British North America Act, of such a procedure. In Hodge v. The Queen[48], the Privy Council said:\nIt appears to their Lordships, however, that the objection thus raised by the appellants is founded on an entire misconception of the true character and position of the provincial legislatures. They are in no sense delegates of or acting under any mandate from the Imperial Parliament. When the British North America Act enacted that there should be a legislature for Ontario, and that its legislative assembly should have exclusive authority to make laws for the province and for provincial purposes in relation to the matters enumerated in section 92, it conferred powers not in any sense to be exercised by delegation from or as agents of the Imperial Parliament, but authority as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by section 92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plentitude of its power possessed and could bestow. Within these limits of subjects and area the local legislature is supreme.\nThis statement of the law seems to be conclusive.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I am willing to accept the findings of my Lord, the Chief Justice, except with relation to the meaning and effect of the three sections relating to church and congregational property; namely, sections 5, 6 and 8 of the United Church of Canada Act, chapter 100 of the Dominion, 1924, and the identic sections, 3, 4 and 6 of the United Church of Canada Act, chapter 59 of New Brunswick, 1924. But in my opinion, the plaintiffs have no legal cause to complain or to seek any declaration or relief, even though the congregation has not consented that the provisions of the said sections, 5 and 6 of the Dominion, and 3 and 4 of the province, shall apply to its property, or to any part of it.\nThe congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church at Newcastle, not having passed a resolution of non-concurrence, was admitted to and declared to be a congregation of the United Church of Canada, on 10th June, 1925, by force of the United Church of Canada Act, chapter 100 of the Dominion, 1924; it entered the Union as a statutory consequence, and the property of the congregation passed with it, subject to the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of the Dominion Act, and the corresponding sections, 4 and 6, of the provincial Act. As set out in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs bring this action, not only for themselves, but \u201cas well for all persons having the same interest, to wit: all communicants, pew-holders and adherents of the said Church not concurring in or agreeing to Church Union under the Acts hereinafter mentioned\u201d; and the Acts here referred to are those which I have cited above.\nIn my judgment of the case, it is not shewn, either by the allegations or the proof, that the plaintiffs have any right to the declarations or relief claimed. It is not denied that the body in question became, by the operation of the statutes, a congregation of the United Church of Canada, and the intention, as I interpret it, was not to detach the congregation from its separate property, but rather to recognize and uphold its independence in relation to that property, although with power of consent or election, which has not been exercised, to introduce the terms and provisions incorporated by sections 6 and 4 of the Dominion and Provincial Acts, respectively. Unless the congregation consent, the property which it holds, in the words of the statute, solely for its own benefit, and in which its denomination has no right or interest, must remain where it was when the Union became effective, namely, with the congregation, and its consent is entirely discretionary.\nThe non-concurring minority, formerly members of the congregation, if they still continue to belong to it, may, of course, agitate in a constitutional manner for the disposal of its property, within the scope of its powers; and I presume they might, if they wish, have a meeting convened for the purpose mentioned in the aforesaid sections, 8 and 6; but, they have not taken the prescribed steps, and obviously such a meeting is not what they claim or desiderate.\nOn the other hand, if the plaintiffs and those whom they represent have ceased to be members of the congregation, they have no longer any voice in the conduct or decision of the business or policy of the congregation, or in the disposition of its property.\nAny other conclusions seem to leave the property unrepresented by any beneficial owner. It is neither in the United Church, nor in the congregation as it exists; and, unless that congregation is empowered to grant the consent provided for, the property is in the air; a result which, with all due respect, cannot possibly have been intended.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs, who were members or adherents of St. James Presbyterian Church at Newcastle, N.B., not concurring in or agreeing to Church Union, brought this action for (inter alia) a declaration as to their rights in the property and assets of the Church, the majority of the congregation of which had voted in favour of entering the Union. Numerous arguments were advanced for the purpose of procuring a reversal of the judgment of the Appeal Division and of shewing that the plaintiffs had some right or interest in the church property. Of these I find it necessary to refer to one only, namely, that under section 6 of the New Brunswick Act (14 Geo. V, ch. 59) a second vote of the congregation was needed to decide whether or not the property of the church should pass with it into the Union and that as such vote had not been taken the church property was held by the trustees thereof for the use of the non-concurring members or at least for the use of those who, prior to the Union, had constituted the congregation.\nThe congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church, not having voted non-concurrence within the time fixed therefor by statute, became merged in the United Church of Canada on June 10th, 1925, by virtue of section 4 of the United Church of Canada Act (Dom.), 14-15 Geo. V, c. 100. Thereafter as a congregation it was part of the United Church.\nThe statutory provisions dealing particularly with the property of a congregation joining the Union, are sections 3, 4 and 6 of the New Brunswick Act, which are embodied in sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Dominion Act. Section 3 of the local Act, with certain reservations, vests in the United Church the properties of the uniting church organizations as distinguished from properties of the congregations. Section 4 deals with congregational property and provides that, subject to section 6, all property within the province belonging to or held in trust for any congregation of any of the negotiating churches shall, from the coming into force of the section, be held, used and administered for the benefit of the same congregation as a part of the United Church, upon the trusts and subject to the provisions of a Model Deed set forth in the schedule. The property, therefore, of every congregation entering the Union was thereafter held by the trustees thereof upon the terms contained in the Model Deed, except in those cases falling within section 6. Section 6, upon which the appellants rely, reads as follows:\u2014\nAny real or personal property belonging to or held by or in trust for or to the use of any congregation, whether a congregation of the negotiating churches or a congregation received into The United Church after the coming into force of this section solely for its own benefit, and in which the denomination to which such congregation belongs has no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 hereof or to the control of The United Church, unless and until any such congregation at a meeting thereof regularly called for the purpose shall consent that such provisions shall apply to any such property or a specified part thereof.\nIt was contended that under certain New Brunswick statutes the Trustees of St. James Presbyterian Church held the church property in trust solely for the benefit of the congregation thereof and that the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as a denomination, had no right or interest, reversionary or otherwise, therein.\nIn the view I take of the rights of the parties, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not the contention is well founded. I will assume that it is, and that the denomination had no right or interest in the congregational property. As there was no consent given by the congregation to the application of the provisions of section 3 or section 4 to its property as provided for in section 6, those sections do not apply, and the only question is: For whom do the trustees, in whose names the property is vested, hold it in trust?\nSection 6 was enacted to give effect to the agreement contained in a clause in the Basis of Union (Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Dominion Act) which provided that any property owned by a congregation or vested in trust for it solely for its own benefit should not be affected by the legislation giving effect to the Union, or by any legislation of the United Church, without the consent of the congregation. It therefore seems clear that in those cases to which section 6 applies it was the legislative intention that the congregational property should not be vested in the United Church or brought under the terms of the Model Deed unless and until the congregation by a proper vote consented thereto. No consent being given in this case, the congregational property, in my opinion, (and I state my conclusions merely) is held by the trustees thereof solely for the benefit of the congregation of St. James Church. That congregation, however, entered the Union and became a congregation of the United Church. In my opinion that does not affect its right to its property. By entering the Union it did not lose its identity (See Preamble to Dominon Act). The scheme of the legislation which brought about the union of the churches was to permit the majority to determine the action of the congregation. If the majority decided to enter the Union, the congregation, as a congregation, became part of the United Church. If the majority decided against entering the Union, the congregation remained outside the Union with all its property. The majority spoke for the congregation. The congregation of St. James Presbyterian Church, by entering the Union, effected a change in its name but not of its identity. Under the Act it was still the same congregation although some of its members refused to go with it into the Union. Those who did go thereafter constituted the congregation, and the trustees in whose names its property was vested held it after the Union for the benefit of that congregation, as a congregation of the United Church, Without the consent of the congregation duly given, as provided in section 6, the congregational property cannot be vested in the United Church nor brought under the terms of the Model Deed, but I fail to find anything in any of the legislation indicating an intention that a congregation on entering the Union was either to forfeit its property or share it with former members thereof now non-concurring, because it preferred to continue keeping for itself the absolute control over its own property and refused to give the United Church any interest therein or control thereover. The congregation, as it is constituted at the present time, is alone, in my opinion, beneficially interested in the property and entitled thereto. This, as I see it, is the meaning and intent of the legislation. As the plaintiffs are no longer a part of the congregation in the Union, they have no valid claim to share in its property.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Allan A.

Act, exclusive authority to legislate in such a way as to carry out the obligations the Convention imposes on Canada and its provinces. But the Dominion Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction is paramount in the exercise of its authority to carry out these obligations.\nThe subject of intra-provincial aviation prima facie falls within the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces under one or other of the heads of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe control of aeronautics does not come within the subject of \u201cNavigation and Shipping\u201d assigned to the Dominion by section 91 (10) of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe Dominion Parliament, in relation to aeronautics, has legislative control over aircraft and aerial navigation, so far as incidentally necessary, in connection with various matters assigned under specific heads of section 91, such as \u201cThe Regulation of Trade and Commerce,\u201d \u201cPostal Service,\u201d \u201cMilitia, Military and Naval Service and Defence\u201d and \u201cNaturalization and Aliens.\u201d\nAs to the questions 3 and 4, concerning the provisions of section 4 of the Aeronautics Act and the \u201cAir Regulations\u201d of 1920, the members of the court (except Newcombe J. who raised a preliminary question as to the propriety of answering these questions and Cannon J.), considered that they were bound by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act to answer the questions submitted as fully as the circumstances permitted and, after examining these provisions and regulations, up-held certain of them as valid and denied the validity of others.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Smith and Cannon JJ.\u2014Legislative jurisdiction over intra-provincial flying prima facie belongs to the provinces under sub-section 13 of section 92 (Property and Civil Rights).\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe J.\u2014Dominion powers derived under section 132 of the B.N.A. Act should be liberally interpreted to include all such as are necessary or proper for achieving the purposes defined. The Dominion is, by that section, authorized to exercise these powers for performing its treaty obligations, and equally so for performing those of a province, irrespective of the question as to where the power would have resided if section 132 had not been enacted.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J.:\u2014Although a province may effectively legislate for the performance of treaty obligations in regard to any matter falling within section 92 of the B.N.A. Act while the field is unoccupied by the Dominion (but not otherwise), Dominion legislation, being paramount, will, when enacted, supersede that of the province about such matters.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J.\u2014The Dominion Parliament has legislative authority to sanction the making and enforcement of the Air Regulations, respecting the granting of licences to pilots and their suspension or revocation; the regulation, etc., and licensing of all aircraft; and also the licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations described in the Convention, and, as to others, so far as may be necessary to prevent air navigators being confused or misled in locating and landing at aerodromes and air stations referred to in the Convention, or in reading ground markings made in pursuance of the Convention.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014The legislative jurisdiction of the provinces under s. 92 runs through the space above the surface of provincial territory as through the surface itself and the space below; and the matters comprised within the subject of aviation primarily fall within that jurisdiction.\u2014\u201dNavigation and Shipping,\u201d within the meaning of Head 10 of s. 91, does not embrace that subject. The Dominion may exercise legislative jurisdiction in relation to aviation in the course of executing its authority over various matters which fall within certain of the enumerated heads of s. 91 or within the subject of Immigration (s. 95); it may also exercise such authority under s. 132 where the conditions exist under which that section comes into play. These conditions are, first, that there exists an obligation of Canada or of a province(as part of the British Empire) towards a foreign country arising under a treaty between the Empire and a foreign country, and, second, that the obligation relates to the subject of aviation or in some manner affects it. The powers arising under that section are given for performing such obligations, and can only be validly exercised in the performance of, and for the purpose of performing, them. Legislation enacted in the valid exercise of such powers takes effect notwithstanding any conflicting law of a province; the Dominion has full competence under s. 132 to give effect by legislation to the rules embodied in the Convention of 1919, and to take measures for the effectual enforcement of them.\u2014Any conflicting or repugnant provincial rules would be superseded by such legislation. The Heads of s. 91 which come under consideration in answering the questions submitted are no. 5, the Postal Service; no. 7, Military, Militia and Naval Service and Defence; no. 11, Quarantine; no. 25, Naturalization and Aliens; no. 2, the Regulation of Trade and Commerce; no. 3, Raising of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation. Under these Heads, the Dominion is entitled to exercise legislative control over the use of aircraft in carrying mails; over the conditions under which goods, mails or passengers may be imported and exported in aircraft into or from Canada; in respect of (in this case, in conjunction with s. 132) the prohibition of the navigation of aircraft over prescribed areas; over landing places for aircraft entering Canada and the conditions of such entry; in relation to the Air Force. The specific question as to the authority of the Dominion to control aerial locomotion between the provinces does not arise under any interrogatory submitted, upon any construction of the interrogatories. Likewise, no question arises (upon any reasonably possible construction of any of the interrogatories) in relation to Dominion legislative authority (under Head 29 of s. 91) in respect of the exceptions defined in Head 10 of s. 92, in their application or possible application to \u201clines\u201d or regular services of aircraft between two provinces; or in their application to such \u201clines\u201d or regular services beyond Canada. S. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, which is a re-enactment of the statute of 1919, and must not be treated as new law, cannot be regarded as having been enacted under s. 132 for the purpose of giving effect to the Convention of that year, because the Convention did not come into force until after the passing of the statute. S. 4 proceeds upon the theory that the Dominion has, independently of s. 132, complete control over the subject of aerial navigation in every respect, and by that section the Minister is given unrestricted authority to regulate and control such navigation in all its aspects, and particularly, in relation to certain matters enumerated by way of example. Parliament herein professes to exercise an authority which it does not possess, and s. 4 is, in its entirety, ultra vires; and consequently, the regulations promulgated under it. Treating, however, interrogatory no. 3 as requiring the court to express its opinion as to the severable matters enumerated in s. 4, as subjects of legislative jurisdiction, and as to the authority of Parliament, in view of the Convention of 1919, or otherwise, to enact s. 4 in relation to such severable matters or any of them, then the answer to interrogatory no. 3 is that, as regards the matters specified above (which are among the severable matters particularized in s. 4) Parliament has jurisdiction under s. 91 or s. 95; as regards identification and inspection of aircraft, and as regards inspection of aerodromes and air stations, Parliament has jurisdiction, in view of the Convention of 1919, under s. 132. While legislation under s. 132, for performing the obligations of Canada under the Convention of 1919, might properly include regulations in relation to registration and certification of aircraft and licensing of personnel and air harbours, if aptly framed to secure the performance of such obligations, and limited to that, the unrestricted powers in relation to such subjects which Parliament professes to exercise by s. 4 are neither \u201cnecessary\u201d nor \u201cproper\u201d for performing those obligations. Answering question no. 4 on a similar assumption, the regulations on the subjects mentioned are not aptly framed for the purpose of performing the obligations under the Convention of 1919. The vice of the principal regulations (speaking generally) is that they are too sweeping in character to fall within the category of legislation \u201cproper or necessary\u201d for performing these obligations. The precise answers to questions 3 and 4 are given in the judgment.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The language of section 132 does not require, either expressly or by necessary implication, nor does it suggest, that a province should thereby suffer diminution of the powers expressed in its enumerations or otherwise conferred, except to admit capacity, on the part of the Dominion, which, in relation to provincial obligations, is no more than concurrent, so long as these are not performed by the province. The case of obligations to be performed for which a province has become bound by treaty to a foreign country, though perhaps difficult to realize, is expressly provided for by section 132; and while, pending provincial non-performance, power is, by that section, conferred upon the Parliament and Government of Canada, the Dominion power cannot be interpreted as meaning to deprive the province of authority to implement its obligations. If that had been the intention it would have been expressed.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014The right of way exercised within a province by a flying machine must, in some manner, be derived from or against the owners of the property traversed, and the power legislatively to sanction such a right of way appertains prima facie to property and civil rights in the province, although it may be overborne by ancillary Dominion powers, where they exist.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014This court ought not to determine under the present procedure question no. 2 which involves the definition of treaty obligations and the ascertainment, judicially, of the interest of foreign sovereign parties to the Convention, who are unrepresented and cannot be convened, especially so, seeing that the interpretation of the Convention is, by its article 37, to be determined by the Permanent Court of International Justice, or, previously to the establishment of that court, by arbitration. The inadvisability of that question being answered should be called to the attention of the Governor General.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The Dominion Parliament may have paramount legislative and executive power for performing the obligations of Canada, or any province thereof, under the Convention, but has not yet found it necessary or proper to exercise such legislative power. If the provinces refuse or neglect to do their share within their legislative ambit with sufficient uniformity to honour the signature of the Dominion, the latter, being compelled to do so, may pass necessary and proper legislation to perform treaty obligations.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014Aviation was not foreseen nor considered when the enumeration of section 91 was made; and the words \u201cProperty and Civil Rights\u201d in section 92 are wide enough to give power to the provinces to legislate, with the required uniformity, to ensure safe and satisfactory regulation of aircraft throughout the Dominion and conform to the new requirements of international law since the sovereignty of each state over the air space above its territory was proclaimed in 1919.\nREFERENCE by the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35.\nThe facts and questions, as stated in the Order in Council, are as follows:\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 27th February, 1929, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that by the Air Board Act, Chapter 11 of the Statutes of Canada, 1919, (1st session), (which, with amendments thereto, is consolidated in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, under the title of The Aeronautics Act, Chapter 3 of the said Revised Statutes), provision was made by the constitution under the authority thereof of a Board on Aeronautics (called the Air Board) and the vesting in the Board of the administrative duties and powers thereby given to it (which duties and powers were by the National Defence Act, 1922, Chapter 34 of the Statutes of Canada, 1922, vested, by way of transfer, in the Minister of National Defence), and by the Air Regulations, 1920, and amendments thereto, approved by the Governor in Council under the authority of the said Act, for the regulation and control in a general and comprehensive way of aerial navigation within Canada and over the territorial waters thereof.\n\u201cThe Minister apprehends that this legislation was enacted by Parliament by reason not only of the expediency of making provision for the regulation of a service essentially important in itself as touching closely the national life and interests, but also of the necessity of making provision for performing the obligations of Canada, as part of the British Empire under the Convention relating to the regulation of Aerial Navigation which, drawn up by a Commission constituted by the Peace Conference at Paris in 1919, was, on 13th October of that year, signed by the representatives of 26 of the Allied and Associated Powers including Canada.\n\u201cThis Convention was ratified by His Majesty on behalf of the British Empire on 1st June, 1922, and is now in force, as the Minister is informed, as between the British Empire and 17 other States.\n\u201cThe Minister observes that the Air Regulations, 1920, conform in essential particulars to the provisions of the said Convention, and are designed to give effect to the stipulations thereof in discharge of the obligations of Canada, as part of the British Empire, towards the other contracting States.\n\u201cThe Minister states that at the conference at Ottawa between representatives of the Dominion and the several Provincial Governments in the month of November, 1927, the representatives of the Province of Quebec raised a question as to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada to sanction regulations for the control of aerial navigation generally within Canada, at all events in their application to flying operations carried on within a Province; and it was agreed that the question so raised was a proper question for the determination of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\u201cThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that Your Excellency may be pleased to refer the following questions to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 35:\u2014\n\u201c1. Have the Parliament and Government of Canada exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the Convention entitled \u2018Convention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation\u2019?\n\u201c2. Is legislation of the Parliament of Canada providing for the regulation and control of aeronautics generally within Canada, including flying operations carried on entirely within the limits of a province, necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the Convention aforementioned, within the meaning of section 132 of the British North America Act, 1867?\n\u201c3. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to enact, in whole or in part, the provisions of section 4 of the Aeronautics Act, chapter 3, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927?\n\u201c4. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to sanction the making and enforcement, in whole or in part of the regulations contained in the Air Regulations, 1920, respecting\u2014\n(\u0430) The granting of certificates or licences authorizing persons to act as pilots, navigators, engineers or inspectors of aircraft and the suspension or revocation of such licences;\n(b) The regulation, identification, inspection, certification, and licensing of all aircraft; and\n(c) The licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations?\u201d\nSection 4 of The Aeronautics Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 3, reads as follows:\n\u201c4. Subject to approval by the Governor in Council, the Minister shall have power to regulate and control aerial navigation over Canada and the territorial waters of Canada, and in particular, but not to restrict the generality of the a foregoing terms of this section, he may, with the approval aforesaid, make regulations with respect to\n(a) licensing pilots and other persons engaged in the navigation of aircraft, and the suspension and revocation of such licences;\n(b) the registration, identification, inspection, certification and licensing of all aircraft;\n(c) the licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air-stations;\n(d) the conditions under which aircraft may be used for carrying goods, mails and passengers, or for the operation of any commercial service whatsoever and the licensing of any such services; (e) the conditions under which goods, mails and passengers may be imported and exported in aircraft into or from Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada, or may be transported over any part of such territory;\n(f) the prohibition of navigation of aircraft over such areas as may be prescribed, either at all times or at such times or on such occasions only as may be specified in the regulation, and either absolutely or subject to such exceptions or conditions as may be so specified;\n(g) the areas within which aircraft coming from any places outside of Canada are to land, and the conditions to be complied with by any such aircraft;\n(h) aerial routes, their use and control;\n(i) the institution and enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe and proper navigation of aircraft in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada; and\n(j) organization, discipline, efficiency and good government generally of the officers and men employed in the Air Force.\n2. Any person guilty of violating the provisions of any such regulation shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to both fine and imprisonment.\n3. All regulations enacted under the provisions of this Act shall be published in the Canada Gazette, and, upon being so published, shall have the same force in law as if they formed part of this Act.\n4. Such regulations shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within ten days after the publication thereof if Parliament is sitting, and if Parliament is not sitting, then within ten days after the next meeting thereof. 1919, c. 11, s. 4; 1922, c. 34, s. 7.\nThe Air Regulations of 1920, which are referred to in the judgments now reported, are the following:\n3. (1) Except aircraft flown only for the purpose of experiment or test within three miles of an airharbour, kites and fixed balloons, no aircraft shall fly unless it has been registered as herein provided. See I.C., Art. 6.\n(2) This paragraph does not apply to aircraft duly registered in some other state or a foreign country with which Canada has made a Convention relating to interstate flying. (Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n4. Subject as hereinafter provided, the Air Board may define the conditions under which, and the mode in which aircraft may be primarily registered in Canada. New.\n5. No aircraft shall be primarily registered in Canada unless it belongs wholly to a British subject or British subjects, or to a company which has been incorporated in His Majesty\u2019s Dominions, and of which the president or chairman and at least two-thirds of the directors are British subjects. See I.C., Art. 7.\n6. No aircraft shall be primarily registered in Canada while it is so registered in any other of His Majesty\u2019s dominions, or in any foreign country, but it may be primarily registered in Canada upon cancellation of an earlier registration in such other Dominion or foreign country. See I.C., Art. 8.\n7. No aircraft shall be primarily registered in Canada unless either it has been built or made in Canada or any customs duties which are or would become payable upon the importation of the aircraft into Canada have been paid. New.\n8. (1) Upon every registration in Canada the Minister of National Defence shall assign to the registered aircraft a registration mark and shall grant a certificate of registration for which there shall be payable a fee of $5.\n(2) In the event of any change in the ownership of an aircraft registered in Canada, then\n(a) The registered owner shall forthwith notify the Department of National Defence, and\n(b) The registration and certificate thereof shall lapse as from the date of such change of ownership. (Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n9. When a registered aircraft has been destroyed or permanently withdrawn from use, the registered owner shall as soon as possible notify the Department of National Defence accordingly, and the registration and the certificate thereof shall lapse as from the date of such notification.\n(2) Certificates of registration shall not remain valid unless endorsed by the Minister of National Defence at intervals not exceeding twelve calendar months. (Amendment dated January 15, 1924.)\n10. It shall be a condition of the primary registration in Canada of any aircraft that, upon the Governor in Council declaring that a national emergency exists or is immediately apprehended, every such aircraft shall be subject to requisition in the name of His Majesty by the Air Board or any officer of the Canadian Air Force, and upon being so requisitioned shall become the property of His Majesty, subject to its return or to the payment of compensation or to both as may be provided by law. New.\n(2) The registration in Canada of any aircraft primarily registered in any of His Majesty\u2019s dominions other than Canada shall be subject to the like condition unless, under the law of that one of His Majesty\u2019s dominions in which the aircraft was primarily registered, it is subject to a paramount right to be requisitioned on His Majesty\u2019s behalf. New.\n11. Any certificate of registration of an aircraft may be suspended or cancelled at any time by the Air Board for cause. New.\n12. (1) No aircraft registered in Canada shall fly beyond Canada unless it has been certified as airworthy by the Department of National Defence.\n(2) Except private aircraft flying wholly within Canada, all aircraft registered in Canada shall be certified as airworthy by the Department of National Defence.\n(3) Every aircraft entering Canada from abroad shall be in possession of a certificate of airworthiness issued by the proper authority of the foreign country or of the Dominion, Colony or Possession of His Majesty in which it is registered. (Amendment dated January 15, 1924.)\n15. No aircraft required to be registered shall fly unless it bears the prescribed nationality and registration marks. See I.C., Art. 10. 16. In the case of an aircraft primarily registered in Canada the nationality mark shall be the letter \u201cG\u201d and the registration mark the assigned combination of four capital letters commencing with the letter \u201cC.\u201d The marks shall be painted in black on a white ground in the following manner:\u2014\n(\u0430) On flying machines the marks shall be painted once on the lower surface of the lower main planes and once on the upper surface of the top main planes, the top of the letters to be towards the leading edge. They shall also be painted along each side of the fuselage between the main planes and the tail planes. In case the machine is not provided with a fuselage the marks shall be painted on the nacelle.\n(b) On airships the marks shall be painted near the maximum cross section on both sides so as to be visible both from the sides and from the ground and on the upper surface equidistant from the letters on the sides.\n(c) On balloons the marks shall be painted on two sides near the maximum cross section so as to be visible both from the sides and ground, and on the upper surface equidistant from the marks on the sides.\n(d) On flying machines and airships the nationality mark shall also be painted on the right and left sides of the lower surface of the lowest tail planes or elevators and also on the upper surface of the top tail planes or elevators, whichever are the larger. It shall also be painted on both sides, of the rudder or on the outer sides of the outer rudders if more than one rudder is fitted.\n(e) On balloons the nationality mark shall also be painted on the basket.\n(f) The nationality and registration marks need in no case exceed eight feet in height, but subject to this provision shall be as hereafter specified.\n(g) On flying machines the height of the marks on the main planes and tail planes respectively shall be equal to four-fifths of the chord, and in the case of the rudder shall be as large as possible. The height of the marks on the fuselage or nacelle shall be four-fifths of the depth of the narrowest part of that portion of the fuselage or nacelle on which the marks are painted.\n(h) On airships the nationality marks painted on the tail plane shall be equal in height to four-fifths of the chord of the tail plane and on the rudder the marks shall be as large as possible. The height of the other marks shall be equal at least to one-twelfth of the circumference at the maximum transverse cross section of the airship. On balloons the height of the nationality mark on the basket shall be four-fifths of the height of the basket, and the height of the other marks shall be equal to at least one-twelfth of the circumference of the balloon.\n(i) The width of the letters shall be two-thirds of their height and the thickness shall be one-sixth of their height. The letters shall be painted in plain block type and shall be uniform in shape and size. A space equal to half the width of the letters shall be left between the letters.\n(j) Except in state and commercial aircraft, the nationality and registration marks shall be underlined with a black line. The thickness of the line shall be equal to the thickness of the letter and the space between the bottom of the letters and the line shall be equal to the thickness of the line.\n(k) Where the nationality and registration marks appear together, a hyphen of a length equal to the width of one of the letters shall be painted between the nationality mark and registration mark.\n(l) The nationality and registration marks shall be displayed to the best possible advantage, taking into consideration the constructional features of the aircraft. The marks must be kept clean and visible. See I.C., Annex A.\n17. All aircraft, except kites, shall carry affixed to the car or to the fuselage in a prominent position a metal plate inscribed with the names and residences of the owners and the nationality and registration marks of the aircraft. See I.C., Annex A, I (d).\n18. No place, building, or work shall be used as an airharbour unless it has been licensed as herein provided. New.\n19. Licences to airharbours may be issued by the Air Board and may be made subject to such conditions respecting the aircraft which may make use of the airharbour, the maintenance thereof, the marking of obstacles in the vicinity which may be dangerous to flying and otherwise, as the Air Board may direct. New.\n21. The licence of an airharbour may be suspended or cancelled by the Air Board at any time for cause and shall cease to be valid two weeks after any change in the ownership of the airharbour, unless sooner renewed to the new owner. New.\n22. Every licensed airharbour shall be marked by day and by night as may be from time to time directed by the Air Board. See I.C., Annex F, II.\n23. The owner of any licensed airharbour shall be permitted to charge for the use of the harbour or for any services performed only such fees as have been approved by the Air Board for such airharbour. The tariff shall be prominently posted up at the airharbour. New.\n24. (1) No person shall without authority of the Air Board\u2014\n(\u0430) mark any unlicensed surface or place with any mark or display any signal calculated or likely to induce any person to believe that such surface or place is an airharbour or emergency alighting ground;\n(b) knowingly use or permit the use as an airharbour of any unlicensed place;\n(c) knowingly use or permit the use of an airharbour for any purposes other than those for which it has been licensed.\n(2) The onus of proving the existence of any authority or licence shall be upon the person charged. New.\n25. No water-craft shall cross or go upon that part of the water area forming part of any seaplane station which it is necessary to keep clear of obstruction in order that flying machines may take off and alight in safety, having regard to the wind and weather conditions at the time, and every person in charge of a watercraft is guilty of a breach of these regulations if such craft crosses or goes upon such area after reasonable warning by signal or otherwise. New. 26. There shall be kept at every licensed airharbour a register in which there shall be entered immediately after the alighting or taking off of an aircraft a record showing the nationality and registration marks of such aircraft, the name of the pilot and the hour of such alighting or taking off. New.\n27. (1) Every licensed airharbour, and all aircraft and the goods therein shall be open to the inspection of any customs or immigration officer or any officer of or other person authorized by the Air Board, but no building used exclusively for purposes relating to the construction of aircraft or aircraft equipment shall be subject to inspection except upon the special written order of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Air Board. New.\n(2) All state aircraft shall have at all reasonable times, the right of access to any licensed airharbour, subject to the conditions of the licence.\n(Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n28. It shall be a condition of every licence to any airharbour that in case the Governor in Council declares that a national emergency exists or is immediately apprehended, the owner of such airharbour shall comply with such directions, if any, with respect to the use of the airharbour as may be given by the Air Board or an officer of the Canadian Air Force, subject only to the payment of such compensation as may be provided by law. New.\n29. At every licensed airharbour the direction of the wind shall be clearly indicated by one or more of the recognized methods, e.g., alighting tee, conical streamer, smudge fire, etc. See I.C., Annex D, 40.\n30. At every licensed aerodrome and seaplane station, if an aircraft about to land or leave finds it necessary to make a circuit or partial circuit, such circuit or partial circuit shall, except in case of distress, be left-handed (anti-clockwise),\n(Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n31. At every aerodrome and seaplane station licensed for use by the public at night there shall at night be exhibited a red light to indicate a left-hand circuit or a green light to indicate a right-hand circuit. See I.C., Annex D., 46 (a).\n32. Every licensed aerodrome shall be considered to consist of three zones when looking up-wind. The right-hand zone shall be the taking-off zone and the left-hand shall be the alighting zone. Between these two there shall be a neutral zone. If the centre of the aerodrome is marked, the taking-off and alighting zones shall commence fifty yards to the right and left respectively of the centre of such mark. I.C., Annex D, 44.\n33. No person shall act as pilot of any aircraft or as navigator, engineer or inspector of any commercial aircraft, or of any aircraft primarily registered in Canada when flying outside Canada unless such person holds a certificate issued by the Air Board authorizing him to so act. See I.C.. Art. 12.\n(2) This paragraph shall not apply,\u2014\n(a) to persons under instruction flying over water or, with the consent of the owner or owners, over an airharbour and such additional surrounding area as is approved by the Air Board, or (b) to pilots, navigators and engineers of aircraft registered in another contracting state, or a foreign country with which Canada has made a convention relating to interstate flying, who hold licences authorizing them to act as such, issued by the proper authority in the contracting state or foreign country in which the aircraft is registered.\n(Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n34. (1) Certificates to pilots, navigators and engineers may be issued by the Air Board and may be limited in time and to flying only under specified conditions, for specified purposes, in specified types of aircraft, on specified routes or otherwise. New.\n(2) Licences issued by a duly competent authority within His Majesty\u2019s Dominions, Colonies or Possessions, to a pilot, navigator, or engineer shall for the purpose of these regulations have the same validity and effect as if they had been issued under these Regulations. (Amendment dated Jan. 15, 1924.)\n35. Certificates to inspectors may be issued by the Air Board and may be limited in time, to specified types of aircraft, or otherwise. New.\n36. A fee not exceeding $5 may be charged for any certificate issued under this Part IV. New.\n37. No person who is not a British subject or a subject of a foreign country which grants reciprocal aeronautical privileges to Canadians on equal terms and conditions with subjects of such foreign country shall be issued with a certificate authorizing him to act as pilot, navigator, engineer or inspector of commercial or state aircraft.\n38. A certificate issued to any pilot, navigator, engineer or inspector may be suspended or cancelled at any time by the Air Board for cause, including the failure to comply beyond Canada with the provisions of Parts V, VI, VII and VIII of these regulations. New.\n116. Every aircraft carrying five persons or more and bound on a flight by night, or on a continuous flight overland between two points more than 300 miles apart, or on a flight over sea between two points more than 125 miles apart, shall have on board a person holding a navigator\u2019s certificate. See I.C., Annex E, IV.\n118. Every aircraft in flight shall have on board its certificate of registration, the certificate of airworthiness, if any, the licences of all the members of the crew requiring licences, the authority and licence for the equipment and working of the wireless installation, if any, and a journey log book containing the following particulars:\u2014\n(\u0430) The category to which the aircraft belongs; its nationality and registration marks; the full name, nationality and residence of the owner; the name of the maker, the description and the carrying capacity of the aircraft.\n(b) In addition for each journey:\u2014\n(i) A record of all signals and wireless communications and observations concerning navigation;\n(ii) The names, nationality and residence of the pilot and of each of the members of the crew;\n(iii) The place, date and hour of departure, the route followed, and all incidents of the journey, including a lightings.

Chrysler K.C. for the Attorney-General of Manitoba.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinions of my brothers Newcombe, Smith and Cannon.\nBy s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), this court is required to \u201chear and consider\u201d\nImportant questions of law or fact touching\n(a) the interpretation of the British North America Acts, or\n(b) the constitutionality or interpretation of any Dominion or provincial legislation; or\n(d) the powers of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislatures of the provinces, or of the respective governments thereof, whether or not the particular power in question has been or is proposed to be exercised; or\n(e) any other matter, whether or not in the opinion of the court ejusdem generis with the foregoing enumerations, with reference to which the Governor in Council sees fit to submit any such question;\n* * * and any question touching any of the matters aforesaid, so referred by the Governor in Council, shall be conclusively deemed to be an important question * * *;\nand it is declared to be\nthe duty of the Court * * * to answer each question so referred; and the Court shall certify to the Governor in Council, for his information, its opinion upon each such question, with the reasons for each such answer; * * * Lord Chancellor Haldane, in the British Columbia Fisheries Case, Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada[1], contrasting the position of this court with that of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, trenchantly observed that\nThe business of the Supreme Court of Canada is to do what is laid down as its duty by the Dominion Parliament.\nWhile I agree with Mr. Justice Newcombe that the advisability of propounding for the consideration of the court abstract questions, or questions involving considerations of debatable fact, is, to say the least, doubtful; that it is undesirable that the court should be called upon to express opinions which may affect the rights of persons not represented before it, or touching matters of such a nature that its answers must be wholly ineffectual in regard to parties that are not, and cannot be, brought before it (e.g., foreign governments); and that, where the court is asked to hear and determine any such question, it is entirely proper for it to represent to the Governor in Council the undesirability of its being called upon to do so (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[2], in the present instance I do not find in the questions submitted enough that is objectionable to justify the adoption of that course. On the contrary, as I understand the questions, they can be, at least partially, answered without going beyond the clear jurisdiction of the court or expressing an opinion upon any debatable matter affecting foreign governments. So far as concerns the interests of private parties in the several provinces, the questions submitted touch them only obliquely, inasmuch as they are directed to the respective legislative powers of the Dominion and the provinces. Such private interests are probably sufficiently represented by counsel for the several provinces concerned; but, if not, by subs. 4 of s. 55, the court is empowered to direct notice to any persons interested, or, where there is a class of persons interested, to nominate one or more persons as representatives thereof, and, by subs. 5, it may, in its discretion request any counsel to argue the case as to any interest which is affected and as to which counsel does not appear. I am, accordingly, unable to accept the view that there is here such absence, or non-representation, of parties interested as would justify our declining to answer the questions submitted.\nAs I read the opinions of my three learned brothers, they all agree that \u201cthe Convention relating to the regulations of Aerial Navigation,\u201d dated the 13th of October, 1919, is \u201ca treaty between the Empire and foreign countries,\u201d within the meaning of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. They are also in accord in regarding intra-provincial aviation as, prima facie, a matter of provincial legislative jurisdiction and as falling within the purview of s. 92 (13) of the B.N.A. Act; and I share those views.\nWhen it comes, however, to the question of how far, and under what circumstances, Dominion legislative power supersedes that of the provinces in regard to aviation, my learned brothers differ, toto coelo. While Newcombe and Cannon JJ. recognize the power of Parliament, under s. 132, to legislate\n* * * for (the) performing (of) the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries,\nthey are not prepared to admit that that power involves or implies the supersession of provincial by Dominion legislation under the circumstances of the case now before us.\nMy brother Smith, while of the opinion that the power of Parliament, under s. 132, is not \u201cexclusive\u201d, but merely \u201cparamount\u201d (so far Cannon J. agrees), holds the view that the circumstances of the present case, as disclosed in the record, justify its exercise regardless of any provincial legislation, existing, or proposed, or possible. My brother Cannon, on the other hand, thinks that, in regard to matters of provincial legislative competence, the power conferred on Parliament by s. 132 arises only in the absence of adequate provincial legislation, and that Parliament may not anticipate failure or refusal on the part of any province to pass \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d legislation for performing its obligations under the treaty, or that identic legislation (and regulations) will not be enacted by the legislatures of the several provinces interested. Mr. Justice Newcombe, I understand, shares the views of my brother Cannon in this regard. My brother Newcombe, as I read his judgment, is further of the opinion that questions nos. 1 and 2 cannot be answered without first ascertaining in detail the precise obligations imposed by the treaty on Canada, or any of its provinces, and that this court should not be called upon to answer these questions because of the fact that the other contracting parties, viz., the foreign governments concerned, are not before it. If I found it necessary to interpret in detail the entire Convention, I would be disposed to accept my brother Newcombe\u2019s view; but, in my opinion, it is necessary only to envisage the Convention as a whole, to ascertain its general tenor and to discern its obvious purpose and to determine a very few of the outstanding obligations imposed by it in terms so clear that their meaning admits of no dispute, and, therefore, does not require interpretation.\nWith regard to the power of Parliament to implement any term of a treaty, it is entirely competent to, and, indeed, it is the duty of this court, explicitly imposed by s. 55 (d) of the Supreme Court Act, to advise the Government of Canada, if duly called upon to do so, as to the meaning and effect of such treaty and as to the right of Parliament to enact legislation necessary to carry it out, whether or not the government proposes to legislate in regard thereto.\nI agree with the view taken by my brother Smith as to the obligations of Canada (and its several provinces) created by the treaty in question, so far as he has found it necessary to define them, and with his conclusion as to the powers of Parliament under s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act with respect thereto.\nThe first question submitted, it will be noted, is framed almost in the language of s. 132, although it omits some significant phrases thereof and inserts words which may be regarded as important. For instance, the word \u201cexclusive\u201d is inserted. The word \u201cexclusive\u201d is not found in the section. Again, for the words \u201call powers necessary or proper\u201d are substituted the words \u201clegislative and executive authority\u201d; the words of the section \u201cas part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries\u201d are omitted; and for the words of the section \u201carising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries\u201d are substituted the words \u201cunder the Convention entitled \u2018Convention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation\u2019\u201d.\nIt will be perceived that the word \u201cexclusive\u201d appears to introduce an idea quite foreign to s. 132 and not warranted by anything which that section contains. I agree with the view of my brother Smith that, if the question is to be answered in the affirmative, the word \u201cparamount\u201d must be substituted for \u201cexclusive\u201d. It might also be better to insert the words \u201cas part of the British Empire, towards Foreign Countries\u201d immediately after the word \u201cthereof\u201d, so as definitely to limit the question and answer to the very matter dealt with by s. 132.\nI fail to appreciate my brother Newcombe\u2019s difficulties in regard to the meaning and scope of question no. 2, and as to the right and duty of this court to hear and consider it and to express its opinion to the best of its ability upon the matter thereby submitted to it. While the Judicial Committee is, no doubt, in a position, as it did in the British Columbia Fisheries Case,[3] to decline to answer questions which it thinks cannot conveniently be dealt with, this court has no such discretion. As to it, the statute is imperative.\nQuestion no. 2 is distinctly directed to the validity of legislation of the character described, under the authority of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act. The general application of the maxim audi alteram partem is beyond dispute. But, in a question of legislative power as between the Dominion and its provinces, submitted to the court by the Governor General in Council, the provinces are \u201cthe other party\u201d\u2014and they have been heard. As pointed out by my brother Smith, s. 37 of the Convention provides for the adjudication of disputes between contracting parties to it as to its interpretation. Nothing which this court may do in the present reference can affect any such matter.\nMy three brothers are also in accord with regard to the legislative control of Parliament over aircraft and aerial navigation in connection with various matters assigned by s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act to the Dominion, such as military and naval service, defence, postal service, customs, aliens, regulation of trade and commerce, etc. How far the exercise of powers necessarily incidental to such control may be made effectual, without regulating and controlling aeronautics generally, is, to say the least, questionable; but question no. 2, as I read it, is not directed to that aspect of the case, but rather to the bearing of s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act upon Dominion legislative jurisdiction. In this connection, my brother Newcombe very properly observes that\nDominion powers derived from s. 132 should be liberally interpreted to include all such as are necessary or proper for achieving the purposes defined * * * irrespective of the question as to where the power would have resided if s. 132 had not been enacted.\nMy brother Smith also agrees with Newcombe and Cannon JJ. in holding that the control of aeronautics in no sense comes within the subject of \u201cNavigation and Shipping\u201d assigned by s. 91 (10) of the B.N.A. Act to the Dominion. In that view I entirely concur.\nWhile it is quite true that the Dominion Act of 1919 antedated the Convention under consideration, and, consequently, cannot be regarded as having been enacted by Parliament in the exercise of its jurisdiction conferred by s. 132 as legislation\nnecessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries\nunder that Convention, as Mr. Justice Cannon points out, the statute which we have to consider, is not the Act of 1919, but c. 3 of R.S.C., 1927, which became law on the 1st of February, 1928, long after the date of the Convention. So far as this legislation implements the Conventional obligations its validity may probably be upheld under s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act.\nI understand Mr. Justice Cannon to concur in the view of Mr. Justice Smith that\nParliament and the Government of Canada have paramount, though not exclusive, jurisdiction to legislate for the performance of all treaty obligations of Canada or any province thereof under the Convention.\nMr. Justice Cannon, however, adds that\nParliament has not yet found it necessary or proper to exercise this legislative power.\nWith deference, J can hardly accede to this latter view.\nDealing with s. 4 as giving to the Minister single and complete control over aerial navigation throughout Canada and the territorial waters of Canada in all respects, followed by enumeration of certain matters by way of illustration merely, such enumeration being preceded by the words \u201cand in particular, but not to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section,\u201d I would answer question no. 3 in the negative. But, I agree with my brothers Smith and Newcombe that it is scarcely possible fully to answer question no. 3 if it requires consideration in detail of each enumerated subhead under subs. 4. The regulations adopted by the Governor General in Council, under the provisions of s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 3) are so general and comprehensive in their terms that it would require minute and meticulous consideration of each of them before deciding whether or not it is necessary or proper in order to implement some treaty obligation within s. 132 of the B.N.A. Act, or may be defended as an exercise of power necessarily incidental to some one of the enumerated heads of Dominion legislative jurisdiction under s. 91. I cannot, however, think that it was intended by question no. 3 to involve the court in such a detailed and minute examination of each particular regulation enacted under s. 4\u2014still less of the possibilities under all the subheads of s. 4. Adequate argument was not directed to such details either of the section or of the regulations. I, therefore, refrain from further discussion of these matters.\nAs has been stated, legislative jurisdiction over intraprovincial flying\u2014and there must be a great deal of it\u2014prima facie belongs to the provinces under s. 92 (13), and it is only where legislation by the Dominion can be justified, either as falling directly within an enumerated head under s. 91, or as necessarily incidental to such a head, or in so far as the subject of aeronautics can be said to be of such Dominion-wide importance that provincial legislative jurisdiction over it may be regarded as ousted, or because it falls within the purview of s. 132, that such Dominion legislation can be held valid.\nIn order to avoid possible misapprehension, I should, perhaps, add that, in so far as the questions submitted are directed to legislative capacity of the Dominion Parliament, I am not satisfied that the establishment and maintenance of a line of aircraft covering an international or interprovincial route is not an \u201cundertaking\u201d within the meaning of subs. 10 (a) of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. Moreover, it is possible that although lines of air transportation are not physical works, the construction, maintenance and operation of flying machines may be regarded as \u201cworks\u201d within the meaning of clause (c) of subs. 10 of s. 92. That aspect of the case, however, was not fully dealt with at bar, and, therefore, I do not give it further consideration.\nAs to question no. 4, I agree with the views thereon expressed by my brother Smith.\nI certify the foregoing to be my opinion (and reasons therefor) upon the four questions herein submitted for hearing and consideration of the Court by His Excellency the Governor in Council.\nThe answers of Mr. Justice Duff (concurred in by Rinfret and Lamont JJ.) to the interrogatories submitted.\nQuestion 1\nTo question 1, the answer is in the negative.\nQuestion 2\nTo question 2, construing the word \u201cgenerally\u201d as meaning \u201cin every respect\u201d, the answer is in the negative.\nQuestion 3\nReading section 4, as I think it ought to be read, as conferring a single indivisible authority to regulate and control, in every respect, aerial navigation over Canada, with an enumeration by way of illustration of particular matters falling within this authority, the answer to question 3 is in the negative.\nAssuming, on the other hand, as some of my brethren think, that the question requires us to consider the matters mentioned in the enumerated sub-heads as severable fields for the operation of the power, and the section as comprising distinct enactments, in relation to each of these severable matters, enacted in view of the Convention relating to aerial navigation, 1919, the answer to question 3 is partly in the negative and partly in the affirmative.\nIn relation to the matters mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a), (h) and (i), such enactments would be invalid.\nIn relation to the matters within sub-paragraph (b) such enactments would be valid in respect of \u201cidentification\u201d and \u201cinspection\u201d, and in other respects invalid. In relation to the matters within sub-paragraph (c) such enactments would be valid as respects \u201cinspection\u201d and in other respects invalid.\nIn relation to the matters within sub-paragraph (d) such enactments would be valid as respects the subject the carriage of mails, in other respects invalid.\nIn relation to the matters within sub-paragraph (e) such enactments would be valid in so far as concerns\nthe conditions under which goods, mails and passengers may be imported and exported in aircraft into or from Canada, or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada;\nand in so far as concerns the second part,\nthe conditions under which goods, mails and passengers * * * may be transported over any part of such territory,\nsuch enactments would, in relation to the subject the transport of mails, be valid, but in relation to other matters, invalid.\nIn relation to the matters within sub-paragraphs (f), (g) and (j), the enactments would be valid.\nQuestion 4\nTreating this question on the assumption that it requires us to consider whether the regulations referred to, or any of them, (and, if so, which) are susceptible of legislative sanction under section 132 (in view of the Convention of 1919) or under any other power vested in the Dominion Parliament, the answers are as follows:\nSub-paragraph (a).\nThe regulations which deal specifically with the subjects mentioned in this paragraph are those numbered 33 to 38.\nRegulation 33 would be valid in so far as it relates to flying outside Canada; but invalid in so far as it relates to commercial aircraft generally. Regulations 34 to 38, inclusive, are subsidiary regulations and would be valid if associated with a valid principal regulation.\nRegulations 116 and 118 are also subsidiary regulations as to which the answer is the same.\nSub-paragraph (b).\nRegulations 3, 4, 124 (2) and 10 would be invalid. Regulations 5 and 6 would be valid. Regulations 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16 and 17 are subsidiary regulations which would be valid if associated with a valid principal regulation. Subsections 1 and 3 of regulation 12 would be valid, and subsection 2 of that regulation invalid.\nSub-paragraph (c).\nRegulations 18 to 32 deal specifically and substantively with the licensing, inspection, and in some respects with the regulation, of air harbours. The principal provisions are regulations 18, 19, 22, 23 and 24. These regulations would be invalid. Regulations 21 and 26 are subsidiary regulations, which would be valid if attached to a valid principal regulation. Regulations 25 and 29 to 32, inclusive, would be valid. Regulation 27 (1), dealing with inspection of air harbours and construction buildings would be valid. Subsection 2 of regulation 27 would be invalid. Regulation 28 would be invalid.\nThe judgment of Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The view presented by the Solicitor General of the questions raised by the interrogatories, which it is our duty to answer, was based primarily upon the proposition that the Dominion possesses authority to legislate upon the subject of aeronautics, in every respect, and that this authority is exclusive, or, at all events, over-rides any law of a province.\nThis proposition is supported upon a variety of grounds. It is contended that, in their very nature, the matters embraced within that subject cannot be local, in the provincial sense, and that accordingly the subject is beyond the ambit of section 92; that, in the alternative, it falls within one of the enumerated heads of 91, no. 10 Navigation and Shipping; that, as a sort of further alternative, so many aspects and incidents of the subject fall within various enumerated heads of section 91, such as the regulation of trade and commerce, undertakings extending beyond the limits of a province, customs, aliens, beacons and lighthouses, postal service, defence, ferries, or under immigration (s. 95), that the subject must as a whole be treated as within Dominion jurisdiction, that being, it is argued, the only interpretation under which the undoubted authority of the Dominion over the various aspects of the subject can be effectively exercised. Still again, it is said, the authority of the Dominion under section 132, to legislate for the performance of its obligations under the Convention relating to Aerial Navigation, 1919, extends over the whole field.\nI am unable to agree that \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d would, \u201caccording to the common understanding of men,\u201d embrace the subject of aeronautics. Nor can I agree that aerial navigation as a subject for legislation is outside the purview of s. 92 of the British North America Act, as not comprising matters which are provincial within the contemplation of that section. The provincial jurisdiction under heads 10 to 16 extends through the air space above, as well as the soil below; and the control of the province over its own property is as extensive in the case of aerodromes and aircraft as in the case of garages and automobiles. The employment of aircraft for survey, exploration, inspection and patrolling, in the management of the public domain, for police purposes, and in the interests of public health (head 7), is as strictly a provincial matter as the employment of any other local agency for such purposes. Primarily the matters embraced within the subject of aerial navigation fall within section 92.\nThe argument that because the Dominion has authority to legislate in relation to this subject, in several, it may be many, aspects, it therefore has authority to appropriate the whole subject to itself, is one which in various forms has been often advanced; and always rejected. It really amounts to this, that it would have been simpler and more convenient if the subject had in terms been committed to exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. As for section 132, the provisions of the Aeronautics Act, and the regulations thereunder, must be considered in relation to the undertakings embodied in the Convention for the purpose of testing the Dominion contention.\nSection 4 of the Aeronautics Act confers upon the Minister a single, indivisible authority to regulate and control aerial navigation in Canada. What I have just said will indicate my reasons for the conclusion that it is not competent for the Dominion to exercise or authorize the Minister to exercise such a comprehensive control over that subject. In my own view, that is sufficient to dispose of question 3. But it is thought by some of my colleagues that each of the sub-paragraphs of section 4 may be treated as comprising severable fields of legislation, and that the section may be considered as involving distinct enactments in the terms of the principal clause applying to each of the severable matters therein comprised; and that by the question we are directed to say to what extent the Dominion might now authorize the Minister to exercise unrestricted control over these several matters under the powers conferred by section 132 (in view of the Convention of 1919) or under any other powers vested in the Dominion Parliament.\nThe section was originally enacted before the Convention came into effect and could not therefore be treated as passed in execution of any power under section 132. As reproduced in the Revised Statutes, 1927, it does not take effect as the re-enactment of a new law, and to the extent to which it was invalid in 1919, it is invalid to-day. Nevertheless some of my brethren think it is our duty to examine the sub-clauses of section 4 with a view to ascertaining to what extent the section, if enacted to-day, and with reference to the Convention of 1919, could take effect as law.\nWhile I do not agree that this course is in conformity with the purport of the question, the point is not free from doubt, and therefore I shall proceed to discuss the questions raised by the interrogatory when so interpreted.\nIt will be convenient to consider, first of all, some of the matters of primary importance embraced within the subparagraphs of section 4. The most important of all are those falling within sub-paragraphs (a) (b) and (c). An unrestricted power of regulation and control is conferred upon the Minister. Such a sweeping authority in relation to the matters within these sub-paragraphs could be derived from no section or sections of the British North America Act other than section 132; and it is necessary therefore to consider whether, under that section, Parliament possesses such authority in itself, or can invest the Minister with it, in consequence of the obligations undertaken by the Dominion under the Convention.\nThe question in concrete form is whether the power to give the force of law to section 4 in relation to such matters is a power necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada under the Convention.\nOne observation should be made here. The powers under that section are given for performing (in the concrete case before us) the obligations under the Convention; and, in this connection, can be validly exercised only in the performance of, and for the purpose of performing, these obligations.\nThe subject of paragraph (a) is the licensing of personnel, which is dealt with by article 12 of the Convention. Under article 12, when read with Annex E, the obligation of each of the contracting states is to enforce in respect to certificates and licences, the conditions set forth in Annex E as regards international traffic, and, as regards domestic traffic, to enforce such conditions, not more stringent than those stated in Annex E, as the contracting state may deem adequate to ensure the safety of air traffic. No argument seems to be needed to shew that for performing that obligation the Dominion does not require an unrestricted authority to regulate and control the licensing of personnel in all respects; which would include power to select licensees upon some principle having no relation to the safety of air traffic, or indeed, to any of the conditions laid down in Annex E.\nIt is convenient to refer to regulation 33, which seems broadly to require a certificate from the Air Board to entitle anybody to act as pilot, engineer or inspector of any commercial aircraft, or of any Canadian aircraft flying outside Canada. It would be inadmissible to suppose that regulations 33 to 38 contemplate the issue, upon demand, of a certificate to any applicant; and indeed the enactment of regulations to that effect would constitute a grave departure from the requirements of Annex E.\nThe regulations appear to leave the conditions upon which licences may be granted to the unlimited discretion of the Air Board, which conditions might be framed without any reference to article 12 or Annex E. Clearly regulations 33 to 38 on any construction of them, could not be validly sanctioned under the powers given under section 132 to legislate for the performance of the obligations mentioned. Sub-paragraph (b) of section 4 deals with registration, identification, inspection, certification and licensing of aircraft. Let us first consider registration. There is an implied duty to provide for registration in accordance with the provisions of section 1 (c) of Annex A of the Convention. The main purpose of registration under the provisions of the Convention is to provide facilities for identification. There is no duty, arising out of these provisions, to impose conditions other than those indicated in the Annex. There is nothing in that part of the Convention requiring legislation in the terms of section 4, or in the terms of regulations 3 and 4, the effect of which is, that aircraft may be registered only on compliance with the conditions defined by the Air Board, and that registration is a condition of the right to fly. These regulations as they stand could not be validly sanctioned under section 132.\nAs to certification and licensing of aircraft, the Convention imposes no duty as to such certificates, except in relation to international navigation. No duty arises out of the Convention which would enable the Dominion to sanction the sweeping enactment of section 4 in relation to the certification and licensing. Regulation 12 (2) seems to require a certificate of air worthiness in respect of commercial aircraft and provincial aircraft registered in Canada. By regulation 13, such certificates may be issued upon compliance with specified conditions. In the result, such aircraft may not be registered, and consequently will not be permitted to fly, unless certified as air worthy upon conditions prescribed by the Air Board. These regulations are rather obscurely worded, but this seems to be the practical effect of them. There is no obligation, under the Convention, that is to say, no express obligation, to require such certification as a condition of domestic flying, and it is difficult to discover on what ground the condition imposed by these regulations, which affects all commercial aircraft flying in Canada, and all provincial aircraft, can be justified. The regulation as it stands would not be a valid one.\nSub-paragraph (c) deals with the licensing, inspecting and regulation of aerodromes and air-stations. No obligation arises under the Convention, which requires, for the performance of it, the unrestricted power of regulation in relation to these subjects given by section 4. In truth, the only undertakings on the subject of aerodromes and air-stations in the body of the Convention are undertakings against discrimination and as to places fixed for the landing of foreign aircraft; while certain duties respecting aerodromes arise out of the rules in Annex D. But there is no obligation under the Convention, the performance of which would require the enactment of sub-paragraph (c) or of regulations 18 and 19.\nIt seems to be sufficiently clear that neither subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 4 which were enacted before the Convention were concluded, nor the regulations made under that section were framed with a view to providing for the performance of obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by Canada in the Convention. They appear to be framed on the theory, which the Dominion now supports as the true view, that the Dominion Parliament possesses authority to control aerial navigation in all respects. The result is that we have regulations which are framed too broadly to go into effect under section 132 of the British North America Act; but although these enactments and regulations could not now be validly sanctioned under the powers conferred by section 132, it does not follow that the Dominion may not exercise under that section very considerable powers of regulation in respect to the matters enumerated in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 4. Indeed there seems to be no room for doubt that for the purpose of procuring the observance of its valid regulations, regulations, that is to say, framed for the purpose of securing the observance of its undertakings under the Convention and regulations put into force under the powers arising under section 91, the objects aimed at by the regulations of 1919 could be very largely, if not entirely, accomplished. For example, article 25 of the Convention imposes upon the Dominion a duty to take measures to insure the observance of the regulations contained in Annex D, and the prosecution and punishment of persons contravening these regulations. I can see no reason to doubt, if the Dominion considered it a suitable measure for implementing its obligations under article 25 to require, as a condition of registration, that aircraft should in design and otherwise be adapted and equipped for the observance of the rules laid down in Annex B, that such a condition might properly be exacted. To exact such a condition or other conditions aptly designed to secure the performance of obligations under the Convention, and limited to that, would of course be a vastly different thing from legislation in the form of regulations 3 and 4, which leave the conditions of the right to register, that is to say, of the right to fly, to the unbridled discretion of the Air Board. So with regard to air harbours, it is competent to the Dominion in order to secure the observance of the rules in Annex D, to require aerodromes to perform the duties expressly or impliedly imposed upon them by that Annex. For this purpose, it would be within the power of the Dominion to prohibit the use of, or suspend the use of, any locality as an aerodrome, where these duties were disregarded, and to take proper measures to maintain such control over such aerodromes as would enable the Government to make its decrees effective; and it would also seem a reasonable and proper measure, for this purpose, to require the licensing of aerodromes under such conditions as to granting licences or as to the suspension or rescission of them as should appear to be calculated to secure this object. It would, of course, be competent to the Dominion, in licensing aerodromes as landing places for aircraft entering the country, to enact such conditions as it might see fit; as well as to provide for the observance at all aerodromes of the undertakings against discrimination in charges or in facilities under article 24 of the Convention. Furthermore, I do not doubt the power of the Dominion to control the use of aerodromes in such a way as to prevent the frustration of the rules of Annex D, and, for this purpose, to prescribe conditions as to the granting suspension and cancellation of licences. I have already stated my views as to the obligations incurred by the Dominion with respect to the conditions to be imposed in respect of the licensing of personnel. As I have said, the Dominion, in my judgment, is entitled to exact, as a condition of the granting of such a licence, the minimum conditions laid down in article 12 and Annex E. But I do not doubt that the Dominion is also entitled to exact sanctions for the performance of the rules in Annex D by providing for the suspension or cancellation of licences upon a breach of such rules; and furthermore, to take any measures calculated to prevent any person acting as navigator, pilot, or member of the crew of an aeroplane not fully equipped by knowledge of the rules in Annex D, and otherwise, to perform any duty cast upon him by them.\nIn addition to all this, there are other regulations which could be sustained as enacted in view of the obligations imposed by the Convention in article 25. Regulation 15, for example, requires any registered aircraft to bear the prescribed nationality and registration marks. The Convention provides explicitly for the use of these marks in international navigation though not in domestic navigation. But it would obviously be proper, in order to secure identification for the purposes of enforcing, and punishing breaches of, the rules, to require that all aircraft should bear the marks of identification mentioned in regulation 15. Similar considerations apply to a number of other regulations; those, for example, requiring aircraft to land in response to signals of police officers, representatives of the Air Board, the Immigration and Customs officials, those requiring the possession and production of licences and certificates and other documents by aircraft, and generally those dealing with inspection.\nAs to \u201cidentification\u201d and \u201cinspection,\u201d in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), I do not doubt the authority of the Dominion to legislate fully and completely on these subjects. The reasons appear to be too obvious to require statement. As to the remaining sub-paragraphs of section 4, little need be said. The Dominion has authority to provide for the carrying of mails, to prescribe the areas in which aircraft entering Canada shall land and the conditions to be observed on such landings, and to provide for the control of the Air Force. Other matters stand in a different situation. For example, the carriage of goods and passengers, the use and control of aerial routes, and those embraced in sub-paragraph (i) which is in the following terms:\nthe institution and enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe and proper navigation of aircraft in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada.\nIn relation to all these last mentioned matters, the vice of section 4 is that its terms are too comprehensive. Under various heads of section 91, the Dominion, as I have already said, possesses authority to legislate in respect to certain aspects of some of these matters, but section 4 is framed in such a way as to render it impossible to treat the enactment, in its relation to the matters just mentioned, as one falling within the Dominion\u2019s authority under, for example, the regulation of Trade and Commerce, undertakings extending beyond the limits of a province, or Defence.\nSome comment is required upon sub-paragraph (f). The Dominion possesses, I am disposed to think, authority to prohibit the navigation of non-Canadian aircraft over prescribed areas, and by the terms of the Convention, where such a prohibition is put into effect, there is an obligation to treat foreign aircraft on the same terms as Canadian aircraft. In the result, I am disposed to think, section 4 could be validly enacted in respect of sub-paragraph (f).\nA further comment is required in respect to regulation 33. As affecting flying outside of Canada, I am disposed to think this regulation is valid under the powers of the Dominion independently of the Convention.\nNo reference was made upon the argument to regulation 133, which among other things provides that the regulations shall not apply to aircraft or to air harbours to the extent to which they have been relieved by the Air Board from compliance therewith. Every regulation is subject to this declaration; and the existence of this dispensing power exercisable according to the absolute discretion of an administrative board, affecting as it does every order, prohibition and declaration in the regulations, on the subject with which it deals, adds to the difficulty of holding that these regulations could be sanctioned validly in exercise of the powers under section 132, which are given for the purpose of providing for the performance of the obligations under the Convention. There is nothing in the Convention giving any countenance to the idea that the performance by each State of its obligations is, strictly, not obligatory, but within the discretion of the State itself.\nTwo regulations, 10 and 28, the first classified as relating to the subject of registration, and the second as relating to the subject of air harbours, both within the scope of question 4, cannot be passed over wholly without comment. I shall quote verbatim regulation 10, the form of which is closely followed in regulation 28: 10. It shall be a condition of the primary registration in Canada of any aircraft that, upon the Governor in Council declaring that a national emergency exists or is immediately apprehended, every such aircraft shall be subject to requisition in the name of His Majesty by the Air Board or any officer of the Canadian Air Force; and upon being so requisitioned shall become the property of His Majesty subject to its return or to the payment of compensation or to both as may be provided by law. New.\n(2) The registration in Canada of any aircraft primarily registered in any of His Majesty\u2019s dominions other than Canada shall be subject to the like condition unless, under the law of that one of His Majesty\u2019s dominions in which the aircraft was primarily registered, it is subject to a paramount right to be requisitioned on His Majesty\u2019s behalf. (New.)\nAlthough two of my brethren would answer question 4 (c) in a sense which recognizes regulation 10 as valid, I must say, with great respect, that neither of these regulations has any sort of relation to anything in the Convention; and that there is no section of the British North America Act other than section 132 under which they could be susceptible of valid sanction. Under them, the power of the Air Board to requisition aeroplanes and aerodromes in the name of His Majesty comes into play upon a proclamation by the Governor General declaring that a \u201cnational emergency\u201d exists or is immediately apprehended. \u201cEmergencies\u201d may possess widely different degrees of gravity and urgency. But this authority is not conditioned upon the existence, in fact, of any conjuncture of the sort loosely and vaguely indicated by the words \u201cnational emergency.\u201d According to the tenor of the regulation, the condition is fulfilled upon a proclamation that this undefined state of affairs has come into being. These regulations afford instructive examples of the extremes to which an administrative board may allow itself to be carried, even when restrained by the necessity of securing the approval of the Governor in Council. They bring into relief, also, in a striking way, the sweeping character of section 4 of the Aeronautics Act of 1919. For under sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section, (if it had itself been valid) investing, as it does, the Air Board with unlimited authority over the registration and the licensing of aircraft as well as over the licensing and regulation of aerodromes (in all the aspects of these subjects), these regulations could have been effectively put into force.\nOn the argument, there was an extended discussion touching the authority of the Dominion in respect of a regular service (or line) of aeroplanes operating between two provinces. The discussion centred in the scope and effect of the excepting clauses of no. 10 of section 92. But these subjects are not before us for consideration. The enactment in the principal clause of section 4, could not in its application to any one of the severally enumerated matters, be supported as within the ambit of any of the powers contemplated by the excepting clauses of section 92 (10). The subject of lines of aeroplanes, regular services of aeroplanes \u201cferries\u201d of aeroplanes, is not the subject, or one of the severable subjects, of that section; or of any of the regulations we are asked to consider. It must be understood that I express no opinion, favourable or unfavourable, upon the contentions presented in argument on these points.\nThe same may be said of head no. 2 of section 91 \u201ctrade and commerce.\u201d Except in cases already specifically dealt with, there is nothing in the statute or in the regulations which properly, as subject of legislation, could be assigned to the subject of interprovincial or of foreign trade.\nSave as to cases specified above, it would be necessary to rewrite these enactments in order to bring them within the ambit of any power possessed by the Dominion under head 2 of section 91.\nBefore taking leave of the reference, it is desirable, perhaps, to refer to a suggestion that the position taken in these reasons, if made good, would lead to confusion, indeed, to chaos, through the prevalence at one and the same time and place of different, and possibly conflicting, rules of aerial navigation. There is no foundation for such fears. The Dominion, I repeat, has full authority under section 132, to give effect to the rules embodied in the Convention and to take effective measures for the enforcement of them. It is now settled, if, indeed, there ever was a doubt upon it, that provincial legislation repugnant to valid legislation of the Dominion under section 132 is thereby superseded. The Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[4]. The course followed in these reasons in examining the regulations in some detail, with a view to answering question 4, has necessitated the consideration of some points in respect of which we had little or no assistance from the argument. That questions 3 and 4 call for such an examination, in the one case, of the matters enumerated in the sub-paragraphs, and in the other, of the regulations, was assumed in the factums, and in the factum of the Dominion, the particular regulations falling under the several divisions of question 4 were indicated. It was also assumed by counsel, and this assumption to a considerable degree, dictated the course of the argument. The argument for the provinces was addressed in detail to the provisions of the statute and to most of the essential regulations upon each subject. In the argument for the Dominion, although the emphasis was predominantly upon the broader contentions, matters of detail were also the subject of extended discussion. It has seemed right to deal with these questions from the point of view from which they were discussed, especially since that point of view rests upon a construction of those questions which (although I think it is not strictly the right one) is in itself not an unreasonable one.\nNevertheless, I think it my duty to say that I sympathize with the feeling of my learned brethren as to the extreme difficulty of making what in practice will be regarded as a judicial pronouncement upon such a variety of topics, presenting, not in one or two cases only, but in many cases, points of no inconsiderable importance. While theoretically not impossible, it would not have been practicable, for counsel, to deal adequately in this case with every question presented by the statute and the regulations; and judicial conclusions arrived at without the assistance of argument, are not necessarily exempt from the weaknesses which often attend conclusions, so reached, elsewhere.\nWe hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor in Council that the reasons expressed in the paper hereunto annexed, are our reasons for the answers, certified of this date, to the questions referred herein by His Excellency for hearing and consideration by this Court. Newcombe J.\u2014In the British Columbia Fisheries Case,[5] the Lord Chancellor (Haldane) introduced his judgment, disposing of the questions submitted, with the following observations. He referred to the statutory authority under which the questions were, as he said, competently put to the Supreme Court, and he said that\nThe business of the Supreme Court of Canada is to do what is laid down as its duty by the Dominion Parliament, and the duty of the Judicial Committee, although not bound by any Canadian statute, is to give to it as a Court of review such assistance as is within its power. Nevertheless, under this procedure questions may be put of a kind which it is impossible to answer satisfactorily. Not only may the question of future litigants be prejudiced by the Court laying down principles in an abstract form without any reference or relation to actual facts, but it may turn out to be practically impossible to define a principle adequately and safely without previous ascertainment of the exact facts to which it is to be applied. It has therefore happened that in cases of the present class their Lordships have occasionally found themselves unable to answer all the questions put to them, and have found it advisable to limit and guard their replies.\nAn illustration is to be found in the course adopted by the Privy Council in the Fisheries Case[6], from which it would seem that we should be careful not to declare or advise upon the rights of proprietors of lands in the provinces; they are not parties here, and cannot conveniently be represented in a general statutory reference, although some of these questions necessarily involve the consideration of proprietary rights. See also Lord Haldane\u2019s observations in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[7].\nI shall endeavour, in my answers, to adhere to a course which is justified by these precedents.\nUnder the first question it is contended, on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, that the convention relating to the regulation of aerial navigation is a treaty within the meaning of s. 132 of the British North America Act, 1867, and that the powers possessed by the Parliament and Government of Canada under that section are exclusive of any like powers which might, in its absence, have belonged to the provinces.\nIt is not denied, and no reason has been suggested to doubt, that the convention is a treaty; but the language of s. 132 does not require, either expressly or by necessary implication, nor, I think, does it suggest, that a province should thereby suffer a diminution of the powers expressed in its enumerations or otherwise conferred, except to admit capacity on the part of the Dominion, which, in relation to provincial obligations, is no more than concurrent, so long as these are not performed by the province. The case of obligations to be performed for which a province has become bound by treaty to a foreign country, though perhaps difficult to realize, is expressly provided for by s. 132; and, while, pending provincial non-performance, power is, by that section, conferred upon the Parliament and Government of Canada, I am unable to interpret the Dominion power as meant to deprive the province of authority to implement its obligations. If that had been the intention, I think it would have been expressed. For example, to put a simple case, which perhaps conceivably may be imagined, if a province were bound by treaty between the Empire and a foreign country to pay a sum of money borrowed on the sole credit of the province, and if the province, by direction of its legislature, were in due course to cause the money to be paid, I do not doubt that the obligation would thereby lawfully and constitutionally be discharged, even without any action on the part of the Parliament or Government of Canada.\nI have considered question 2 with the utmost solicitude to discover its meaning, and I remain in some perplexity; but, accepting the view, which seems not unreasonable, that the necessity of legislation to sanction the obligations of the treaty is intended to be brought within the scope of the enquiry, I am met by an objection which seems successfully to challenge the validity of the reference; and it is this: Granted that under section 132 the Parliament has authority, in excess of its powers elsewhere defined, to authorize the performance of treaties, the language of the section is not the less restricted to treaty obligations towards foreign countries, and it is to such obligations that the question addresses itself. When, therefore, it is considered that the court has no jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign, except by submission, and that the foreign States, party to the convention, have made no submission, it results, as I am disposed to think, that this court ought not to determine, under the present procedure, a question which involves the definition of the treaty obligations; and, especially so, seeing that the interpretation of the convention is, by Article 37, to be determined by the Permanent Court of International Justice, or, previously to the establishment of that court, by arbitration.\nAlthough the answers of the court upon questions referred are declared by the statute to be advisory only, and although, as said by the Judicial Committee in a passage which I shall quote more fully, they \u201cwill have no more effect than the opinions of the law officers,\u201d yet the proceedings are judicial, and the questions are referred to the court for \u201chearing and consideration\u201d; and it is the statutory duty of the court to \u201chear\u201d and consider. In the discharge of this duty, the court, in ordinary course, and necessarily, as I see it, applies the principle of the maxim audi alteram partem, and that, I think, comports with the just intention of the statute. Moreover, Parliament has been careful to provide expressly for this procedure. By subsecs. 4 and 5 of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, the court may direct that any person or class of persons interested shall be notified of the hearing, and that such person or class shall be entitled to be heard; also, where there is no appearance, the court may, in its discretion, request counsel to argue the case as to any interest which is affected. These provisions strengthen the view that the section is not intended to apply to the adjudication of interests in support of which the court is not empowered to require argument at the hearing. I am not overlooking the case of the Japanese Treaty Act, Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[8], where an Act of British Columbia was held ultra vires for conflict with a valid Dominion statute, and which is thus quite distinguishable. And there is also the case, which should be mentioned, of the Reference in the matter of Legislative Jurisdiction over Hours of Labour[9]. But I do not think that in either of these cases the reasons or answers were intended to come into conflict with the view which I am now expressing, and which, certainly, was not therein suggested or considered.\nIf, as would appear, it be desired to know whether Dominion legislation is necessary, one must ascertain what the obligation is, and that cannot judicially be declared without learning or inviting the contentions of the obligees. It may, of course, be suggested that there is no evidence of any controversy; but, on the other hand, we are not informed that the contracting parties are ad idem in their interpretation of the treaty obligations. It may likewise be said that foreign sovereign powers are not within the purview of the Supreme Court Act; that their interests are impliedly excepted and should be disregarded; but, in the British Columbia Fisheries Case[10], reasons were advanced why their Lordships should not answer a cognate question relating to the territorial rights claimed by the Crown in the shore extending below low water mark to within three miles of the coast, and affecting the pretensions of foreign nations. And, for my part, although I do not mean to suggest that litigation might not arise in which it would be convenient or necessary that the court should construe the treaty, the view which impresses itself upon my mind is that since the foreign sovereign parties to the convention are unrepresented and cannot be convened, a question which looks to the ascertainment of their interests judicially, cannot, upon submission by the Governor in Council, be determined compatibly with the statutory requirements and procedure.\nDominion powers derived under s. 132 should, I think, be liberally interpreted to include all such as are necessary or proper for achieving the purposes defined. The Dominion is, by that section, authorized to exercise these powers for performing its treaty obligations, and equally so, for performing those of a province; and this is true, irrespective of the question as to where the power would have resided if s. 132 had not been enacted. There is ample authority for the view that, if the treaty obligations cannot legally be performed under the domestic law as it exists, legislation is necessary to justify the performance; and, in Walker v. Baird[11], the Attorney-General of England (Sir Richard Webster)\nconceded that he could not maintain the proposition that the Crown could sanction an invasion by its officers of the rights of private individuals whenever it was necessary, in order to compel obedience to the provisions of a treaty. But the question remains of ascertaining and interpreting the conventional obligations; and, as to that, I have endeavoured to explain my difficulty as it presents itself.\nMoreover, even if the jurisdiction were held to persist, notwithstanding that the court cannot convoke or summon the parties for hearing, I would have thought that the inexpediency or liability to miscarriage of a judicial attempt exhaustively to interpret and declare these obligations, when practical differences have not arisen and specific cases are not formulated, rests upon grounds so impressive and obvious as to justify a representation to the Governor in Council against the advisability of requiring an answer to a question possessing the general character and obscurity of no. 2.\nIt is true that a question as to the power of the Governor in Council to require this court to answer questions of law or fact, in the broad terms provided by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, was determined favourably to the legislation in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[12], but, in pronouncing that judgment, the Lord Chancellor (Earl Loreburn) said at pages 588, 589:\nIt is difficult to resist the conclusion that the point now raised never would have been raised had it not been for the nature of the questions which have been put to the Supreme Court. If the questions to the Courts had been limited to such as are in practice put to the Judicial Committee (e.g., must justices of the peace and judges be resworn after a demise of the Crown?) no one would ever have thought of saying it was ultra vires. It is now suggested because the power conferred by the Canadian Act, which is not and could not be wider in its terms than that of William IV, applicable to the Judicial Committee, has resulted in asking questions affecting the provinces, or alleged to do so. But the answers are only advisory and will have no more effect than the opinion of the law officers. Perhaps another reason is that the Act has resulted in asking a series of searching questions very difficult to answer exhaustively and accurately without so many qualifications and reservations as to make the answers of little value. The Supreme Court itself can, however, either point out in its answer these or other considerations of a like kind, or can make the necessary representations to the Governor General in Council when it thinks right so to treat any question that may be put.\nAnd the course so suggested appears to me appropriate for the present occasion.\nQuestions 3 and 4 relate to specific legislation, which has been enacted by the Dominion; and, even by all the forethought and imagination which we can exercise or may possess, they cannot be comprehensively or perfectly answered, if room is to be found, as I think it must be, for the operation of provincial rights. We were told at the argument that no practical difficulties had been encountered; and, obviously, questions could be better considered and more satisfactorily determined when, or from time to time as, they practically emerge, and so become capable of being stated with adequate point and precision. Meantime, in the discharge of our duty under the statute, we have certainly to face a question as to the authority of Parliament to enact these clauses under s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867; and, as to that, I am satisfied that we cannot usefully do more than indicate generally the principles to be applied for the avoidance of controversy, or for the determination of specific differences, should they practically arise.\nI would reject the argument urged on behalf of the Dominion that the subject matter of either of these questions is \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d, within the 10th enumeration of s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867. I see no evidence of any Parliamentary intention that this was ever intended.\nThe earth hath in law a great extent upwards, not only of water, as hath been said, but of ayre and all other things even up to heaven; for cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum, as is holden 14 H. 8. fo. 12. 22 Hen. 6. 59. 10 E. 4. 14. Registrum origin, and in other bookes.\nThese are the words of Coke\u2019s venerable Commentary upon Littleton (4 a.), and they express, as I have been taught to believe, the common law of England, which applies in the English provinces of Canada. In the province of Quebec, the law is not materially different, for, by art. 414 of the Civil Code, it is declared that\nownership of the soil carries with it ownership of what is above and what is below it.\nThe principle is thus established, and the courts have no authority, so far as I can perceive, to explain and qualify it so as to admit of the introduction of a public right of way for the use of flying machines consequent upon the demonstrations in recent times of the practicability of artificial flight. The appropriate legislature may, of course, provide for airways as it has habitually done for roads and highways, notwithstanding the rights of the proprietors; but the project is legislative, not judicial. \u201cNavigation and shipping\u201d are words inapt and unauthorized to connote flight or the utilization of atmospheric resistance or buoyancy for the carriage of craft or traffic. Flight is one thing, and navigation another. The way of a flying machine may in some respects be assimilated to the way of an eagle in the air, but not to that of a ship in the midst of the sea, which has been recognized as something different. Navigation consists in the exercise of a right of way, which may be enjoyed in the sea, in tidal and in non-tidal water. (Coulson & Forbes on Waters, 4th edition, by H. Stuart Moore, 437.) This meaning is emphasized for the purposes of s. 91, where the, word is associated with \u201cshipping.\u201d Moreover, as to tidal waters at least, the right is public, not dependent upon property. On the other hand, the right of way exercised within a province by a flying machine must, in some manner be derived from or against the owners of the property traversed; and the power legislatively to sanction such a right of way appertains prima facie to property and civil rights in the province, although, no doubt, it may be overborne by ancillary Dominion powers, where they exist. It was enacted by sec. 9 of the Imperial Air Navigation Act, 1920, 10-11 Geo. V, c. 80, that, subject to its provisions, no action should lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance, by reason of the flight of aircraft over any property at a reasonable height; and, if, for example, it were desired to confer similar immunity in the provinces of Canada, I see no reason to doubt that the resort would prima facie lie to the legislatures of the provinces. Therefore, if the subject of \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d is to be extended to what, in the absence of a definitive name, has been described as \u201caerial navigation,\u201d that is a function to be discharged by the enactment of appropriate words, and it belongs to the Imperial Parliament, not to this court.\nIf it be desirable to have uniformity of regulations for the licensing, inspection, etc., of air traffic, an inference may be drawn from the judgment of the Privy Council in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[13], that the object Should be attained by co-operation between the Dominion and the local authorities. The federal system, as it is known in the Dominion, while it has proved its adaptation to local conditions of government, is not without some disadvantages, and one apparently is that an inconvenient situation may arise requiring a legislative remedy for which, notwithstanding some wayside utterances to the contrary, the concurrence or co-operation of both federal and provincial law-making bodies is necessary; but, as was said by Lord Atkinson, with relation to railways, in the City of Montreal case[14], page 346:\nIt cannot be assumed that either body will decline to co-operate with the other in a reasonable way to effect an object so much in the interest of both the Dominion and the Province, as the regulation of \u201cthrough traffic.\u201d\nThe Dominion enumerated powers must, of course, have their full effect, even when they seem to conflict with those of the provinces. This follows from the concluding paragraph of s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867:\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe meaning of this clause was explained by Lord Watson in the Prohibition Case[15], as follows:\u2014\nIt was apparently contemplated by the framers of the Imperial Act of 1867 that the due exercise of the enumerated powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 might, occasionally and incidentally, involve legislation upon matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the provincial legislatures by s. 92. In order to provide against that contingency, the concluding part of s. 91 enacts that * * *\nAnd his Lordship, having quoted the clause, proceeded:\u2014\nIt was observed by this Board in Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[16], that the paragraph just quoted \u201capplies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of s. 92.\u201d The observation was not material to the question arising in that case, and it does not appear to their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language in the exception in s. 91 was meant to include and correctly describes all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of s. 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. It also appears to their Lordships that the exception was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen subsections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of clause 91. That view was stated and illustrated by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[17], and in Cushing v. Dupuy[18]; and it has been recognized by this Board in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[19], and in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[20].\nAnd so, it cannot be successfully denied that the Dominion may have, maintain and operate aircraft, as part of its military or naval service, or for customs, postal or other Dominion services, and may regulate their use for these purposes; and, as well, may prohibit or regulate their use commercially for exporting or importing goods out of or into Canada, or for the carriage of passengers to and from Canada, or, I suggest, interprovincially. In respect of these and other services, as to which the Dominion derives its powers from the enumerations of s. 91, or exercises general powers not belonging to provincial subjects, the regulations in s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act appear to be competent to Parliament, but, on the other hand, it is, I think, certain that there are uses for aircraft, which appertain exclusively to \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d in relation to \u201cmatters of a merely private or local nature in the province\u201d; and, as to these, some of the regulations in question cannot be applied without entering a field exclusively reserved for provincial authority. The same may be said with regard to the Air Regulations, 1920, respecting the matters specified in the fourth question.\nA province, for example, amongst its other legislative powers, may exclusively make laws in regard to the establishment and tenure of provincial offices and the appointment and payment of provincial officers; the management and sale of public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon, and the comprehensive subject of property and civil rights in the province. (S. 92 (4), (5) and (13)). And, if, therefore, to introduce only one illustration, the province desire to provide an air service for the oversight, protection and management of its Crown lands and timber, or for its mines and minerals or mining reserves, it is not, I believe, destitute of power for the institution and use of it; and so, if a legislature should sanction the appointment of officers to perform the duties of provincial air guides or pilots or operators for the conduct of that service, I am far from persuaded that these officers must qualify for the discharge of their duties by production of Dominion licences, unless the province by its legislation should so enact.\nI have thus endeavoured briefly to state what I think may usefully be submitted in answer to the questions referred, and, pursuant to the statute, I certify the above as my opinion and reasons for the information of the Governor in Council.\nSmith, J.\u2014The following are the questions submitted:\u2014\n1. Have the Parliament and Government of Canada exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the Convention entitled \u201cConvention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation?\u201d\n2. Is legislation of the Parliament of Canada providing for the regulation and control of aeronautics generally within Canada, including flying operations carried on entirely within the limits of a province, necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the Convention aforementioned, within the meaning of section 132 of the British North America Act, 1867?\n3. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to enact, in whole or in part, the provisions of section 4 of the Aeronautics Act, chapter 3, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927?\n4. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to sanction the making and enforcement, in whole or in part, of the regulations contained in the Air Regulations, 1920, respecting\u2014\n(a) The granting of certificates or licences authorizing persons to act as pilots, navigators, engineers or inspectors of aircraft and the suspension or revocation of such licences;\n(b) The regulation, identification, inspection, certification and licensing of all aircraft; and\n(c) The licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations?\nIn my opinion, the answer to question 1 is determined by the decision in Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada.[21] In that case, a treaty was made in 1913 between His Majesty the King and the Emperor of Japan, by which it was, among other things, agreed that the subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties should have full liberty to enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other, and in all that relates to the pursuit of their industries, callings, professions and educational studies, should be placed in all respects on the same footing as the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation.\nOn April 10, 1913, the Parliament of Canada passed the Japanese Treaty Act of that year, and this Act provided that the treaty should be thereby sanctioned and declared to have the force of law in Canada.\nIn 1902 two minutes had been passed by the Executive Council of the province of British Columbia, and approved by the Lieutenant Governor, which set out resolutions passed by the Legislative Assembly and recommended, in accordance with these resolutions, that all tunnel and drain licences issued under s. 58 of the Mineral Act and s. 48-of the Placer Mining Act, and all leases granted under part VII of the latter Act, should contain provisos that they were granted on the express condition that no Chinese or Japanese should be employed in or about the tunnels, drains or premises to which the licences or leases related, and that a similar provision should also be inserted in all instruments relating to a number of enumerated leases and licences which should be issued by the officers of the provincial government.\nOn April 2, 1921, the legislature of British Columbia passed the Oriental Orders in Council Validation Act, which statute purported to validate and confirm the two Orders in Council of the province already referred to, and passed in the form of recommendations of the provincial Executive Council, approved by the Lieutenant Governor, in May, 1902. The statute further provided that the Orders should be deemed to have been valid and effectual according to their tenor as from the dates of their approval, and that where, in any instrument referred to in the said Orders in Council, or in any instrument of a similar nature to any of those so referred to, issued by any minister or officer of any department of the government of the province, any provision had heretofore been inserted, or was thereafter inserted relating to or restricting the employment of Chinese or Japanese, that provision should be deemed to have been and to be valid, and always to have had the force of law according to its tenor. It was further enacted that every violation of or failure to observe any such provision on the part of any licensee, or other person in whose favour the instrument operated, should be sufficient ground for the cancellation of the instrument by the Lieutenant Governor.\nSection 132 of the British North America Act is as follows:\u2014\n132. The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards Foreign Countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nThe question at issue in the case was the validity of the British Columbia statute referred to. One of the grounds urged against the validity of the Act was that it purported to deal with the status of aliens, a matter solely under the jurisdiction of the Dominion under s. 91 of the British North America Act; and the other ground was that the provincial statute violated the principle laid down in the Dominion Act of 1913.\nIt was held that the provincial Act was not inconsistent with s. 91 of the British North America Act, but was void because it violated the principle laid down in the Dominion Act of 1913.\nIt is to be noted that it was not argued that the Dominion Act was invalid or that the provincial Act could prevail over the Dominion Act, passed pursuant to s. 132 of the British North America Act. The whole argument was that the provincial Act did not in fact conflict with the Dominion Act.\nIt is argued here, on behalf of the provinces, that where there is a stipulation in a treaty that something shall be done that the provinces have jurisdiction to do, it is only on failure of the provinces to discharge the provincial obligations that the Dominion has jurisdiction to intervene. This contention seems to be totally at variance with the decision of the Privy Council in the case just referred to, which holds that, apart from the question of jurisdiction over aliens, the Dominion Parliament had jurisdiction to implement the treaty by legislation, and that the province could not validly enact legislation inconsistent with the principle of the Dominion legislation.\nIt follows, in my opinion, that the Dominion Parliament has paramount jurisdiction to legislate for the performance of all treaty obligations, and that, while a province may effectively legislate for that purpose in regard to any matter falling within s. 92 of the British North America Act while the field is unoccupied by the Dominion (but not otherwise), Dominion legislation, being paramount, will, when enacted, supersede that of the provinces about such matters. The answer to the first question, therefore, substituting the word \u201cparamount\u201d for the word \u201cexclusive,\u201d is in the affirmative.\nI am of the opinion that, taking the words in question 2, \u201cregulation and control of aeronautics generally within Canada,\u201d as meaning unlimited regulations and control of aeronautics within Canada, the answer must be in the negative.\nThe contention on behalf of the provinces is that the international Convention applies only to aircraft operated internationally, and has no application to aircraft of any of the contracting countries which flies wholly within the territory of the country where it is owned. In some respects the Convention purports to deal only with international flying, but in others with the flying of all aircraft.\nFor example, article 25 is as follows:\nEach contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to ensure that every aircraft flying above the limits of its territory and that every aircraft, wherever it may be, carrying its nationality mark, shall comply with the regulations contained in Annex D.\nAnnex D lays down elaborate rules as to lights and signals, and rules for air traffic, following closely the rules of water navigation. If the contention of the provinces be sound, every province, so far as this Convention is concerned, would be entitled to establish rules of its own, as to lights and signals and air traffic, which might be entirely at variance with the international rules laid down in the Convention, and each of which might be at variance with the other. The manifest object of these rules as set out in the Convention is to secure safety in air navigation for all craft flying over the territory of the parties to the treaty; and it is unreasonable to suppose that these rules were to apply only to aircraft flying internationally, and that every country and every province was at liberty to make its own rules for aircraft owned and flying within its own territory. I am of opinion, therefore, that under article 25 the Dominion is under obligation to adopt measures to ensure that every aircraft flying above the limits of Canadian territory shall comply with the regulations contained in Annex D, and has authority to enact accordingly.\nArticle 12 is as follows:\u2014\nArt. 12. The commanding officer, pilots, engineers and other members of the operating crew of every aircraft shall, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Annex E, be provided with certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by the State whose nationality the aircraft possesses.\nAnnex E has the following:\u2014\nThe conditions set forth in the present Annex are the minimum conditions required for the issue of certificates and licences valid for international traffic.\nNevertheless, each contracting State will be entitled to issue certificates and licences, not valid for international traffic, subject to such less stringent conditions as it may deem adequate to ensure the safety of air traffic.\nThe said certificates and licences will not, however, be valid for flight over the territory of another State.\nArticle 12 in terms refers to the operating crew of every aircraft, while the preceding article 11, expressly refers to every aircraft engaged in international navigation.\nIn the portion of Annex E just quoted, we have express provision for the issue of certificates and licences by each of the states for flying within its own territory, on such less stringent conditions as each state may deem adequate to ensure the safety of air traffic. By virtue, therefore, of article 12 and Annex E, there is imposed upon each party to the Convention an express obligation to control in this way all aircraft flying exclusively within its own territory.\nThe Articles of Convention do not explicitly provide that aircraft shall be registered; but this is necessarily implied.\nArticle 5 provides that no contracting state shall, except by a special and temporary authorization, permit the flight above its territory of an aircraft which does not possess the nationality of a contracting state. By article 6, aircraft possess the nationality of the state on the register of which they are entered, in accordance with the provisions of section I (c) of Annex A; and article 10 provides that all aircraft engaged in international navigation shall bear their nationality and registration marks, as well as the name and residence of the owner, in accordance with Annex A. As nationality under these provisions can only be possessed by registration, the necessary inference is that there must be registration of all aircraft as provided in Annex A, except in cases where such aircraft are flying under a \u201cspecial and temporary authorization.\u201d\nIt is contended on behalf of the provinces that article 5 refers only to aircraft engaged in international navigation; but the language of the article has no such limitation: and, in view of the general intention to be gathered from the whole tenor of the Convention, and particularly from the provisions of Annex E quoted above, to provide for the safety of air navigation, there would seem to be no good reason for introducing such a limitation. If the argument on behalf of the provinces were sustained, then every state, and each province of Canada, so far as the Convention is concerned, might allow aircraft of all descriptions, uninspected, unregistered, and of any nationality, to fly within its own borders, which, in my opinion, would be contrary to the express language of article 5 and the general intent and provisions of the Convention.\nIt is to be noted, however, that article 37 provides that, in case of a disagreement between two or more states relating to the interpretation of the Convention, the question in dispute shall be determined by the Permanent Court of International Justice to be established by the League of Nations, and, until its establishment, by arbitration. This Court, therefore, has no jurisdiction to give an opinion binding upon the various parties to the Convention on disputes as to interpretation, whereas a decision under article 37 would be binding on all parties to the Convention, and the obligation of the Dominion and the jurisdiction to legislate would thereafter accord with the interpretation thus arrived at.\nIt is admitted on behalf of the provinces that, independently of the Convention, the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction over aircraft and air navigation, by virtue of s. 91 of the British North America Act, in connection with various matters thereby assigned to the Dominion, such as Military and Naval Service and Defence, Customs, Postal Service, Control of Aliens, and, possibly to some extent, for the regulation of Trade and Commerce. On behalf of the Dominion it is argued that the whole subject comes within Navigation and Shipping, under clause (10) of sec. 91.\nI am of opinion that Navigation and Shipping, as used in s. 91, refers only to the navigation of water, and shipping plying on or in water. This is the definition of navigation and shipping in the \u201cNew English Dictionary,\u201d and there can be little doubt that it was the meaning attached to these terms at the time the Act was passed. In my opinion, jurisdiction over aeronautics belongs to the provinces under the heading Property and Civil Rights in the province, section 92 (13) of the British North America Act, subject to the jurisdiction of the Dominion under s. 91, as indicated, and to the provisions of the Convention referred to and of s. 132 of the British North America Act.\nQuestion 3 is apparently construed by the majority of the members of the court as an (inquiry as to whether or not s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, as it now stands in the Revised Statutes, is intra vires and valid. On that view it is contended that, as the statute was passed long before the treaty came into effect, no jurisdiction under s. 132 of the British North America Act by virtue of the treaty can be invoked to sustain the validity of the Act, and that the re-enactment of this statute in the Revised Statutes of 1927 does not alter the matter because of the provisions of s. 8 of 14-15 Geo. V, c. 65, which provides that the Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws.\nIn my view, the question relates to the present legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, including legislative authority under the various headings in s. 91 of the British North America Act and under s. 132, by virtue of the treaty. Interpreting the question in this way, it follows from what has been already said that Parliament has authority to enact the provisions of s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act in relation to the matters set out in s. 91 of the British North America Act, and, so far as necessary and proper, within the meaning of s. 132 of that Act, for carrying out the provisions of the treaty. S. 4, however, goes beyond this, and purports to assume unlimited regulation and control of aeronautics in Canada. It is difficult, therefore, to answer categorically question 3, but, interpreting the question as indicated, it follows from what has been said that, as to a great part of the provisions of s. 4, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d Clause (d) refers not only to the carrying of mails, but to the carrying of goods and passengers, and the operation of any commercial service whatsoever, and jurisdiction as to these matters, independently of the Convention, would depend on whether or not they are of such a nature as to amount to Regulation of Trade and Commerce as set out in s. 91 of the British North America Act. The same remarks would apply to transport of goods and passengers over part of the territories of Canada, as set out in clause (e).\nQuestion 4 (a) and (b) should be answered in the affirmative.\nQuestion 4 (c) should be answered in the affirmative as to all aerodromes and air stations described in the Convention, and, as to others, so far as may be necessary to prevent air navigators being confused or misled in locating and landing at aerodromes and air stations referred to in the Convention or in reading ground markings made in pursuance of the Convention.\nI certify the foregoing to be my opinion and reasons therefor upon the four questions herein submitted for hearing and consideration by the court by His Excellency the Governor in Council.\nCannon, J.\u2014The Governor General in Council, on the 15th of April, 1929, referred the following questions to this court for hearing and consideration pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 35:\u2014\n1. Have the Parliament and Government of Canada exclusive legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or any province thereof, under the Convention entitled \u201cConvention relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation?\u201d\n2. Is legislation of the Parliament of Canada providing for the regulation and control of aeronautics generally within Canada, including flying operations carried on entirely within the limits of a province, necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, under the Convention aforementioned, within the meaning of section 132 of the British North America Act, 1867?\n3. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to enact, in whole or in part, the provisions of section 4 of the Aeronautics Act, chapter 3, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927? 4. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative authority to sanction the making and enforcement, in whole or in part, of the regulations contained in the Air Regulations, 1920, respecting\u2014\n(a) The granting of certificates or licences authorizing persons to act as pilots, navigators, engineers or inspectors of aircrafts and the suspension or revocation of such licences;\n(b) The regulation, identification, inspection, certification and licensing of all aircrafts; and\n(c) The licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air stations?\nThe Minister of Justice, in his report to Council, apprehends\nthat this legislation was enacted by Parliament by reason not only of the expediency of making provision for the regulation of a service essentially important in itself as touching closely the national life and interests, but also of the necessity of making provision for performing the obligations of Canada, as part of the British Empire under the Convention relating to the regulation of Aerial Navigation which, drawn up by a Commission constituted by the Peace Conference at Paris in 1919, was, on 13th October of that year, signed by the representatives of 26 of the Allied and Associated Powers including Canada.\nThis convention was ratified by His Majesty on behalf of the British Empire on 1st June, 1922, and is now in force, as the Minister is informed, as between the British Empire and 17 other States.\nThe Minister observes that the Air Regulations 1920, conform in essential particulars to the provisions of the said Convention, and are designed to give effect to the stipulations thereof in discharge of the obligations of Canada, as part of the British Empire, towards the other contracting States.\nThe Minister states that at the conference at Ottawa between representatives of the Dominion and the several Provincial Governments in the month of November, 1927, the representatives of the province of Quebec raised a question as to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada to sanction regulations for the control of aerial navigation generally within Canada, at all events in their application to flying operations carried on within a Province; and it was agreed that the question so raised was a proper question for the determination of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAt the argument, Mr. Geoffrion suggested that the order of the questions should be reversed, as it seemed logical that we should first see whether flying is federal or not. If it is federal, it is unnecessary to discuss the application of section 132. If flying is provincial, then it will become important to determine how far section 132 carries federal legislative power.\nQuestions 8 and 4\nThe impugned section 4 of The Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 3, reads as follows:\n4. Subject to approval by the Governor in Council, the Minister shall have power to regulate and control aerial navigation over Canada and the territorial waters of Canada, and in particular, but not to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, he may, with the approval aforesaid, make regulations with respect to\n(a) licensing pilots and other persons engaged in the navigation of aircraft, and the suspension and revocation of such licences;\n(b) the registration, identification, inspection, certification and licensing of all aircraft;\n(c) the licensing, inspection and regulation of all aerodromes and air-stations;\n(d) the conditions under which aircraft may be used for carrying goods, mails and passengers, or for the operation of any commercial service whatsoever, and the licensing of any such services;\n(e) the conditions under which goods, mails and passengers may be imported and exported in aircraft into or from Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada, or may be transported over any part of such territory;\n(f) the prohibition of navigation of aircraft over such areas as may be prescribed, either at all times or at such times or on such occasions only as may be specified in the regulation, and either absolutely or subject to such exceptions or conditions as may be so specified;\n(g) the areas within which aircraft coming from any places outside of Canada are to land, and the conditions to be complied with by any such aircraft;\n(h) aerial routes, their use and control;\n(i) the institution and enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe and proper navigation of aircraft in Canada or within the limits of the territorial waters of Canada; and\n(j) organization, discipline, efficiency and good government generally of the officers and men employed in the Air Force.\n2. Any person guilty of violating the provisions of any such regulation shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to both fine and imprisonment.\n3. All regulations enacted under the provisions of this Act shall be published in the Canada Gazette, and, upon being so published, shall have the same force in law as if they formed part of this Act.\n4. Such regulations shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within ten days after the publication thereof if Parliament is sitting, and if Parliament is not sitting, then within ten days after the next meeting thereof.\nSection 14 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, says:\nThe preamble of every Act shall be deemed a part thereof intended to assist in explaining the purpose and object of the Act.\nI note immediately that Parliament has not deemed it desirable, when passing 9-10 Geo. V, c. 11, assented to on 6th June, 1919, to state in a preamble the object and purport of the Act, so that we remain only with the report of the Minister of Justice who apprehends that the legislation was enacted by Parliament on account of the expediency of making provision for the regulation of a service essentially important in itself as touching the national life and interest.\nThe latest decisions of the Privy Council on our Constitution are to be found, first, in the case of Edwards v. Attorney General for Canada,[22] where Lord Chancellor Sankey says at page 136:\nThe British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. The object of the Act was to grant a Constitution to Canada. \u201cLike all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention;\u201d Canadian Constitutional Studies, Sir Robert Borden (1922), p. 55.\nTheir Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this board\u2014it is certainly not their desire\u2014to cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal interpretation so that the Dominion to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, may be mistress in her own house, as the Provinces to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in theirs. \u201cThe Privy Council, indeed, has laid down that Courts of law must treat the provisions of the British North America Act by the same methods of construction and exposition which they apply to other statutes. But there are statutes and statutes; and the strict construction deemed proper in the case, for example, of a penal or taxing statute or one passed to regulate the affairs of an English parish, would be often subversive of Parliament\u2019s real intent if applied to an Act passed to ensure the peace, order and good government of a British Colony\u201d: see Clement\u2019s Canadian Constitution, 3rd ed., p. 347.\nThe learned author of that treatise quotes from the argument of Mr. Mowat and Mr. Edward Blake before the Privy Council in St. Catharine\u2019s Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen[23]. \u201cThat Act should be on all occasions interpreted in a large, liberal and comprehensive spirit, considering the magnitude of the subjects with which it purports to deal in very few words.\u201d With that their Lordships agree, but as was said by the Lord Chancellor in Brophy v. Attorney-General of Manitoba[24], the question is not what may be supposed to have been intended, but what has been said.\nThe Lord Chancellor, however, restricts his observations in the following way:\nIt must be remembered, too, that their Lordships are not here considering the question of the legislative competence either of the Dominion or its Provinces which arise under ss. 91 and 92 of the Act providing for the distribution of legislative powers and assigning to the Dominion and its Provinces their respective spheres of Government.\nThe other case is Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[25], where Lord Tomlin, speaking for the Board, on October 15, 1929, lays down these four propositions relative to legislative competence in Canada as being established by decisions of the Judicial Committee:\nQuestions of conflict between the jurisdiction of the Parliament of the Dominion and provincial jurisdiction have frequently come before their Lordships\u2019 Board, and as the result of the decisions of the Board the following propositions may be stated:\u2014\n(1) The legislation of the Parliament of the Dominion, so long as it strictly relates to subjects of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91, is of paramount authority, even though it trenches upon matters assigned to the provincial legislatures by s. 92; see Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[26].\n(2) The general power of legislation conferred upon the Parliament of the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act in supplement of the power to legislate upon the subjects expressly enumerated must be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of national interest and importance, and must not trench on any of the subjects enumerated in s. 92 as within the scope of provincial legislation, unless these matters have attained such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion: see Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[27].\n(3) It is within the competence of the Dominion Parliament to provide for matters which, though otherwise within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature, are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the Parliament of the Dominion upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91: see Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[28]; and Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion27.\n(4) There can be a domain in which provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which case neither legislation will be ultra vires if the field is clear, but if the field is not clear and the two legislations meet the Dominion legislation must prevail: see Grand Trunk Ry. of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada[29].\nApplying these four tests, I find\n1st. That aviation, even if designated as aerial navigation, is not a subject enumerated in section 91, or in subsection 10 of s. 92. The works and undertakings connecting a province with another province or extending beyond the limits of the province are \u201cphysical things, not services,\u201d as pointed out by Lord Atkinson in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[30]. The air lines cannot be assimilated to railways as physical things and this authority applies with singular force to exclude federal control of aviation, unless the latter is assimilated to inter-provincial lines of navigation. 2nd. Nothing before us shows conclusively that it is unquestionably a matter of national interest and importance and that it does not trench on any of the subjects enumerated in s. 92 or that it has attained such dimensions as to affect the whole body politic of the Dominion.\n3rd. My first finding disposes of the third test; this legislation is not necessarily incidental to effective legislation by Parliament upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91, amongst others \u201cnavigation and shipping, militia, military and naval service and defence, regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d Perhaps an all powerful Rational air-board and an all-inclusive national air code would be the desideratum if we were drafting de novo section 91, but under our peculiar dual form of government, it is difficult to see how such results can be accomplished without ignoring the federal constitution. Such legislation might be required in case of war, in time of extraordinary peril to the national life of the Dominion, but this Act was not passed for such an emergency, and it cannot be justified as an exception to the exclusive right of the provinces to legislate concerning property and civil rights.\n4th. This legislation, so far as property and civil rights are concerned, does not touch a domain where provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap. The ownership of the air space is prima facie a subject within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces; and they alone can impose restrictions to the rights of the owners of land and to those of the owners of aircraft. Almost every federal power could be somewhat more conveniently exercised if some portion of provincial sovereignty were added to it. This rule for the extension of the federal power should require a strict necessity for its application. If mere convenience is to be a sufficient cause, then assuredly the reservation to the provinces of the control of property and civil rights is meaningless and futile. As pointed out by my brother Duff, re Montreal Street Railway v. City of Montreal[31],\nDivision of legislative authority is the principle of the B.N.A. Act, and if the doctrine of necessarily incidental powers is to be extended to all cases in which inconvenience arises from such a division, that is the end of the federal character of the Union, and paraphrasing Lord Atkinson\u2019s statement in the same case[32]: \u201cIt cannot be assumed that the legislatures will decline to co-operate in a reasonable way to effect an object so much in the interest of both the Dominion and the province as the regulation of air traffic.\u201d\nAlthough the Lord Chancellor in the Edwards case[33], says that\nthe B.N.A. Act should be on all occasions interpreted in a large, liberal and comprehensive spirit, considering the magnitude of the subjects with which it purports to deal in very few words,\nit would seem by the above-quoted reservation that he makes that statement non-applicable to the question of the legislative competence either of the Dominion or its provinces; judges cannot afford to give to a text which is clear a liberal and large interpretation in favour of Dominion power to the detriment of the provinces, and vice versa.\nI would therefore say, with respect for those who believe that our constitution must be stretched to meet new conditions as they arise in the life of the people, that aviation was not foreseen nor considered when the enumeration of 91 was made, and that the words \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d in section 92, are wide enough to give power to the provinces of legislating, with the required uniformity, to ensure safe and satisfactory regulation of aircraft throughout the Dominion and conform to the new requirements of International Law since the sovereignty of each State over the air space above its territory has been proclaimed in 1919.\nI would therefore answer question 3 in the negative.\nQuestion 4 as framed I would answer in the negative under sections 91 and 92 of the B.N.A. Act; but, under 132, I would refer to my answers to questions 1 and 2.\nQuestions 1 and 2\nReaching the above conclusions with respect to the application of sections 91 and 92, I must now come to the main contention of the Dominion that section 132 of the Act validates the impugned provisions.\nQuestion 1\nSection 132 provides that\nThe Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries. As already stated, the treaty was signed on behalf of the Empire on the 13th October, 1919, and ratifications deposited in Paris on June 1st, 1922.\nThe Air Board Act was assented to on the 6th of June, 1919, before the Parliament of Canada could invoke article 132 to secure the power of performing the obligations of Canada under a treaty which was not then in existence. It requires an existing treaty to give validity to legislation, not merely a prospective convention.\nBut the Act has been re-enacted as chapter 3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1927) which, under proclamation, came into force and have affect as law on, from and after the first day of February, 1928, pursuant to the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada, assented to on 19th July, 1924. At both the latter dates, the convention was in force. But at no time has the Parliament of Canada, as they had done for the Japanese Treaty, passed an Act providing that the treaty should be thereby sanctioned and declared to have the force of law in Canada.\nI would therefore answer the first question, as drafted, in the negative. The Parliament and Government of Canada may have paramount, though not exclusive, legislative and executive authority for performing the obligations of Canada, or any province thereof, under the Convention, but have not yet found it necessary or proper to exercise such legislative power.\nQuestion 2\nWe have not before us the elements required to answer question 2 in the affirmative. Is Parliament or this court to decide what legislation may be necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada under the Convention?\nBy inserting the words \u201cor of any province thereof\u201d in clause 132, the Fathers of Confederation seem to imply that some of the Treaty obligations might, as an internal matter, be considered as within the jurisdiction of Canada as a whole, and others as within the provincial competence.\nIf the provinces, or any of them, refuse or neglect to do their share within their legislative ambit with sufficient uniformity to honour the signature of the Dominion, then the question may come before Parliament which might, in a preamble explain why it had become either necessary or proper, to legislate and make regulations under the special powers given by 132. This has not yet been done and, with the data submitted, I cannot answer the question in the affirmative.

Langevin (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1930: February 24; 1930: April 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2014Accident\u2014Indemnity\u2014Ascendant\u2014Principal support\u2014Time of the accident\u2014Compensation\u2014Computation as to wages\u2014R.S.Q., 1925, c. 247, ss. 4, 9.\nIn order to decide whether the victim of an accident, during his work, was the \u201cprincipal support\u201d of the ascendant, who claims indemnity under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 274, s. 4), the courts are not bound to take into account any fixed period of time. The Act itself specifies the period to be considered as \u201cat the time of the accident\u201d. These words do not imply that a purely accidental or temporary situation of the victim, at that time, should alone be considered. While the courts should take into account an apparent character of permanency in the employment of the victim, on the other hand an arbitrary and artificial rule should not be adopted in determining the indemnity claimed under the Act, such as a period of twelve months before the accident. Every case should be determined according to its peculiar circumstances; the courts must weigh them, and, with regard to same, the law does not prescribe any special period of time.\nUnder the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 274, s. 4), \u201cwhen the accident causes death, the compensation shall consist of a sum equal to four times the average yearly wages of the deceased at the time of the accident.\u201d The phrase \u201cyearly wages\u201d in this section has the same meaning as \u201cthe wages upon which the rent is based\u201d in section 9. In the case of a workman not \u201cengaged in the business during the twelve months next before the accident,\u201d whose kind of work was necessarily limited to the summer time, and where therefore there were no workmen of the same class engaged during the time necessary to complete the twelve months, the work of the deceased must be held to have been \u201cnot continuous\u201d; and his yearly wages shall be calculated both according to the remuneration received while he worked for the employer and according to his earnings elsewhere during the rest of the year.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Tessier J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action for $2,726.96, under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nP. St. Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la somme de $2,726.96, \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 274). Elle soul\u00e8ve deux objections \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre elle.\nPremi\u00e8rement. L\u2019accident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019action a caus\u00e9 la mort d\u2019Armand Beaudet, le fils de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante. La premi\u00e8re question est de savoir si le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait le principal soutien de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au moment de cet accident (section 4 de la loi) et l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas.\nLe sens de l\u2019expression \u201cle principal soutien\u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini par cette cour dans la cause de Laroche v. Wayagamac Pulp & Paper Company[1]. Cette definition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les tribunaux de Qu\u00e9bec et n\u2019est plus en discussion; mais le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a jug\u00e9 que\npour d\u00e9terminer si la victime a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0, l\u2019entretien et au soutien de l\u2019ascendant pour au del\u00e0 de cinquante pour cent, il faut prendre comme base de calcul la p\u00e9riode de douze mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019accident;\npuis, appliquant ce principe aux faits de la cause, il en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que\nlors de l\u2019accident, la victime n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le principal soutien de la demanderesse; et, en cons\u00e9quence, il a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re des fins de son action.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, et nous sommes d\u2019accord avec elle.\nPour d\u00e9cider si la victime d\u2019un accident du travail \u00e9tait le principal soutien de l\u2019ascendant, qui poursuit en indemnit\u00e9, on ne saurait s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de temps fixe et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nLa loi indique l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il faut se placer; \u201cau moment de l\u2019accident\u201d. Cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il faille se baser sur un \u00e9tat de choses passager et accidentel. Il faut sans doute tenir compte seulement d\u2019une situation \u00e9tablie et qui a un certain caract\u00e8re de dur\u00e9e; mais il ne faut pas, d\u2019autre part, adopter une r\u00e8gle arbitraire et factice. Chaque cas doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 suivant ses circonstances particuli\u00e8res. Le tribunal doit les peser; et la loi, pour cela, ne l\u2019assujetit \u00e0 aucune limite de temps particuli\u00e8re.\nLe cas actuel fournit un exemple du danger qu\u2019il y aurait \u00e0 adopter le principe rigide qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL\u2019accident a eu lieu le 21 juin 1927. En remontant d\u2019une ann\u00e9e en arri\u00e8re, on constate que depuis le 21 juin jusqu\u2019au 26 octobre 1926 l\u2019intim\u00e9e demeurait avec ses enfants et son mari, \u00e0 Donnelly, dans la province d\u2019Alberta, et que celui-ci pourvoyait \u00e0 leur entretien. Le 26 octobre 1926, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00fb laisser son mari pour cause de mauvais traitements. Depuis lors, elle n\u2019a plus entendu parler de lui. Il ne lui a rien fourni pour sa subsistance; et elle ne sait m\u00eame pas o\u00f9 il est.\nApr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de Donnelly, il y a eu une p\u00e9riode d\u2019incertitude pendant laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e logea chez sa s\u0153ur, \u00e0 Port-Alfred, avec son plus jeune fils. Ses deux filles, engag\u00e9es comme servantes, lui fournissaient le peu qu\u2019elles pouvaient \u00e9conomiser et l\u2019aidaient \u00e0 faire face aux besoins les plus n\u00e9cessaires.\nMais d\u00e8s que l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 des fils, Armand (qui fut plus tard la victime de l\u2019accident dont il s\u2019agit), se rendit compte des conditions qui r\u00e9sultaient de la s\u00e9paration de son p\u00e8re et de sa m\u00e8re, il comprit en m\u00eame temps son devoir et il d\u00e9cida de le remplir. Il remit \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re l\u2019argent dont elle avait besoin pour se rendre de Donnelly au Lac Saint-Jean; et il fut convenu qu\u2019il irait la rejoindre \u201cau plus t\u00f4t, pour prendre maison\u201d. Il a envoy\u00e9 quelque argent durant l\u2019hiver; mais il \u00e9tait surtout pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 de garder son salaire pour se former le montant requis afin d\u2019aller la retrouver. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il fit au mois de mars 1927. A partir de son arriv\u00e9e, il devient r\u00e9ellement le chef de la famille. Tout change. On loue une maison; on la meuble. Armand trouve rapidement de l\u2019ouvrage; et, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort, il remet \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re tout son gain, soit: $179.12 depuis le 19 mars, date de son retour aupr\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re, jusqu\u2019au 21 juin, date de sa mort.\nIl est \u00e9vident, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce r\u00e9cit des faits, que l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019accident pr\u00e9sente trois p\u00e9riodes distinctes: celle pendant laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e demeurait avec son mari et ce dernier la faisait vivre; la p\u00e9riode interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019installation \u00e0 Port-Alfred; et celle qui a commenc\u00e9 lorsque Armand a rejoint sa m\u00e8re dans ce dernier endroit.\nDe ce moment, une nouvelle situation s\u2019est \u00e9tablie, toute diff\u00e9rente de la premi\u00e8re et de la seconde p\u00e9riode. L\u2019existence de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement modifi\u00e9e et n\u2019avait plus rien de commun avec les circonstances qui l\u2019entouraient avant son d\u00e9part de Donnelly, ou avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de son fils aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle. La situation qui existait \u201cau moment de l\u2019accident\u201d \u00e9tait celle qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par son fils Armand \u00e0 partir du 19 mars 1927. C\u2019est donc celle-l\u00e0 seule qu\u2019il fallait envisager pour rester dans l\u2019esprit du statut. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a fait la Cour du Banc du Roi, et nous approuvons son interpr\u00e9tation de la loi.\nPour le reste, il ne s\u2019agit que de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve. L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit r\u00e9form\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle partait du principe erron\u00e9 en droit qu\u2019il fallait \u201cprendre comme base de calcul la p\u00e9riode de douze mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019accident\u201d. Il nous para\u00eet, au contraire, que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la Cour du Banc du Roi est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur et est justifi\u00e9e par le dossier. Nous croirions m\u00eame qu\u2019elle est trop favorable \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, parce qu\u2019elle suppose que les deux jeunes filles, Rollande et Anita, ont remis \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re des montants mensuels fixes jusqu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident, alors que la part de contribution de Rollande est plut\u00f4t impr\u00e9cise. Elle \u201cdonnait ce qu\u2019elle pouvait\u201d. Quant \u00e0 Anita, elle n\u2019a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 en service apr\u00e8s avoir laiss\u00e9 Monsieur et Madame Brenigan, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire depuis la fin d\u2019avril ou le commencement de mai; plut\u00f4t depuis la fin d\u2019avril, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans son t\u00e9moignage dit:\nOn a pris maison au mois d\u2019avril, et elle (Anita) \u00e9tait chez nous dans le temps.\nLa preuve est qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 depuis lors jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019Armand et que, par cons\u00e9quent, en mai et juin, elle n\u2019a rien contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la subsistance de sa m\u00e8re.\nComme la Cour du Banc du Roi, il faut donc d\u00e9cider que \u201cau moment de l\u2019accident\u201d Armand, \u201cle d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait le principal soutien\u201d de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement. L\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi. C\u2019est encore la section 4 du statut qu\u2019il faut interpr\u00e9ter sur ce point:\nLorsque l\u2019accident a caus\u00e9 la mort, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 comprend une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 quatre fois le salaire moyen annuel du d\u00e9funt au moment de l\u2019accident, ne devant, dans aucun cas, sauf le cas mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 6, \u00eatre moindre que mille cinq cents dollars, ni exc\u00e9der trois mille dollars.\nL\u2019article 6, auquel ce paragraphe r\u00e9f\u00e8re, a trait \u00e0 la faute intentionnelle de la victime, ou \u00e0 la faute inexcusable de l\u2019ouvrier ou du patron. Il n\u2019a donc aucune application ici.\nComme on le voit, il s\u2019agit du sens des mots: \u201cle salaire moyen annuel du d\u00e9funt au moment de l\u2019accident\u201d.\nLa loi d\u00e9clare dans la section 9 ce qu\u2019elle entend par \u201cle salaire servant de base \u00e0 la fixation des rentes\u201d. Aucun autre mode de calcul n\u2019est indiqu\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir le montant des indemnit\u00e9s, en cas de mort de la victime. D\u2019autre part, il n\u2019y a pas de raison pour qu\u2019on adopte un mode diff\u00e9rent (Voir: Dallaire vs. Quebec Salvage Company[2], confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi[3].\nVoici comment se lit la section 9 de la loi (en omettant le quatri\u00e8me paragraphe, qui ne peut entrer en ligne de compte dans la pr\u00e9sente cause):\n9. Le salaire servant de base \u00e0 la fixation des rentes s\u2019entend, pour \u013eouvner occup\u00e9 dans l\u2019entreprise pendant les douze mois \u00e9coul\u00e9s avant \u013eaccident, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 allou\u00e9e pendant ce temps, soit en argent soit en nature.\nPour les ouvriers occup\u00e9s pendant moins de douze mois avant l\u2019accident, il doit s\u2019entendre de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7ue depuis leur entr\u00e9e dans l\u2019entreprise, augment\u00e9e de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne qu\u2019ont re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois, les ouvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie. Si le travail n\u2019est pas continue, le salaire annuel est calcul\u00e9 tant d\u2019apr\u00e8s ja r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019activit\u00e9 que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le gain de l\u2019ouvrier pendant le reste de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\nArmand Beaudet, au moment de l\u2019accident, \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 au d\u00e9chargement des barges qui transportaient le bois de pulpe \u00e0 Port-Alfred. Il fut \u201coccup\u00e9 dans l\u2019entreprise\u201d seulement pendant le mois de juin, et il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201coccup\u00e9\u201d \u00e0 un autre travail que celui-l\u00e0. Il ne tombe donc pas sous l\u2019effet du premier paragraphe de la section 9.\nD\u2019autre part, de toute \u00e9vidence, le d\u00e9chargement des barges \u00e9tait forc\u00e9ment limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de navigation dans la r\u00e9gion de Port-Alfred. Les ouvriers employ\u00e9s \u00e0 ce travail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas occup\u00e9s pendant les douze mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019accident et il ne pouvait donc y avoir dans l\u2019entreprise des \u201couvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie\u201d, dont \u201c la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne * * * pendant la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter les douze mois\u201d p\u00fbt \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la \u201cr\u00e9mun\u00e9ration effective\u201d recue par Armand Beaudet \u201cdepuis son entr\u00e9e dans l\u2019entreprise\u201d. Par \u201couvriers de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie, on doit entendre ceux qui dans un \u00e9tablissement industriel ont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame emploi et touchent le m\u00eame salaire que la victime\u201d (Sachet, Accidents du travail, 6\u00e8me \u00e9d. n\u00b0 854). Ici, par la force m\u00eame des circonstances, il n\u2019y avait aucun des ouvriers \u201cde la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie\u201d que Armand Beaudet qui re\u00e7\u00fbt de l\u2019appelante un salaire annuel int\u00e9gral. Il s\u2019ensuit que le second paragraphe de la section 9, pas plus que le premier, ne peut \u00eatre utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour le calcul du salaire de base.\nNous pouvons supposer (quoique la preuve ne l\u2019\u00e9tablisse pas) que l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019appelante ne ch\u00f4mait pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement pendant une partie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, mais le seul travail auquel f\u00fbt employ\u00e9 la victime n\u2019\u00e9tait pas continu. Dans ce cas, c\u2019est le paragraphe 3 de la section 9 qui s\u2019applique.\nNous croyons donc que, pour les fins de la cause, \u201cle \u201csalaire moyen annuel du d\u00e9funt\u201d devait \u00eatre \u201ccalcul\u00e9 \u201ctant d\u2019apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue pendant la p\u00e9riode \u201cd\u2019activit\u00e9 que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le gain de l\u2019ouvrier pendant le reste \u201cde l\u2019ann\u00e9e\u201d.\nComme l\u2019a fait remarquer Monsieur le Juge Tellier dont les chiffres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s par les autres juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, en adoptant cette r\u00e8gle, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 exc\u00e9derait le montant de $2,726.96 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. On est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette somme en prenant le taux du salaire journalier le jour de l\u2019accident et le nombre de jour de travail de la victime, \u00e0 Port-Alfred; puis, en multipliant ce taux journalier par ce nombre de jours de travail. Le montant ainsi obtenu repr\u00e9sentait le salaire re\u00e7u pendant trois mois. On a adopt\u00e9 cette base pour d\u00e9terminer \u201cle salaire moyen annuel du d\u00e9funt au moment de \u013eaccident\u201d \u00e0 $669.24. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 allou\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi comprend une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 quatre fois le salaire moyen annuel ainsi \u00e9tabli, plus $50 pour les frais de m\u00e9decin et de fun\u00e9railles, suivant les prescriptions de la section 4 de la loi.\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 e\u00fbt certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 plus forte si on l\u2019avait calcul\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 3 de la section 9 de la loi. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a donc pas lieu de se plaindre.\nSur les deux points qu\u2019elle a soulev\u00e9s, nous sommes d\u2019avis que son appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi est, en cons\u00e9quence, confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Place, Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett & Foster.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Boulianne & Martel.\n[1] (1923) S.C.R. 476.\n[2] Q.R.49 S.C. 503.\n[3] Q.R. 26 \u041a.B. 253.\n",

Ernest Lefaivre (Trustee) Respondent;\nand\nNeuville Belleau (Insolvent).\n1930: April 30; 1930: May 1; 1930: June 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nStock broker\u2014Orders on New York exchange to Canadian broker\u2014Certificates of stock\u2014Endorsement in blank\u2014Recovery from trustee in bankruptcy\u2014Right to follow proceeds of sale\u2014Not existing in Quebec\u2014Arts. 1017, 1705, 1709, 1713, 1723, 1730, 1735, 1976, 1985, 1994, 2005a C.C.\nOders to sell or to buy shares negotiated on the New York stock exchange, given to a Canadian broker who has no seat on that foreign exchange, must be taken to have been given upon the assumption that the Canadian broker would deal with those shares through New York brokers; and it is an implied condition of the orders that the transactions will be carried out under the rules and customs of the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe endorsement in blank by the customer of the certificates of stock is sufficient to confer to the stock broker an apparent authorization to make use of the certificates for all purposes (C.C. 1730).\nA customer who, upon giving such orders to a Canadian broker, delivered to the latter his certificates of stock endorsed in blank, has no right to revendicate them from the trustee in bankruptcy, after the Canadian broker became bankrupt, unless the certificates can still be identified in the hands of the trustee; and then, only upon paying the trustee all sums due and disbursed on behalf of the customer.\nMore particularly has the customer no right to revendicate the certificates when it is shown that they were merged in a credit and debit account between the Canadian broker and the New York stock brokers, in which all transactions on behalf of the Canadian broker\u2019s customers were dealt with in the sole name of the Canadian broker.\nUnder those circumstances, the customer\u2019s stock became security for the whole of the New York brokers\u2019 account; and, upon that account being liquidated, if there should remain a surplus standing to the credit of the bankrupt Canadian broker, no individual customer may claim, out of this surplus, an amount alleged to represent his stock; but such surplus must be distributed between the customers of the Canadian broker pro rata and according to bankruptcy rules.\nIn Quebec, there exists no right to follow (droit de suivre) the proceeds of the sale of a thing, except under art. 2005a C.C., which deals with a special case.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Sir. F. X. Lemieux C.J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition to recover from the respondent, as trustee in the bankruptcy of one Belleau, stock broker, certificates of stock.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nRobert Taschereau and Antoine Rivara for the appellant.\nJ. L. Perron K.C. and Ls. St-Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014Nous allons t\u00e2cher d\u2019analyser les faits essentiels de cette cause aussi minutieusement que possible, car\u2014ainsi que d\u00e9j\u00e0 le laissait entendre l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef de cette cour en autorisant le pourvoi en appel\u2014il semble bien que les divergences d\u2019opinione qui se sont rencontr\u00e9es en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc du Roi proviennent d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes de la preuve plut\u00f4t que de points de vue oppos\u00e9s sur les questions de droit.\nM. Neuville Belleau \u00e9tait, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, un agent de change ou un courtier. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait son client depuis quelques ann\u00e9es.\nLe 8 septembre 1926, l\u2019appelant remit \u00e0 Belleau des certificats repr\u00e9sentant 100 actions de Union Pacific, 50 actions de New York Central et 200 actions de Wabash. Que les certificats des autres actions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps que ceux du Wabash est un fait certain. Il est \u00e9tabli par Belleau et son employ\u00e9 Dion, et il est contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par les entr\u00e9es dans les livres.\nEn passant, nous signalerons donc que la cause de l\u2019appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme si la transaction, ce jour-l\u00e0, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 restreinte aux seules actions du Wabash. Ainsi que nous le verrons, elle embrassait tous les certificats apport\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps et il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas tout \u00e0 fait l\u2019aspect auquel Grondin a voulu la limiter dans ses proc\u00e9dures.\nLes instructions \u00e9taient de vendre \u00e0 certains prix fix\u00e9s les valeurs ainsi remises et d\u2019acheter d\u2019autres valeurs. \u201cCe n\u2019\u00e9tait pas avec le Wabash particuli\u00e8rement, c\u2019\u00e9tait avec toutes les valeurs \u201c, dit l\u2019appelant, marquant ainsi lui-m\u00eame la nature collective de la transaction. Et, dans son t\u00e9moignage, il caract\u00e9rise le r\u00f4le que jouaient les valeurs qui devaient \u00eatre vendues \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celles qui devaient \u00eatre achet\u00e9es:\nQ. Votre compte \u00e9tait suffisamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9?\nR. Il \u00e9tait plus que prot\u00e9g\u00e9. De tout l\u2019argent que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u cent cinquante (150) parts de St-Louis & San Francisco qui repr\u00e9sentaient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s\u2014\u00e0 cent un (101)\u2014je pense, \u00e7\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu quinze mille piastres ($15,000), et puis j\u2019ai d\u00fb lui donner pour vingt-cinq mille piastres \u00e0 trente mille piastres ($25,000 \u00e0 $30,000), je ne peux pas dire exactement.\nQ. En argent?\nR. En valeurs qu\u2019il a vendues ou devait acheter.\nQ. Il appliquait cela \u00e0 votre compte sp\u00e9culatif?\nR. Non, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mon compte sp\u00e9culatif. Je lui donnais de l\u2019argent pour acheter telle, telle chose, telle valeur\u2026\nQ. (Par Me A. Galipeault, C.R.) De l\u2019argent ou des valeurs?\nR. Des valeurs qu\u2019il a converties en argent.\n* * *\nR. Je payais avec les valeurs qu\u2019il a vendues.\nQ. Mais cela c\u2019est une autre transaction, \u00e0 part de la transaction du Wabash?\nR. Cela n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec cela.\nQ. Vous aviez des valeurs suffisamment pour payer toutes les valeurs que vous aviez achet\u00e9es, \u00e0 part du montant du Wabash. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le produit de la vente du Wabash n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour acheter les autres valeurs que vous avez achet\u00e9es?\nR. Cela, je ne suis pas capable de dire cela. Parce que j\u2019achetais * * * J\u2019aurais d\u00fb recevoir les choses, mais je ne les ai pas re\u00e7ues.\nOn remarque la tentative, dont nous parlions plus haut, de s\u00e9parer les actions Wabash d\u2019avec les autres valeurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 8 septembre, mais, d\u00e8s la suite de l\u2019interrogatoire, les choses sont r\u00e9tablies: Q. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, toutes les valeurs qu\u2019il (Belleau) avait en mains venant de vous devaient \u00eatre vendues par lui, n\u2019est-ce pas, pour en acheter d\u2019autres?\nR. Oui.\nLa signification de cette admission est que, entre les mains de Belleau, les certificats devenaient de l\u2019argent avec lequel il devait faire l\u2019acquisition des autres valeurs qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u instructions d\u2019acheter, \u00e0 la seule restriction que ces certificats seraient compt\u00e9s \u00e0 un prix respectivement fix\u00e9 pour chacun d\u2019eux.\nLes valeurs que l\u2019appelant donnait ordre d\u2019acheter pour lui \u00e9taient: 125 actions de Pan-American Petroleum, 300 actions Royal Dutch Petroleum et 150 actions de St-Louis et San Francisco. En prenant le prix exact du co\u00fbt d\u2019achat charg\u00e9 \u00e0 Grondin dans les livres\u2014car, d\u00e8s les 8, 9 et 10 septembre, tout l\u2019ordre d\u2019achat \u00e9tait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9\u2014ces valeurs repr\u00e9sentaient une somme de $39,568.75. \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas de doute\u201d\u2014comme le dit M. Dion\u2014\u201dqu\u2019il y aurait eu un certain montant de demand\u00e9, en argent, pour couvrir ou pour payer les valeurs\u201d, si en m\u00eame temps que Grondin donnait ses instructions d\u2019acheter, il n\u2019avait pas remis les actions d\u2019Union Pacific, de New York Central et de Wabash. Ges actions constituaient le fonds avec lequel Belleau \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d\u2019acheter. Converties en argent par la vente au prix indiqu\u00e9, elles le remboursaient des avances faites pour les achats effectu\u00e9s. En attendant d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi converties, elles pouvaient \u00eatre trait\u00e9es comme de l\u2019argent et, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, restaient garantes pour les avances ainsi faites sur la foi des actions ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. Suivant l\u2019expression de Belleau: \u201c\u00c7a servait de garantie collat\u00e9rale en attendant.\u201d Cela est conforme aux \u201cusages bien connus de la Bourse\u201d, tels qu\u2019ils sont \u00e9tablis dans la cause. Nous ajouterons: c\u2019est l\u00e0 la nature de la transaction du 8 septembre entre Grondin et Belleau, telle qu\u2019elle se d\u00e9duit de ce qui s\u2019est dit et de ce qui s\u2019est fait.\nAussi, les certificats remis par Grondin\u2014et qui \u00e9taient des titres nominatifs\u2014furent-ils par lui endoss\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, \u201cpour qu\u2019ils soient n\u00e9gociables\u201d, admet Grondin lui-m\u00eame.\nLes valeurs dont il fut question le 8 septembre\u2014celles qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019acheter comme ceifes qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de vendre\u2014se n\u00e9gociaient exclusivement sur les march\u00e9s des Etats-Unis. Il est raisonnable d\u2019affirmer que les parties pour leurs transactions avaient en vue la bourse de New-York. Belleau n\u2019\u00e9tant pas un agent de change accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette bourse, il s\u2019ensuivait que, \u00e0 la connaissance de Grondin et comme cons\u00e9quence du mandat confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Belleau, ce dernier emploierait des courtiers de New-York, et les relations d\u2019affaires entre ces courtiers et le mandataire Belleau seraient r\u00e9gies par les r\u00e8gles et les usages de la bourse de New-York. On peut dire que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une condition implicite de la convention (art. 1017 C.C.).\nIl y a, au dossier, une preuve de ces r\u00e8gles et usages. Elle est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les courtiers de New-York, en recevant les certificats endoss\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, comme l\u2019\u00e9taient ceux du Dr Grondin, les envoient aux agents de transfert pour les faire mettre \u00e0 leur nom ou au nom d\u2019une autre maison de New-York, et qu\u2019il est d\u2019habitude de s\u2019en servir dans leur finance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la transaction ait \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et termin\u00e9e avec leur client.\nRien dans la preuve que nous avons devant nous ne laisse pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement dans le cas qui nous occupe, mais (bien que toutes les circonstances nous justifieraient de l\u2019assumer) nous n\u2019en tiendrons pas compte dans notre d\u00e9cision.\nIl reste acquis que Grondin savait que Belleau serait forc\u00e9 d\u2019employer des courtiers de New-York et, en lui confiant son mandat, il l\u2019investissait, sans les sp\u00e9cifier, de tous les pouvoirs qui, dans le cours ordinaire des affaires, s\u2019inf\u00e9raient de la nature m\u00eame de ce mandat (art. 1705 C.C.).\nLes courtiers de Belleau, \u00e0 New-York, \u00e9taient MM. Post & Flagg. Belleau avait avec eux un arrangement au moyen duquel il n\u00e9gociait sur les march\u00e9s des Etats-Unis toutes les affaires de ses clients. Un seul compte \u00e9tait ouvert au nom de N. Belleau & Co., qui seuls \u00e9taient connus de Post & Flagg. Toutes les transactions de bourse aux Etats-Unis confi\u00e9es \u00e0 la maison Belleau \u00e9taient transig\u00e9es par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Post & Flagg, qui achetaient et vendaient au propre nom et pour le compte de Belleau uniquement.\nCe compte est produit depuis le 1er septembre 1926 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa cl\u00f4ture apr\u00e8s la faillite. On y voit les achats, les ventes, les cr\u00e9dits, les d\u00e9bits, les titres re\u00e7us, les titres en mains, les titres d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, les avances, les paiements, etc., etc., tous entr\u00e9s chronologiquement, en traitant Belleau comme le seul et unique client, sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 aucun des mandants de Belleau et sans la moindre marque d\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui avaient confi\u00e9 les titres \u00e0 Belleau. C\u0435la constituait un compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019avoir et de d\u00e9bit qui, en droit, ne pouvait se liquider autrement que par une reddition de compte, pour \u00e9tablir la balance qui reviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019un ou \u00e0 l\u2019autre des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nPost & Flagg, recevant des titres ou valeurs de la maison Belleau, endoss\u00e9s en blanc, ne savaient pas et n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 savoir \u00e0 qui ils appartenaient. L\u2019endos g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tait suffisant pour conf\u00e9rer une autorisation apparente \u00e0 toutes fins (art. 1730 C.C.). Et de m\u00eame que les achats ou les titres d\u00e9livr\u00e9s ou les avances de fonds ou les ch\u00e8ques exp\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e9taient d\u00e9bit\u00e9s au compte de Belleau; de m\u00eame les ventes, les titres re\u00e7us, ou l\u2019argent d\u00e9pos\u00e9 lui \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dit\u00e9s. Tout ce compte formait un ensemble dont chaque op\u00e9ration r\u00e9pondait l\u2019une pour l\u2019autre, les titres et les fonds en mains constituant la garantie collat\u00e9rale pour les avances, les achats et les remises d\u2019argent.\nC\u2019est ainsi que Belleau d\u00e9crit la nature de ses relations avec Post & Flagg. Mais le compte lui-m\u00eame est l\u00e0 et il est facile de constater que cela est exact.\nLes ordres d\u2019achat et de vente de Grondin furent imm\u00e9diatement transmis \u00e0 Post & Flagg par la maison Belleau, pas au nom de Grondin mais au nom de Belleau, suivant le cours ordinaire des affaires. Le m\u00eame jour (8 septembre), les 50 actions de New-York Central \u00e9taient vendues et 100 actions de St. Louis & San Francisco \u00e9taient achet\u00e9es par Post & Flagg. Le lendemain, tous les autres ordres d\u2019achat de Grondin \u00e9taient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, sauf 70 actions de Royal Dutch Petroleum qui ne furent achet\u00e9es que le 11 septembre. Dans les livres de la maison Belleau, cette vente et ces achats furent, d\u00e8s leurs dates, entr\u00e9s au compte de Grondin. A la suite de ces transactions, et en autant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait des affaires entre Grondin et Belleau, ce dernier apparaissait comme cr\u00e9ancier pour un montant de $25,128.13 et comme d\u00e9biteur de Grondin pour 100 actions Barnsdall, 100 Union Pacific, 200 Wabash, 125 Pan American Petroleum, 300 Royal Dutch et 150 St. Louis & San Francisco. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 de la tenue de livres.\nLes faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve sont que les certificats ou titres que Grondin avait endoss\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le 8 septembre furent, le soir m\u00eame et dans le cours ordinaire des affaires, exp\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 Post & Flagg, \u00e0 New-York, au nom et pour le compte de la maison Belleau et sans en aucune fa\u00e7on d\u00e9voiler le nom de Grondin. Et si maintenant nous nous reportons \u00e0 New-York, en envisageant cette fois les affaires entre la maison Belleau et Post & Flagg, nous constatons (sans nous occuper, comme nous le pourrions, des r\u00e8glements et usages de la bourse de New-York; mais uniquement en tenant compte des conventions prouv\u00e9es entre Belleau et Post & Flagg) que, \u00e0 ces dates, Post & Flagg achet\u00e8rent pour le compte de N. Belleau & Co. les actions St. Louis & San Francisco, et les Pan American et les Royal Dutch dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question, et qu\u2019ils vendirent 50 actions New York Central, et qu\u2019ils re\u00e7urent les certificats de New York Central, de Wabash et de Union Pacific.\nDans leurs livres, Post & Flagg d\u00e9bit\u00e8rent Belleau pour les achats faits et les cr\u00e9dit\u00e8rent pour les ventes ou pour les certificats d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. De cette fa\u00e7on et conform\u00e9ment aux conventions existant entre Belleau et Post & Flagg, les 100 actions de Union Pacific et fes 200 actions de Wabash devinrent englob\u00e9es dans le compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de N. Belleau & Co. (les 50 actions de New York Central ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues). En effet, \u00e0 la date du 11 septembre, on trouve les entr\u00e9es qui correspondent \u00e0 ces transactions. Il est possible\u2014il est m\u00eame probable, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la coutume \u00e9tablie \u2014que Post & Flagg firent transf\u00e9rer les certificats en leur nom. Il est suffisant de dire que, entre ces courtiers de New-York et la maison Belleau, ces certificats furent depuis ce moment d\u00e9tenus en garantie collat\u00e9rale du compte de Belleau et qu\u2019il devint d\u00e8s lors le droit absolu de Post & Flagg d\u2019en rendre compte non plus comme d\u2019une transaction isol\u00e9e et d\u00e9tach\u00e9e mais comme d\u2019une transaction faisant partie de l\u2019ensemble des op\u00e9rations entre les deux maisons. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une situation de fait prouv\u00e9e par Dion et admise par Belleau. Grondin peut contester le droit qu\u2019avait Belleau d\u2019en agir ainsi, mais il ne peut nier le fait que c\u2019est ainsi que les choses se sont pass\u00e9es.\nPour tout ce qui va suivre, m\u00eame pour les relations entre Post & Flagg et Belleau et leur effet en vertu des lois de New-York ou des Etats-Unis, nous pouvons nous guider sur la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, car il n\u2019y a au dossier aucune preuve de la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Belleau a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Post & Flagg un gage valide sur les actions de Grondin, en supposant toujours que les certificats eux-m\u00eames n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au nom de Post & Flagg. Comme nous l\u2019avons indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, ce pouvoir \u00e9tait implicitement compris dans son mandat (art. 1705 C.C.). Mais, \u00e9cartant au besoin cette premi\u00e8re raison, ce pouvoir lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ostensiblement octroy\u00e9 par Grondin en endossant les certificats g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement (art. 1730 C.C.). De plus, nous sommes d\u2019accord avec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi pour dire que cette mise en gage \u00e9tait valable en vertu des articles du code civil concernant les courtiers, facteurs et autres agents de commerce (arts. 1735 et suivants).\nTelle \u00e9tait donc la situation \u00e0 la date du 11 septembre 1926; et telle elle est rest\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la faillite de Belleau, le 27 novembre 1926. Dans l\u2019intervalle, les 100 actions de Union Pacific avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues et cr\u00e9dit en fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Grondin; mais cela n\u2019affecte pas le pr\u00e9sent litige. Cette situation, on le remarque, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Grondin lui-m\u00eame, et elle r\u00e9sulte de la nature m\u00eame de ses relations avec Belleau. Elle existait avant la faillite. Elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re; au contraire, la faillite en a h\u00e9rit\u00e9. Le syndic intim\u00e9 n\u2019y a en rien particip\u00e9: c\u2019est un \u00e9tat de choses qui lui est d\u00e9volu avec tous les droits et les obligations qu\u2019il pouvait comporter.\nLe syndic n\u2019a donc pas eu la possession des actions Wabash et encore moins celle des certificats d\u00e9pos\u00e9s le 8 septembre par Grondin et qui font l\u2019objet de sa requ\u00eate en revendication. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi des droits que Belleau lui-m\u00eame aurait pu exercer et, vis-\u00e0-vis de Grondin, il est devenu responsable des obligations ou des dettes de Belleau, mais dans la mesure seulement o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9tat de faillite survenu depuis et la loi de faillite lui permettaient de les satisfaire.\nQuels, sont donc les droits qui, de cette situation, d\u00e9coulaient en faveur de l\u2019appelant?\nIl aurait pu avant la faillite exiger de Belleau, son mandataire, une reddition de compte et obtenir un jugement pour le reliquat \u00e9tabli en sa faveur, s\u2019il y en avait un. M\u00eame pendant que Belleau avait encore le certificat du Wabash en sa possession, Grondin pouvait en exiger la remise, mais \u00e0 la condition de rembourser \u00e0 Belleau \u201cses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et son d\u00fb \u00e0 raison de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du mandat \u201c (arts. 1713, 1723 C.C.). A la date de la faillite, le montant en \u00e9tait de $8,378.28. Ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la vente des actions Union Pacific, ce montant avait atteint environ $25,000.\nApr\u00e8s que le certificat du Wabash e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Post & Flagg, Grondin ne pouvait plus le revendiquer de ces derniers purement et simplement, car ils avaient acquis une possession l\u00e9gale et qu\u2019ils pouvaient valablement lui opposer. Exer\u00e7ant peut-\u00eatre les droits de Belleau, Grondin e\u00fbt pu obtenir de Post & Flagg la remise de son certificat, s\u2019il \u00e9tait encore susceptible d\u2019identification entre leurs mains, mais toujours \u00e0 la condition de payer \u00e0 ces derniers le montant de leurs d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et avances \u00e0 la maison Belleau (arts. 1713, 1723 C.C.). Et cela voulait dire le montant du compte total, car le gage est indivisible (art. 1976 C.C.). Du 8 septembre au 26 novembre, ce montant a oscill\u00e9 entre $434,730.39 et $353,315.23. U suffit de mentionner la chose pour d\u00e9montrer combien elle \u00e9tait hors de question.\nGrondin pouvait encore tenter une action en dommages contre Belleau, s\u2019il pr\u00e9tendait que celui-ci avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 son mandat et avait ill\u00e9galement engag\u00e9 les actions Wabash (art. 1709 C.C.).\nCe sont l\u00e0, croyons-nous, les seuls recours qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 sa disposition. Il n\u2019en a adopt\u00e9 aucun; mais ce qu\u2019il est surtout important de constater, c\u2019est que aucun de ces recours ne correspond \u00e0 celui qu\u2019il veut maintenant faire accueillir contre le syndic.\nEn plus, il ne faut pas oublier que ces recours ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s, et que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 en a \u00e9t\u00e9 diminu\u00e9e par suite de l\u2019\u00e9tat de faillite qui est survenu. Toutefois, il est certain que Grondin n\u2019a pas plus de droit contre le syndic qu\u2019il n\u2019en avait contre Belleau. U s\u2019ensuit que sa requ\u00eate actuelle, qui n\u2019aurait pu r\u00e9ussir contre Belleau, peut encore moins \u00eatre maintenue contre le syndic, et que la Cour d\u2019Appel a eu raison de la rejeter.\nLe syndic n\u2019a jamais eu la possession du certificat de Wabash. Par la faillite de Belleau, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi des droits de ce dernier contre Post & Flagg. Ces droits consistaient \u00e0 obtenir une reddition de compte \u00e0 l\u2019amiable ou en justice. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait la plus d\u00e9sirable et la plus pratique. C\u2019est celle qui \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9e par l\u2019ordonnance du Registraire en date du 3 d\u00e9cembre 1926. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel de cette ordonnance (Loi de faillite\u2014art. 159-3, R\u00e8gle 67) et la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 on l\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 de la reddition de compte faite au syndic par Post & Flagg ne sont pas attaqu\u00e9es, ni mises en doute. Bien au contraire, l\u2019appelant adopte le montant de $14,800 auquel ses actions Wabash sont suppos\u00e9es avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues. La liquidation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on a produit un surplus qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au syndic. Ce surplus constitue un fonds commun. Il est certain que Grondin n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une partie sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e de ce fonds. Aucune portion sp\u00e9ciale du reliquat de compte vers\u00e9 par Post & Flagg entre les mains du syndic n\u2019est directement attribuable \u00e0 la vente des actions. Wabash qui appartenaient \u00e0 Grondin. \u0420\u043eur revendiquer ses certificats, m\u00eame en remboursant Post & Flagg, il \u00e9tait essentiel que l\u2019appelant p\u00fbt les retracer et les identifier. Nous ne croyons pas que cette identification soit \u00e9vidente dans le dossier que nous avons devant nous.\nD\u2019autre part, les 200 actions Wabash de Grondin ne sont pas les seules actions de cette compagnie que Post & Flagg aient re\u00e7ues de Belleau ou qui aient fait l\u2019objet de transactions entre les deux maisons. On en trouve d\u2019autres dans l\u2019\u00e9tat de compte qui est produit. La veille du jour o\u00f9 figure \u013eentr\u00e9e qui para\u00eet se rapporter aux actions de l\u2019appelant, on voit (10 sept.) une autre entr\u00e9e pour 100 Wabash re\u00e7ues. Mais, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, les valeurs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 successivement vendues pour liquider le compte appartenaient indiff\u00e9remment \u00e0 tous les clients de Belleau, au m\u00eame titre que les Wabash appartenaient \u00e0 Grondin. \u201cC\u2019\u00e9taient toutes des valeurs de clients qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0\u201d, affirme le syndic. Ces valeurs, la preuve l\u2019\u00e9tablit, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 Post & Flagg au moyen d\u2019une \u201ctransaction identique \u00e0 celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le cas du Wabash, les parts du Dr Grondin\u201d. C\u2019est le produit global de la vente de toutes ces valeurs qui a servi \u00e0 les d\u00e9gager et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le fonds commun dont le syndic dispose, apr\u00e8s avoir liquid\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement le compte de Post & Flagg. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il n\u2019existe pas de droit r\u00e9el ou droit de suite sur l\u2019argent ou le prix provenant de l\u2019ali\u00e9nation d\u2019une chose. Exceptionnellement, le propri\u00e9taire de la chose qui \u013ea pr\u00eat\u00e9e, lou\u00e9e ou donn\u00e9e en gage, et qui n\u2019en a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 la vente, a droit d\u2019en toucher le produit apr\u00e8s collocation des cr\u00e9ances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux articles 1995 et 1996, et de ce qui est d\u00fb au locateur (art. 1994 C.C., parag. 8a; art. 2005a C.C.).\nIci, le moms qu\u2019on puisse dire c\u2019est que ce droit appartient \u00e0 tous les clients de Belleau dont les valeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues dans les m\u00eames conditions que celles de l\u2019appelant et dont le produit a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 former le fonds commun et indivis (art. 1985 C.C.). Nous ne voulons pas nous prononcer l\u00e0-dessus, car il ne serait pas \u00e9quitable que, dans cette cause o\u00f9 les seuls droits de Grondin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s, le jugement d\u00e9cide des questions dans lesquelles tous les autres cr\u00e9anciers de Belleau peuvent avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nIl est au moins un fait acquis, c\u2019est que le fonds venant de Post & Flagg est insuffisant pour payer tous les cr\u00e9anciers qui sont dans le m\u00eame cas que l\u2019appelant. Reconna\u00eetre, comme il le demande par sa requ\u00eate, son droit d \u00eatre pay\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame ce fonds du plein montant de sa cr\u00e9ance, ce serait le traiter par pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence alors que ses co-cr\u00e9anciers ne pourraient plus recevoir qu\u2019une partie de ce qui leur est d\u00fb. En d\u2019autres termes, ce serait autoriser pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que la Loi de Faillite a pour but d\u2019emp\u00eacher. L\u2019appelant se heurte au fait mat\u00e9riel que son d\u00e9biteur est en faillite et que tous ceux qui sont dans son cas doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s sur le m\u00eame pied. A cette fin, la proc\u00e9dure indiqu\u00e9e par la loi est le bordereau de distribution. (Loi de Faillite, art. 37.) Comme chacun des cr\u00e9anciers aura le droit de contester ce bordereau de distribution, et qu\u2019aucun d\u2019eux n\u2019a eu l\u2019occasion en cette cause de faire valoir ses pr\u00e9tentions individuelles, nous devons nous abstenir d\u2019exprimer une opinion sur la fa\u00e7on dont la distribution devra se faire. Toutes ces questions restent ouvertes. Ce que nous en avons dit \u00e9tait simplement pour d\u00e9montrer que la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Ses droits sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour discussion sur le bordereau de distribution; et l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chauveau, Rivard & Blais.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Galipeault, Boisvert & Galipeault.\n",

Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nThomas E. Walsh K.C. and George Gogo K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The defendant appeals from the judgment of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench modifying, but only as to the amount allowed, the judgment of Weir J. upholding the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nThe action was brought by the natural mother of David Hough, who was killed, as the plaintiff alleged, by the negligence of the defendant. In the view we take of the matter, the existence or non-existence of negligence is of little consequence. Upon that point, however, as at present advised, we should not be prepared to disturb the judgment of the Superior Court, affirmed, as it has been, by the majority (4-1) of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe principal grounds of appeal to this court are:\nthat the respondent had no legal claim for alimentary support upon the late David Hough as her natural son; and\nthat the death of David Hough was not due to any negligence on the part of the appellant, but was due to his own fault.\nUpon the second ground, as already stated, we will not interfere. The true question upon this branch of the case is not as to the weight of evidence in support of the judgment maintaining liability, but rather as to whether there is any evidence to justify the finding of negligence against the defendant and the inferences on which that finding rests. The appellant undertakes an almost impossible task when he seeks to convince us, in the face of opinions to the contrary already expressed by the learned trial judge and four judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that there is no such evidence. In our opinion, there is evidence which, if believed, was sufficient to justify the inferences drawn by the trial judge on which he based his finding of negligence; and there is also enough to warrant his having acquitted the victim of the .accident of any contributory negligence. Nor is the balance of the testimony so clearly and overwhelmingly against the plaintiff that we would be justified on that ground in setting aside the concurrent judgments below. These questions really depend on the appreciation of the evidence, both as to its veracity and as to the inferences of fact to which it gives rise. They were eminently matters for the consideration of the trial judge in the first instance; and, his views upon them having been; affirmed on appeal, error therein must be demonstrated to our satisfaction in order to justify interference. This is the settled jurisprudence of this court. Such error has not been demonstrated; interference, therefore, on this aspect of the case is out of the question.\nIn regard to the quantum of damages allowed\u2014$4,500 at the trial, reduced to $2,500 in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, there was in the latter court considerable divergence of views. Guerin J. would affirm the judgment as it was; Allard J. would reduce the damages to the amount allowed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, $2,500; Lafontaine C.J. did not discuss the matter, but probably agreed with one or the other of these two; L\u00e9tourneau J., on the other hand, would reduce the recovery to $500; and Hall J. would dismiss the action, or, if compelled to allow damages, would make a reduction to $750. The practice of this court is not to interfere in the quantum of damages fixed by a provincial court of appeal, unless error in regard to the principle on which they have been assessed is shewn, or there is really no evidence to warrant the allowance. Here no error in principle is established; and the matter is merely one of appreciation of the sufficiency of the evidence, i.e., whether its weight was adequate to sustain the amount of the award. Following our usual practice in such matters, although, were the matter res integra, we would probably have given a smaller sum, we should, we think, decline to interfere with the amount allowed for damages.\nAs to the first ground of appeal, it was suggested from the bench to counsel for the appellant that the real basis of attack on the judgment against his client is not the alleged lack of legal right on the part of the plaintiff to alimentary support from her natural son, but the fact that, as merely his natural mother, she is not within the purview of art. 1056 C.C., on which she must base her right of action.\nAs was stated to counsel for the respondent in the course of the argument, it seems abundantly clear that the only right of action which the respondent can have must be based on that article, and that, under art. 1053 C.C., she can have no claim for \u201cdamages occasioned by the death\u201d of her son. It may well be that, were there no art. 1056 C.C., the terms of art. 1053 C.C. would be deemed in se sufficiently wide to cover a claim for damages caused by the death of one killed through fault of the defendant, as has been held in France (where they have no provision corresponding to art. 1056 C.C.) in regard to the scope of arts. 1382-3 C.N., which cover substantially the same field as art. 1053 C.C. But the presence in the Civil Code of Quebec of art. 1056, providing expressly for the case of \u201cdamages occasioned by death\u201d and directing that there shall be but one action, which is to embrace all the damages caused by such death, makes it clear that the intention of the legislature was to restrict claims for \u201cdamages occasioned by death\u201d to cases within the purview of that article and to preclude actions under art. 1053 C.C. for such claims. (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[3]). So far, at all events, the matter may be regarded as settled in this court by the views to that effect unanimously expressed in Regent Taxi & Transport Co., Ltd. v. Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[4].\nMoreover, the plaintiff\u2019s claim being under art. 1056 C.C., of which Lord Campbel\u013es Act was the prototype (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[5]), prima facie at least, the basis for estimating the damages recoverable in this action (common fault having been excluded) should be the same as under the English statute (City Bank v. Barrow[6]). Of course, as was pointed out in Miller v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[7], Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent[8] and elsewhere, there are, in other respects, noteworthy differences between the provisions of art. 1056 C.C. and those of Lord Campbel\u013es Act (Regent Taxi & Transport Co., Ltd. v. Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[9]; but we do not find anything in art. 1056 C.C. to justify our treating it as affording, to a plaintiff in Quebec, only some basis on which his damages must be estimated less liberal than that afforded by Lord Campbel\u013es Act. Under that statute in England, and as adopted in Ontario, it is well settled that, while there can be no recovery for anything except actual loss susceptible of pecuniary appraisal sustained by the plaintiff and those whom he represents (Jennings v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.)[10], \u201ca reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit\u201d from the continued life of the deceased is all that a plaintiff need show in order to found a claim for damages, a legal right on his part against the deceased to alimentary support or otherwise, being unnecessary. (Mayne on Damages (10th ed.), p. 516, note (b)). The jurisprudence under art. 1056 C.C. is to the same effect. Thus, it was early settled that damages recoverable under that article do not include anything by way of compensation for solatium doloris as distinct from pecuniary loss (Montreal v. Labelle[11]; Jeannotte v. Couillard[12]; Bouchard v. Gauthier[13]; and it is equally well established that a reasonable expectation, on the part of the plaintiff, of advantage from the deceased, the worth of which is estimable in money, suffices in an action against a wrongdoer responsible for the death of the victim of his fault (Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Lachance[14]; Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Robinson[15]; Bernard v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[16]; Hunter v. Gingras[17]; Dumphy v. Montreal L.H. & P. Co.[18].\nWe find Mr. Justice Duff, with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Girouard, in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Lachance[19], at p. 208, after alluding to the question of the right to solatium, saying,\nThe jury may unquestionably take into consideration every other loss and every other disadvantage which are in the natural and ordinary course attributable to the death out of which the action arises and can fairly be appraised in money.\nAnd I added, with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Idington, (p. 209),\nIf the only element for consideration in estimating the damages in this case were the actual wages or earnings of the deceased, the task of the appellants in impeaching the verdict would be less difficult. But for loss of his services at home\u2014of his care and protection of his wife and family\u2014Of his assistance in husbanding the family resources\u2014for the loss of these and other kindred and substantial benefits and advantages, of which the death of the husband and father has deprived them, the plaintiffs were justified in asking compensation from the which declares them entitled to recover \u201call damages occasioned by such death.\u201d\nWe are accordingly of the opinion that upon the first ground of appeal, as stated, the appeal cannot succeed.\nIt may be that, under the common law of Quebec, compensation in the case of death might have included an allowance for solatium doloris (Ravary v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[20]; Hunter v. Gingras[21]. It is also possible that a legal right to alimentary support, or something of the kind, from the deceased victim of the defendant\u2019s fault was essential to enable the plaintiff to sue.\nBut, under the common law of Scotland, which, we are assured by Mr. Justice Aylwin in the Ravary case[22], was, in these matters, \u201cidentical with\u201d that of Quebec, the right to solatium was not recognized (or, in other words, the law did not recognize the supposed feeling of affection on the assumed injury to which that right to solatium was founded), except in the case of husband and wife, or ascendants and descendants. It did not recognize the right of collaterals to pursue an action for reparation of wrong done them on the ground of solatium, even though they were, as sisters, dependent upon their deceased brother for patrimonial support, since that dependence and that interest are quite irrespective of relationship and may exist where there is no relationship at all (Eisten v. North British Ry. Co.[23].\nAs the Lord President (Inglis) observed in that case,\nIt appears \u2018to me that the true foundation of this claim is partly nearness of relationship between the deceased and the person claiming on account of the death, and partly the existence during life, as between the deceased and the claimant, of a mutual obligation of support in case of necessity. On these two considerations in combination our law has held that a person standing in one of these relations (i.e., husband, wife, father, mother or lawful child) to the deceased may sue an action like this for solatium, where he can qualify no real damage, and for pecuniary loss in addition, where such loss can be proved.\nThis passage was cited with approval by Lord Young in Weir v. Coltness Iron Co., Ltd.[24].\nQuebec, however, is, in this matter, no longer under the regime of the common law, but is under a statutory provision, viz., art. 1056 C.C.; and it is on the construction of that article that the right of the plaintiff to maintain the present action must depend.\nWe have dwelt at considerable length upon the two grounds of appeal taken and discussed at bar to make it clear that neither of them affords a reason for setting aside the judgment appealed against and that it is, accordingly, necessary (Art. 10 C.C.), in order to dispose of this appeal, to consider the broader question suggested from the Bench (the negative of which counsel for the appellant tacitly declined to argue), viz., whether a natural mother is a \u201cm\u00e8re,\u201d or, an \u201cascendant relation,\u201d within the meaning of those terms as used in art. 1056 C.C., and its converse, whether an illegitimate son is an \u201cenfant,\u201d or a \u201cdescendant relation,\u201d within the purview of the same article. This attitude of counsel probably accounts for the status of the plaintiff having apparently been taken for granted in the provincial courts (Mignault, Droit Civil, vol. 1, p. 108; but see Japiot, Proc. Civ. et Com., (1929 ed.) no. 160; McFarran v. The Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. [25]. The learned judges in the Court of King\u2019s Bench appear to have devoted their attention largely to a consideration of the question whether or not the plaintiff had a legal claim for alimentary support upon the deceased, her natural son, the majority concluding that she had such a claim; and, on that ground, they maintained her status to sue. Mr. Justice Hall, who dissented, took the opposite view of this point and based his conclusion that the plaintiff had no status chiefly, if not solely, upon that ground, But it seems immaterial whether the plaintiff had, or had not, a legal claim for alimentary support, since she had, in fact, a reasonable expectation, of receiving support in future from her deceased natural son.\nThe amendment of 1930 (20 Geo. V, c. 98, s. 1) not being retroactive, it is still advisable, in cases such as this arising before that date, to consider both the English and the French versions of art. 1056 C.C. in dealing with this question.\nIn this connection it is necessary to bear in mind that the statute, as originally enacted (Can. 10-11 Vic, c. 6; C.S.C. 1859, \u0441. 78), which was applicable to both Upper Canada and Lower Canada and was the predecessor of art. 1056 C.C., contained a definition (s. 6), which gave the word \u201cparent\u201d there used a meaning that included \u201cfather and mother, grandfather and grandmother, stepfather and step-mother,\u201d and to the word \u201cchild\u201d a meaning (1) (1900) 30 Can. S.C.R. 410. that included \u201cson and daughter, grandson and granddaughter, step-son and step-daughter.\u201d This corresponded to s. 5 of the original Lord Campbel\u013es Act (9-10 Vic. Imp., c. 63). Indeed, the Canadian Act of 1847 is practically a verbatim copy of the Imperial Act of 1846, except that the latter did not contain anything equivalent to s. 3 of the Canadian Act, which had to do with duels, etc. But the interpretation clause has now disappeared and we are left to deal with the words of art. 1056 C.C. without its aid.\nIn England it was early decided, in Dickenson v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[26], that an illegitimate child is not within the statute (9-10 Vic, c. 93), Pollock C.B., saying,\nI am of opinion that no rule should be granted, for I do not entertain any doubt that the word \u201cchild\u201d in the Act means legitimate child.\nBramwell \u0412., Channel \u0412., and Pigott \u0412., concurred.\nThis decision was in accordance with the well established rule of English law that, where the word \u201cchild\u201d is used, either in a private document or in an Act of Parliament, it connotes, as a rule, a legitimate child only; and, conversely, where the words \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d are used they signify lawful parents only. (R. v. Totley[27]; R. v. Birmingham[28]; R. v. Maude[29]; Hill v. Crook[30]; Donn v. Dorin[31]. In Helton v. Lidlyneh[32], Lee C.J. said,\nI know of no case that considers bastards as the children of anyone.\nand Chappie J. concurring, said,\nThe word \u201cchildren\u201d in this Act (8-9 Wm. III, c. 30) must mean legitimate children.\nand Wright J. added that\nIn the case of New Windsor v. White W altham[33], the court declared that \u201cillegitimate children were nobody\u2019s children.\u201d\nThe same idea prevailed in France (Ferri\u00e8re, Diet, de Dr., vbo. \u201cEnfants\u201d) S. 52, 2, 35; P. 51, 1,660.\nWe can conceive of no reason why a different intention should be imputed to the legislature of Quebec. It would be a libel on that province to suggest that (except, perhaps, in the particular covered by art. 237, discussed below,) illegitimacy is there less disfavoured by law than it is in England, or in any province of Canada whose legal system is based on the English common law. Moreover, as Lord Sumner observed in Quebec Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry[34], speaking of arts. 1053 and 1054 C.C.,\nthe statutory character of the Civil Code of Lower Canada must always be borne in mind * * *, (It) is and always must be remembered to be the language of a legislature established within the British Empire.\nAnd, to adapt and apply language used of Art. 1056 C.C. by Viscount Haldane, in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parent[35],\n*The presumption to be made is that in enacting art. 1056 the Quebec Legislature meant, as an act of the Imperial Parliament would be construed as meaning, to confine the special remedy conferred to cases of (claims by legitimate parents and children). There is, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, nothing in the context of the chapter of the Code in which the article occurs which displaces this presumption of its construction. The rule of interpretation is a natural one where law, as in the case of both Quebec and England (is based upon fundamental Christian morality). No doubt the Quebec legislature could impose many obligations in respect of (illegitimate children and natural parents); but, in the case of art. 1056 there does not appear to exist any sufficient reason for holding that it has intended to do so, and by so doing to place claims for torts committed (against illegitimates) in Quebec on a footing differing from that on which the general rule of (fundamental morality observed in the Imperial Parliament) would place them.\nWhen, therefore, the legislature of Quebec speaks of father, mother and children (\u201cp\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants\u201d) it must be taken to mean thereby, in the absence of clear indication to the contrary, lawful father, lawful mother and legitimate children, i.e., father and mother joined in lawful wedlock and the children of such a union. Indeed, the code itself suggests that this view prevailed with the legislature in enacting it. Thus, amongst the obligations arising from marriage, we find, by art. 166 C.C., that\nChildren are bound to maintain their father, mother and other ascendants, who are in want.\nAnd, by art. 168 C.C., it is declared that\nThe obligations which result from these provisions are reciprocal.\nNevertheless, in order to extend their application, even partially, to illegitimate children, it was thought necessary to provide, as was done by art. 240 C.C., that\nThe forced or voluntary acknowledgment by the father or mother of their illegitimate child, gives the latter the right to demand maintenance from each of them according to circumstances. So, it is seen that when the Code deals with illegitimate children it does so specifically and does not include them under the general description of children. There is no counterpart of art. 168 C.C. applicable to art. 240 C.C. Moreover, it will be noted that, whereas art. 166 C.C. declares the obligations of lawful children towards their parents, art. 240, conversely, declares the obligations of parents to their illegitimate children. If it were material, we would have to consider whether the dissenting opinion of Hall J., that no legal obligation for alimentary support of natural parents is imposed on their illegitimate children, should not prevail.\nThat the common law of Scotland also excluded from its description of \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d persons not joined in matrimony who had children, and from the term \u201cchildren\u201d their bastard progeny, is also abundantly clear. It was so decided in Weir v. Coltness Iron Co.[36], above cited, it being there held that\nthe mother of a bastard child has no title to sue an action of reparation in respect of his death.\nThis view was confirmed by the House of Lords in Clarke v. Carfin Coal Co.[37], where it was held that\na parent of an illegitimate child has, by the law of Scotland, no right of action against a person whose negligence has caused its death.\nI quote this significant passage from the judgment of Lord Watson (p. 418),\nAs matter of fact, it cannot be disputed that, although for a century past actions for solatium and damages have been sustained at the instance of husband, wife, or legitimate child, in respect of the death of a spouse, a child, or a parent, a similar action at the instance of a natural parent or child had never (with one exception, which appears to me to be of no moment) been heard of in the law of Scotland. In my opinion, the rule which admits the former class of suits does not rest upon any definite principle, capable of extension to other cases which may seem to be analagous; but constitutes an arbitrary exception from the general law which excludes all such actions founded in inveterate custom, and having no other ratio to support it. I venture to think that the Lord President in Eisten v. North British Rly. Co. did not mean to suggest that the rule (or rather the exception) was capable of being extended to cases other than those in which it had already been received. To my mind, it is evident that by \u201cnearness of relationship\u201d his lordship meant legal relationship; because he treats as an essential element of the pursuer\u2019s claim the right to demand solatium, which is a right to reparation for disruption of the family tie, and therefore impossible in the case of natural parent and child; and also because his lordship subsequently describes the connection between a bastard and his putative father as \u201cone which the law cannot recognize.\u201d\nIn Wood v. Gray & Son[38], Lord Watson, speaking of Clarke v. Carfin Coal Co.[39], said\nThe practical effect of your Lordships\u2019 decision was to limit the class to persons standing in the legitimate relation of husband, father, wife, mother or child, to the deceased. In Eisten v. North British Ry. Co.[40], which is the leading authority upon this branch of the law, the Lord President (Inglis) observed: \u201cAs the existence of such claims in our common law is a peculiarity of our system, it is not desirable to extend this class of actions, unless they can be justified on some principle which has already been established.\u201d In that observation, which has been repeatedly made, in different terms, by other judges of the Court of Session, I entirely concur.\nIt is, therefore, abundantly clear that, by the common law of Scotland (and by the common law of Quebec, if they be identical, as Mr. Justice Aylwin in Ravary\u2019s case[41], assures us that, in these matters, they are), the mother of an illegitimate child was not within the class of persons who were entitled to maintain actions for \u201cdamages occasioned by death.\u201d\nThat art. 1056 C.C. was intended to restrict, rather than to enlarge, the class of persons entitled to maintain such actions has been the basis of more than one judgment in Quebec. Thus in Hunter v. Gingras[42], we find that the head-note reads, in part, as follows:\nL\u2019article 1056 \u0421. civ., tir\u00e9 du chapitre 78 S. ref. du Canada, reproduisant la loi 10-11 Victoria, ch. 6, n\u2019a pas -cr\u00e9\u00e9 un recours l\u00e9gal qui n\u2019existait pas auparavant; il a simplement modifi\u00e9 ce recours qui existait en France depuis des si\u00e8cles, en le restreignant aux plus proches parents, en donnant \u00e0 ceux-ci une seule action, en \u00e9tablissant la prescription d\u2019un an, et en refusant le recours lorsque le d\u00e9funt lui-m\u00eame a obtenu compensation. * * *\nAgain, in St. Laurent v. La Cie de Telephone de Kamouraska[43], it was held that the action under art. 1056 C.C. belongs exclusively to the persons mentioned in the article\nqui est restrictif et doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre.\nThe court there decided that the stepfather had no cause of action under art. 1056 C.C. in his own right; but, being in community with his wife, he could, as head of the community, maintain an action on behalf of the community in her right. See too Bonin v. The King[44]. And, in Dionne v. La Compagnie des Chars Urbains[45], we find it held that an adopted child, not being recognized by the Civil Code, the adopting father could not claim damages for his death under art. 1056 C.C.\nAgain, in Gohier v. Allan[46], it was held that\nBy the terms of art. 1056 C.C. the only persons who have a right of action for the death of a person resulting from a quasi-delict, are his consort, and ascendant or descendant relatives; the brothers and sisters have no such right of action.\nThe plaintiffs failed in that case because they were not included within the enumeration of the persons entitled to maintain an action. (See, too, Ruest v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[47], and Tessier v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[48].\nIn Ruest v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., we find Mr. Justice McCord saying,\nBut no such action lies except under the terms of article 1056, the express inclusiveness of which excludes the right of any other persons than those therein mentioned. According to the terms of this article the \u201cconsort and ascendant and descendant relations\u201d can alone have the right to claim damages for death occasioned by quasi-offence.\nThis passage is explicitly approved by that great civilian, Strong J., in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[49].\nWhile there is a marked dearth of direct authority in the Quebec courts on the question at issue, there is, at least, one case in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Provost v. Jackson[50]), decided three years after the code was enacted, but upon the law as it stood before the code (as contained in C.S.C., c. 78), in which it was held, affirming the Superior Court in banco, which had agreed with the learned trial judge, that legal proof of the marriage of parents suing to recover damages for the death of their son was a sine qua non of the right to recover in the action. The point is put in these words by Johnson J. ad hoc (p. 170), with the concurrance of Duval C.J., \u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0443 A.J. and Torrance J. ad hoc,\nThe ground on which the Court goes is this: The statute gives a right of action to surviving parents in certain cases. Now, in the present case, the parents have not proved their relationship; therefore there is no right of action. and, as explained by \u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0443 A.J.,\nIt was absolutely necessary on the part of Provost and his wife to prove their marriage, and establish that the boy killed was their son . . . The judge who tried the case was, therefore, right in saying that the defendants need not enter on their case as the marriage of the parents and birth of the son had not been proved.\nThis means that a valid marriage was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action.\nCaron J., who alone dissented, appears to rest his opinion chiefly on the grounds that the general denial in the defendant\u2019s plea of the allegations of the plaintiffs (which included the facts of their own lawful marriage and of the filiation of the deceased victim) did not suffice to put those facts in issue (See Royal Institution Y.Picard[51]; and that they were, in any event, sufficiently established in the case.\nNor is there any difference in substance between the enacting language of the statute (C.S.C., c. 78, s. 2) (excluding from consideration s. 6), which required that\nevery such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused,\nand the terms of art. 1056 C.C., which enacts that\ndans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, * * * son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants ont * * * droit de poursuivre, etc.\nThere can be no reason whatever for holding that, while the father and mother bringing the action as \u201cparents,\u201d under s. 2 of C.S.C., c. 78, must have established that they were the lawful parents of the deceased victim by legal proof of their marriage, the like proof may be dispensed with where the right of action is given to the father and mother (\u201cp\u00e8re et m\u00e8re\u201d), as it is in the terms of art. 1056 C.C. (French version).\nProvost v. Jackson[52], must therefore, be regarded as a distinct authority supporting a, negative answer to the question under consideration. It is cited without any adverse comment by Strong J., at p. 109, and by Taschereau J., at p. 126, in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Robinson[53].\nThe following observation of Lord Watson, in Clarke v. Car fin Coal Co.[54], already quoted, seems to me to apply to the local situation, if the last word thereof be changed from \u201cScotland\u201d to \u201cQuebec.\u201d\nAs matter of fact, it cannot be disputed that, although for a century past actions for solatium and damages have been sustained at the instance of husband, wife, or legitimate child, in respect of the death of a spouse, a child, or a parent, a similar action at the instance of a natural parent or child had never (with one exception, which appears to me to be of no moment) been heard of in the law of Scotland.\nIndeed, the recorded jurisprudence of the province of Quebec, as well under art. 1056 C.C. as under the statute which prevailed before it, and under the common law, which preceded the statute, presents no parallel to Renton v. North British Railway Company[55], the solitary case (of first instance) in the Scottish reports so slightingly alluded to by Lord Watson.\nNor is the plight of the plaintiff better if regard be had to the terms of the English version of art. 1056 C.C., which gives the right of action to \u201cascendant and descendant relations.\u201d The words \u201crelations\u201d and \u201crelatives\u201d are, for the present purpose, synonymous and interchangeable (Murray\u2019s Oxford Dictionary, pp. 398-9); both prima facie, import the idea of legal or lawful relationship.\nWhen people speak of man or woman as brother or sister, son or daughter, unless they say something to the contrary, I think the meaning is legitimate son or daughter, brother or sister. (Smith v. Tebbitt[56], per Sir J. P. Wilde.)\nEither word, \u201crelations\u201d or \u201crelatives,\u201d may, if the circumstances or context necessarily imply that intention, include connections by blood only, i.e., illegitimate relations or relatives. Thus, we find Lord Herschell saying in Seale-Hayne v. J odreli[57], where, with the other members of the court, he found that there was enough clearly to indicate such intention,\nIt is of course not open to dispute that the word \u201crelatives\u201d according to its natural interpretation, if there were nothing to show that another meaning was to be attributed to it, would not include those who were what may be termed natural blood relations, but whose parents or grandparents were not born in wedlock, and who therefore were not in the eye of the law related to the testator. A like view was taken In re Wood[58], where the difficulty of importing such an intention is dealt with by Vaughan Williams L.J.; and In re Corsellis[59].\nAs illustrative of the strictness with which American courts construe the term \u201crelations\u201d when found in statutes dealing with their rights, reference may be had to Kimball v. Story[60], and Horton v. Earl[61]. In the former a step-son was held not to be a child or relation, within the meaning of Gen. Stats., c. 92, s. 28, which saved from lapsing, by predecease of the devisee or legatee, any devise or bequest made \u201cto a child or other relation\u201d of a testator; in the latter, a brother-in-law was held not to be a \u201crelation\u201d within a like provision of the Pub. Sts., c. 127; s. 23; and in both instances the bequests were held to have lapsed. (See also In re Renton\u2019s Estate[62]; and Smith v. Knights of Maccabees[63].\nIt would seem, therefore, equally clear, whether we take the French or the English version of art. 1056 C.C., that neither natural parents nor illegitimate children are within its purview.\nA somewhat ingenious suggestion was made in the course of consideration of this case, viz., that the plaintiff might invoke arts. 237 and 239 C.C. in aid of her status. These articles read as follows:\n237. Children born out of marriage, other than the issue of an incestuous or adulterous connection, are legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their father and mother.\n239. Children legitimated by a subsequent marriage have the same rights as if they were born of such marriage.\nBut there is here no evidence whatever to indicate that John Barnes, whom the plaintiff married some nine years after the birth of her natural son David Hough (to wit, on the 15th October, 1883), was his father. Had that been the case, the plaintiff would certainly have said so when obliged, in the course of her examination on commission, to admit that David Hough was her natural son. Moreover, in addition to the most significant fact that the deceased David Hough never took the name of Barnes but always adhered to his mother\u2019s maiden name, Hough, we have the testimony of George Barnes, a son born of the marriage of John Barnes with the plaintiff, and a witness for her, that David Hough was his half-brother, thus indicating that, although born of the same mother, they had been begotten by different fathers. There can be no presumption in favour of the paternity of John Barnes; and the burden of proving it rested on the plaintiff. (Provost v. Jackson[64]; see, too, art. 241 C.C.). The essential basis, therefore, for the application of art. 237 (Lahay v. Lahay[65]), viz., that David Hough was the son of John Barnes and Sarah Hough, is entirely lacking. In fact, the only fair inference from the evidence in the record is that John Barnes was not his father.\nIt was strongly urged at bar that a construction of art. 1056 C.C. excluding natural parents and illegitimate children savours of barbarism and would shock the sensibilities of persons holding enlightened views, and that, accordingly, the courts should give to it a construction more consistent with humane and liberal ideas. The short answer to this contention is that the courts must await the action of the legislature, whose exclusive province it is to determine what should be the law. Whatever may occur elsewhere (1929, Canadian Bar Review, vol. VII, p. 617) it would seem to be the plan of this \u201cCourt of Law and Equity\u201d (R.S.C. (1927), c. 35, s. 3), to give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed, not to make the law as they think it should be. Judicis est jur dicere, non dare.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed, but without costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the judgment of the Chief Justice, as well as those of Mr. Justice Rinfret and Mr. Justice Cannon. I have no doubt that the rule of interpretation which the law of Quebec requires us to apply to art. 1056 limits \u201cmother\u201d to women who stand towards a victim in a maternal relation recognized by the law. To put it more pointedly, the article does not admit the claim of a mother in respect of the death of an illegitimate child. One additional observation I feel obliged to make. We have before us a dry question of law, and I do not think it incumbent upon me to express either approval or condemnation of the well known traditional attitude of the common law, of England as well as of France, towards illegitimacy.\nWe are, in consequence, constrained to allow the appeal, but I agree with my brother Rinfret that the plaintiff should not be required to pay costs here or below.\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui \u00e9tait la demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a poursuivi l\u2019appelante, la ville de Montr\u00e9al-Ouest, pour lui r\u00e9clamer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de David Hough. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que David Hough \u00e9tait son fils et que la mort de ce dernier \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 la faute et \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de la ville et de ses employ\u00e9s.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Hough \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence des employ\u00e9s de la ville et a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une somme de $4,500 de dommages.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9; mais elle a r\u00e9duit le montant de la condamnation \u00e0 $2,500.\nDeux juges furent dissidents.

En outre, \u013eun d\u2019eux \u00e9tait \u010favis qu\u2019il y avait eu faute contributoire de la victime; et, de ce chef, il e\u00fbt fait une r\u00e9duction additionnelle.

(Art. 240 C.C.);\nmais la loi n\u2019accorde pas ce droit au p\u00e8re ou \u00e0 la m\u00e8re contre leur enfant naturel.

Il s\u2019ensuit que, le droit \u00e0 ce secours n\u2019existant pas dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e9clamation de \u013eintim\u00e9e manque de base l\u00e9gale.\nDevant cette cour, l\u2019appelante nous a soumis de nouveau qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable de l\u2019accident qui a caus\u00e9 la mort du fils de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; et, subsidiairement, que le montant des dommages accord\u00e9s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 sur une base erron\u00e9e. A l\u2019appui de cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention, elle invoquait cette th\u00e9orie que, dans les cas de filiation naturelle, la r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation alimentaire n\u2019existe, pas en faveur du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re.\nMais, au cours de l\u2019argument, il a surgi une question qui n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e ni devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ni devant la Cour du Banc du Roi. Cette question est de nature telle que, si elle est tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle met fin \u00e0 son action et il devient inutile de juger les autres points. C\u2019est donc l\u00e0 que nous devons porter d\u2019abord notre attention.\nL\u2019action est bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 1056 du code civil. Dans la cause de Regent Taxi & Transport Company v. La Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[66], les juges de cette cour ont exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que le recours auquel cet article pourvoit appartient exclusivement aux personnes qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es. Cette opinion \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 un certain nombre d\u2019arr\u00eats de la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec: St-Laurent v. Compagnie de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Kamouraska[67], Gohier v. Allan[68], Ruest v. Grand Trunk Co.[69], Lionne v. Compagnie des Chars Urbains[70], Tessier v. Grand Trunk Co.[71].\nC\u2019est aussi ce qui ressort du jugement de monsieur le juge-en-chef Lamothe dans la cause de Hunter v. Gingras[72].\nLa question qui se pose d\u00e8s l\u2019abord est donc celle-ci:\nLa m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant naturel est-elle une des personnes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019article 1056 du code civil?\nSi la r\u00e9ponse est dans la n\u00e9gative, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e des fins de son action. Ce moyen de d\u00e9fense, comme nous l\u2019avons dit, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante, et il ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 avant l\u2019audition \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame. Je crois que nous devons quand m\u00eame en tenir compte parce qu\u2019il affecte le droit m\u00eame de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recouvrer une indemnit\u00e9. Avant de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude de la d\u00e9fense, la cour doit n\u00e9cessairement se demander si le droit d\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Or, le point de droit qui nous occupe, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9, entra\u00eene le rejet de l\u2019action; et ce r\u00e9sultat s\u2019imposerait m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de d\u00e9fense au dossier.\nEn plus, par sa nature m\u00eame, la question rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re d\u2019ordre public qui emp\u00eacherait de l\u2019\u00e9carter pour la simple raison qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9fense, ni d\u00e9battue au cours du proc\u00e8s. Nous croyons de notre devoir d\u2019entrer dans l\u2019examen de cette question.\nDans cette cause-ci, il faut accepter le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est la m\u00e8re de la victime. Les deux cours qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9; et l\u2019appelante ne nous a pas demand\u00e9 de reviser les jugements sur ce point. Mais il est \u00e9galement admis de part et d\u2019autre qu\u2019elle est la m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant naturel. Peut-elle, dans ce cas, r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019article 1056 du code civil?\nIl ne suffit pas, pour r\u00e9pondre, de se borner au texte de l\u2019article; il faut l\u2019envisager dans son sens et dans son esprit; et, suivant l\u2019expression de Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des personnes, vol. 1, 3 \u00e9d., n\u00b0 258, il faut \u201creconstituer la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur\u201d.\nNous sommes contraints d\u2019admettre cependant que, en ce qui concerne l\u2019article 1056 du code civil, nous manquons de plusieurs des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s habituels d\u2019investigation auxiliaire. Il n\u2019y a pas dans le code Napol\u00e9on d\u2019article correspondant \u00e0 l\u2019article 1056, et nous n\u2019avons pas l\u2019avantage de pouvoir r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la jurisprudence des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais\u2014except\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre dans son application \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de droit qui est semblable dans son ensemble. On ne nous a cit\u00e9 aucun jugement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 la question soit discut\u00e9e. La cause de Provost v. Jackson (1)[73], qu\u2019on nous signale, ne me semble pas, en tout respect, constituer un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. D\u2019abord, c\u2019est une cause ant\u00e9rieure au code. Ensuite, il n\u2019appara\u00eet nulle part, dans le rapport de cette cause, que la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de la filiation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en question. La d\u00e9claration all\u00e9guait que du l\u00e9gitime mariage des demandeurs est n\u00e9 Joseph Pravost * * * laissant pour ses h\u00e9ritiers naturels et l\u00e9gitimes et ses plus proches parents, ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re etc.\nA l\u2019enqu\u00eate, les demandeurs n\u00e9glig\u00e8rent de prouver leur mariage et la filiation du d\u00e9funt, soit par la production d\u2019actes de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil, soit autrement. L\u2019un des moyens des d\u00e9fendeurs en appel \u00e9tait que\nles demandeurs n\u2019ont pas produit la meilleure preuve de leurs qualit\u00e9s prises en l\u2019action, savoir qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re du d\u00e9funt.\nDans les circonstances, mon humble opinion est que lorsque M. le juge MacKay dit:\nIn this case, it was absolutely necessary on the part of Provost and his wife to prove their marriage and establish that the boy killed was their son;\nlorsque M. le juge Johnson dit:\nNow, in the present case, the parents have not proved their relationship; therefore there is no right of action,\nni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019esprit la question de filiation l\u00e9gitime; mais ces passages de leurs jugements \u00e9quivalent tout simplement \u00e0 constater que les demandeurs n\u2019ont pas prouv\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de leur d\u00e9claration telle que faite.\nDe m\u00eame qu\u2019il para\u00eet y avoir dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec absence totale de jurisprudence sur le point que nous discutons, nous sommes \u00e9galement priv\u00e9s, pour p\u00e9n\u00e9trer la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur dans l\u2019article 1056, d\u2019un autre moyen d\u2019investigation, qui est de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au rapport des codifica-teurs. Ainsi que le faisait remarquer monsieur le juge Mignault, dans la cause de Regent Taxi[74], \u00e0 la page 683:\nL\u2019article 1056 est entr\u00e9 au code sans avoir pass\u00e9 par les rapports des codificateurs, et sans avoir figur\u00e9 parmi les amendements que la l\u00e9gislature fit au projet du code par la loi 29 Vict. c. 41.\nIl n\u2019est pas douteux que cet article tire son origine des statuts refondus du Canada de 1859, c. 78, qui reproduisent le statut 10-11 Vict., c. 6 (1847).\nEt Lord Watson, dans la cause de Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[75], signalait que ces statuts,\nthough not identical in expression, were the same in substance with the enactment of the English statute (9 & 10 Vict., c. 93) commonly known as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act.\nCela peut justifier de donner aux expressions qui se trouvent \u00e0 la fois dans l\u2019article 1056 du code civil et dans le Lord Campbell\u2019s Act le sens qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence anglaise. Il para\u00eet \u00e9vident que, en vertu de cette jurisprudence, la m\u00e8re \u010fun enfant naturel n\u2019aurait pas de recours en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nMais, dans Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[76], au passage que nous venons de citer, Lord Watson ajoutait (p. 487) que, sous certains rapports,\nthe terms of section 1056 appear to their Lordships to differ substantially from the provisions of the Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and of the provisions of the statute of 1859.\nLes observations de Lord Davey, dans la cause de Miller v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[77] vont encore plus loin et consid\u00e8rent qu\u2019on ne serait pas en droit\nin assuming -this (i.e., une action en vertu de l\u2019article 1056) to be a proceeding to be governed by the law applicable to actions under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act (p. 48).\nJe pr\u00e9f\u00e8re donc appuyer mon jugement sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation interne de la loi. (Voir Geny, M\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, 2e \u00e9d., vol. 1, p. 25.)\nEn ins\u00e9rant dans le code un principe inspir\u00e9 d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de droit diff\u00e9rent, il est raisonnable de croire que les termes dont le l\u00e9gislateur s\u2019est servi doivent \u00eatre entendus suivant la signification qu\u2019ils ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans la tradition doctrinale et dans le langage juridique du pays. Les mots \u201cp\u00e8re\u201d, \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d et \u201cenfants\u201d dans l\u2019article 1056 ne peuvent pas avoir pris dans la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur du Qu\u00e9bec un sens diff\u00e9rent de celui qu\u2019ils ont dans les autres articles du code.\nOr, nous pouvons affirmer, croyons-nous, que chaque fois que ces mots sont employ\u00e9s seuls dans le code, except\u00e9 lorsque le texte impose une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente, ils r\u00e9f\u00e8rent exclusivement \u00e0 la paternit\u00e9, \u00e0 la maternit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la filiation l\u00e9gitimes. Si le mot \u201cenfant\u201d, par exemple, dans l\u2019article 54 du code civil, doit sans doute comprendre \u00e0 la fois les enfants l\u00e9gitimes et les enfants naturels, \u00e0 cause de la nature m\u00eame de la prescription qu\u2019il contient, il nous para\u00eet certain que dans tous les autres cas o\u00f9 il se trouve seul dans le code, et, en particulier, dans le chapitre des successions, il signifie exclusivement les enfants l\u00e9gitimes. Comme cons\u00e9quence, les mots \u201cp\u00e8re\u201d et \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d signifient exclusivement le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant l\u00e9gitime. Cette intention du l\u00e9gislateur est sp\u00e9cialement marqu\u00e9e dans le contraste entre le chapitre du code qui traite des obligations qui naissent du mariage et celui qui traite des enfants naturels. L\u2019article 166 dit que\nles enfants doivent des aliments \u00e0 leurs p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et autres ascendants qui sont dans le besoin.\nSi les mots \u201cenfants\u201d, \u201cp\u00e8re\u201d et \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d employ\u00e9s dans cet article visaient \u00e0 la fois la parent\u00e9 l\u00e9gitime et la parent\u00e9 naturelle, l\u2019article 240 n\u2019aurait plus sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Il est \u00e0 remarquer, au contraire, que le l\u00e9gislateur, dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 l\u2019enfant naturel le droit de r\u00e9clamer des aliments, a cru devoir \u00e9dicter cet article sp\u00e9cial et, de plus, qu\u2019il y a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u013eenfant ill\u00e9gitime par les mots \u201cenfant naturel\u201d, indiquant bien par l\u00e0 que ce dernier n\u2019est pas compris par l\u2019emploi du mot \u201cenfant\u201d seul. L\u2019article 239 vient compl\u00e9ter cet argument en \u00e9dictant que seuls les enfants l\u00e9gitim\u00e9s par le mariage subs\u00e9quent ont les m\u00eames droits que les enfants n\u00e9s du mariage. Toute l\u2019\u00e9conomie du code civil est \u00e9difi\u00e9e sur le principe de la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de la filiation; et les droits r\u00e9sultant de la filiation naturelle, ou des relations entre les p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants naturels sont trait\u00e9s \u00e0 part dans des articles distincts.\nCette observation, d\u2019ailleurs, ne s\u2019applique pas seulement au code civil. Il est tr\u00e8s important de noter que dans la loi des Accidents du travail (S.R.Q. 1925, c. 274) qui traite d\u2019un sujet connexe aux articles 1053 et 1056 du code civil, lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur parle de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, il s\u2019exprime comme suit (art. 4):\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 est payable de la mani\u00e8re suivante:\n* * * * *\n2. aux enfants l\u00e9gitimes ou aux enfants naturels reconnus avant l\u2019accident, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 aider \u00e0 pourvoir \u00e0 leurs besoins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de seize ans r\u00e9volus, ou plus s\u2019ils sont invalides.\nOn voit donc que lorsque l\u2019intention est d\u2019inclure les enfants naturels dans une disposition de la loi dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, cette intention est manifest\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on expresse.\nLa cons\u00e9quence qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9duire g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de cette constatation est qu\u2019il en est de m\u00eame lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur emploie les mots \u201cp\u00e8re\u201d ou \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d seuls.\nPar surcro\u00eet, cette interpr\u00e9tation est conforme \u00e0 la tradition historique et doctrinale. C\u2019est ainsi que l\u2019envisagent Ferri\u00e8re et Merlin. Pothier (edition Bugnet, vol. 8, Substitutions, n\u00b0 67) dit:\n67. Ce terme \u201cenfants\u201d, soit dans la disposition, soit dans la condition, ne comprend que les enfants l\u00e9gitimes et ceux qui jouissent de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil. Les b\u00e2tards n\u2019y sont pas compris etc.\nLaurent, dans ses Principes de droit civil, au volume 4, conclut dans le m\u00eame sens que Pothier. Il se demande s\u2019il y a une analogie entre la filiation naturelle et la filiation l\u00e9gitime. Il r\u00e9pond que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les principes sont contraires il ne peut pas y avoir d\u2019analogie. Les textes diff\u00e8rent, et \u013eesprit de la loi encore bien plus (p. 7). L\u2019enfant naturel a une filiation aussi bien que l\u2019enfant l\u00e9gitime; mais cette filiation n\u2019est reconnue par la loi que dans la limite fix\u00e9e par elle (p. 11). \u201cL\u2019esprit qui anime le code\u201d, ajoute-il, \u201cest un esprit moral\u201d, et le code traite les enfants naturels diff\u00e9remment afin d\u2019honorer le mariage. Plus loin (p. 43), il parle de la d\u00e9faveur dont la loi frappe la filiation ill\u00e9gitime et la restreint dans les limites les plus \u00e9troites \u201cparce qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une esp\u00e8ce de tache\u201d.\nCette constatation elle-m\u00eame conduit au principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s ancien que toute l\u00e9gislation a pour base principale \u201cl\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et l\u2019utile\u201d et qu\u2019on s\u2019\u00e9carte de la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur chaque fois qu\u2019entre diverses significations possibles on admet celle qui n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 ce principe (Delisle, Principes de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, vol. 1, p. 10).\nPour les raisons que je viens d\u2019exposer, j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant naturel n\u2019est pas comprise dans l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration des personnes qui peuvent recouvrer en vertu de l\u2019article 1056 du code civil. Il s\u2019ensuit que, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019action de la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nMais l\u2019appelante r\u00e9ussit par suite d\u2019un moyen qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 et qui e\u00fbt mis fin \u00e0 la cause d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but des proc\u00e9dures, s\u2019il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 en temps utile. Dans les circonstances, je serais d\u2019avis de n\u2019accorder de frais \u00e0 l\u2019appelante dans aucune des cours.\nCannon J.\u2014Sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la m\u00e8re qui, hors mariage, a port\u00e9 et mis au monde un enfant qu\u2019elle a reconnu peut r\u00e9clamer des aliments de ce fils naturel, le jugement en cette cause d\u00e9pend du sens que comportent les mots \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d et \u201cenfants\u201d dans la version fran\u00e7aise de \u013earticle 1056 du code civil, tel qu\u2019il se lisait avant la modification apport\u00e9e par 20 Geo. V., c. 98. Oet article 1056 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 dans le rapport des codificateurs charg\u00e9s de codifier les lois du Bas-Canada.\nLe pr\u00e9ambule du chapitre II des Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada (concernant la codification des lois du Bas-Canada qui se rapportent aux mati\u00e8re civiles et \u00e0 proc\u00e9dure) constate, en 1865, que les lois du Bas-Canada, en mati\u00e8re civile, \u00e9taient celles qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la cession du pays \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019Angleterre, \u00e9taient suivies dans cette partie de la France r\u00e9gie par la Coutume de Paris; que ces lois et coutumes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es en France et r\u00e9duites \u00e0 un code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de mani\u00e8re que les anciennes lois encore suivies dans le Bas-Canada n\u2019\u00e9taient plus ni r\u00e9imprim\u00e9es ni comment\u00e9es en France, et qu\u2019il devenait de plus en plus difficile d\u2019en obtenir des exemplaires et des commentaires. Ce pr\u00e9ambule constate de plus que nos lois civiles avaient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es par l\u2019introduction de certaines parties des lois d\u2019Angleterre dans des cas sp\u00e9ciaux.\nLe paragraphe 6 ordonnait aux commissaires, en r\u00e9digeant le code civil, de n\u2019y incorporer que les dispositions qu\u2019ils tiendront pour \u00eatre alors r\u00e9ellement en force et de citer les autorit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils s\u2019appuieraient pour juger qu\u2019elles l\u2019\u00e9taient.\nComme je l\u2019ai dit plus haut, le rapport des commissaires ne contenant pas cet article 1056, nous devons nous contenter de constater qu\u2019il fait partie de l\u2019acte 29 Vict., c. 41, \u201cconcernant le code civil du Bas-Canada\u201d, dont le pr\u00e9ambule d\u00e9clare que les commissaires se sont en tout point conform\u00e9s aux exigences de la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et que le projet, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement adopt\u00e9 par les deux chambres, le code tel que contenu dans . le r\u00f4le d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du greffier du conseil l\u00e9gislatif aura force de loi au Canada du jour plus tard fix\u00e9 par proclamation, savoir, le ler ao\u00fbt 1866.\nLe savant juge-en-chef de cette cour a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de quelle fa\u00e7on les tribunaux de l\u2019Angleterre, d\u00e8s avant et depuis cette date, avaient appliqu\u00e9 le Lord Campbel\u013es Act, qui est certainement un statut anglais introduit substantiellement dans la l\u00e9gislation civile du Bas-Canada par le parlement des provinces unies. J\u2019ai cru bon cependant de constater quelle interpr\u00e9tation on donnait aux mots \u201cm\u00e8re\u201d et \u201cenfant\u201d dans l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, avant les changements introduits par la R\u00e9volution et le Code Napol\u00e9on.\nFerri\u00e8re, Dictionnaire de Droit, vbo. \u201cenfants\u201d, dit:\nOn n\u2019entend ordinairement par le nom d\u2019enfants que ceux qui sont l\u00e9gitimes, car ce qui caract\u00e9rise un enfant, c\u2019est d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9 d\u2019un p\u00e8re et d\u2019une m\u00e8re unis par un mariage public: Filius est qui ex viro & uxore nascitur simul commorantibus, scientibus vicinis, aut qui legitimatus est subsequenti matrimonio.\nA l\u2019\u00e9gard des b\u00e2tards, on ne leur donne le nom d\u2019enfants qu\u2019en ajoutant quelque qualification, comme celle d\u2019enfants naturels ou autre qui distingue leur condition de celle des enfants l\u00e9gitimes, surtout quand il s\u2019agit de succession ab intestat: comme ils n\u2019y ont aucune part, ils ne sont pas compris sous le nom d\u2019enfants, non plus que quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019autres droits inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 la famille.\nIl suffit de lire les articles de notre code civil pour constater que, lorsqu\u2019on veut y parler des b\u00e2tards, on a ajout\u00e9, comme le dit Ferri\u00e8re, la qualification d\u2019enfants naturels, ou autre expression distinctive:\n121. L\u2019enfant naturel qui n\u2019a pas atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de vingt et un ans r\u00e9volus, doit, pour se marier, y \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 par un tuteur ad hoc qui lui est nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet.\n218. L\u2019enfant con\u00e7u pendant le mariage est l\u00e9gitime et a pour p\u00e8re le mari * * *.\n237. Les enfants n\u00e9s hors mariage, autres que ceux n\u00e9s d\u2019un commerce incestueux ou adult\u00e9rin, sont l\u00e9gitim\u00e9s par le mariage subs\u00e9quent de leurs p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re.\n240. La reconnaissance volontaire ou forc\u00e9e par le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re de leur enfant naturel, donne \u00e0 ce dernier le droit de r\u00e9clamer des aliments contre chacun d\u2019eux, suivant les circonstances.\n768. Les donations entrevifs faites par le donataire \u00e0 celui ou \u00e0 celle avec qui il a v\u00e9cu en concubinage, et \u00e0 ses enfants incestueux ou adult\u00e9rins, sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 des aliments.\n(Cette prohibition ne s\u2019applique pas aux donations faites par contrat de mariage intervenu entre les concubinaires.\nLes autres enfants ill\u00e9gitimes peuvent recevoir des donations entrevifs comme toutes autres personnes).\nFerri\u00e8re, dito, vbo. \u201cL\u00e9gitime\u201d:\nSe dit de celui qui est n\u00e9 en l\u00e9gitime mariage.\nDito, vbo. \u201cIll\u00e9gitime\u201d:\nOn appelle celui qui est n\u00e9 d\u2019une conjonction r\u00e9prouv\u00e9e, ou non autoris\u00e9e par les lois, un enfant ill\u00e9gitime.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, cet article 1056 a eu pour effet de limiter \u00e0 certains membres de la parent\u00e9 de la victime le recours qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s 1053, aurait pu \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par tous ceux souffrant des dommages \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit causant la mort. Aussi longtemps que notre l\u00e9gislation conservera le christianisme et sa morale comme base et r\u00e9prouvera \u013eunion libre, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il faudra limiter aux p\u00e8res et m\u00e8res d\u2019enfants l\u00e9gitimes le recours de 1056.\nJe cite Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire de jurisprudence, vbo. b\u00e2tard:\nDans l\u2019ordre de la nature, la condition des b\u00e2tards et des enfants l\u00e9gitimes est la m\u00eame, puisqu\u2019ils sont tous enfants du m\u00eame sang; mais elle est in\u00e9gale dans le droit civil qui prononce contre les b\u00e2tards, non seulement l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de succ\u00e9der \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re, mais m\u00eame de recevoir de lui des dons et legs consid\u00e9rables: on regarde ces sortes de personnes comme n\u2019\u00e9tant d\u2019aucune famille et n\u2019ayant point de parents: c\u2019est la loi civile qui \u00e9tablit cette diff\u00e9rence entre les b\u00e2tards et les l\u00e9gitimes: c\u2019est elle seule qui leur impose une peine \u00e0 cause de la faute de leur p\u00e8re.\nN\u2019oublions pas, en cette mati\u00e8re, ce que disent Planiol et Ripert, II Droit civil, 1926, p. 6:\nEnfin il n\u2019y a pas de partie du droit qui touche d\u2019aussi pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la morale: l\u2019organisation de la famille n\u2019est solide que si elle est fond\u00e9e sur une morale rigoureuse. Les r\u00e8gles qui gouvernent la famille constituent autant, et quelquefois plus, des pr\u00e9ceptes de morale que des r\u00e8gles de droit.\nPar l\u00e0 le droit de famille touche de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s aux pr\u00e9ceptes religieux eux-m\u00eames. De fait, il fut r\u00e9gi en France pendant de longs si\u00e8cles par le droit canonique; si la R\u00e9volution \u013ea s\u00e9cularis\u00e9, elle n\u2019a pu en changer le caract\u00e8re, et, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les lois r\u00e9volutionnaires et les lois modernes se sont \u00e9cart\u00e9es des principes sur lesquels la famille avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, elles ont affaibli la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019institution.\nPartout dans le code, le mot \u201cenfants\u201d, lorsqu\u2019il est employ\u00e9 seul, n\u2019a et ne peut avoir d\u2019autre signification que celle d\u2019enfants l\u00e9gitimes, sauf aux articles 54, 55 et 56, concernant les actes de naissance, o\u00f9 l\u2019on pr\u00e9voit le cas o\u00f9 un enfant, dont le p\u00e8re, ou la m\u00e8re, ou tous deux, sont inconnus, est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au fonctionnaire public. D\u2019ailleurs, notre l\u00e9gislature a entendu maintenir le droit \u00e9tabli par la Coutume de Paris et par S.R.C. \u0441. 78 (1859) codifiant les dispositions du statut 10-11 Viet., c. 6, dont le but, dit Mignault (5 C.C. 339) \u00e9tait de reproduire le statut imp\u00e9rial mieux connu sous le nom de \u201cLord Campbel\u013es Act\u201d.\nL\u2019article 1056 doit recevoir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application qui lui \u00e9taient donn\u00e9es sous l\u2019empire de la loi qu\u2019il a remplac\u00e9e; chez nous, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui a lieu en France, la position des enfants naturels ne diff\u00e8re pas substantiellement aujourd\u2019hui de celle qui leur \u00e9tait faite par le droit existant au temps de la cession du pays.\nJe suis donc dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 dire, adaptant le langage de la Cour d\u2019Appel de Bordeaux, dans son arr\u00eat du 4 d\u00e9cembre 1851, re Masson v. Hostein (1), que, dans le langage de l\u2019homme, comme dans le langage de la loi fran\u00e7aise, ancienne et moderne, le mot \u201cenfants\u201d ne peut s\u2019entendre que des descendants l\u00e9gitimes, car la l\u00e9gislature, \u00e0 moins de dire clairement le contraire, n\u2019est cens\u00e9e pr\u00e9voir que ce qui est honn\u00eate et l\u00e9gitime et n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e supposer, comme faisant partie de la famille, des enfants naturels qui ne peuvent na\u00eetre que d\u2019une union r\u00e9prouv\u00e9e par la morale.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de renverser le jugement des cours inf\u00e9rieures et de renvoyer l\u2019action sans frais en premi\u00e8re instance, en appel et devant cette cour.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Place, Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett & Foster.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Walsh & Walsh.\n[1] (1930) Q.R. 48 K.B. 456.\n[2] (1929) Q.R. 67 S.C. 322.\n[3] (1887) 14 Can.

The jury found that there was no negligence in Glover causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but that there was negligence in defendant company\u2019s motorman causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries; and that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff. On the jury\u2019s findings, Kelly J. dismissed the action as against Glover, and gave judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favour against the defendant company for $8,500, and ordered that defendant company pay the costs of plaintiff and of defendant Glover.\nThe defendant company appealed to the Appellate Division. The plaintiff did not appeal from the dismissal of the action against Glover.\nThe Appellate Division1 held, on the evidence, that the sole and effective cause of the accident was due to the gross negligence of the defendant Glover; that, while fully recognizing that a jury\u2019s findings on the facts are not to be lightly interfered with, the jury\u2019s findings in this case could not be supported on the evidence; and it allowed the defendant company\u2019s appeal and dismissed the action as against it, with costs.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAfter hearing counsel for the appellant (plaintiff) and for the respondent (defendant company), and without calling on counsel for the appellant in reply, the Court delivered judgment orally, allowing the appeal with costs, on the ground that there was evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of negligence by the respondent causing the appellant\u2019s injuries, in the respondent\u2019s motorman not bringing his car to a stop; that, on the evidence, the motorman must have realized the danger of a collision, and he should have brought the speed of his car down to such a rate as would have enabled him to stop in time to avoid the accident. The appeal was allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored, except that portion thereof dealing with the Glover costs, there being no appeal in this Court by Glover against the judgment of the Appellate Division which denied him his costs as against defendant company.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nJ.A.

The Appellate Division reversed the judgment on the grounds that there was no evidence of any illegality in connection with the mortgage transactions; that in any case the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was established without relying on any illegal transaction; and that the refusal to answer questions on the examination for discovery, no substantive motion grounded on such refusal having been launched by defendant before the trial, could not be a ground for dismissal of the action at the trial.\nOn the appeal to this Court, on the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondents, the Court delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, the Chief Justice stating that the members of the Court were in accord with the views expressed by the Appellate Division and in agreement with the judgment delivered therein by Orde J.A.; with that learned judge they were of the view that defendant failed to adduce any evidence in support of his plea of illegality; he was bound to prove, not only the illegal- ity (as to the existence of which the Court passed no opinion), but also its connection with the transactions in question; the signatures of defendant to the mortgages being admitted and the advance of the money not being contested, the plaintiff established a prima facie case by showing non-payment; he was not obliged to invoke in any wise the alleged illegal transactions in support of his claim; the burden of establishing these and their connection with the claim sued upon remained upon defendant, and that burden he failed to discharge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nF.D. Davis K.C. for the appellant.\nBernard Furlong for the respondents.\n[1] (1929) 64 Ont. L.R. 658.\n[2] (1929) 64 Ont. L.R. 392.\n",

Martin, [1931] S.C.R. 145\nDate: 1930-04-22\nLouis H\u00e9bert (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Martin and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1930: February 14; 1930: April 22.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nRiot \u2014 Mob \u2014 Disturbance \u2014 Revolver shooting \u2014 Unlawful assembly \u2014 Peace officer \u2014 Discharge of duty \u2014 Person injured \u2014 Liability.\nThe necessity of dispersing a riotous crowd, which would become dangerous unless dispersed, and which threatens serious injury to persons and property, justifies a peace officer in using firearms to prevent violent and felonious outrage to persons and property. A ringleader who, under such conditions and while assaulting a peace officer, is shot dead, dies by justifiable homicide; and the peace officer who fired is free from any liability in damages.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Letellier J. and maintaining the respondents\u2019 action in damages.\nThe respondents were tutors to the minor children of one M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin and brought action for damages against the appellant, a police officer of a mining town, arising from the death of their father under the following circumstances: At a circus in Thetford Mines, one Alcide\u2019 Martin, brother of the deceased, during discussion with one Dufresne and his wife, fortune tellers, was struck in the face by Dufresne. It is admitted that Alcide Martin stirred up (ameuta) his friends who took up his defence and pulled down Dufresne\u2019s tent. A general disturbance thereupon ensued having all the appearances of a riot. The appellant went home to get his revolver and returned with it to establish order. He mounted a box and commanded the crowd to keep the peace: failing by this method to restore order, he discharged his revolver, first into the air and then into the ground. M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, a powerful man, approached the appellant and assaulted him, whereupon H\u00e9bert, with the probable intention of wounding his assailant and thereby preventing further aggression by him, discharged his revolver and killed him. The evidence established the existence of an unlawful assembly within the definition of section 87 Cr. C. at the time and place of the shooting and that this unlawful assembly had already become a riot within the definition of section 88 Cr. C. The evidence showed also that the appellant had reason to believe, and did in fact believe, that his own safety, as well as that of Dufresne, was seriously menaced by the conduct of the crowd by which he was surrounded.\nR. Beaudoin K.C. for the appellant.\nL. Morin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Cannon and I agree in his conclusion.\nThe evidence abundantly establishes the existence of an unlawful assembly, within the definition of s. 87 of the Criminal Code, at the time and place of the shooting of M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin. Indeed, it justifies the conclusion that this unlawful assembly had already become a riot within the definition of s. 88, Cr. C\nAs a peace officer, it was the imperative duty of constable H\u00e9bert, under s. 94 of the Criminal Code, to endeavour to suppress this riotous assembly and he would have rendered himself liable to a penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment had he failed to do so.\nBy s. 125 of the code, a peace officer is authorized\nto carry loaded pistols or other usual arms or offensive weapons in the discharge of his duty,\nand, by s. 48, he is\njustified in using such force as he, in good faith, and on reasonable and probable grounds, believes to be necessary to suppress a riot, and as is not disproportioned to the danger which he, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes to be apprehended from the continuance of the riot.\nThe questions, therefore, for our consideration would appear to be, whether the evidence supports the finding of the trial judge that the circumstances were such as to justify a reasonable belief in the mind of the constable, and whether he in fact entertained the belief, that the riotous assembly would continue, and would probably result in serious injury to Dufresne and also to himself unless immediate steps were taken to suppress it; and, whether he was likewise justified in believing that the use of his fire-arm was, under the circumstances, a means necessary to suppress the riot, and not disproportioned to the danger which he * * * believed to be apprehended * * *.\nHaving read the evidence through with great care, and considered it in all its aspects, I am of the opinion that this case clearly falls within these statutory provisions and that the conduct of constable H\u00e9bert was not only justifiable, but should probably be regarded as unavoidable, in the discharge of the duty imposed upon him by s. 94 of the Code. It would be highly dangerous and most discouraging to peace officers to hold them liable, either criminally or civilly, under circumstances such as those before us, for injuries sustained by one of the ringleaders of a semi-drunken mob of blackguards such as H\u00e9bert was called upon to deal with.\nThe evidence satisfies me that H\u00e9bert had reason to believe, and did in fact believe, that his own safety, as well as that of Dufresne, was seriously menaced by the conduct of the crowd by which he was surrounded, and that he was within his rights, as a peace officer, in using his fire-arm as he did, not with the intention of killing M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, but possibly of wounding him, and thus putting an end to the danger of further aggression by him. That the danger was imminent, and the necessity for protecting persons and property urgent, the evidence clearly establishes.\nIn my opinion, with great respect, the Court of King\u2019s Bench should not have disturbed the findings made by the trial judge on evidence which quite sufficiently justified them. I would allow this appeal and would restore the findings of the trial judge and dismiss the action.\nThe judgment of Rinfret J. and Cannon J. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Joseph Martin, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur aux enfants mineurs de feu M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin et de feue Alfr\u00e9da St-Pierre, et dame Marie-Ange Lessard, veuve dudit M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, tant en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice aux enfants mineurs issus de son mariage que personnellement, ont adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante et \u00e0 Louis H\u00e9bert, constable du m\u00eame endroit, un avis qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration d\u2019un mais une poursuite serait prise contre la corporation et le constable conjointement et solidairement pour une somme de $20,000, dont $10,000 pour lesdits mineurs et $10,000 pour la veuve Marie-Ange Lessard, r\u00e9sultant des circonstances suivantes, savoir:\nLe ou vers le 17 juillet 1927, dans un parc d\u2019amusements, dans le village d\u2019Amiante, alors qu\u2019il s\u2019y donnait certaines repr\u00e9sentations d\u2019amusements, ledit Louis H\u00e9bert, votre employ\u00e9 comme constable, alors en fonctions pour votre corporation, a d\u00e9charg\u00e9 une arme \u00e0 feu (revolver) appartenant \u00e0 votre corporation et a tu\u00e9 M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, p\u00e8re desdits mineurs et \u00e9poux de ladite dame Marie Lessard, alors qu\u2019il se trouvait dans ledit parc un grand nombre de (personnes entourant le constable et sa victime, et que ledit constable ne se trouvait aucunement dans une situation p\u00e9rilleuse ni dangereuse pour sa personne ni pour sa vie.\nLes faits et incidents ci-dessus sont arriv\u00e9s par la faute de votre corporation d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et sp\u00e9cialement pour ne pas avoir mis le nombre de constables requis, en pareille circonstance, pour y maintenir l\u2019ordre; et aussi par le mauvais jugement dudit Louis H\u00e9bert, votre constable agissant sous votre responsabilit\u00e9 et que vous avez-vous m\u00eames arm\u00e9, tel que dit ci-dessus en lui fournissant un revolver dont il a fait usage sans n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, ledit constable n\u2019\u00e9tant pas comp\u00e9tent et ayant re\u00e7u des ordres ill\u00e9gaux.\nLe tout causant auxdits mineurs et \u00e0 leur m\u00e8re, dame Marie Lessard, les dommages susmentionn\u00e9s.\nCet avis fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises, le 2 ao\u00fbt et le 26 septembre 1927.\nLa d\u00e9claration, en date du 23 novembre 1927, relate plais en d\u00e9tail les griefs contre la corporation et son constable et conclut \u00e0 une condamnation conjointe et solidaire contre les d\u00e9fendeurs au montant de $20,000 \u00e0 \u00eatre partag\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre la veuve et les enfants.\nLa corporation et H\u00e9bert ont plaid\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, all\u00e9guant que le d\u00e9funt M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin et ses amis, dans la circonstance en question, ont troubl\u00e9 la paix publique en mena\u00e7ant de mort un nomm\u00e9 Dufresne et le constable lui-m\u00eame, qui cherchait \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger ce dernier, que le constable n\u2019avait fait que son devoir et \u00e9tait justifiable de prendre les moyens qu\u2019il avait adopt\u00e9 pour prot\u00e9ger sa vie et celle du public et que la victime M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, avec ses amis, la cause du trouble qui avait amen\u00e9 sa mort.\nApr\u00e8s une longue enqu\u00eate, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens, consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019acte du constable \u00e9tait justifiable non seulement au point de vue criminel mais au point de vue civil, et qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les cons\u00e9quences fatales de son acte.\nLe conseil de famille s\u2019\u00e9tant r\u00e9uni a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 inscrire en appel,\nsi opportun, sur l\u2019issue contre Louis H\u00e9bert, et \u00e0 se d\u00e9sister, si opportun, d\u2019une partie seulement de la demande et \u00e0 ne r\u00e9clamer en appel que la somme de $9,950 et, alternativement, \u00e0 inscrire et plaider en appel contre les deux d\u00e9fendeurs, si opportun.\nPar leur inscription, les appelants d\u00e9clarent qu\u2019ils n\u2019appellent que sur Tissue avec le d\u00e9fendeur Louis H\u00e9bert et r\u00e9duisent leur r\u00e9clamation en dommages \u00e0 une somme de $9,950 et consentent \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des frais de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nPar un jugement unanime, la Cour du Banc du Roi, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1929, a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 la demande, consid\u00e9rant que \u201csans cause, ni raison, ni excuse, ni justification, le d\u00e9fendeur a tu\u00e9 brutalement feu M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin\u201d.

L\u2019honorable Juge Howard, dissident, aurait maintenu l\u2019appel et l\u2019action jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $5,000.\nLes griefs d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant H\u00e9bert devant la Cour Supr\u00eame sont les suivants:\n1o Le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi d\u00e9cr\u00e8te la contrainte par corps contre le constable H\u00e9bert, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 la loi et ultra petita.\nA l\u2019audition, le procureur des intim\u00e9s a admis le bienfond\u00e9 de ce grief. Le jugement devrait donc \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre du dispositif la condamnation de H\u00e9bert \u00e0 la contrainte par corps. La d\u00e9claration ne Ta jamais demand\u00e9e; et c\u2019est un moyen d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qui ne peut \u00eatre obtenu que d\u2019apr\u00e8s une proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale subs\u00e9quente au jugement dans la cause.\n2\u00b0 Voici comment l\u2019appelant exprime son deuxi\u00e8me grief d\u2019appel:\nL\u2019obligation est \u00e9teinte. Les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas de recours contre le constable, et il y a chose jug\u00e9e sur ce point.\nVoici maintenant les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant: L\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 la fois contre l\u2019appelant et contre la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante, qu\u2019on a voulu tenir conjointement et solidairement responsable pour l\u2019acte de son constable.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019action \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit.\nLes demandeurs ont accept\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9; et sur ce point le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a acquis l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e entre la corporation et eux. Ils ont port\u00e9 la cause en appel contre le constable H\u00e9bert seulement. La question qui se pose est donc: Le fait d\u2019avoir accept\u00e9 le jugement qui lib\u00e9rait la corporation municipale, en d\u00e9clarant justifiable l\u2019acte de son constable, emp\u00eache-t-il les demandeurs de continuer leur appel contre le constable lui-m\u00eame? Lorsque l\u2019employ\u00e9 et le patron sont poursuivis solidairement pour l\u2019acte de l\u2019employ\u00e9, dans la m\u00eame action, et que cette action est rejet\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une d\u00e9cision qui d\u00e9clare que l\u2019acte de l\u2019employ\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, un demandeur peut-il accepter ce jugement quant au patron et tenter de le faire infirmer quant \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 seulement, sans s\u2019exposer \u00e0 l\u2019exception de chose jug\u00e9e? Il y a l\u00e0 une question de droit qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas cependant n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9soudre, si cette cour donne raison \u00e0 l\u2019appelant sur le troisi\u00e8me grief qui nous est soumis comme suit:\n3\u00b0 En fait et en droit, l\u2019action telle qu\u2019originairement intent\u00e9e est mal fond\u00e9e, comme l\u2019a jug\u00e9 l\u2019honorable juge Letellier en premi\u00e8re instance, parce que le constable pouvait et devait agir comme il l\u2019a fait.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9, dans son factum, pr\u00e9tend que le nomm\u00e9 Dufresne, par sa conduite en attaquant brutalement et sans justification Alcide Martin, fr\u00e8re du d\u00e9funt, ameuta les amis de ce dernier qui prirent fait et cause pour lui et jet\u00e8rent bas la tente de Dufresne, et il cite le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Albert Drouin:\nCombien voulaient battre le p\u00e8re Dufresne?\u2014R. A peu pr\u00e8s quatre ou cinq.\nCette admission serait suffisante pour nous justifier d\u2019appliquer les articles 87 et 88 du code criminel concernant les attroupements ill\u00e9gaux.\n87. Un attroupement ill\u00e9gal est la r\u00e9union de trois personnes ou de plus qui, dans l\u2019intention d\u2019atteindre un but commun, se r\u00e9unissent ou se conduisent, une fois r\u00e9unis, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire craindre aux personnes qui se trouvent dans le voisinage de cet attroupement, pour des motifs plausibles, que les personnes ainsi r\u00e9unies vont troubler la paix publique tumultueusement, etc.\n88. Une \u00e9meute est un attroupement ill\u00e9gal qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 troubler tumultueusement la paix publique.\nSur ce point, je citerai quelques t\u00e9moignages:.\nH\u00e9bert:\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que \u00e7a criait? Est-ce que vous avez compris?\u2014R. Ils voulaient le tuer.\nQ. Ils le disaient?\u2014R. Oui. Ils \u00e9taient vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente, le moins, qui criaient, qui voulaient le tuer.\n* * *\nQ. Sacraient-ils?\u2014R. Oui, ils sacraient; \u00e7a criait. J\u2019ai embarqu\u00e9 debout sur la bo\u00eete, j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 un coup en haut en disant de se tenir tranquilles. J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 un coup en haut en disant de se tenir tranquilles. J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 en bas; \u00e7a n\u2019arr\u00eatait pas. J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me coup en bas, en disant de se tenir tranquilles.\nQ. En disant de se tenir tranquilles?\u2014R. Oui. L\u00e0, M\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u00e9tait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 cinquante pieds plus loin. Il dit: \u201cToi, mon christ d\u2019H\u00e9bert, tu vas mourir.\u201d L\u00e0, j\u2019ai saut\u00e9 en bas, j\u2019avais mon revolver \u00e0 la main, comme de raison, dans le dos, j\u2019ai envoy\u00e9 mon revolver dans le dos.\nQ. Point\u00e9 vers la terre?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que M\u00e9d\u00e9ric a fait?\u2014R. Il \u00e9tait avec moi, je lui ai dit de se tenir tranquille.\nQ. Vous touchait-il?\u2014R. Oui, il me tenait et me secouait. J\u2019ai dit: \u201cTiens-toi tranquille, c\u2019est tout ce qu\u2019on te demande.\u201d Il continuait toujours la m\u00eame chose. La troisi\u00e8me fois qu\u2019il m\u2019a poign\u00e9 j\u2019ai point\u00e9 mon revolver pour le blesser \u00e0 la jambe. Comme de raison, il m\u2019a pouss\u00e9 comme \u00e7a, la main m\u2019a manqu\u00e9 de m\u00eame * * *\n* * *\nQ. Martin, tout le temps, vous tenait-il?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Et il sacrait?\u2014R. Il sacrait: \u201cMon christ, tu vas mourir.\u201d\nQ. Lui-m\u00eame, Martin?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur.\n* * *\nR. Il y en avait d\u2019autres en arri\u00e8re, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la roue, qui criaient: \u201cTuerie, ce vieux christ-l\u00e0.\u201d\nQ. Il y avait beaucoup de monde?\u2014R. Ah! oui.\nQ. Dans ceux qui criaient et faisaient le train, \u00e9taient excit\u00e9s, \u00e9taient-ils nombreux?\u2014R. Dans les vingt-cinq \u00e0 trente; ils entouraient la roue.\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez tout seul?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Ces gens-l\u00e0 avaient-ils l\u2019air d\u2019\u00eatre en boisson?\u2014R. Ils n\u2019avaient pas toute leur t\u00eate, c\u2019est bien mon id\u00e9e.\nQ. Avez-vous eu peur?\u2014R. Oui, j\u2019ai eu peur.\nQ. Peur de quoi?\u2014R. J\u2019ai eu peur de me faire tuer. C\u2019est tout juste.\nQ. Vous connaissiez Martin avant \u00e7a?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Il vous connaissait?\u2014R. Oui, il me connaissait et je le connaissais.\nQ. C\u2019est un gars qui \u00e9tait plus gros que vous?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Plus fort?\u2014R. Oui, il pouvait en battre deux comme moi.\nQ. Il \u00e9tait beaucoup plus jeune que vous?\u2014R. Oui, il \u00e9tait plus jeune que moi.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui, sous votre serment, monsieur H\u00e9bert, qu\u2019est-ce qui vous a fait craindre de vous faire tuer? Qu\u2019est-ce qui vous a fait penser que vous \u00e9tiez expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort?\u2014R. S\u2019il m\u2019avait frapp\u00e9 l\u00e0 et que les autres seraient venus, toute la gang qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient l\u00e0.\nQ. Est-ce que ces gens avaient l\u2019air de vouloir se ranger contre vous?\u2014R. Comme de raison, du moment qu\u2019ils ont venu me b\u00e2drer, M. Dufresne a d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 de la roue, ils l\u2019ont poign\u00e9 cinq ou six et lui ont noirci les deux yeux. * * *\n* * *\nQ. Vous ne savez pas qui a fait arr\u00eater la roue?\u2014R. Non, je ne sais pas.\nQ. Pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans la roue, le p\u00e8re Dufresne, et que la roue tournait, est-ce que ces gens-l\u00e0 faisaient des menaces?\u2014R. Ils lui criaient. Q. Quoi?\u2014R. \u201cAm\u00e8ne-le qu\u2019on le tue.\u201d\nQ. \u00c0vez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu des bagarres, des grosses batailles, avant celle-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Non, je n\u2019en ai jamais vu.\nQ. Celle-l\u00e0 vous a paru consid\u00e9rable?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Vous avez dit tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure, monsieur H\u00e9bert, que vous \u00e9tiez \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la municipalit\u00e9. Comme question de fait, vous n\u2019avez pas de salaire de la municipalit\u00e9?\u2014R. Non.\nQ. Ils vous paient quand ils ont besoin de vous?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, vous \u00e9tiez employ\u00e9 par les \u201cBosco\u201d?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019est Bosco qui vous payait ?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Vous n\u2019aviez pas de compte \u00e0 rendre \u00e0 la corporation de ce temps-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Non, rien du tout.\nQ. Aucun \u00e9chevin, ni le maire, ni le secr\u00e9taire, pas un vous a dit de vous servir de votre revolver?\u2014R. Non.\nQ. Vous avez agi d\u2019apr\u00e8s votre propre jugement?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Maintenant, quel \u00e2ge avez-vous, monsieur H\u00e9bert?\u2014R. Cinquante-six ans.\n* * *\nQ. Pouvez-vous donner un fait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 votre connaissance, qui pourrait d\u00e9montrer que la populace vous en voulait?\u2014R. Dans une \u00e9meute semblable, des fois \u00e7a ne prend pas de temps de se virer sur une personne et la battre. On ne conna\u00eet pas tout le monde qui arrive dans une \u00e9meute, \u00e7a ne prend pas de temps \u00e0 se soulever, \u00e0 sauter sur un homme; c\u2019est \u00e7a.\nJ\u2019ai cit\u00e9 abondamment la version du constable pour d\u00e9montrer que ce dernier avait lieu de s\u2019alarmer de la situation, en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une foule avin\u00e9e et ameut\u00e9e, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait seul pour remplir le devoir que lui imposait l\u2019article 94 du code criminel qui dit:\nEst coupable d\u2019un acte criminel et passible de deux ans d\u2019emprisonnement celui qui * * * \u00e9tant agent de la paix * * * est notifi\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019une \u00e9meute dans la localit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il a juridiction et s\u2019abstient, sans excuse raisonnable, de remplir son devoir en r\u00e9primant cette \u00e9meute.\nEt voici maintenant le t\u00e9moignage de Dufresne:\nQ. Y avait-il bien du tapage?\u2014R. Oui, il y avait bien du tapage: des lions, c\u2019\u00e9tait comme des lions, une gang de lions.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019a paru?\u2014R. Une guerre.\nQ. Par cons\u00e9quent quelque chose de dangereux?\nObject\u00e9 de la part du demandeur \u00e0 cette preuve. Q. Avez-vous eu peur?\u2014R. J\u2019ai eu peur, pour le s\u00fbr que j\u2019ai eu peur.\nQ. Avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 menac\u00e9?\u2014R. Oui, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 menac\u00e9. Q. Beaucoup?\u2014R. Bien * * *\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019ils vous ont dit?\u2014R. \u201cSi tu peux d\u00e9barquer, on va t\u2019en donner une bonne.\u201d Quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 ils m\u2019ont poign\u00e9 et amen\u00e9 en arri\u00e8re, ils m\u2019ont tapoch\u00e9 tant qu\u2019ils ont pu.\n* * *\nQ. Ils avaient peut-\u00eatre un petit coup de trop?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Avaient-ils l\u2019air d\u2019en avoir pris?\u2014R. Oui; je leur en ai vu prendre moi-m\u00eame.\nQ. Plusieurs?\u2014R. Non, seulement un; je l\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9.\nQ. O\u00f9 c\u2019\u00e9tait?\u2014R. Droit en face, lorsque j\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00e8s de la roue.\nQ. A travers tout le monde?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait une grosse bagarre?\u2014R. Oui.\nCe t\u00e9moignage est confirm\u00e9 par celui de Mme Dufresne, par Robert Roy, m\u00e9canicien, et Paul-Emile Lafontaine. Le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier doit \u00eatre cit\u00e9, je crois:\nQ. Quand \u00eates-vous arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0?\u2014R. Je suis arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0 quand le d\u00e9funt Martin est arriv\u00e9. Quand je suis arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0, Martin arrivait de East Broughton, en automobile, avec M. Vachon.\nQ. Etait-il chaud?\u2014R. Je ne pourrais pas dire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait chaud; il m\u2019a paru chaud.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, quand il est arriv\u00e9?\u2014R. Quand il est arriv\u00e9, son fr\u00e8re lui a dit \u2026\nQ. Quel fr\u00e8re?\u2014R. Alcide a dit \u00e0 M\u00e9d\u00e9ric: \u201cLe vieux m\u2019a battu.\u201d Il dit: \u201cOn va arranger \u00e7a.\u201d Ils sont all\u00e9s \u00e0 la cabane, en fin de compte, le cabane est tomb\u00e9e \u00e0 terre. Ils se sont mis \u00e0 chanter et se sont pay\u00e9 la traite.\nQ. Etaient-ils plusieurs?\u2014R. Ils paraissaient \u00eatre une dizaine.\nQ. Vous les avez vus prendre un coup?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. M\u00e9d\u00e9ric aussi?\u2014R. Tous.\nQ. Les avez-vous vus jeter la tente \u00e0 terre?\u2014R. La tente, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9e par en arri\u00e8re, ces gars-l\u00e0 \u00e9taient de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nQ. Apr\u00e8s \u00e7a, qu\u2019est-ce qui est arriv\u00e9?\u2014R. Ils ont demand\u00e9 si M. Dufresne \u00e9tait sorti d\u2019en dessous la tente. Il \u00e9tait sorti et se sauvait dans la roue. L\u00e0, il y a quelqu\u2019un qui a cri\u00e9: \u201cLe bonhomme se sauve !\u201d Ils sont partis apr\u00e8s.\n* * *\nR. Oui. J\u2019ai rest\u00e9 avec lui; on est all\u00e9 voir M. Marcotte. Il lui a dit que \u00e7a regardait bien mal. Il a demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide \u00e0 la ville. Il m\u2019a dit que \u00e7a faisait deux fois qu\u2019il demandait de l\u2019aide, il ne pouvait pas en avoir, ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas assign\u00e9s par le village. Il a dit: \u201cCet homme-l\u00e0 est sur nos charges, il faut le prot\u00e9ger.\u201d Je suis parti avec M. H\u00e9bert; quand il est revenu, ils ont cri\u00e9: \u201cD\u00e9p\u00eachez-vous !\u201d La roue \u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9e, M. Dufresne, ils commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 le tirer par les jambes.\nQ. Qui?\u2014R. Je ne peux pas dire qui, il y en avait deux.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait-il deux qui \u00e9taient dans le groupe?\u2014R. Oui; le groupe qui \u00e9tait dans le bout de la roue. On ne comprenait rien.\nQ. \u00c7a criait beaucoup?\u2014R. Pas mal. L\u00e0, M. H\u00e9bert, il y a quelqu\u2019un\u2014je crois que c\u2019est M. Beaudoin\u2014a dit: \u201cTirez en l\u2019air pour apaiser les choses.\u201d L\u2019effet que \u00e7a fait: \u00e7a les a enrag\u00e9s, \u00e7a criait plus fort.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que \u00e7a criait?\u2014R. Apr\u00e8s le bonhomme: \u201cPoignez-le! poignez-le! poignez-le!\u201d M. Dufresne criait: \u201cD\u00e9fendez-moi, tirez, tirez!\u201d M. H\u00e9bert a tir\u00e9 un coup \u00e0 terre, je crois qu\u2019il en a frapp\u00e9 un au pied, que j\u2019ai su apr\u00e8s.\nQ. S\u2019est-il recul\u00e9?\u2014R. Je crois. Et puis, quand il a vu \u00e7a, le d\u00e9funt Martin a saut\u00e9 sur les \u201ccr\u00eates\u201d, M. H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 dessus. Il a dit \u00e0 M. H\u00e9bert: \u201cT\u2019as pas d\u2019affaire ici \u00e0 nous b\u00e2drer, va t\u2019en.\u201d M. H\u00e9bert a saut\u00e9 \u00e0 terre; l\u00e0, ils se sont poign\u00e9s par les bras, le revolver \u00e9tait en l\u2019air, au bout du bras.\nQ. Au bout du bras d\u2019H\u00e9bert?\u2014R. Oui, le bras \u00e9tait en l\u2019air.\nQ. Puis?\u2014R. M. Martin a l\u00e2ch\u00e9 M. H\u00e9bert. J\u2019ai pris M. Martin par le bras en disant: \u201cFais pas de folie, il vient pour mettre la paix.\u201d Il m\u2019a donn\u00e9 un coup et il est retourn\u00e9 trouver M. H\u00e9bert, il lui a mis une main \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule et l\u2019autre au collet. Le revolver \u00e9tait point\u00e9 vers la terre, au bout du bras. Je n\u2019ai pas rest\u00e9 l\u00e0 parce que je trouvais que c\u2019\u00e9tait dangereux pour moi, je me suis tir\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re chose que j\u2019ai sue, le revolver \u00e9tait lev\u00e9 et le coup est parti.\nQ. Au moment o\u00f9 le coup est parti, dans quelle position \u00e9taient H\u00e9bert et Martin?\u2014R. La distance?\nQ. De quelle mani\u00e8re se tenaient-ils?\u2014R. La distance \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au bout des bras.\nQ. Martin le tenait-il encore?\u2014R. Par le bras et par l\u2019\u00e9paule.\nQ. Puis?\u2014R. Quand le coup a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9, Martin sa port\u00e9 sa main ici.\nQ. A la plaie?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Y a-t-il eu une bousculade g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, des sacres?\u2014R. C\u2019\u00e9tait en arri\u00e8re, \u00e0 la roue.\nQ. Le d\u00e9funt sacrait-il?\u2014R. Le d\u00e9funt sacrait dans le temps apr\u00e8s M. H\u00e9bert, en voulant l\u2019envoyer.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il disait?\u2014R. Mon christ d\u2019H\u00e9bert, va t\u2019en chez vous, t\u2019as pas d\u2019affaire \u00e0 venir nous b\u00e2drer.\n* * *\nQ. H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait expos\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame?\u2014R. Pareil; si le revolver avait tourn\u00e9, il l\u2019aurait eu pareil.\nQ. Y avait-il rien que cela de dangereux sur le terrain, le danger du revolver?\u2014R. Non; il y avait les menaces qui \u00e9taient dangereuses.\nQ. Y en avait-il plusieurs qui mena\u00e7aient?\u2014R. Pour le moins, ils \u00e9taient toujours une vingtaine.\nJ\u2019attache aussi beaucoup d\u2019importance au t\u00e9moignage du notaire C\u00f4t\u00e9:\nJ\u2019ai approch\u00e9 du trouble qu\u2019il y avait\u2014il y avait du trouble, il y avait un groupe qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9uni vers une tente qui \u00e9tait install\u00e9e vers le bord du terrain, je suppose. L\u00e0, j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019avocat Beaudoin qui m\u2019a dit: \u201cTant\u00f4t, il va y avoir du trouble, c\u2019est \u00e9vident.\u201d J\u2019ai circul\u00e9 sur le terrain. Apr\u00e8s, je me suis aper\u00e7u que la tente, occup\u00e9e par M. Dufresne \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e. L\u00e0, je suis all\u00e9 vers la tente qui \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e par terre; je m\u2019occupais de la lever pour sortir de dessous M. Dufresne dans le temps je ne savais pas son nom,\u2014M. Dufresne et sa femme. A un moment donn\u00e9, la tente a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e de quelque mani\u00e8re et M. Dufresne est disparan; je l\u2019ai revu dans la roue, ce qu\u2019ils appelaient le \u201cfairway\u201d. Au bout de quelques minutes, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 vers cette grande roue du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit, la face dirig\u00e9e vers la personne du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit de la roue. A ce moment, il y a un groupe d\u2019individus que je ne connaissais pas du tout, qui criaient, qui vocif\u00e9raient, etc., qui paraissaient vouloir faire un mauvais parti \u00e0 l\u2019homme qui \u00e9tait dans la roue, M. Dufresne.\n* * * Il y a eu une m\u00eal\u00e9e, je sais qu\u2019il y en a un qui est parti et qui a fonc\u00e9 sur M. H\u00e9bert\u2014pour dire lequel, je ne peux pas le dire. Dans le temps je ne connaissais pas les gens, j\u2019\u00e9tais trop nouveau.\nQ. Avez-vous entendu les paroles que cet individu-l\u00e0 a prononc\u00e9es; qui a saut\u00e9 sur H\u00e9bert?\u2014R. J\u2019ai entendu quelque chose comme ceci: \u201cMon christ, tu veux nous tuer, \u00e7a va \u00eatre toi qui vas y passer\u201d, quelque chose dans ce sens-l\u00e0.\nQ. Des menaces?\u2014R. Des menaces.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que les \u00e9meutiers faisaient pendant ce temps-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Pendant ce temps-l\u00e0 et avant ce temps-l\u00e0, \u00e7a vocif\u00e9rait, \u00e7a hurlait. Ils en voulaient \u00e0 celui dans la roue, c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9vident.\nQ. Avez-vous entendu un seul coup de revolver?\u2014R. Au moins trois coups\u2014je n\u2019ai pas compt\u00e9, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre plus\u2014pas moins.\nQ. Avant de tirer du revolver, avez-vous dit que H\u00e9bert avait demand\u00e9 la paix?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur, certainement qu\u2019il l\u2019a demand\u00e9e, je le jure positivement.\nQ. Ces gens-l\u00e0 paraissaient-ils chauds?\u2014R. Il y en avait certainement de chauds.\nQ. En avez-vous vu de ces gens-l\u00e0 prendre de la boisson?\u2014R. Oui, monsieur, j\u2019en ai vu, il y en avait qui avait une bouteille, je ne sais pas ce qu\u2019il y avait dedans, \u00e7a ne devait pas \u00eatre de l\u2019eau b\u00e9nite. Je dis de la boisson, je ne sais pas.\nQ. A Thetford, ce n\u2019est pas la coutume que des gens sortent avec des bouteilles pleines d\u2019eau?\u2014R. \u00c7a n\u2019a pas coutume.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que vous avez conclu de ce que vous avez vu? Qu\u2019est-ce que vous avez conclu par rapport \u00e0 H\u00e9bert et au p\u00e8re Dufresne?\u2014R. C\u2019est que la position de M. Dufresne \u00e9tait dangereuse, tr\u00e8s dangereuse m\u00eame; et M. H\u00e9bert, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en autorit\u00e9 dans le moment, comme police, et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9cout\u00e9, \u00e7a devenait un d\u00e9sordre et que partout o\u00f9 il y a d\u00e9sordre, il y a danger.\nQ. Avez-vous trouv\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait une \u00e9meute qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0?\u2014R. Certainement.\nQ. S\u00e9rieuse?\u2014R. S\u00e9rieuse, \u00e0 mon point de vue.\nQ. Pouvant inspirer des craintes?\u2014R. Certainement.\nLe t\u00e9moin Louis Deshaies d\u00e9crit la sc\u00e8ne et nous dit qu\u2019apparemment la foule voulait prendre le contr\u00f4le de tout ce qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0, que c\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame pr\u00e9m\u00e9dit\u00e9 et que de bonne heure ce soir-l\u00e0 on rencontrait des gens qui, si on les regardait de travers une fois, disaient: \u201cTu me regardes, je vais te sacrer une claque. Laisse-moi.\u201d \u201cIls avaient l\u2019air chauds\u201d, et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, le d\u00e9funt et ses amis mena\u00e7aient H\u00e9bert.\nUn autre t\u00e9moin d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, Dickenson, qui assistait \u00e0 la sc\u00e8ne de sa galerie, nous dit:\nQ. What did the general appearance look like, at that distance?\u2014R. It looked bad for a while.\nQ. Why?\u2014R. I saw a tent fall down. That is all I could see.\nQ. Could you see who was making the row?\u2014R. No. They were -shouting.\nQ. Could you see if there was a crowd?\u2014R. There seemed to be a crowd. Q. You say they were shouting?\u2014R. Yes.\nQ. Could you hear what they said?\u2014R. No. I saw constable Huard in an automobile.\nQ. You could not hear whether there were threats?\u2014R. No. I was about at two hundred feet.\nQ. Did the whole affair look dangerous?\u2014R. Yes, at that time it did, in my own opinion.\n* * *\nR. I was asked to telephone.\nQ. By whom?\u2014R. Mr. Devault; he came to my house and asked me to telephone to the police, because the situation looked dangerous. I telephoned, the reply was: \u201cI have no business there.\u201d\nQ. H\u00e9bert was left alone?\u2014R. Yes.\nWilfrid Drouin nous dit qu\u2019il y avait une trentaine d\u2019individus qui mena\u00e7aient, qui criaient, dont plusieurs \u00e9taient \u201cchauds\u201d.\nLes t\u00e9moins des demandeurs disent de m\u00eame. Odilon Desrosiers admet qu\u2019il y avait pas mal de monde de \u201cchauds\u201d dans la \u201cgang\u201d, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il a pu voir.\nRobert Mercier nous dit qu\u2019il a eu connaissance de la bagarre et il admet que \u00e7a avait l\u2019air bien dangereux pour le p\u00e8re Dufresne.\nAlbert Drouin admet qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de batailleurs, que c\u2019\u00e9tait mena\u00e7ant, que c\u2019\u00e9tait une bagarre pas mal consid\u00e9rable.\nJe crois donc, en pr\u00e9sence de ces t\u00e9moignages, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu raison de constater comme un fait l\u2019existence d\u2019un attroupement ill\u00e9gal ayant commenc\u00e9 et continuant \u00e0 troubler la paix publique. Nous avons donc les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019\u00e9meute, telle que d\u00e9finie dans notre code criminel. Il nous suffit de nous en tenir \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition, sans la rechercher dans les rapports de d\u00e9cisions rendues en Angleterre ou ailleurs. Comme les intim\u00e9s l\u2019ont dit dans leur avis d\u2019action, la situation \u00e9tait tellement grave que la pr\u00e9sence de plus d\u2019un constable \u00e9tait requise pour maintenir la paix. Il \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre difficile de pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019une \u00e9meute \u00e9claterait soudainement \u00e0 propos d\u2019un incident assez insignifiant. Quoi qu\u2019on puisse penser de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la corporation sur ce point, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise hors de cause par l\u2019acceptation du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance quant \u00e0 elle par les intim\u00e9es. Il reste acquis que H\u00e9bert se trouvait seul pour faire face \u00e0 cette foule ameut\u00e9e. Certains des honorables juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi semblent attacher beaucoup d\u2019importance au fait, et lui reprochent fortement d\u2019\u00eatre all\u00e9, au cours de la soir\u00e9e et apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre consult\u00e9 avec le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la municipalit\u00e9, chercher son revolver \u00e0 la maison. Le port d\u2019armes ne saurait lui \u00eatre reproch\u00e9, puisque l\u2019article 125 du code criminel fait une exception en faveur des agents de la paix, qui peuvent sans contravention \u201cporten dies pistolets charg\u00e9s * * * dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions\u201d. La section 48 du m\u00eame code nous dit que tout agent de la paix est justifiable d\u2019employer la force qu\u2019il croit, de \u201cbonne foi et pour des motifs raisonnables et plausibles, n\u00e9cessaire pour la r\u00e9pression d\u2019une \u00e9meute, et qui n\u2019est pas hors de proportion avec le danger qu\u2019il peut, pour des motifs raisonnables et plausibles, appr\u00e9hender de la continuation de cette \u00e9meute\u201d.\nLe plaidoyer de H\u00e9bert \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 invoquer cet article pour justifier son acte et le mettre \u00e0 couvert des cons\u00e9quences et des dommages encourus. C\u2019est de ce point de vue que, en tout respect, la Cour du Banc du Roi ne semble pas avoir suffisamment tenu compte. Elle a trait\u00e9 la cause comme celle d\u2019un particulier qui aurait tu\u00e9 et invoquerait le cas de l\u00e9gitime d\u00e9fense. Mais, comme le dit la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,\nl\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en autorit\u00e9 et avait le droit et le devoir de tenir l\u2019ordre sur le terrain et de prot\u00e9ger le propri\u00e9taire et les personnes qui faisaient partie de ce cirque.\nIl \u00e9tait \u201cdans l\u2019exercice de (ses) fonctions\u201d; et nous devons nous demander si H\u00e9bert s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 dans les circonstances pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019article 48 du code criminel que l\u2019appelant peut invoquer pour sa justification, alors qu\u2019il se pourrait que ce moyen de d\u00e9fense ne f\u00fbt pas \u00e0 la disposition du citoyen ordinaire.\nApr\u00e8s avoir lu attentivement la preuve, je crois devoir adopter les constatations et les conclusions du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait beaucoup de contradictions dans les t\u00e9moignages quant au nombre de personnes qui troublaient la paix, ni quant aux menaces adress\u00e9es \u00e0 H\u00e9bert, et qui devaient lui faire craindre des blessures s\u00e9rieuses. M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, son agresseur, qui non seulement troublait la paix mais voulait emp\u00eacher le constable de remplir son devoir et probablement lui enlever son arme, a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de sa propre conduite. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de juger apr\u00e8s coup, froidement, les mesures que H\u00e9bert a cru devoir prendre. Nous devons nous demander s\u2019il a eu raison de croire et s\u2019il a cru que la situation \u00e9tait assez s\u00e9rieuse pour lui permettre de se servir de son arme \u00e0 feu en tirant d\u2019abord en l\u2019air pour demander la paix et en cherchant \u00e0 blesser M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, un colosse beaucoup plus fort que lui, qui essayait par violence d\u2019expulser du terrain le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 publique.\nOn nous a dit que H\u00e9bert aurait d\u00fb se contenter de se servir de son b\u00e2ton et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de recourir au pistolet. L\u2019argument ne me convainc pas. Si en se servant du pistolet \u00e0 deux reprises avant de tirer sur M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, ce dernier et la foule n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 intimid\u00e9s, il semble difficile de croire qu\u2019un b\u00e2ton de policier aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour r\u00e9tablir l\u2019ordre.\nNous avons une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9j\u00e0 ancienne dans la cause de Stevenson v. Wilson[1], dans laquelle les honorables juges Day, Smith et Mondelet ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nA magistrate charged with the preservation of the peace in a city, who causes the military to fire upon a person, whereby the latter is wounded, is not liable in an action of damages at the suit of the injured party, if it be made to appear that though there was no necessity for firing, yet the circumstances were such that a person might have been reasonably mistaken in his judgment as to the necessity for such firing.\nEt j\u2019attire l\u2019attention sur les remarques suivantes des juges:\nDay, J.\u2014It is true that when calmly reviewing the occurrence by the light of subsequent information, we are inclined to think that no serious riot existed at the time the order was given; but the question was not what was the true state of affairs at that time, but whether a magistrate acting in exercise of his discretion at a time of great difficulty had reasonable grounds for doing what he did.\nSmith, J., said the position of the magistrate in this case was one of peculiar difficulty, and he was entitled to claim the protection of the law when acting in the exercise of his. discretion. Unless there could be shown such an absolute want of discretion on his part as almost amount to malice, the court would not hold him responsible for the consequences of what occurred. The evidence on this point must be strong and conclusive.\nL\u2019on peut voir, en lisant le rapport de cette cause, que la cour a sembl\u00e9 arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le maire de Montr\u00e9al, lors de ces \u00e9meutes, avait commis une erreur de jugement en ordonnant ou en demandant \u00e0 la troupe de faire feu sur la foule, mais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tout de m\u00eame responsable en dommages pour cette erreur de jugement, qui \u00e9tait excusable dans les circonstances.\nJe crois que H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait plus s\u00e9rieusement menac\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions que le maire de Montr\u00e9al ne l\u2019\u00e9tait par l\u2019\u00e9meute Gavazzi et qu\u2019il avait parfaitement raison, dans les circonstances, d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 son pistolet pour affirmer son autorit\u00e9 et se d\u00e9barrasser de M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, son agresseur. Il est parfaitement \u00e9tabli que ce dernier \u00e9tait un homme tr\u00e8s fort, beaucoup plus jeune que le constable, et que ce dernier ne pouvait pas en avoir raison sans avoir recours \u00e0 son arme. Il n\u2019a certainement pas voulu le tuer; sur ce point son t\u00e9moignage est accept\u00e9 de part et d\u2019autre; il avait simplement l\u2019intention de le blesser pour le mettre hors de combat. Est-ce un mouvement de la victime qui lui tenait le poignet \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qui a fait d\u00e9vier l\u2019arme et la direction de la balle? Nous ne pouvons que faire des conjectures \u00e0 ce sujet. Une chose certaine, c\u2019est que les autorit\u00e9s publiques n\u2019y ont vu aucun acte criminel, et que ni le coroner, ni le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019ont cru que la responsabilit\u00e9 de H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e au point de vue criminel.\nM\u2019inspirant du rapport du comit\u00e9 parlementaire sur l\u2019\u00e9meute de Featherstone (Pari, Papers Imp. 1893-94, c. 7234), je dirais:\nThe taking of life can only be justified by the necessity for protecting persons or property against various forms of violent crime, or by the necessity of dispersing a riotous crowd which is dangerous unless dispersed. * * *\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, nous avons aussi\na crowd which threatened serious injury, amounting to felony, to property and persons, and it became the duty of all peaceable subjects to assist in preventing this. The necessary prevention of such outrage on persons and property justifies the guardians of the peace in the employment against a riotous crowd of even deadly weapons.\nA guilty ringleader who under such conditions is shot dead dies by justifiable homicide * * * The reason is that the soldier who fired had done nothing except what was his strict legal duty.\nJe crois, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que H\u00e9bert s\u2019est justifi\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019a commis, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances et \u00e0 sa position de constable, aucun acte illicite, partant aucun d\u00e9lit, ni quasi-d\u00e9lit; et sa responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e envers les repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux de feu M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin. Je crois que l\u2019appel d\u2019H\u00e9bert devrait \u00eatre acueilli favorablement et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli quant \u00e0 lui, avec d\u00e9pens en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en Cour du Banc du Roi et devant cette cour contre les intim\u00e9s.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

The defendant board of school trustees employed plaintiff as teacher. Under the agreement of employment, either party might terminate it by giving 30 days' written notice, \"provided that no such notice shall be given by the board until the teacher has been given the privilege of attending a meeting of the board (of which five clear days' notice in writing shall be given to the teacher) to hear and to discuss its reasons for proposing to terminate the agreement.\" In terminating plaintiff's employment, said proviso was not observed, nor, as found by this Court on the evidence, was there any effective waiver by plaintiff of his privilege thereunder. Plaintiff sued for damages for wrongful termination.\nHeld (1): S. 196 of the School Act (R.S.A., 1922, c. 51, as amended 1923, c. 35, s. 8), which provided for an appeal to the Minister by \"any teacher who has been suspended or dismissed by the board,\" had no application to deprive plaintiff of his right of action. S. 196\u2020 should be read as relating to a suspension or dismissal under s. 137 (1) (o), and not to a decision to terminate an agreement under s. 199 (2). Further, moreover, s. 196 contemplated a re-hearing on the merits by the Minister of the matter on which the board's decision was given; and, whether in the case of a dismissal or suspension under s. 137 (1) (o), or in the case of termination under a provision such as that in the agreement in question (if s. 196 applied in such case), there was contemplated, before appeal to the Minister, a consideration of the matter by the board after giving the teacher a full opportunity to be heard; and where no such opportunity was given, the board's right to dismiss or suspend under s. 137 (1) (o), or to terminate under such a provision in the agreement, did not come into operation; and s. 196 did not contemplate the supersession of the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts where the sole question was whether or not the board had taken the necessary steps to put itself in the position to give an, effective decision, and did not concern the merits of the decision itself.\nMurray v. Ponoka School District, 24 Alta. L.R. 205, in effect overruled.\n(2): In all the circumstances, the failure by the board to observe the terms of the agreement was a technical breach only; had they been followed, there was no doubt the agreement would have been terminated conformably thereto; plaintiff was entitled to recover as damages the wages to which he would have been entitled during the period required to make effective the stipulated proceedings for its termination (less amount earned during that period elsewhere).

Brookes, 6 Bing., 354).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff (by special leave granted by the Supreme Court of Canada) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Ives J. dismissing his action, which was brought to recover damages for alleged wrongful termination of his agreement of employment as school teacher by the defendant board of school trustees. The material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., for the appellant.\nH. G. Nolan for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal concerns the claim of the appellant for salary as school teacher in the respondents' District, under an agreement dated the 27th of July, 1927.\nThe pertinent provisions of the agreement are these:\n2. The salary to be paid said teacher shall be at the rate of Sixteen Hundred Dollars per year, such salary to be increased annually as follows:\n3. The said Board further binds and obliges itself and its successors in office to pay the said Teacher during the continuance of this Agreement the sum or sums for which it hereby becomes bound in accordance with the provisions of The School Act.\nThe salary earned shall be estimated as provided in Section 199 of The School Act, which is in part as follows:\n\"The salary of a Teacher shall be estimated by dividing the rate of salary for the year by 200 and multiplying the result obtained by the number of actual teaching clays within the period of his engagement;\n\"Provided that if the salary stated in the Teachers contract is given at a monthly rate, the rate of salary for the year shall be deemed to be a sum equal to twelve times the said monthly rate.\" 6. This agreement shall continue in force from year to year, unless it is terminated as hereinafter provided, or unless the Certificate of the Teacher has been revoked in the meantime.\nEither party hereto may terminate the agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice in writing to the other party:\nProvided that no such notice shall be given by the Board until the Teacher has been given the privilege of attending a meeting of the Board (of which five clear days' notice in writing shall be given to the Teacher) to hear and to discuss its reasons for proposing to terminate the agreement.\n8. All amendments to this agreement are subject to the provisions of The School Act and to the approval of the Minister of Education.\nThe appellant was present at a meeting of the respondents on the 20th of June, 1928. At that meeting there was some criticism by the secretary of the board directed against the conduct of the school by the appellant. Among other things, the sufficiency of the preparation of pupils for the forthcoming provincial examinations was adverted to. And after some discussion, one of the trustees, Mr. McLeod, suggested that it would be better to defer action until the results of the examinations were known. The appellant then asked the board, if they had any intention of terminating his agreement, to inform him of it, so that he might make arrangements for another position before the expiry of the summer vacation. Thereupon the chairman of the board appears to have said, (although there is some conflict of evidence upon this) that the matter would be further considered when the results of the examinations became known and the appellant would be communicated with. After the transpiry of the results of the examinations, a meeting of the board was held on the 4th of August, at which it was decided that a change should be made, and that the appellant should be given \"the customary thirty days' notice\" of the termination of his contract, and that applications for the vacant post should be advertised for. Notice in writing was accordingly sent by the secretary, but apparently the appellant did not receive it, and on his return to Athabasca on the 1st of September, it was read to him by one of the trustees in the presence of the secretary. It is stated in the respondents' factum that a meeting of the respondents was held on the 5th of September, at which the appellant was present with a representative of the Teachers' Alliance, and that the situation then was discussed, but apparently with no result. Admittedly the proviso of clause 6 of the agreement was not observed, and the contention on behalf of the respondents that there was an effective waiver by the appellant of his right under the proviso, is without support in the evidence.\nThe substantive defence of the respondents is that by force of section 196 of The School Act, the appellant's only remedy is by way of appeal to the Minister of Education. The courts in Alberta, following their previous decision in Murray v. Ponoka School District[1], gave effect to this defence.\nSecticm 196* is in these words:\n196. Any teacher who has been suspended or dismissed by the board may appeal to the Minister, who may take evidence and confirm or reverse the decision of the board and in the case of reversal he may order the reinstatement of such teacher;\nProvided that if the teacher does not appeal from the decision of the board, or is not reinstated, the teacher shall not be entitled to salary from and after the date of his suspension or dismissal.\nBefore considering the argument founded upon this section, it is desirable to call attention to the terms of two other provisions of the statute.\nBy sec 137 1 of The School Act the powers of a school board are enumerated and it is (inter alia) provided that,\nIt shall be the duty of the board of every district, and it shall have power,\n(o) to suspend or dismiss any teacher for gross misconduct, neglect of duty, or for refusal or neglect to obey any lawful order of the board and to forthwith transmit a written statement of the facts to the Department.\nThe other section is in these words:\n199 (2) Unless otherwise provided for in the contract either party thereto may terminate the agreement for teaching between the teacher and the board of trustees by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party of his or its intention so to do.\nIt will be noticed that in article 6, the agreement reproduces, as one of its stipulations, the enactment of section 199 (2) with the addition of a proviso permitted by the section and sanctioned by the Minister.\nThe point in controversy, as touching the application of this section, is, whether or not, the phrase \"any teacher who has been suspended or dismissed by the board\" applies to the appellant in the circumstances of this case. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that section 196 has no application to a decision by a board to effect the termination of an agreement under section 199 (2) or under a clause in the agreement embodying it.\nI am unable to agree with the conclusion of the Alberta courts for two reasons. First, I think that, regarding the provisions above quoted as a whole, the more natural construction is to read section 196 as relating to a suspension or dismissal under section 137 (1) (o), and not to a decision to terminate an agreement under section 199 (2).\nThen it appears to me that section 196 contemplates a re-hearing on the merits by the Minister of the matter in which the decision of the board is given. In the case of a dismissal or suspension under section 137 (1) (o), the Minister would have to consider whether any of the statutory causes had in fact arisen. In the case of the termination of an agreement under clause 6 (if I am wrong in thinking that section 196 does not apply to such a case), the question for the Minister would be whether the board had adequate reasons for terminating the agreement. In either case, it seems to me, the statute contemplates, before appeal to the Minister, a consideration of the matter by the board after giving the teacher a full opportunity to be heard. The appellant's agreement provides for this in express terms, but the law would attach an analogous condition to the exercise of the powers of a board in proceedings under section 137 (1) (o).\nWhere no such opportunity is given to the teacher, the board's right to dismiss or suspend under section 137 (1) (o), or to terminate the agreement under cause 6 of the agreement before us, does not come into operation. The board has in such circumstances no title in point of law to give a decision under the statute or the agreement, and any decision in fact given would be simply inoperative. An appeal to the Minister would be a most inappropriate remedy in such a case; and, in my opinion, section 196 does not contemplate the supersession of the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts, where the sole question is, whether or not the trustees have taken the necessary steps to put themselves in a position to give an effective decision, and does not concern the merits of the decision itself. The question of damages remains. The plaintiff is entitled to reparation in respect of the loss incurred by reason of the wrongful termination of his contract. Had the contract (art. 6) been complied with, there appears to be no probability that notice of termination of the contract would not have been given.\nIndeed, there is no doubt as to the dissatisfaction of the board at the end of the term, or that action was postponed solely with a view to ascertaining the results of the examinations. There is no room for a suggestion that the board were actuated by any sort of personal feeling, or by any motive other than a desire to secure efficiency in the conduct of the school. In this, the board were simply doing their duty. They may have erred in judgment, there is always a possibility of that, but it was their duty to give effect to their judgment and there is no ground for supposing that the appellant could have invoked any consideration which would have altered their view. In all the circumstances, the failure to observe the terms of the proviso was a technical breach of contract only, in the sense that the observance of it would not, I am entirely convinced, have helped the appellant in any material way.\nThe appellant is entitled to be placed in the same position (so far as that can reasonably be done by pecuniary reparation) as if the contract had been performed; but if the strict terms of the engagement had been followed, there can be no doubt that the contract would have been brought to an end in conformity with its terms. As I have said, in my opinion, there would have been no appeal to the Minister under section 196. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to recover as damages, the wages to which he would have been entitled during the period required to make effective the stipulated proceedings for its termination. He is not entitled to the expenses incurred in moving. French v. Brookes[2]. On the whole, I think it would be fair to calculate this period from the 5th of September; and therefore the period of five days, from the 1st to the 5th of September, must be taken into account In the result, the appellant is entitled to wages for forty-one days, computed in the manner directed by the contract, less the amount received from the Celtic School District, that is to say, to $207.50. The appeal is allowed with costs in this Court and the Court of Appeal, and judgment will be entered for the appellant for the sum mentioned, with the costs of the action. The costs in the Alberta courts will be calculated according to the appropriate scale.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 24 Alta.

Mrs. Tatisich (defendant in the three actions) was driving her motor car westerly, and Edwards (defendant in two of the actions and plaintiff in the other) was driving his car easterly, on the highway between Hamilton and Niagara, on August 12, 1928. It was alleged that Mrs. Tatisich turned out to pass a car ahead of her and that Edwards (coming in the opposite direction), in order to avoid a head-on collision with her car, swerved to his right off the pavement, and on returning to the pavement his car collided with others, causing injuries or loss to the plaintiffs.\nWright J. held that the accident was caused by the negligence of Mrs. Tatisich, and that Edwards was not chargeable with any negligence causing the accident, and gave judgment in all actions in favour of the plaintiffs against Mrs. Tatisich, and dismissed the actions against Edwards. This judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division[2]. Mrs. Tatisich appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The plaintiffs Harding et al. and Gall also appealed, in so far as their claims against Edwards were dismissed, and asked that, in the event of the appeal of Mrs. Tatisich being allowed, they be awarded judgment against Edwards. Leave to all said appellants to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was given by the Appellate Division.\nAfter hearing argument by counsel for the appellant Tatisich, and counsel for the appellants Harding et al. and Gall having stated that they were satisfied to have the judgment below (as given against the appellant Tatisich) sustained as it stands, the members of the Court retired to consider the case, and on their return to the Bench, the Court, without calling on counsel for respondents, delivered judgment dismissing the appeal of the appellant Tatisich with costs. The Chief Justice stated that the Court was of opinion that the question involved was purely a question of fact on which the Court had the explicit finding of the trial judge, confirmed by the majority of the Appellate Division; that question of fact being whether Edwards had recovered sufficiently from the condition of nervous excitement, into which the rash act of the appellant Tatisich had thrown him, to be held responsible for what subsequently occurred, or, whether he should be regarded as still acting involuntarily under the influence of that condition; the Court took the view, notwithstanding Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s very able presentation of the appeal, that nothing had been shewn which would entitle it to determine the question before it otherwise than as the Appellate Division had done.\n(The appeals of Harding et al. and of Gall, against Edwards, were, on counsel for the parties concurring, dismissed without costs.)\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nI.F.

The securities were, at the seizure dates, beneficially owned by alien enemies. The said certificates were: (1) share certificates and special investment note certificates issued by C.P.R. Co., the securities being registered in its branch registry office in New York and transferable there only; (2) bearer share warrants issued by I. Co. and transferable by delivery without anything further having to be done to perfect title; (3) certificates for City of Montreal debenture stock, transferable only on the City\u2019s books by the registered holder or by attorney duly constituted; (the certificate stated that it \u201cshall not constitute the title to the stock, which title shall consist exclusively in registry in the Debenture Stock Register of the City\u201d); (4) certificates for debenture stock issued by T. Co. and transferable on its books either in London (Eng.) or in Canada; the stock in question was on the Toronto register. All said certificates (except the bearer share warrants) were transferable by assignment in writing in common form, and the registered owner had executed the usual assignment and power of attorney, in most cases in blank. The securities were listed and dealt in on recognized stock exchanges. The said Custodian had the assigned certificates presented to the issuing companies and himself or his nominee registered as owner; as to the T. Co. securities, this was not done until a time later than the vesting orders hereinafter mentioned. The Canadian Custodian, in October, 1919, under the authority of s. 28 of the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916 (put into force under the War Measures Act, 1914, Can.) obtained Canadian court orders (except as to the City of Montreal stock) purporting to vest in himself the shares and stock in question. He brought the present actions in 1926, and the question in issue was, which of the two custodians was entitled to the securities.\nHeld (affirming judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1930] Ex. C.R. 75), that the United States Custodian was entitled to the securities.\nPer Rinfret, Lament and Smith JJ.: The Canadian Consolidated Orders, 1916, did not intend or effect prevention of an allied Power from validly seizing shares of Canadian companies the certificates for which were physically situate in the allied country. The seizures by the United States Custodian (having regard to the terms of the authorizing U.S. law) vested in him, as against the enemy nationals, not only the possession of the paper certificates, but every property right and interest to which the beneficial owners thereof would have been entitled had a state of war not existed. Both by Canadian and by United States law, share certificates endorsed in blank by the registered owner give the right to the lawful holder thereof to be registered as owner (Colonial Bank v. Cady, 15, App. Cas., 267, at 277; Disconto-Gesellschaft v. U.S. Steel Corp., 267 U.S. 22, affirming 300 Fed., 751); and this right existed in the United States Custodian (Disconto case, supra) and was, prior to and at the time of the Canadian court vesting orders, a \u201cproperty, right or interest\u201d in him, to the exclusion of any such in an enemy, in respect of the securities in question. (The C.P.R. Co. shares and notes, registered in the company\u2019s New York office in the name of his nominee, and the I. Co. bearer share warrants, were also property in the United States; quaere as to the other securities in this regard). His right to have himself or his nominee registered as the owner of the securities was subject to any assertion by Canada of her paramount legislative power over the companies which had issued the certificates. Canada did assert this power when the shares were vested in the Canadian Custodian by the courts under the Consolidated Orders, but she relinquishes her claim to all vested property which was not enemy property at the time of the vesting (Canadian Consolidated Orders, 1916, ss. 28, 33, 36 (1), and Treaty of Peace (\u2018Germany) Order, 1920, ss. 33, 34, 42 (2) (3), particularly considered in this regard).\nPer Duff and Newcombe JJ.: The Canadian Consolidated Orders, 1916, had no intention or effect of nullifying in Canada proceedings taken by an allied Power to reduce into possession such securities so situated as those in question. The principle of the Disconto case (supra) applied, and the proceedings taken by the American Custodian had the effect of investing him with the rights of a transferee of the securities, including the right to demand registration. Therefore Order 28, which authorized only the vesting of property \u201cbelonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy,\u201d had no application to any of the properties in question. Ss. 33 and 34 of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, which Order was passed pursuant to the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, and was for the purpose of carrying out the Treaty of Peace and giving effect to its provisions, must be read in the light, and within the limitation, of that purpose; the Treaty, while ratifying the administrative orders of Canada acting within her proper sphere, also contemplated ratification of the administrative orders of the United States acting within her proper sphere; and said s. 34 could not be read as giving such an effect to a vesting order purporting to have been made under the Consolidated Orders as would interefere with the operation of an administrative act by the United States properly done within her sphere. As to the T. Co. securities, assuming that the bare legal title of the enemy owner had not been completely extinguished at the time the Canadian court vesting order was made, yet that bare legal title, vested under the vesting order in the Canadian Custodian, was subject to be devested by the exercise of the rights which the American Custodian had acquired under his proceedings; the effect of the Treaty was that the rights so acquired became properly exercisable notwithstanding the existence of the vesting order.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff (the Honourable the Secretary of State of Canada and Custodian under the provisions of the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920) from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1)[1], holding that on the 10th day of January, 1920, the right, title, property or interest in the securities in question was not vested in an enemy or in the plaintiff but was vested in the defendant, the Alien Property Custodian of the United States of America.\nThe material facts and the issues in question are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., A. Geoffrion K.C., and Thomas Mulvey K.C. for the appellant.\nN. W. Rowell K.C., G. H. Montgomery K.C. and W.F. Chipman, K.C. for the respondent the Alien Property Custodian of the United States.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by Lamont J.\u2014These are four appeals from judgments delivered by the President of the Exchequer Court in four cases tried together[2]. They all contain conflicting claims to jurisdiction between the Canadian Custodian of Alien Enemy Property and the Alien Property Custodian of the United States of America.\nThe four cases are very similar although each in some respect differs from the others. They are test cases and they have to do with the seizure in New York by the Alien Property Custodian of certain securities issued by Canadian companies, which securities, at the date of the seizure, were beneficially owned by alien enemies. The facts are not in dispute and, as far as material in the view I take of the rights of the parties, may be stated as follows:\u2014\nOn May 2, 1916, after the outbreak of the Great War, the Governor General of Canada in Council, acting under the authority of the War Measures Act, 1914, put into force the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, section 6 of which reads:\u2014\n6. (1) No transfer made after the publication of these orders and regulations in the Canada Gazette, (unless upon licence duly granted exempting the particular transaction from the provisions of this subsection) by or on behalf of an enemy of any securities shall confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect thereof and no company or municipal authority or other body by whom the securities were issued or are managed shall, except as hereinafter appears, take any cognizance of or otherwise act upon any notice of such a transfer.\nSecurities were defined as including stocks, shares, annuities, bonds, debentures or debenture stock, or other obligations issued by or on behalf of any government, municipality or other authority, or any corporation or company within or without Canada.\nSection 28 of the Orders provided that any superior court of record within Canada or any judge thereof may, on the application of the Canadian Custodian, vest in him any real or personal property belonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy.\nOn April 6, 1917, the United States entered the war on the same side as Canada and the two countries were thereafter allies. After the United States entered the war, Congress enacted and the President approved of the Trading with the Enemy Act. That Act provided that:\u2014 If the President shall so require, any money or other property owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a licence granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owing or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred * * * or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian; * * * (Sec. 7 (c)).\nActing under the authority vested in him the Alien Property Custodian (hereinafter called the United States Custodian) demanded the property represented by the certificates in question, then physically situate in New York, all of which had been issued by Canadian companies existing under Canadian law with their respective head offices in Canada.\nThe certificates delivered in response to the demand were certain specified,\n(1) Common Stock Certificates and Special Investment Note Certificates issued by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Both classes of certificates were transferable only on the books of the company, but the company under its general powers maintained a registry in New York and these securities were on that register, where alone they could be transferred.\n(2) Bearer Share Warrants issued by the Imperial Oil Company and transferable by delivery without anything further having to be done, either in Canada or the United States, to perfect title.\n(3) Certificates for Debenture Stock issued by the City of Montreal. These were transferable only on the books of the city by the registered holder or by attorney duly authorized.\n(4) Certificates for Debenture Stock issued by the Toronto Power Company and transferable on the books of the company either in London, England, or in Canada. The stock in question was on the Toronto register.\nThese certificates were seized, that is demanded and received, between March 27, 1918, and April 27, 1919.\nAs pointed out by the learned President of the Exchequer Court in his judgment[3], all these securities, except the bearer share warrants, were transferable by assignment in writing in common form either upon the certificate itself or by another separate instrument, and, in practically every case, the registered owner had executed the usual assignment and power of attorney, though in most cases in blank. After the seizure of these certificates the United States Custodian caused the assigned certificates to be presented to the companies issuing them, and had himself or his nominee registered as the owner thereof.\nBy an order of a superior court in Canada, dated October 14, 1919, the Canadian Custodian had vested in himself the shares of the Toronto Power Company and of the Imperial Oil Company, the certificates for which had been seized by the United States Custodian. By a similar order, dated October 17, 1919, he had likewise vested in himself the shares and notes of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. These shares and notes at the time the vesting order was made were registered in the books of the company in the name of the nominee of the United States Custodian. No vesting order was obtained for the debenture stock of the City of Montreal.\nIn the early part of 1926 the Canadian Custodian brought an action against each of the said companies and made the United States Custodian a party defendant. The statement of claim alleged that the securities in question therein were, on the 10th day of January, 1920 (the date of the coming into force of the Treaty of Versailles), property belonging to an enemy; that the paper certificates for the securities had been seized, after war had broken out between the United States and Germany, by the \u201cAlien Property Custodian for the United States\u201d; that such seizure was without legal justification; that the securities were, at all material times, property within Canada, and that the plaintiff was entitled to them. The defendant companies in effect submitted their rights to the court.\nThe United States Custodian in his plea alleged that at the time the securities were seized they were the property in the United States of alien enemies, and that the seizure was in accordance with the law of the United States. He also set up that at the time the Canadian Custodian obtained the court orders vesting the securities in himself they had ceased to be enemy property.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court, in each case, held that the United States Custodian was entitled to the securities the certificates for which he had seized[4]. The plaintiff now appeals to this court.\nIn view of the fact that the United States Custodian was the first to take any action to deprive the enemy nationals of their interest in the securities, it is convenient to inquire, in the first place, what right or interest he secured by his seizure as against the enemy beneficially entitled thereto? The securities stood in the books of the respective companies in the names of persons or corporations not shewn to have been enemies, but it is admitted that, in each case, they were held on behalf of an enemy.\nIn a statement of fact agreed to by all parties it is stated that, except as regards the question of jurisdiction between the United States and Canada, the formal regularity under United States law of the steps taken by the United States Custodian to obtain title to the securities is not contested by the appellant.\nBy an executive order made by the President of the United States, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and bearing date February 26, 1918, it is declared that the Alien Property Custodian may make a demand for any money or other property in the United States belonging to, or held for, by or on account of, an enemy not holding a licence under the Act; that such demand, unless expressly qualified or limited, shall be deemed to include every right, title, interest and estate of the enemy in the money or other property so demanded, as well as every power and authority of the enemy thereover; that notice of such demand may be given to any person who, alone or jointly with others, may have the custody or control of, or may be exercising any power or authority over the money or other property, and that when such demand shall be made, and notice thereof given, such \u201cdemand and notice shall vest in the Alien Property Custodian all the estate and interest of the enemy.\u201d This estate and interest is defined as including not only that which actually existed, but also that which might or would exist if the existing state of war had not occurred. The war between Great Britain and Germany was brought to an end by the Treaty of Versailles. Art. 297 (d) of that treaty reads as follows:\u2014\nAs between the Allied and Associated Powers or their nationals on the one hand and Germany or her nationals on the other hand, all the exceptional war measures or measures of transfer, or acts done or to be done in execution of such measures as defined in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Annex hereto shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons except as regards the reservations laid down in the present Treaty.\nBy paragraph 1 of the Annex the validity of all vesting orders and of all other orders, directions, decisions or instructions of any court or any department of the Government of any of the High Contracting Parties made or given, in pursuance of war legislation with regard to enemy property, rights and interests, was confirmed, and it was there provided that no question should be raised as to the regularity of a transfer of any property dealt with in pursuance of such order, direction, decision or instruction.\nIt is true that the United States Government did not directly ratify the Treaty of Versailles, but, by the Treaty of Berlin, which ended the war between Germany and the United States, Germany gave to the United States, and the United States accepted, all the benefits which the Treaty of Versailles gave to the Allied Powers or their nationals. The seizure of the certificates and the agreements which put an end to the war between Germany and the United States, therefore, vested in and confirmed to the United States Custodian, as against the German nationals, not only the possession of the paper certificates, but every property right and interest to which the beneficial owners thereof would have been entitled had a state of war not existed.\nFor the appellant it was contended that, apart from the confirmation of the Canadian vesting orders by the Treaty of Versailles, the seizures of the securities by the United States Custodian, and confirmation thereof by Germany, did not in any way affect the appellant\u2019s right to the securities and that for two reasons:\n(1) Because the Canadian Consolidated Orders, which were in force prior to the dates on which the seizures were made, \u201cfroze,\u201d so to speak, in the hands of the German nationals all property rights which they had in the securities and prevented any rights therein passing from them either by their own acquiescence or by seizure by one of the Allied Powers, and\n(2) Because the paper certificates were not themselves property in the United States, but only the evidence of property situate in Canada.\nThe first of the above cententions cannot, in my opinion, be supported in so far as it claims that it was either the effect or intention of the Consolidated Orders to prevent an allied power from validly seizing shares of Canadian companies the certificates for which were physically situate in the allied country.\nThe object of the Consolidated Orders was, broadly speaking, to curtail the commercial resources of the enemy and to prevent unregulated intercourse with him altogether. It was sought to secure these objects by depriving an enemy owner of property in Canada of all beneficial interest therein during the war. It was recognized that under modern economic conditions property rights had come to consist, to a considerable extent, of intangible choses in action, evidenced by debentures, bonds, and share certificates, many of which found their way into countries other than that in which the company was domiciled. When duly assigned in blank these securities were traded on the international exchanges, and passed from one person to another as property. As in the present case the shares might be standing in the books of the companies issuing them in the names of persons who were not, or were not known to be, enemies. In such cases the only mode of ascertaining what shares were enemy held, was for the Government of the country, in which the share certificates were physically situate, to require all persons holding any such certificates to furnish a list thereof. Under these circumstances it cannot, in my opinion, be held that the Consolidated Orders, which were directed solely against the enemy, were intended to prevent the only allied country which could discover what shares were in reality enemy owned, from taking the steps necessary to effectively deprive the enemy of the power to dispose of them. By his action the United States Custodian brought about the very state of affairs which the Consolidated Orders were intended to secure. Again, that which is prohibited by the Consolidated Orders is the transfer of enemy property. A \u201ctransfer\u201d within the meaning of this prohibition, in my opinion, implies an act plus an intention to pass the property, something done with acquiescence of the enemy owner, or for his benefit. A seizure of enemy property by the United States Custodian against the enemy\u2019s will and contrary to his interests, does not, as I read the Orders, come within the mischief which it was the purpose of the Orders to prevent. A reference to the definition of \u201csecurities\u201d shews that the framers of the Orders considered that shares in a company or corporation without Canada would, if the certificates therefor were in Canada, be considered enemy property here.\nThe next question is, were the certificates seized property rights or interests in the United States? It has been said that the law of the place where the certificates actually are, determines who shall be the owner thereof, while the law of the company\u2019s domicile determines what interest in the company\u2019s stock the possession of these certificates confers upon a holder who has lawfully acquired them. Colonial Bank v. Cady[5]. Under United States law the United States Custodian became, by his seizure, the lawful owner of the certificates and of the entire beneficial interest of the enemy in the shares they represented, and he became such owner before the Canadian Custodian had applied to the court for an order vesting the securities in himself. It is pertinent, therefore, to inquire if, on October 14 and October 17, 1919, when the Canadian Custodian applied to the courts for vesting orders, there was any property, right or interest in an enemy in respect of the securities in question. Under section 28 of the Consolidated Orders, all the court was authorized to vest was the property real or personal (including legal and equitable rights arising therefrom) \u201cbelonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy.\u201d If section 28 stood alone it would seem reasonably clear that when the vesting orders were obtained there was no property right or interest belonging to an enemy which could be vested in the Canadian Custodian. With section 28, however, must be read section 33 of the same Orders:\u2014\n33. Where a vesting order has been made under these orders and regulations as respects any property belonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of a person who appeared to the Court making the order to be an enemy or enemy subject, the order shall not nor shall any proceedings thereunder or in consequence thereof be invalidated or affected by reason only of such person having prior to the date of the order, died or ceased to be an enemy or enemy subject or subsequently dying or ceasing to be an enemy or enemy subject, or by reason of its being subsequently ascertained that he was not an enemy or an enemy subject as the case may be.\nThis section envisages the probability of vesting orders being made covering property belonging to a person not in fact an enemy although appearing to the court making the order to be so, and provides that such an order shall be valid and the property vested in the Canadian Custodian, notwithstanding that it was not in fact enemy property at the time of the vesting.\nThen section 36 reads:\u2014\n36 (1). The Custodian shall, subject to all other (provisions of these orders and regulations, hold any money paid to and any property vested in him under authority of any of these orders and regulations until the termination of the present war, and shall thereafter deal with the same as the Governor General in Council may by Order in Council direct.\n* * *\nIn view of these provisions the intention, in my opinion, was that the title of all property covered by the vesting orders should remain in the Canadian Custodian until after the close of the war when the rights of non-enemy owners would be provided for and justice done by an Order in Council. That Order in Council was passed and is known as the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. Section 33 of that Order is as follows:\n33. All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the 10th day of January, 1920, to enemies, or heretofore belonging to enemies, and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of this Order, are hereby vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in any order heretofore made vesting in the Custodian any property, right or interest formerly belonging to an enemy, such property, right or interest shall be vested in and subject to th\u00e9 control of the Custodian, who shall hold the same on the same terms and with the same powers and duties in respect thereof as the property, rights and interests vested in him by this Order.\nand the material part of section 34 reads:\u2014\n34. All vesting orders * * * and all other orders, directions, decisions and instructions of any Court in Canada or any Department of the Government of Canada made or given or purporting to be made or given in pursuance of the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, or in pursuance of any other Canadian war legislation with regard to the property, rights and interests of enemies, * * * are hereby validated and confirmed and shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons, subject to the provisions of Sections 33 and 41.\nBy this section the vesting orders of October 14 and October 17, 1919, which covered all the securities in question (except the debenture stock of the City of Montreal) were validated and confirmed and made binding upon all persons, subject to section 41.\nSection 41 (2) and (3) reads as follows:\u2014\n(2) In case of dispute or question whether any property, right or interest belonged on the tenth day of January, 1920, or theretofore to an enemy, the Custodian * * * may proceed in the Exchequer Court of Canada for a declaration as to the ownership thereof, notwithstanding that the property, right or interest has been vested in the Custodian by an order heretofore made * * *.\n(3) If the Exchequer Court declares that the property, right or interest did not belong to an enemy as in the last preceding subsection mentioned, the Custodian shall relinquish the same * * *.\nIt does not seem to me to be material whether we consider all the securities vested in the appellant by the orders of the court as being property heretofore belonging to enemies and in the possession of the Custodian at the date the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order came into force (April 14, 1920), under section 33, or as coming within the vesting orders mentioned in section 34. If the former they come expressly within the language of section 41; if the latter the vesting was confirmed subject to section 41. In either case section 41 (2) and (3) applies.\nThe position taken by the Canadian authorities in enacting section 41 appears to me to be this: They say: \u201cThe war is now over, there are certain properties vested in our Custodian by orders of the court, which, it is claimed, were not enemy properties in Canada either when the vesting orders were made or when the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, came into force, we will, therefore, leave it to the Exchequer Court to say whether or not such is the case. If it is, our Custodian will relinquish all his claims to these properties.\u201d Leaving the determination of these disputes to the Exchequer Court necessarily implies that the court would determine the rights of the parties in cases in which vesting orders were made as of the date of the vesting and in cases in which no vesting order was made, as of the 14th of April, 1920. As section 41 was enacted for the purpose of doing full justice to any person, not an enemy, whose property had been vested in the appellant, the intention, in my opinion, was that the rights of the contending parties were to be determined as though the vesting orders had not been made and, in light of those considerations which should, and undoubtedly would, have guided the superior courts in making the vesting orders had all the facts relevant to the ownership of the securities, which are now before us, been before those courts. There would be no object in referring the question to the Exchequer Court if that court was bound to maintain the vesting orders.\nWhat were the rights of the parties when the applications for the vesting orders were made? Would the securities have been recognized by Canadian law as property rights or interests in the United States if the facts had all been before the Canadian courts? In so far as the Canadian Pacific Railway shares and notes are concerned there can, in my opinion, be no doubt. At the time of the application to vest these shares and notes in the Canadian Custodian the nominee of the United States Custodian had already been registered as the owner thereof in the books of the company in the United States. They were, therefore, property in the United States. The share warrants of the Imperial Oil Company, being payable to bearer, were property wherever they were physically situate, for they could be effectively dealt with there. Brassard v. Smith (1)[6]. The debenture stocks of the Toronto Power Company and of the City of Montreal stand in a somewhat different position, as the transfers of these stocks were required to be registered in Canada. In my opinion, however, we do not in this appeal have to resort to rules more or less artificial in character which have been adopted to determine the local situation to be attributed to the various assets of a deceased person, in order to determine who would be entitled under Canadian law to be registered as owner of the securities. I think the question may be determined as to all the securities on the ground that, both by Canadian law and the law of the United States, share certificates indorsed in blank by the registered owner are, in the hands of a lawful holder, recognized as \u201cproperty, rights, or interests\u201d which entitles the possessor to be registered as owner. In Colonial Bank v. Cady[7], Lord Watson used this language:\u2014\nWhen the indorsed transfer has been duly executed by the registered owner of the shares, the name of the transferee being left blank, delivery of the certificate in that condition by him, or by his authority, transmits his title to the shares both legal and equitable. The person to whom it is delivered can effectually transfer his interest by handing his certificate to another, and the document may thus pass from hand to hand until it comes into the possession of a holder who thinks fit to insert his own name as transferee, and to present the document to the company for the purpose of having his name entered in the register of shareholders and obtaining a new certificate in his own favour.\nHis Lordship goes on to point out that \u201cdelivery\u201d does not invest him with the ownership of the shares in the sense that no further act is required in order to perfect his right, and farther on he says:\u2014\nIt would, therefore, be more accurate to say that such delivery passes, not the property of the shares, but a title, legal and equitable, which will enable the holder to vest himself with the shares without risk of his right being defeated by any other person deriving title from the registered owner.\nThe demand of the United States Custodian for the certificates, and their delivery to him by the agent or trustee of the enemy, although in pursuance of a compelling statute, was, in my opinion, \u201cdelivery\u201d within the meaning of Lord Watson\u2019s judgment. Disconto-Gesellschaft v. U.S. Steel Corporation[8], affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States[9].\nIn this latter case the Public Trustee as English Custodian had seized in England certificates indorsed in blank representing certain shares in the United States Steel Co., a New Jersey corporation, which were beneficially owned by German companies. After the close of the war these enemy companies brought an action in the United States, against the U.S. Steel Co. and the Public Trustee, claiming that the seizure of certificates in England did not constitute a seizure of the shares of the New Jersey corporation represented thereby. It was held that the seizure in England transferred the title to the certificates to the Public Trustee by English law, and, by the law of New Jersey and the law of England the owner of such certificates may write a name in the blank indorsement and thus entitle the nominee to become registered as owner of the shares; the Trustee was, therefore, entitled to the securities. In giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Holmes said:\u2014\nTherefore New Jersey having authorized this corporation like others to issue certificates that so far represent the stock that ordinarily at least no one can get the benefits of ownership except through and by means of the paper, it recognizes as owner anyone to whom the person declared by the paper to be owner has transferred it by the indorsement provided for, wherever it takes place. It allows an indorsement in blank, and by its law as well as by the law of England an indorsement in blank authorizes anyone who is the lawful owner of the property to write in a name, and thereby entitle the person so named to demand registration as owner in his turn upon the corporation\u2019s books.\nBut for the existence of war conditions the beneficial owners of the shares could have demanded the certificates representing the shares from their trustees in the United States who were the registered owners and, if the trustees failed to deliver them duly endorsed, to the beneficial owners, these latter could have obtained from the American courts an order declaring the registered owners to be trustees for them and directing that the certificates be delivered up. With such a declaratory order and the certificates the beneficial owners would, on an application to Canadian courts, have been entitled to an order directing the respective companies issuing the shares to register them in the name of the beneficial owners. This right to compel title passed to the United States Custodian on the seizure of the certificates. Even if this right could not be termed property in its strictest sense, it is, in my opinion, a right or interest in property which, under both Canadian and United States war legislation, was intended to be dealt with as property of which the beneficial enemy owner was to be deprived.\nThe United States Custodian having vested in him all the interest of the enemy owner in the securities in question and having in his possession the certificates representing these securities duly indorsed, was entitled, under both Canadian and United States law, to have himself or his nominee registered as the owner thereof, provided there was no assertion by Canada of her paramount legislative power over the companies which had issued the certificates. Canada, in my opinion, did assert her paramount power when the shares were vested in the appellant by the courts under the Consolidated Orders but, as one would expect from a civilized country, she relinquishes her claim to all vested property which was not enemy property at the time of the vesting. As all the securities in question had ceased to be enemy property when vested in the appellant, the Exchequer Court, in my opinion, was right in awarding them to the United States Custodian. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Newcombe JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014These appeals severally concern: (1) shares and special note certificates of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, (2) bearer share warrants of the Imperial Oil Limited, (3) debenture stock of the Toronto Power Company Limited, and (4) consolidated stock of the City of Montreal; to which the appellant claims to be entitled as Canadian Custodian of Alien Property, as against the respondent, the Alien Property Custodian for the United States of America.\nThe facts out, of which the controversy arises can be stated very briefly. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s securities were, at the material time, represented by certificates in the name, as to the shares, of one Lowitz, and as to the note certificates, in the name of Lowitz and others. Transfers in blank, executed by the holders named in the certificates, were endorsed upon them. The certificates were in the possession of Speyer & Company in New York. The registered holders of the shares, as well as Speyer and Company, who were the depositaries of the certificates, held them in all respects on account of the Deutsche Bank, a German national. These shares and note certificates were registered in New York in the company\u2019s branch registry office there, and were transferable there and there only. The legal title to the security was in each case in the registered owner, but the securities were regularly dealt with on the recognized stock exchanges, by means of the certificates which, with the transfers endorsed were transferable by delivery; the owner of such a certificate, so endorsed, being recognized by the company as entitled to insert a name in the blank transfer, and to have the person so named registered as owner. On the 28th March, 1918, the respondent, the American Custodian, acting under powers conferred upon him by Acts of Congress, determined that these securities were enemy property, and required, accordingly, delivery of the certificates to his nominee, and subsequently caused the shares and certificates to be registered in the proper registry in the name of his nominee. Subsequently, on the 17th of October, 1919, a vesting order purporting to be made under Order 28 of the Canadian Consolidated Orders of 1916, respecting trading with the enemy, was obtained by the appellant, vesting the shares and note certificates in him.\nThe bearer share warrants of the Imperial Oil Company are warrants declaring that the bearer is entitled to a specified number of shares in the capital stock of the Imperial Oil Company.\nThe Supplementary Letters Patent of the Company provide (paragraph 7): \u201cThe bearer of a share warrant shall be deemed to be a shareholder of the Company for all purposes and to the full extent, subject always to the provisions of the Companies Act and of these Supplementary Letters Patent in that behalf.\u201d\nOn the 14th of September, 1918, the warrants were in the custody of the Guarantee Trust Company in New York, who held them for account of one Heideman, an alien enemy; and on that date they were, pursuant to the demand of the American Custodian, delivered to his nominee as enemy property. Subsequently, on the 14th of October, 1919, the appellant obtained a vesting order, vesting these warrants in him as Custodian.\nThe consolidated debenture stock of the Toronto Power Company was registered in the name of one Wallach, who held it on behalf of the Verdeutch Bank, an enemy alien. The stock was represented by certificates with blank transfers endorsed executed by Wallach which, on the 13th of May, 1918, were in possession of Kuhn, Loeb & Company, in New York; on that date these certificates were, on demand of the American Custodian, delivered into the possession of his nominee as enemy property. These certificates entitled the registered holder of them to participate in the benefit of certain sums (principal and interest) payable to the British Empire Trust Company of London, England, under a certain trust deed. The registry was in Toronto, and the legal title to the stock was vested in the person there registered as owner, and was transferable on the books there, but the certificates were dealt with on recognized stock exchanges, and passed, with the endorsed transfer executed in blank, by delivery; and the company recognized such transferees of certificates as entitled to be registered as the legal owners of the stock.\nThe consolidated stock of the City of Montreal was registered in the name of the Hartford Trust Company, a trustee for the South German Reinsurance Company, the last mentioned company being an alien enemy. On the 26th day of April, 1919, the American Custodian demanded the certificates, and on a later date the stock was transferred into the name of his nominee. In this case no vesting order was obtained. A condition governing the transfer of this stock is expressed in these words:\nThis stock can be transferred on the books of the City only by the registered holder or by attorney duly constituted, and the capital thereof will be paid to whoever is the registered holder at its maturity, but this certificate shall not constitute the title to the stock, which title shall consist exclusively in registry in the Debenture Stock Register of the City.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court, before whom the action was tried, dismissed the claim of the appellant on the ground (to state it very summarily) that the respondent, the American Custodian, had, by the proceedings outlined above, acquired a title to the securities in dispute[10].\nThe judgment is attacked in two ways: first, it is said that the Consolidated Orders of 1916 made absolutely inoperative any transfer of any security issued or managed by any Canadian \u201ccompany or municipal authority, or other body\u201d after the publication of these Orders, and that consequently, the American Custodian could not by the proceedings mentioned acquire the securities in question. Second, it is said that these securities were, within the meaning of s. 33 of the Treaty of Peace Order, 1920, \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201crights\u201d or \u201cinterests,\u201d \u201cin Canada\u201d which, prior to the date of the Order, 14th April, 1920, belonged to enemies, and, at the date of the Order, were in \u201cpossession or control of the Canadian Custodian,\u201d and that by force of s. 33, they became \u201cvested in and subject to the control of the Custodian\u201d; and furthermore, that, by force of s. 34 of the same Order, the vesting orders which had been obtained in respect of three of the groups of securities, as above explained, are, in point of law, \u201cfinal and binding upon all persons,\u201d and that the designation \u201call persons,\u201d includes the respondent, the American Custodian. These contentions can most conveniently be considered in the order in which I have stated them.\nAnd first, of the effect of the Consolidated Orders of 1916. There can be no doubt that Order 6 of the Consolidated Orders, which deals specifically with securities of the kind we are concerned with, is sweeping in its scope, and is absolute in its terms. It applies to securities issued by all Canadian companies, municipal and other corporations and bodies, and, read literally, it nullifies any unlicensed transfer of any such security \u201cby or on behalf of an enemy\u201d made after the publication of the Consolidated Orders, and prohibits all such companies, corporations and other bodies taking notice of any such transfer. No exception is made in favour of securities transferable by delivery or in favour of persons acquiring such securities for value, without notice of the enemy interest. The point in controversy is whether or not this Order, as well as other Orders dealing with other phases of trading with the enemy, had the effect of nullifying, in Canada, proceedings taken by allied and associated powers for the purpose of reducing into possession securities of the character here in question. If the contention of the appellant is right, then, quite independently of the intervention of the appellant, it was the duty of the companies and corporations concerned to refuse to recognize the application of the alien custodian of the United States to be registered as the holder of the securities, of which he had taken possession. Not only was it the duty of the company or corporation so to refuse, but, by taking notice of and acceding to such an application, the company or corporation which did so exposed itself to the penalties of Orders 45 and 46.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court has decided this point adversely to the appellant upon his construction of the Consolidated Orders as well as upon the authority of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Disconto-Gesellschaft v. U. S. Steel Corp.[11]. The issues there concerned the right of the Public Trustee of the United Kingdom, as Custodian of Alien Property, to be registered as the owner of certain shares of the United States Steel Company, which were represented by certificates in the name of a broker domiciled in England with a transfer endorsed executed in blank by the broker, and held by the appellants, a German corporation and an alien enemy; which certificates, together with the right of the appellant to the shares, had been vested in the Public Trustee by an order of the Board of Trade. As regards certificates of the character described, the court said:\nTherefore New Jersey having authorized this corporation like others to issue certificates that so far represent the stock that ordinarily at least no one can get the benefits of ownership except through and by means of the paper, it recognizes as owner any one to whom the person declared by the paper to be owner has transferred by the endorsement provided for, wherever it takes place. It allows an endorsement in blank, and by its law as well as by the law of England an endorsement in blank authorizes anyone who is the lawful owner of the paper to write in a name, and thereby entitle the person so named to demand registration as owner in his turn upon the corporation\u2019s books.\nThis statement applies mutatis mutandis to the securities in question here, with the exception of the bearer share warrants, the ownership to which passes by delivery, without registration.\nI must here advert to an argument advanced regarding the City of Montreal consolidated stock and the Toronto Power Company stock. There can be no doubt that in both these cases the legal title to the stock could be transferred only upon the books of the corporation; but in that respect the securities adverted to do not differ from the securities under discussion in the judgment just quoted, or from those which are the subject of Lord Watson\u2019s observation in Colonial Bank v. Cady[12]:\nThe original transferor, who is entered as owner in the certificate and register, continues to be the only shareholder recognized by the Company as entitled to vote and draw dividends in respect of the shares.\nThe important point is that, in the case of the securities of the City of Montreal and of the Toronto Power Company as in other cases (including the case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company), the corporation, having presented to it a certificate bearing the name of the registered owner, together with a transfer executed by him, will register, and is bound by law to register as owner the transferee named in the transfer, notwithstanding the fact that the transfer may have been originally executed in blank, and may have passed through numerous hands before the name of the transferee was inserted. The law of this country as applicable to the corporations with which we are concerned, recognizes that shares, and particularly those which are regularly the subjects of trading on stock exchanges, are sold and bought by the delivery of a certificate accompanied by a transfer executed in blank, and that the market price of the shares is paid upon delivery, which is treated as the execution of the sale, because it confers upon the person receiving the document a title, as Lord Watson says, in the case already cited[13], \u201clegal and equitable, which will enable the holder to vest himself with the shares without risk of his right being defeated by any other person deriving title from the registered owner.\u201d\nThere is no doubt, I repeat, that the terms of Order 6 are quite comprehensive enough to reach any such transfer of the securities of a Canadian corporation made by or on behalf of an alien enemy, and, if effect be given to the ex facie sense of its terms, to \u201cstrike it with sterility.\u201d But the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Disconto case[14], took the view that scrip and certificates, which, in the degree manifested by the practice described, stand for the securities which they evidence, may be subject, not only as pieces of paper, but as representing those securities, to appropriation in time of war by a sovereign power exercising its right to appropriate enemy property, and that such appropriation will invest such sovereign power with the title legal and equitable against the corporation which has issued the security, which in ordinary times would have passed to a transferee by delivery. That is the view which the Supreme Court of the United States took in the Disconto case14 of an appropriation by the Public Trustee in England of certificates of shares in an American company. The rule was applied in favour of the Public Trustee, that the law of the place where the certificate was must determine whether or not the transaction had the effect of investing the Public Trustee with the rights of a transferee of the shares, including the right to demand registration.\nThe question we have to consider is whether the Consolidated Orders, as the appellant contends, displace this principle, or rather whether, in the system set up by the Consolidated Orders, there is room for the operation of this principle. We must not overlook the fact, I think, that this method of dealing with enemy securities, by seizing, that is to say, the document of title, was practised freely, and, we may assume, wherever possible. Obviously, a security which can be transferred by delivery of a document in such a way as to leave no trace of the hands through which it passes, can be most effectively immobilized by taking possession of the document. It was, no doubt, within the power of Canada, and, it may be assumed that such is the effect of Order 6, to nullify transfers so effected of the securities of Canadian companies at whatever undeserved injury to innocent and friendly persons, by prohibiting the recognition by Canadian companies of any claim originating or depending upon a transfer by or on behalf of an alien enemy to a transferee however innocent, after the publication of the Consolidated Orders. But this would offer no sure guarantee against the alien enemy, whose interest was concealed under the name of an agent or trustee, realizing upon his security to the disadvantage of the subjects of the British Empire or of friendly powers, and the more direct procedure was plainly the preferable one. The Consolidated Orders themselves recognize it, and it was, no doubt, but into practice whenever the opportunity occurred in the countries engaged in the war.\nThe primary object of these Orders, as sufficiently appears from them, was to cripple the enemy, by depriving him of the benefit of property which could be taken possession of. Primarily that was the purpose of these Orders, and I do not find in them any evidence of an intent to repudiate proceedings taken by other governments associated with us in the prosecution of the war to take possession of the class of property in which German investments would most likely be found, namely, corporation securities. The argument as put on behalf of the appellant would lead to the rather singular result that a proceeding by the Public Trustee in England, which would be recognized in the United States as effective to entitle him to be registered as a shareholder in a New Jersey company, would be ineffective in the case of a Canadian company. It is true that the provisions of the Consolidated Orders as to the licensing of particular transactions are not entirely free from obscurity, but the exception in Order 6, \u201cunless upon licence duly granted exempting the particular transaction from the provisions of this section,\u201d could hardly apply to the statutory provisions under which the Public Trustee acted in the United Kingdom; and it seems clear that this exception does not contemplate something done under public authority in any other part of the British Empire. Indeed, it seems beyond question that the very words of Order 6 themselves \u201cby or on behalf of an enemy,\u201d exclude such compulsory proceedings from the scope of the Order.\nMy conclusion is that compulsory proceedings by the public authorities of a country associated with Canada in the prosecution of the war are not within the contemplation of Orders 2, 3,4 and 6. It follows from this, that Order 28, Which authorizes only the vesting of property \u201cbelonging to or held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy,\u201d had no application to any of the properties in question here. The validating Orders, 32 and 33, do not appear to affect the matter. Indeed, it is expressly stated in the supplementary memorandum filed on behalf of the appellant that, except in cases under Order 17, which does not concern us, \u201cthe evident purpose of the Consolidated Orders and the vesting orders issued under authority thereof was to deal only with enemy interest in property,\u201d and again, \u201cthe vesting order as such, aside from identifying the property interest involved, had nothing to do with fixing the status of the property as enemy owned, but was merely an administrative measure to be used to reduce such property to possession when deemed \u2018expedient for the purposes of these orders and regulations\u2019\u201d. The memorandum, I think, in this sentence admirably states the true view of the vesting orders.\nI now come to the consideration of the second ground of attack, which has its basis in sections 33 and 34 of the Treaty of Peace Order of April, 1920. In the view I take of the considerations governing this phase of the controversy, it is not necessary to analyze strictly the language of these sections. It may, however, conduce to lucidity to reproduce them textually in so far as they are pertinent. The material parts of them are as follows:\n33. All property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the 10th day of January, 1920, to enemies, or heretofore belonging to enemies, and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of this Order, are hereby vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian. (P.C. 267, 1924).\n34. All vesting orders and all orders for the winding up of businesses or companies, and all other orders, directions, decisions and instructions of any Court in Canada or any Department of the Government of Canada made or given or purporting to be made or given in pursuance of the Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, or in pursuance of any other Canadian war legislation with regard to the property, rights and interests of enemies, and all actions taken with regard to any property, business or company, whether as regards its investigation, sequestration, compulsory administration, use, requisition, supervision, or winding up, the sale or management of property, rights or interests, the collection or discharge of debts, the payment of costs, charges or expenses, or any other matter whatsoever in pursuance of any such order, direction, decision or instruction, and in general all exceptional war measures or measures of transfer or acts done or to be done in the execution of any such measures are hereby validated and confirmed and shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons, subject to the provisions of Sections 33 and 41.\n(2) The interests of all persons shall be regarded as having been effectively dealt with by any such order, direction, decision or instruction dealing with property, rights or interests in which they may be interested, whether or not their interests are specifically mentioned therein;\n(3) No question shall be raised as to the regularity of a transfer of any property, rights or interests dealt with in pursuance of any such order, direction, decision or instruction.\n(4) The provisions of this section shall not be held to prejudice any title to property heretofore acquired in good faith and for value and in accordance with the Canadian law by a British subject or by a national of any of the Powers allied or associated during the war with His Majesty.\nOrder 33, in the view advanced by the appellant, applies to the groups of securities in controversy for two reasons. First, they were at the critical date, the 10th of January, 1920, property in Canada, and had always been property in Canada. In each case, it is said, every interest in the unit of intangible property described as a share or debenture stock, had its situs where the head office of the corporation was, which must be regarded as the centre of the mass of its assets, and consequently, no order made under the authority of the United States, and no proceeding taken by the respondent, the American Custodian, could affect prejudicially to the government of this country, in other words, prejudicially to the appellant, the enemy character or status of any such interest. Such being the case, it follows, the argument proceeds, that the property became by force of s. 33 vested in, and subject to the control of, the Custodian. That argument, presented with a great deal of ability by counsel on behalf of the appellant, is answered mainly by invoking the doctrine above indicated as the doctrine in the Disconto case[15], and nothing, as far as I can see, can usefully be added to what I have said on that point.\nA supplementary argument is put forward in relation to the City of Montreal securities, as to which counsel insist that, owing to the terms of conditions attached to the certificates quoted above, the property in the Montreal consolidated stock must be held to have its seat in Montreal. This argument I have really dealt with, but there is perhaps an additional point which ought to be mentioned. This debenture stock stood in the name of the Hartford Trust Company, an American corporation, as trustee for the German company. Now it is quite clear that the trust would not be recognized by the City of Montreal, and it is, I think, also clear that as a trust it would not be recognized by the law of Quebec. The Hartford company might under that law be under a personal obligation, and possibly stand in the relation of mandatary to the German company, but the German company would possess according to the law of Quebec no jus in re. On the other hand, the Hartford company in its own domicile, would be under the obligations of a trustee, and there is much, I think, to be said for the view that the seat of the equity, as well as of the personal obligation, would be at the Hartford company\u2019s domicile. If that is so, then the United States was the proper sovereignty to appropriate the enemy rights. On the question of the situs of two other groups of securities, those of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and of the Imperial Oil Limited, special points are made which are not without their weight. As to the Imperial Oil Limited, the provision quoted from the Supplementary Letters Patent makes it perfectly clear that the benefit of the obligation passes with the delivery of the instrument. The analogy of negotiable instruments, strictly so called, is pertinent, and indeed, seems to be almost, if not quite, complete. Such instruments have their situs where they are physically situated. There also is the situs of the obligation.\nAs to the Canadian Pacific Railway shares, it is pointed out that by the law of the province of Quebec, which is the law of the head office of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, these shades, for the purpose of determining the incidence of succession duty, have their situs at the branch office at which they are registered and can only be validly transferred; Brassard v. Smith[16]. The litigation there related to shares in a bank, but there is no pertinent distinction. True it is, that the considerations determining the situs of an intangible item of property, for one purpose, may not be conclusive where it may be necessary to ascribe to it a constructive situs in some other connection, or for some other purpose, but in the judgment just referred to, Lord Dunedin proceeded upon the view that for the purposes of succession duty and probate, the determining factor must be the answer to the question, where can the subjects be effectively dealt with? In addition to everything that has been said as to the importance for the purposes of war measures of getting at the document, which in ignorance of its enemy character could itself be circulated as a valuable asset, there is the circumstance that, in the case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s shares, the place for perfecting the legal title and thereby completing the disposition was New York. This also is not without its application to the Imperial Oil securities. The place of effective disposition was the place where the warrant was. The appellant, however, in this branch of his argument does not rest entirely upon this. As regards three of the groups of securities, namely, those for which vesting orders were obtained by him, he invokes s. 34 and affirms that under that section the vesting orders were valid and binding on all persons, which he says includes the respondent, the American Custodian, and these groups of securities, he says, therefore, were under his control by virtue of the vesting orders, and since they fall within the category of \u201cproperty, rights and interests in Canada * * * heretofore belonging to enemies,\u201d they became by force of s. 33 vested in him subject to his control. The argument is that, recognizing to the fullest extent the doctrine of the Disconto case[17], first, legislative authority over all these securities rested in Canada by virtue of the fact that the corporations were here, and that this fact in itself is sufficient to establish the existence of an interest having a situs here; then secondly, or rather, perhaps, in the alternative, it is said that since in every case except in the case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s shares, the legal title to the shares could only be transferred in Canada, there was in respect of these securities, an interest having a constructive situs in Canada, prior to the passing of the Treaty of Peace Order, over which the appellant had acquired control by virtue of the vesting orders, the validity of which, by reason of s. 34, could not be impugned.\nTo all this, the answer, I think, rests upon broad considerations. The Treaty of Peace Order was passed pursuant to the Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, by which it was provided that the Governor in Council might make such Orders in Council as might appear to him to be necessary to carry out the Treaty and for giving effect to any of the provisions of the Treaty. That is the purpose of the Treaty of Peace Order with which we are concerned. By the Treaty, it was provided that all property rights and interests belonging to German nationals at the date of the coming into force of the Treaty might be detained by the allied and associated powers within their territory. And it was also provided that, as between Germany and German nationals and the governments of allied and associated powers, all vesting orders and other administrative acts by the several powers dealing with the property of German nationals should be ratified and confirmed. Order 34 is obviously intended to give effect in Canada to this ratifying provision. Indeed, the Governor in Council under the statute had no authority to go beyond the Treaty. The Orders in Council authorized were Orders in Council framed for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Treaty. The scope of ss. 33 and 34 must be limited by the scope of that purpose. The Treaty, while ratifying the administrative orders of Canada acting within her proper sphere, also contemplated ratification of the administrative orders of the United States acting within her proper sphere. S. 34 therefore cannot be read as giving such an effect to a vesting order purporting to have been made under the Consolidated Orders as would interfere with the operation of an administrative act by the United States properly done within her sphere. The function of the section is not to determine the respective spheres of Canada and the United States as between themselves. This follows from a consideration of the genesis and purpose of the Order. The language of the Order also comports with this view. The words of s. 34 are not the words one would expect to find in an Order in Council dealing with competing claims between Canada and a sovereign power which had been associated with us in waging the war. The phrase \u201call persons\u201d in s. 34 does not include the United States of America as a nation.\nThe controversy, therefore, must be determined by reference to the principles indicated above in the consideration of the Consolidated Orders. In none of the groups of securities, it follows, was there anything on which a vesting order could take effect except in the case of the securities of the Toronto Power Company. There it may be assumed, for the purpose of the argument, that the legal title, that is to say, the bare legal title, of the enemy owner, had not been completely extinguished at the time the Canadian vesting order was made, but the bare legal title, vested under the vesting order in the Canadian Custodian, was subject to be devested by the exercise of the rights which the American Custodian had acquired under his proceedings. The effect of the Treaty would appear to be that the right so acquired became properly exercisable notwithstanding the existence of the Canadian vesting order. The Treaty, it is to be observed, being a Treaty of Peace, had the effect of law quite independently of legislation.\nOne or two points have been made on behalf of the appellant, which require separate notice.\nIt is said that the Orders must be construed in such a way as to apply to transactions in neutral countries in the same manner as to transactions in the countries of the allied and associated powers. The point has really no significance here, because the real issue now before us is whether or not a proceeding by which the government of an allied or associated power acquires an enemy property is, for the purpose of the Consolidated Orders or the Treaty of Peace Order, to be regarded as in the same category as a voluntary transaction by an alien enemy for his own benefit.\nThe compulsory proceedings of the American Custodian which are in question could in purpose and substance have no proper analogue in a neutral country.\nThen, an important argument is advanced to the effect that, allowing full play to the principle of the Disconto case[18], in cases where the Canadian Custodian has not intervened, the doctrine of that decision stops short at that point, and does not apply here, because the contest is one between the Canadian Custodian and the American Custodian. The difficulty confronting the appellant under this head is this: The core of his argument, as his supplementary memorandum demonstrates, consists in denying the applicability of the principle of the Disconto case18 to public proceedings in the United States or in other allied countries in respect of enemy owned securities of Canadian companies. If he is wrong in this, his argument necessarily fails, and in truth, the appellant does not represent the \u201cparamount power\u201d of Canada, to quote the phrase of the Disconto case18, except in so far as the Consolidated Orders and the Peace Treaty Order permit him to do so. The doctrine of that case gives legal force to a practice necessary for the effectual immobilization of enemy securities of the character here in question, and, for the reasons already given, the Orders do not contemplate a repudiation of that doctrine.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Aim\u00e9 Geofjrion.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the Alien Property Custodian for the United States: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Canadian Pacific Railway Company: Rodolphe Paradis.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Imperial Oil, Limited: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Toronto Power Company, Limited: I.

Held: The application should be declared null and void unless it was clearly established that by \"instalment savings certificate\" both plaintiff and C. meant a certificate for a certain specific kind of share which defendant could issue; and the onus of establishing that their minds were ad idem as to this rested on defendant. The evidence established that the contract offered by C. to plaintiff was one allowing plaintiff to mature his shares in five years, and, according to the defendant association's rules, he would have such right only as a holder of savings shares; the class of shares, therefore, which plaintiff and C. had in mind when the application was signed was savings shares. There was no consent by defendant's directors to a right in plaintiff to mature his shares in five years. The right was important; and, although plaintiff had not complained with respect to it before bringing action, his immediate quarrel being with respect to other privileges alleged to have been represented, this did not justify the inference that such right was not one of the causes inducing him to sign the application or that he did not rely upon it; the onus of showing that the representation was not relied on rested on defendant; and there was no evidence that it was not relied on or was waived. Defendant had failed to establish that plaintiff intended to subscribe for instalment shares, and, as defendant had no intention of accepting, and did not accept, an application for savings shares, their minds were never ad idem, there was no contract, and plaintiff was entitled to recover his moneys paid.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia affirming the judgment of Fisher J., dismissing his action, in which he asked that the application made by him for shares in the defendant association and the certificate for shares issued to him be cancelled or declared null and void, and that he recover the moneys ($1,500) paid by him to defendant in respect thereof. Fisher J. held that there was an actual concluded contract between the parties for 700 Class \" E \" Instalment Shares of the defendant association (Class \" E \" to be substituted for Class \" F \" by rectification); and he also dismissed the claims of plaintiff based on alleged misrepresentations.\nThe material facts of the case and issues in question are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed, and it was directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for $1,500 and costs throughout.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by LAMONT J.\u2014In this action the appellant seeks to recover the sum of $1,500, being the amount of three payments of $500 each made by him to the respondent, hereinafter called the \"Association,\" under a supposed contract between himself and the Association.\nThe Association is a corporation under the Savings and Loan Associations Act of British Columbia (ch. 62, Statutes of 1926-1927) formed for the purpose of raising a fund by the sale of its shares and making loans to its shareholders upon the security of real estate in British Columbia or upon the security of shares in the Association other than guarantee shares. The Association, under the Act, was permitted to issue four classes of shares: guarantee shares, investment shares, instalment shares and savings shares. The first two of the above classes had to be paid for in full at the time of subscription; the last two were payable by instalments. On or about November 28, 1927, an agent of the Association, one Christie, who had previously had one or two conversations on the street with the appellant, called upon him in his office and asked him if he would open a savings account with the Association. The appellant expressed his willingness to do so. After matters in reference thereto had been discussed between them for a short time, Christie handed the appellant an application form which the appellant signed and handed back to Christie with his cheque for $500. The application reads as follows:\u2014\nGUARANTY SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION 7748\n543 Pender Street West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nInitial payment $500.00.\nCertificate No. 3264\nDate Nov. 28, 1927.\nI, R. P. Baker, hereby make application for a $70,000.00 Class \"F\" Instalment Savings Certificate of the GUARANTY SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION payable in 114 months at $490.00 per month, commencing the 15th day of November, 1927.\nIt is understood that I am to have withdrawal privileges plus interest in accordance with the Rules of the Association and the Charter granted under the \"Savings and Loan Associations Act\" of the Province of British Columbia.\nI hereby appoint Geo. S. Harrison, the Managing Director for the time being of the Association, as my proxy to vote for me at all annual and special meetings of the Association hereafter held at which I may not be present. On November 29 the application went before the directors of the Association and, according to the evidence of one of them, was accepted, although the minutes of the meeting do not shew any resolution to that effect. On the following day the Association forwarded to the appellant by mail a pass book together with a certificate, under the corporate seal of the Association, which certificate reads as follows:\u2014\nINSTALMENT INVESTMENT CERTIFICATE 3264 GUARANTY SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION\nVancouver, B.C.\nThis certifies that in consideration of the payment to the Association of Four Hundred and Ninety Dollars, payable on or before the 15th day of each month for the full term of one hundred and fourteen months, unless sooner matured, R. P. Baker, of 522 Pender Street West, Vancouver, B.C., is the owner of seven hundred Class \" F \" Instalment Shares numbered 61414 to 62113 inclusive of the GUARANTY SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION of the par value of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) each, transferable only upon the books of the Association upon the surrender of this Certificate properly assigned.\nUPON all payments having been made the GUARANTY SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION will pay at its office, Vancouver, B.C., on the 15th day of May, 1937, unless matured at an earlier date, the sum of Seventy Thousand Dollars, together with the surplus then apportioned to the shares represented by this Certificate to the then legal holder upon the surrender thereof.\nTHIS Certificate is issued and accepted by the holder hereof subject to the conditions contained in the application and those endorsed hereon, and the Rules of the Association.\nOn the back of the above the following among other conditions were indorsed:\u2014\n2. Payments are to be made on the 15th day of each month, provided that any proportion or the entire amount of the instalment required may be paid in advance until with interest thereon to be compounded semiannually at Five per cent. (5%) per annum on the amount paid up thereon the shares have reached the matured value of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per share.\n4. There shall be no withdrawals other than the advance payments within one (1) year of this contract, and until twelve (12) monthly payments have been made.\n6. This contract shall mature as soon as the payments, together with accrued interest, shall total the maturity value of the contract.\nThe appellant says that when he got the pass book he just looked to see if he had been credited with the $500 and then put it in the drawer of his desk. On December 4, 1927, and January 9, 1928, the appellant made two more payments of $500 each. Then he went to Honolulu with his family and did not return until March, when he received a letter from the Association stating that it had not yet received \"the February deposit on your savings account.\" The appellant did not make any further payments, giving as a reason that either he overlooked the matter or else did not have the money. In June he wrote the Association stating that when he opened the account he had been told by the Association's representative that the funds he deposited would be available for his use at any time provided he left a balance of $200; that he desired to temporarily use $1,200, and to let him have that amount. The Association refused to allow him to withdraw the money, claiming that, under his contract and the rules of the Association, such right of withdrawal did not then exist. He then consulted his solicitor, and got for him the pass book, and it was then that he discovered the certificate in the back of the pass book. This certificate when folded is just the size of the leaves of the pass book. Up to that time the appellant says he had not read the certificate. After ascertaining the rights granted to him and the obligations imposed upon him by the application and its acceptance in the terms of the certificate, the appellant brought this action and asked for the cancellation of the application and the certificate, and a return to him of the money paid, on the grounds: (1) that the application was a nullity inasmuch as the Association had no power to issue the \"Instalment Savings Certificate\" applied for; (2) that his application was for a Savings Certificate which the directors did not accept but, in pretended acceptance thereof, issued to him an Instalment Investment Certificate, and (3) if the application and certificate constituted a contract, he was induced to sign the application by the misrepresentation of the Association's representative, Christie. The trial judge gave judgment in favour of the Association which was confirmed on appeal.\nReferring to the contention that the application was a nullity, as being an application for an Instalment Savings Certificate, the learned trial judge held that the Association had not the power to issue such a Certificate if each of the words \" Instalment\" and \" Savings \" was to be given the special and technical meaning imparted to it by the rules and interpretive sections of the Act when used with the word \" share.\" He, however, denied the appellant relief for the reason which he states as follows:\u2014\nI do not think, therefore, that in negotiations preliminary to or amounting to a contract even with regard to shares the word \" Savings,\" when used, as here, in conjunction with the word \"account\" or \"certificate \" and not with the word \" share \" should be interpreted as having the special or technical meaning imparted to it, when used in immediate conjunction with the word \"share\" by statutory or constitution definitions which neither party might have in mind and which would make the expression used in the written application self-contradictory. I think it is a fair inference that the word \"Savings\" was used with its ordinary rather than with any such special or technical meaning. I find therefore that both parties understood that the application was for Instalment Shares.\nThe application signed was a formal printed one placed by the Association in the hands of its agents for the express purpose of enabling them to obtain thereby subscriptions for shares in the Association. This application with its acceptance was intended by the Association to constitute a binding contract. The certificate which the Association intended should be issued pursuant to the acceptance of the application was a certificate that the appellant was the holder of 700 of the Association's shares. As the Association considered the application for a certificate to be an application for shares, the word \"Savings\" in the application must, in our opinion, be given the same meaning as it would have borne if the word \"Shares\" had been substituted therein for the word \"Certificate.\" The language of the application was the language of the Association and, in case of ambiguity arising from the use of particular words, these must be construed most strongly against it. It is admitted that the Association had no power to issue an \"Instalment Savings Certificate.\" The application, therefore, must be declared null and void, unless it is clearly established that by the phrase \"Instalment Savings Certificate \" both the appellant and Christie understood and meant a certificate for a certain specific kind of share which the Association had power to issue. The onus of establishing that their minds were ad idem as to this, rests on the Association.\nThe real contest in this case is as to the kind of share the appellant was applying for. As a business man of large affairs, desirous of establishing with the Association a fund of $70,000, he must, in our opinion, be held to have contemplated depositing that sum under some contract which it was in the power of the Association to make. As the fund was to be accumulated by monthly payments, his choice of contracts was limited to two classes: a contract for Instalment Shares and a contract for Savings Shares. In the Act these are defined as follows:\u2014\n\"Instalment Share\" means a share in an association on which payments of a like amount are required to be periodically made as specified in the rules.\n\"Savings Share\" means a share in an association on which any payment of not less than 25 cents may be made at any time.\nTurning to the rules, however, we find in Clause 3, subclauses 4 and 5, the following:\u2014\n4. Instalment shares shall be payable as follows: *** Class \"E\", in monthly instalments of Seventy cents ($0.70) per month per share for one hundred and fourteen (114) months; *** provided that with the consent of the Directors any proportion or the entire amount of the instalments required may be paid in advance.\n5. Savings shares shall be payable as follows: Payments may be made thereon at any time and in any amounts of not less than twenty-five cents ($0.25) per share; provided that the holder of savings shares must maintain an average payment per share per month according to the class of share for which he subscribes as follows: *** Class \"E\", Seventy cents ($0.70) per month per share for one hundred and fourteen (114) months; ***\nBy Clause 4, sub-clauses 7 and 8, both classes of shares entitle the holder to a dividend of 5 per cent. per annum compounded semi-annually.\nSub-clauses 10 and 11 in part read:\u2014\n10. Instalment shares shall mature upon the required number of monthly payments being made as required by the investment certificate *** In the event of the Directors allowing any instalment shareholder to make payments in advance, such payments shall not mature the shares with respect to which they are made before their regular maturity, except with the consent of the Directors.\n11. Savings shares shall mature when the payments made thereon, together with the interest credited thereon, compounded semi-annually at Five per cent. (5%) per annum, shall reach the sum of One Hundred dollars ($100.00) per share ***.\nClause 5, sub-clause 3, sets out the holder's right of withdrawal thus:\u2014\n3. Instalment and savings shares shall have no withdrawal or loan value until after One (1) year from the 15th day of the month for which the first payment applied, and until One (1) full year's payments have been made; provided that the said term of One (1) year may in the discretion of the Directors be reduced to a period not less than Three (3) months from the date of issue of the said shares.\nand sub-clause 5 reads:\u2014\n5. In the event of the withdrawal of instalment or savings shares before maturity, the owner shall only be entitled to receive the annual amount paid in, less membership fees, plus interest at the rate of Four per cent. (4%) per annum compounded semi-annually.\nFrom these rules it will be seen that the differences between \" instalment shares \" and \" savings shares \" are: (1) With respect to instalment shares the unpaid balance may be paid up only with the consent of the directors, whereas on savings shares such payment may be made as a matter of right, for although the proviso in Clause 3, sub-clause 5, states that the holder of a savings share must maintain an average payment per share per month, such requirement cannot be read as interfering with the holder's statutory right to make thereon, at any time, any payment of not less than twenty-five cents. (2) Payments in advance on instalment shares, when allowed by the directors, do not mature the shares so as to enable the certificate holder to obtain the return of his money before the maturity date of his shares, unless the directors so consent. In the case of savings shares, if the unpaid balance is paid in advance the shares automatically mature when the sums paid, together with the interest credited thereon, amount to $100 per share. The certificate holder may then withdraw the full maturity value of his shares.\nThe question then is, on the material before us, has the Association established that the appellant intended to contract for instalment shares as it alleges? The contention of the appellant is that he had no intention of contracting for instalment shares, and that the representations made to him by Christie establish that Christie had no intention of selling him such shares. The representations relied on are: (a) that he could deposit as much as he wished at any time; (b) that the policy could be matured in five years, and (c) that he could withdraw moneys from time to time so long as he kept a balance with the Association of $200. The appellant testifies that each of these representations was made to him by Christie and points out that the rules in force shew that such representations were wholly untrue as applied to instalment shares. With reference to these representations Christie gave the following testimony:\u2014\nQ. *** you told Mr. Baker he could deposit as much as he liked at any time and when the deposits with the interest reached $70,000 although it took less than 114 months, but not less than five years the policy would mature?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You told him that?\u2014A. Yes. Q. There is no question about that. Now, I think you have told me, Mr. Christie, that you asked Mr. Baker if he wanted to open a savings account. Did you make that statement?\u2014A. Open a savings account?\nQ. Or an account for himself?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. And that he could deposit as much as he liked at any time. You have told me that?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And in the event of withdrawals his interest would decrease from 5 to 4 per cent. Did you tell him that?\u2014A. I don't recollect whether I did or not.\n***\nQ. You do not dispute that was said, do you?\u2014A. No.\nWith reference to the right to withdraw sums deposited, Christie said:\u2014\nI told him there was no withdrawal privilege for a year and then down to 2 per cent. of the maturity value of the account.\nHe also gave this testimony:\u2014\nQ. Did you or did you not familiarize yourself with the rules and constitutions?\u2014A. No, I didn't read over the rules and constitution.\nQ. You didn't read them over?\u2014A. No.\nQ. How did you explain matters to prospective clients?\u2014A. Took what we were told at the office and what there was on the savings certificate itself.\n***\nQ. So you got all your information from the officers of the Association and from the certificates?\u2014A. Quite.\nThis evidence establishes beyond question that the contract which Christie was offering the appellant was one which permitted him, as a matter of right, to deposit as much as he wished at any time and that, if the sums he paid plus the interest amounted to $100 per share, he could, at the expiration of five years, withdraw the whole deposit. Such right the appellant would have only under a certificate for savings shares, as the rules above quoted shew.\nThe learned trial judge held that, although the right to pay instalments in advance under the certificate issued by the Association could only be exercised with the consent of the directors, yet, as the Association did accept $10 in addition to the $490 specified in the application on each of the occasions on which payments were made, he thought the representation could be considered \" true for all practical purposes as the directors had apparently given their required consent to the payment of instalment shares in advance.\" This conclusion, in our opinion, is not consistent with the attitude taken by the directors when they were considering whether or not they would accept the application, as appears from the evidence of Mr. Allen, the manager of the Association. Mr. Allen, in answer to a request to tell just what had occurred, said:\u2014\nThe application was read by Mr. Harrison to the directors, and they discussed whether or not to accept the application, due to the amount of it. It was finally pointed out by one of the directors that inasmuch as this application would require our paying $70,000 on a specific date, we would have a period of time in which to prepare for the payment of this sum, and we could plan sometime before the maturity date.\nThis statement shews that the directors not only had not consented but also that they had no intention of consenting to any payments in advance which would enable the appellant to obtain his money before the date specified in the contract. Even if the Association accepted an advance payment of $10 on the three occasions on which money was paid, that would not give the appellant a right to demand its acceptance on any other occasion. No payment of any kind had been made when Christie made the representation. To a business man accumulating as large a sum as $70,000, it is easy to understand how important it might be for him, after the expiration of five years, to have a right to pay in the amount of the unpaid instalments and then be able to draw out at once the whole fund, and, from the evidence of Mr. Allen quoted above, it appears to have been likewise a matter of importance to the Association that, in the case of so large a sum, the contract holder should not have the right to call upon it to pay over the fund before its maturity date. On behalf of the Association it is said that the right to mature the shares in five years was not a matter of which the appellant had complained. It is true he had not said anything about it before action brought. His immediate quarrel with the Association was in respect of their refusal to allow him the withdrawal privileges which he claimed he had been told his contract would give him. The fact that up to the time he brought his action he had complained only in respect of the withdrawal privileges, does not justify the inference that the right to mature the shares in five years was not one of the causes inducing him to sign the application, or that he did not rely upon it.\nWhere such an untrue representation has been made, the onus of shewing that it was not relied on rests upon the party who made it. In view of the importance which it might have for the appellant to be able, by paying up the unpaid instalments, to withdraw his investment at the expiration of five years, we are of opinion that it cannot be said that this was an unimportant representation. There is no evidence that it had been waived, or was not relied on.\nWe find it unnecessary to express an opinion as to the effect of the alleged representation that the appellant would have the right, under his contract, to withdraw all sums deposited down to $200, or the effect of describing, in the application, the shares applied for as Class \" F \" shares, when the rules shew that a share payable in 114 months was a Class \" E \" share. As to the materiality of the latter there may be room for doubt.\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that, as the rights which Christie admitted he stated would flow from the acceptance of the appellant's application would belong to the appellant only in case he became a holder of savings shares, the class of shares which both the appellant and Christie had in mind when the application was signed was savings shares. The Association has, therefore, failed to establish that the appellant intended to subscribe for instalment shares and, as it had no intention of accepting, and did not accept, an application for savings shares, there was no contract between them. The minds of the parties were never ad idem.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment below set set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff for $1,500 with costs in all courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fraser & Murphy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Burns, Walkem & Thomson.\n",

The consideration was $100 cash and a yearly rent of $10. C. entered into possession on March 10, 1821, and possession was continued in successive assignees, and it was admitted in this action that defendant was in possession as assignee of whatever rights. C. had under the lease. The rent was paid yearly to March 10, 1920, when the Crown refused to accept further rents. From about 1875 the rent was paid to the Department of Indian Affairs, for the benefit of the Indians. The lease was registered at the Department of Indian Affairs in 1875. There was in evidence a letter of February 26, 1875, from an official of the Department to one B., an Indian, (in reply to a letter from B., not produced) in terms apparently recognizing rights of C. under the lease. The Crown notified defendant to give up possession at the expiration (March 10, 1920) of the term of 99 years; and, defendant not complying, it took proceedings to recover possession of the land, as ungranted Crown lands reserved for the Indians.\nHeld (1) The Crown was entitled to possession. The lease was invalid in law; the chiefs had no power to make it (St. Catherines Milling & Lumber Co. v. The Queen, 14 App. Cas. 46); and the taking of it violated the Proclamation of 1763 respecting Indians and Indian lands, and subsequent enactments (Reference to Order in Council of Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada of November 10, 1802, in evidence; to C.S.U.C., 1859, c. 81, ss. 21 et seq.; and to the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1886, c. 43, ss. 38-41, and subsequent revisions). The receipt of rent at the Department could not serve to validate the lease; nor had anything done created any obligation on the Crown to recognize the right to possession claimed by defendant.\n(2) The defendant was not entitled to compensation for improvements. There was no statutory liability on the Crown; and defendant had not established any act or representation for which the Crown was responsible whereby he was misled to believe that he had a title which could be vindicated in competition with that of the Crown, or whereby the Crown had incurred any equitable obligation to recognize a right to compensation; defendant and his predecessors knew that there had been no surrender, and that they had no grant from the Crown; and all the circumstances justified the conclusion that they were not, at any time, in ignorance of the infirmity of their title. (Ramsden v. Dyson, L.R. 1 E. & I. Ap., 129, at 168, cited).\n(3) The finding in the Exchequer Court that the Crown should recover $400 per annum for defendant\u2019s use and occupation from March 10, 1920, should, on the evidence as to value, be sustained.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (Audette J.), [1929] Ex. C.R. 28, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Audette J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] holding: that the lease in question, bearing date March 10, 1821, between the British Indian Chiefs of St. Regis and one Chesley (under which the defendant claimed title) was null and void ab initio; that the Crown (plaintiff) was entitled to recover possession forthwith from the defendant of the land in question, with the appurtenances; that the Crown recover from the defendant, for the use and occupation of the land and appurtenances by him, the sum of $400 per annum, to be computed from March 10, 1920, until the delivery of possession by him to the Crown; and that defendant\u2019s claim for compensation for improvements made, by him or his predecessors in occupation, upon the land, be dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nG. I. Gogo K.C. for the appellant.\nW. C. McCarthy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Attorney-General of Canada, by Information filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada, seeks to recover, as ungranted Crown lands reserved for the Indians, the possession of the lands hereinafter described, situate on Cornwall Island, in the River St. Lawrence, opposite the town of Cornwall. The island is said to be five miles long; to average in width three-quarters of a mile, and to comprise 3,500 acres. There is in proof a report of Mr. Davidson, an Indian Agent, dated 3rd June, 1878, wherein it is stated that this island is exclusively occupied by Indians, except the Chesley farm (the subject of this action), containing about 200 acres, and that there are thirty-seven houses on the island, inhabited by about forty families. It is shewn elsewhere that the farm extends across the island from one side to the other, thus dividing into two sections the lands which remain in the possession of the Indians. The dichotomy is explained by the circumstances in which the claim has its origin.\nThere is in evidence a document, dated 10th March, 1821, executed at Cornwall\nby and between the British Indian Chiefs of St. Regis, in the Province of Lower Canada, of the first part and Solomon Youmans Chesley, of the said Town of Cornwall, gentleman, of the second part;\nWhereby the said Indian Chiefs, for themselves and on behalf of their tribe (whom they represent) for and in consideration of the sum of One Hundred Dollars to them in hand paid by the said Soloman Youmans Chesley, before the signing, sealing and delivering of these presents as well as the rents and covenants hereinafter mentioned do by these presents lease, convey and to farm let unto the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns all and singular that certain parcel of land and premises situated on Cornwall Island in the River St. Lawrence and being composed of that portion of it which lies immediately south and in front of the said Town of Cornwall containing by admeasurement one hundred and ninety-six acres more or less which piece or parcel of land and tenement is butted and bounded as follows, viz:\u2014Commencing at the water\u2019s edge on the north side of said Cornwall Island nearly opposite to the Court House in said Town and at the mouth of a ravine or gully immediately below Nett Point where a white ash post is planted and running south ten degrees east fifty-two chains more or less across said Island to the south bank thereof, thence following the water\u2019s edge downwards a distance at a right angle from the base line of forty-five chains to a white oak post, thence northward on a line parallel to said base line across said Island to the water\u2019s edge on the north side thereof, thence following the water\u2019s edge upward or against the current to the place of beginning. To have and to hold the said land and premises with all and singular its appurtenances unto him the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns for and during the full end and term of ninety-nine years to be fully ended and completed and at the expiration thereof for another and further like period of ninety-nine years and so on until the Ml end and term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years shall be fully ended and completed. He, the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns yielding and-paying there for to the said Chiefs of St. Regis and their successors yearly and every year on the tenth day of February, the sum or rent of ten dollars of lawful money of Canada, and the said Chiefs do hereby covenant with the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns, that they are the representatives of the said tribe of St. Regis as well as trustees of their estate and as such that they have a perfect right to make, execute and deliver this lease in good faith upon the terms and conditions herein already expressed.\nAnd there are covenants on the part of Mr. Chesley with the Indian Chiefs, expressed as follows:\nAnd the said Solomon Youmans Chesley, for himself, his heirs and assigns doth hereby covenant and agree to and with the said Indian Chiefs of St. Regis and with their successors in manner and form following, that is to say: that he the said Solomon Y. Chesley being put into peaceable and quiet possession of aforesaid described lands and premises shall and will on the tenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, pay unto the said Indian Chiefs or their successors, the sum or rent of ten dollars, at the Town of Cornwall aforesaid and in like manner, so long as he the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns shall be kept and assured in peaceable and undisturbed possession of said lands and premises, so long as he, his heirs and assigns continue to pay the said annual sum at rent of ten dollars on the tenth day of February in each succeeding year to the end and term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years.\nAnd further that should he the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns allow the said rent of ten dollars to remain unpaid by the space of one month after the same shall have been due in any year to come and after the same may have been legally demanded, he and they shall renounce the said land and premises and return the same to the said Indian Chiefs or their successors.\nThe original document is not produced upon this appeal; but it purports, so it is said, to be executed under seal, on behalf of the parties of the first part, by nine individuals, said to be Indian Chiefs, and by Mr. Chesley, the party of the second part. There is no evidence whatever as to what were the powers or authority of the British Indian Chiefs of St. Regis, but it is admitted that the premises, being Crown Lands, had not been ceded or surrendered to the Crown by the Indians; and, therefore, as a matter of law, the Chiefs could not dispose of the reserve or any part of it, or of any estate therein. St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[2]. And there is an additional reason in this case why the alleged lease, in the absence of proof to the contrary, should be regarded as invalid, seeing that the Chiefs, whatever powers they may have possessed during their tenure of office, profess to grant an estate in the land, to commence at a time ninety-nine years after the date of the instrument. It is very carefully stated that the term is to endure for ninety-nine years to be fully ended and completed and at the expiration thereof for another and further like period of ninety-nine years and so on until the full end and term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years shall be ended and completed.\nStrong J., who certainly did not speak without information as to the facts, tells us in his dissenting judgment in the St. Catherines Milling case[3], that\nthe control of the Indians and of the lands occupied by the Indians had, until a comparatively recent period, been retained in the hands of the Imperial Government; for some fifteen years after local self government had been accorded to the Province of Canada the management of Indian Affairs remained in the hands of an Imperial officer, subject only to the personal direction of the Governor General, and entirely independent of the local government, and it was only about the year 1855, during the administration of Sir Edmund Head and after the new system of Government had been successfully established, that the direction of Indian affairs was handed over to the Executive authorities of the late Province of Canada.\nThere is no evidence that either the Imperial Superintendent of Indian Affairs or the local government was, at the time, consulted or became in anywise party to or concerned in, or even informed as to the transaction of 1821 between the Chiefs and Mr. Chesley, which certainly was brought about in breach of the prohibition expressed, and repeated more than once by the proclamation of 1763, as essential to the interest of the British Crown and the security of its colonies. The governors and commanders-in-chief in America are forbidden to grant warrants of survey, or to pass any patents upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to or purchased by the Crown, are reserved to the Indians, or any of them; and all British subjects are strictly forbidden, on pain of the royal displeasure, from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved (which include the lands now in question), without our special leave and licence for that purpose first obtained.\nAlso, it is provided that:\nAnd We do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described, or upon any other lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements.\nMoreover the policy of the Crown is further emphasized by the following injunction:\nAnd whereas great frauds and abuses have been committed in the purchasing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of Our interests and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians; in order, therefore, to prevent such irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of Our Justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, We do, with the advice of Our Privy Council, strictly enjoin and require that no private person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts of Our colonies where We have thought proper to allow settlement; but that, if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the same shall be purchased only for Us, in Our name, at some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that purpose by the Governor or Commander-in-Chief of Our colony respectively, within which they shall lie.\nThese provisions have persisted, both under British and Colonial administration; and there is in evidence an Order in Council of the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, dated 10th November, 1802, and certified for publication, which comes out of the custody of the Dominion Archives, and reads as follows:\nHis Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor in Council hereby gives notice, to all whom it may concern, That no leases which have been, or shall be Granted, or pretended to be Granted, by or under the authority of any Indian Nation, will be admitted or allowed\u2014And this Public Notice is given in order that No person may pretend ignorance of the same.\nSee the clauses relating to Indian lands in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859, chap. 81, sees. 21 et seq.; also the Indian Act as enacted by the Dominion, R.S.C., 1886, chap. 43, secs. 38-41 inclusive, and in the subsequent revisions.\nLooking at the provisions of the lease itself, which have been fully quoted above, it is difficult to avoid a reasonable inference that Mr. Chesley was fully aware of the precarious nature of the estates evidenced by the instrument of 10th March, 1821. It will be perceived that he paid the chiefs $100 in hand; and, beyond that, the consideration on his part for the valuable concession which he stipulated for consists only of the annual rent of $10. It is not suggested that there was any meeting of the band to authorize or approve the grant; and Mr. Chesley\u2019s security, quantum valeat, consists in the covenant of the chiefs, \u201cthat they are the representatives of the said tribe of St. Regis as well as trustees of their estate and as such that they have a perfect right to make, execute and deliver this lease in good faith upon the terms and conditions herein already expressed.\u201d Mr. Chesley, upon his part, covenants for payment of the rent to the chiefs at Cornwall \u201cso long as he the said Solomon Y. Chesley, his heirs and assigns shall be kept and assured in peaceable and undisturbed possession of said lands and premises\u201d; and, finally, it is provided that if he, Mr. Chesley, his heirs and assigns, \u201callow the said rent of ten dollars to remain unpaid by the space of one month after the same shall have been due in any year to come and after the same may have been legally demanded, he and they shall renounce the said land and premises and return the same to the said Indian Chiefs or their successors.\u201d\nIt would seem not improbable that the lease first came to the knowledge of the Department of Indian Affairs when, on 18th February, 1875, Mitchell Benedict, an Indian of the St. Regis settlement, wrote to the Superintendent General, or the Deputy Superintendent General, presumably making enquiries about the validity of Mr. Chesley\u2019s title. Immediately following this letter, on 24th February, 1875, the lease was registered at the Department, as certified by the initials of Mr. Van Koughnet, the Assistant Superintendent General; and a letter was written to Benedict on 26th idem, signed, as I infer, by Mr. Van Koughnet, and saying:\nI have to state in reply to your letter of the 18th inst., that the lease to Mr. Chesley of 196 acres of land on Cornwall Island in the St. Lawrence River is dated March 10th, 1821, and is for 99 years, renewable at the end of each such period until the full term of 999 years has expired on payment of the annual rental of $10.00. Mr. Chesley has complied with the terms of his lease, and has a right to sublet the land as he has been in the habit of doing for years.\nA memorandum, written by Mr. Chesley, is also introduced by the defendant, which reads as follows:\nIn reply to a letter from Mitchell Benedict an Indian of Cornwall Island addressed to the Indian Department under date the 18th February, 1875, enquiring whether the ownership and possession of a farm on Cornwall Island by Solomon Y. Chesley was known to me and recognized by the said Department. A letter was addressed to the said Benedict by direction of Mr. Laird the Superintendent General, under date the 24th February, 1875, stating that Mr. Chesley held a lease for 196 acres of land on Cornwall Island dated 10th March, 1821, to run 999 years from date at a rental of $10 per annum. That Mr. Chesley having fulfilled his engagements under said Lease he had a right to said land and to sublet same as heretofore.\nThe said lease is registered in the Book of the office of the Indian Department on the 24th February, 1875, as appears indorsed on the back thereof. Certified by the initials of Lawrence Van Koughnet, Asst. Supt. Genl. But there seems to be some confusion about the minutes relating to this subject, because it is stated by counsel for the defendant, and admitted by counsel for the Crown, that\nthe endorsement upon our original lease at Cornwall shows that the late Mr. Van Koughnet made a memorandum on the back of the lease that it was originally in the Department on the 24th September, 1875.\nIt is admitted, in the following terms, that Mr. Chesley entered into possession on or about 10th March, 1821, and that\nthe present defendant is in possession as assignee of whatever rights Solomon Y. Chesley had under that original lease. There is a chain of assignments but they admit that they have been in possession.\nThen, immediately following,\nThe Crown admits that during that period rents were paid by the occupant and received by the Crown, or the Department of Indian Affairs, for the benefit of the Indians.\nAnd this, as I interpret it, is intended to mean that during the period of the defendant\u2019s possession, the rent, instead of being paid directly to the Indian Chiefs, as it was at the beginning, was paid to the Department for the benefit of the Indians, although there is evidence in another place that the first payment of rent to the Department was made in 1877, three years before the defendant was born.\nThe defendant continued to pay the rent until the expiry of the term of ninety-nine years provided for by the lease; and there are Admissions:\nThat all rents provided by the lease in question herein have been paid by the original lessee and successive occupants to 10th March, 1920, since which time the Respondent (the Crown) has refused to accept further rents.\nThat the Respondent served Appellant with Notice to Quit and demand for possession in due time prior to the expiration of the first 99 year period of the lease in question herein.\nThat the Appellant has remained in possession of the lands described in said lease since the 10th March, 1920, and is still in possession of same.\nThat the Appellant is the successor in title to such rights as the original lessee from the Indian Chiefs may have had and has been in continuous possession thereof since on or about the 28th October, 1904.\nThe facts are not set out or introduced in a very orderly fashion and the reader is left in some perplexity to ascertain precisely the order of events and what the truth is; but nevertheless, it seems to be clear enough that although the lease was ineffective and void at law, by reason of the absence of any authority on the part of the grantors to make it, and for non-compliance with the peremptory requirements of the proclamation, which have the force of statute, an officer of the Department, constituted after the union of the provinces in 1867 for the administration of Indian Affairs, registered the lease, not earlier than 1875; and, from that time until the expiration in 1920 of the demised term of ninety-nine years, received, for the Indians, the annual rent of $10, as it accrued from year to year. But the Department then ceased to tolerate the defendant\u2019s possession and gave notice to quit in a manner which, it is admitted, satisfied the requisites, as in the case of a tenant from year to year; refusing to receive any further rent, or in any manner to recognize a tenancy. And so the case passed to the Attorney-General, who filed his Information on 18th October, 1921; but the defendant remained in possession, and, pending the litigation, has enjoyed the benefit of the use and occupation.\nThe defendant alleges four grounds of appeal: first, that the alleged lease was not void ab initio; secondly, that the learned judge erred in holding \u201cthat the appellant was not entitled as of right to compensation for permanent improvements\u201d; thirdly, he denies that the proclamation of 1763 affects the transaction; and, fourthly, he denies that the Crown is entitled to $400 a year for the occupation of the premises after 10th March, 1920.\nThe learned judge found no difficulty in disposing of the case, and I have no doubt that his conclusions must be maintained. By the formal judgment he declared that the lease of 10th March, 1821, was and is null and void ab initio, and that the King was entitled to recover forthwith the possession of the lands described with their appurtenances. He found the value of the defendant\u2019s use and occupation, computed from 10th March, 1920, until delivery of the possession, to be at the rate of $400 per annum; and, moreover, he held that the defendant\u2019s. claim for compensation for improvements made by him or his predecessors should be dismissed.\nThere is some conflict of opinion as to the annual value of the premises, but the evidence certainly preponderates in favour of an estimate not less than that found by the learned judge; and, therefore, his finding in that particular ought not to be disturbed.\nAs to the defendant\u2019s claim for compensation for the improvements to which he asserts a right, there is no statutory liability upon the Crown; and I agree with the learned judge that the defendant has entirely failed to establish any act or representation, for which the Crown is responsible, whereby he was misled to believe that he had a title which could be vindicated in competition with that of the Crown. There is no claim to recover compensation for the use of the premises during the period of the first term, which, in the words of the instrument, is \u201cfully ended and completed\u201d; and, to that extent, the defendant has profited by the unauthorized and illegal transaction. The learned judge refers to the leading case of Ramsden v. Dyson[4]; and I cannot avoid the conclusion that the defendant and his predecessors were not, at any time, in ignorance of the infirmity of the title which they claim to have derived from the Indians; and, certainly, they knew that there had been no surrender, and that they had no grant from the Crown. The law, as applicable in such cases, is very aptly stated by Lord Wensleydale at page 168, where he says:\nIf a stranger build on my land, supposing it to be his own, and I, knowing it to be mine, do not interfere, but leave him to go on, equity considers it to be dishonest in me to remain passive and afterwards to interfere and take the profit. But if a stranger build knowingly upon my land, there is no principle of equity which prevents me from insisting on having back my land, with all the additional value which the occupier has imprudently added to it. If a tenant of mine does the same thing, he cannot insist on refusing to give up the estate at the end of his term. It was his own folly to build.\nThe letter from the Indian, Mitchell Benedict, is not produced, and without it one cannot interpret the reply with certainty; moreover the introduction of secondary evidence by Mr. Chesley\u2019s memorandum, admitted to be inaccurate in a material particular, does not add to the proof. Whether Mr. Laird or Mr. Van Koughnet was the writer, he was evidently under an utter misapprehension if he intended to assure the Indian of the validity of the Chesley lease, and these gentlemen should have sought the advice of the law officers; but, anyhow, Mr. Chesley was not a party to the correspondence, and it contains no representation by which the Crown is bound to him. If he were looking for an assurance from the Indian Department to strengthen his title, why did he not approach the competent authorities in a straightforward manner? Neither the Crown, as to its title, nor the Indians, as to their burden upon the lands, are to suffer deprivation by the facts which this incident discloses or suggests.\nIt is true that, during the latter part of the term of ninety-nine years, the annual rent of $10 was received at the Department of Indian Affairs, and presumably distributed as belonging to the income of the band or the Indians of the reserve; but that circumstance could not serve to validate a lease which was void at law, nor even to create a tenancy from year to year under conditions which the law prohibited. In any event, the defendant and his predecessors have had the full benefit of possession for the term during which the rent was paid; and, for the period which has since elapsed, and for the future, the Crown has not, so far as I can perceive, incurred any obligation, legal or equitable, to recognize the defendant\u2019s possession or right to compensation.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George I.

Brockman, [1914] A.C. 338, at 368, cited); and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 1 M.P.R. 556, holding (by a majority, reversing judgment of Paton J., ibid) that the alleged public road exists, and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action for trespass, should be affirmed.\nAnglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. dissented, holding that there was not sufficient evidence of dedication of the alleged highway (the only ground relied on at bar) to prove that fact; that the locus of the highway claimed to have been dedicated was left quite uncertain; and that the acts of user were wholly consistent with there having been merely a private right of way, or personal understandings for use of a way, and, while circumstances may warrant an inference of dedication, just as they may prove any other fact, that inference must be the only one that can reasonably be drawn from them.\nThe admissibility in evidence of an ancient book, being a record of meetings of the proprietors under the original settlers\u2019 grant from the Crown, was discussed, but not decided; the majority basing their judgment on evidence apart from it, and the dissenting judges, while much inclined in opinion against its admissibility, yet assuming its admissibility in dealing with the case.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs (by special leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] which, by a majority (reversing judgment of Paton J. (1)) held that a public road exists across plaintiffs\u2019 lands in question; that defendant as one of the public had the right to use the road; and that the plaintiffs\u2019 action, which was for damages for trespass and for an injunction, should be dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. dissenting.\nC. J. Burchell K.C. for the appellants.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Newcombe and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The defendant alleges a public right of way across the plaintiffs\u2019 lands, which he had been accustomed to exercise, and which, in 1929, the plaintiff, Hedley T. Fulton, obstructed by a fence. The plaintiffs are proprietors of a parcel of land in the eastern part of the peninsula of Nova Scotia, contiguous to the river Stewiacke on its southern bank and opposite to the village of Upper Stewiacke, which is situated on the other side of the river. The highway leading easterly to Musquodoboit passes through the village. The Meadowvale Road, at this place going northerly, crosses the river by a bridge below the plaintiffs\u2019 lot and, just beyond the bridge, joins the Musquodoboit highway. A little farther up, to the eastward, the Stewart Hill Road, running in this stretch nearly parallel to the Meadowvale Road, crosses the river by another bridge, and likewise opens into the Musquodoboit highway. The distance between the upper and the lower bridge is about half a mile. The riparian area between the Meadowvale Road and the Stewart Hill Road is taken up by four lots belonging, respectively, to James D. Cox, the plaintiff Hedley T. Fulton, Ross Johnson and Henry Cox, in the order mentioned; James D. Cox abutting upon the Meadowvale Road and Henry Cox upon the Stewart Hill Road; Fulton and Johnson thus come between. All these four lots terminate southerly at a gully, and neither the plaintiffs\u2019 lot nor that of Johnson is reached by any public road, unless the way in issue be a public road.\nThe appellants, introducing the \u201cBrief of Argument\u201d in their factum, very frankly state that \u201cthe sole question for consideration in this action is whether the evidence adduced established the existence of the public highway across the appellants\u2019 lands\u201d; and, it thus becomes, in reality, a question of fact, depending upon the inferences which may be drawn from the testimony and exhibits in proof, to establish a presumption of dedication. There is a considerable body of evidence, substantially uncontradicted, of long, continuous and uninterrupted user by the public of a way from the Meadowvale Road to the Stewart Hill Road through these lots, along the riverside. It is shewn that there is an undisputed road from a point on the Meadowvale Road just to the south of the lower bridge and known as the \u201cOak Island Road,\u201d leading down, along the river, to Oak Island and the settlement at South Branch. This road, in fact, crosses the Meadowvale Road on to the lot of James D. Cox, and the defendant maintains that it is thence prolonged in a direct course, deflected slightly to the north, across the lots of the plaintiffs, Johnson and Henry Cox, where it opens into the Stewart Hill Road; thereby affording immediate access to the public road running along the riverside from the Stewart Hill Road, at the southern end of the upper bridge, easterly, to the grist mill and settlements above.\nIt is not disputed that if the travelled road across these four lots had its origin in dedication,-or otherwise became a public road, it so remains, for it was never closed according to law, and our attention was directed to sec. 47 (1) of The Public Highways Act of Nova Scotia, R.S.N.S., 1923, cap. 75, as follows:\n47. (1) Except in so far as they have been closed according to law, all allowances for highways made by surveyors for the Crown, all highways laid out or established under the authority of any statute, all roads on which public money has been expended for opening them, or on which statute labour has heretofore been performed, all roads passing through Indian lands, all roads dedicated by the owners of the land to public use, every public road now used as such, and all alterations and deviations of, and all bridges on or along any road or highway, shall be common and public highways vested in the Crown until the contrary be shown.\nIt was on 28th October, 1783, that the government of Nova Scotia granted to John Harris, Joseph Brewster and fifty-two others, named as grantees, a tract of land on the river Stewiacke, then called Wilmot River,\ncontaining in the whole, by estimation 20,250 acres more or less, allowance being made for all such roads as may hereafter be deemed necessary to pass through the same, according to the plan annexed, being wilderness land withal, and all manner of mines unopened (excepting mines of gold and silver, lead, copper and coal).\nBy the habendum, the grantees were to have and to hold the premises \u201cin the following proportions\u201d; the number of acres for each grantee being specified, and varying from 750 acres to 250 acres each, respectively. There is no record in evidence of the partition. Apparently, the settlement of the district was consequent upon this grant and took place at that time; there is a book which was admitted in evidence shewing that the proprietors were holding meetings upon the ground as early as October, 1786. This was a settlers\u2019 grant, and the grantees came under obligation gradually to clear and work, erect dwelling houses, etc.\nThe case was tried before Paton J., who thus disposes of the defendant\u2019s case, upon the main question of public highway; the learned judge says[2]:\nThe defendant\u2019s chief contention was that there was once and therefore still is a public highway where the present wheel ruts now are over the Henry Cox lot and the James Cox lot, and that the road necessarily continued over the two intervening lots of Ross Johnson and the plaintiff. There was no evidence to support that contention. Any occasional passage over the land by defendant was not sufficient to create an easement;\nand, accordingly, he granted the plaintiffs an injunction and assessed nominal damages. Upon the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[3], the Chief Justice and Chisholm J., for the reasons stated by the former, would have maintained the judgment; but the other judges, Mellish, Graham and Ross JJ., each of whom stated his reasons, were for the defendant; and, upon the discussion of fact, I have come to the conclusion, after careful consideration of the case, that I cannot usefully add anything to the reasoning which is so clearly set out by Graham J., and the other learned judges who upheld the defendant\u2019s appeal in the court below. The defendant might, of course, have encountered serious difficulty to overcome the trial judgment if it could be held to have proceeded upon the weight or credibility of the evidence; but this, with due respect to the learned judge, is a plain case of misdirection; and, in the result, instead of considering the probabilities of the case and the inferences which it legitimately suggests, he founds his judgment upon a denial of the evidential quality or value of the facts upon which the defendant relies. The learned judge, having stated the defendant\u2019s chief contention, that the road in question is a public highway, finds that there was no evidence to support that contention. Now the defendant had called a number of witnesses, living in the neighbourhood, two of them very old men, who had been familiar with the locality all their lives, and who testified to the uninterrupted use of the road for highway purposes, so long as they could remember; not only this, but they pointed to the existence of cellars along that road, some between the Stewart Hill Road and the Meadowvale Road, and some farther down, as marking the situations upon which settlers had formerly lived. Also, there was evidence introduced of an ancient bridge crossing the river opposite the line between the plaintiff\u2019s property and that of James D. Cox, to the westward. This position coincides very well with that described in the order of the Colchester Court of Sessions, of July, 1800, which the defendant put in evidence, subject to the objection that \u201cit has no reference to the part where the trespasses were committed,\u201d and whereby it was\nOrdered upon the memo of Thomas Pearson, Esquire, and Samuel Kent, that \u00a38 be paid them out of the money now in the licence fund for repairing the Stewiacke Bridge. Ordered upon the presentment of the Grand Jury that the sum of \u00a38 be assessed upon the settlement of Stewiacke for repairing the bridge over the river at William Fulton\u2019s house, and for other necessary repairs of highways where Robert Gamiel, Commissioner, shall find it necessary.\nIt seems perhaps remarkable that, at a time before living memory, the village of Upper Stewiacke should have had two bridges crossing the river within half a mile of each other; but no doubt is suggested of the fact, and there is no explanation of it. Certainly, however, there must have been one bridge before there were two, and, in 1800, when the place was a mere pioneer settlement, if that bridge were, as there is evidence independent of the Colchester minute to signify, located between the points which subsequently became the sites of the two bridges now in use, it suggests the existence of public roads communicating with its approaches on both sides. Moreover, it was shewn that the schoolhouse of the district had been at or about the point of junction between the road in dispute and the Stewart Hill Road, which, as I have shewn, itself unites with the public road leading easterly from the upper bridge along the southern bank of the river. These are material facts which should not have been disregarded, and they cannot, consistently with the justice of the case, be rejected upon the holding that they afford no evidence.\nThere is, among the exhibits before the court, the registry book of the proprietors under the grant. It is bound in parchment, now worn and shattered, and inscribed, \u201cProprietors\u2019 Registry Book, 1786.\u201d Its authenticity as an original record is not denied. Nobody assails the verity of the book; the learned Chief Justice, who dissents and would have excluded the entries, says[4]:\nIt is an ancient looking book, and I have no doubt of its genuineness and that it is what it purports to be, a record of certain meetings of the proprietors under the old grant of 1784;\nevidently meaning the Settlers\u2019 Grant of 28th October, 1783, the only grant in the case. The truth of the entries thus seems out of question, and not the less so because, out of the exigencies of their situation, the proprietors would seem to have proceeded voluntarily, under a de facto organization. In the book the minutes of the proprietors\u2019 meetings are recorded, the first entry being on 10th October, 1786, and relating to a reservation of intervale on the south side of the river for a glebe. The granted lands were held in common and the minutes relate generally to matters of common interest to the proprietors, who, in the years immediately succeeding the grant, were presumably the only persons concerned; they were signed usually by the clerk and \u201cmoderator,\u201d as the chairman of the meetings was called, and refer, among other things, to the appointment of surveyors of roads and the expenditure of public money on the roads and the bridge. The last entry recording minutes of a meeting is of 15th November, 1796. From that time forward the book was used only for the inscription of the earmarks for identification of the proprietors\u2019 cattle and sheep; the first of such entries bearing date 26th June, 1794, and the last 17th September, 1853; and it is interesting to recall in this connection that by chap. 1, sec. 6, of the Nova Scotia Acts of 1765, entitled, \u201cAn Act for the choice of town officers and the regulating of townships,\u201d it was provided that\nWhereas many inconveniences have arisen for want of cattle being branded or otherways marked, that run in common, Be it enacted, That all and every owner of any horse or horses, neat cattle, sheep, or swine, shall brand or otherways mark such horse or horses, neat cattle, sheep or swine, in such manner as that the same may be clearly known, and shall enter such mark or brand with the Town Clerk, in a book to be kept by him for that purpose, and the said Town Clerk shall receive for recording the said mark or brand the sum of six pence.\nThere are some minutes in this book that, subject to doubt suggested as to the identity of the localities to which they relate, afford information as to the public roads of the district; and the matters of record generally are of such a character that the book naturally would be kept in the custody of the clerk for public access and information.\nThe decision in the House of Lords of Bullen v. Michel, with respect to the vicarage of Sturminster Newton[5], is thus in part summarized in the headnote:\nAncient entries made by the monks of an abbey, relating to an endowment by them of a vicarage, (whether perfect or not) are good evidence (quantum valeant) of their subject-matter; although such entries be mixed with extraneous memoranda, and the book be not confined or appropriated to subjects ejusdem generis. And being admitted, they may be read throughout, for the purpose of proving any thing which is material to the issue, provided it is relevant, although it go to affect third persons who were not privy to it, and could have had no cognizance of the matters to which it relates.\u2014Wood, Baron, dissentiente. As to the actual custody from which the book comes, the evidence of James D. Cox, the postmaster, called by the defendant to lay a foundation of admissibility, is that \u201cprobably ten years ago, eight or ten years, perhaps more,\u201d the Town Clerk of Upper Stewiacke handed it to him (the witness), who kept it for a number of years and then sent it to the Dominion archives building at Halifax for safekeeping.\nQ. And you got it back from them the other day?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And handed it to us (the defendant\u2019s counsel) ?\u2014A. Yes.\nThere was no cross-examination, nor was any objection to the admission of the book subsequently raised at the trial; but, on the appeal to the court below, and also in this court, it was objected that the book, as a public document, does not come from proper custody, and does not shew anything admissible by way of reputation. The rules against secondary or hearsay evidence must, of course, be observed; and, if the book be not admissible consistently with the established practice, it should, upon objection properly stated, have been rejected. At the hearing I was not disinclined to the view that the admission of the book would not offend the principles which have been enunciated in the cases; but that is not so clear as I had expected to find, and I do not think it is necessary to solve the question in this case, for, whatever the rule may be as to the strict admissibility of the evidence, assuming the plaintiffs are entitled now to raise it, I am, for my part, like Mellish J., content to rely upon the proof which remains, assuming the rejection of the book; and, whether it be received or rejected, the appeal ought, I think, to be dismissed.\nIt is not without some misgiving that I have reached this conclusion, in view of the dissent; but, with great respect, I think the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia has failed to address his mind to the inference to be drawn from the indubitable fact in evidence of the public and uninterrupted use of the road for the period coextensive with the memory of witnesses. This is a fact which, considered along with the evidence of the ancient cellars and the abandoned bridge, seems amply to justify a finding of dedication; and, in Folkestone Corporation v. Brockman[6], Lord Atkinson, at page 368, affirmed the view expressed by Taylor on Evidence, 9th ed., paragraph 131, saying that the statement contained in the paragraph is perfectly correct and is supported by the six authorities mentioned in the notes. \u201cIt is to this effect, that the uninterrupted user of a road justifies a presumption in favour of the original animus dedicandi even against the Crown.\u201d He adds, that the rule \u201cas to the unrebutted presumption of dedication is a good working rule for all judges of fact to act upon. It is a rule which juries should be instructed to act upon, and which they ought to act upon.\u201d Moreover, I am persuaded that the learned Chief Justice has allowed his mind to be unduly affected by the absence of evidence of compliance with the statutory procedure for the lay out and the establishment of the road. These settlers were evidently proceeding voluntarily, and that is what might naturally have been anticipated.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J., dissenting, was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Newcombe, but regret to find myself not in accord with his conclusions.\nIn my opinion the convincing judgment of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia[7], in which Mr. Justice Chisholm concurs, and which affirms that of the learned trial judge, establishes\n(1) that there is not sufficient evidence of dedication of the alleged highway (the only ground relied on at bar) to prove that fact;\n(2) that the locus of the highway claimed to have been dedicated is left quite uncertain;\n(3) that the acts of user proven are wholly consistent with there having been merely a private right-of-way in existence for the benefit of the lands lying between the Stewart Hill and Meadowvale roads, or with an understanding, tacit or express, of the persons, who, from time to time, for their convenience, made use of the alleged roadway, with the owners of the properties so traversed, which would fall far short of the clear and convincing proof requisite to establish dedication of the land as a highway. The very full analysis of all the testimony made by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia renders it unnecessary to discuss it here in detail. Like him, I deal with the case on the assumption that the book, so much in question below, was properly received in evidence\u2014although I deem its admissibility, to say the least, extremely doubtful, having regard to the facts that it is not, and does not purport to be, an official record, or one required by law to be kept, but, rather, memoranda of transactions of a group of private landowners, and that there is no evidence of anyone having been, at any time, officially designated to keep such a book. But, assuming its admissibility, it falls far short of showing facts sufficient to justify the conclusion of dedication for highway purposes of any particular portion of the lands now owned by the plaintiffs. As the learned Chief Justice says of the entries in the book,\nMost if not all of the entries relied upon are ambiguous to say the least of it. Many of them are clearly not understandable without local knowledge of the conditions existing more than a hundred years ago, and that is not available at this time.\nCircumstances may, of course, warrant an inference of dedication, just as they may prove any other fact; but that inference must be the only one that can reasonably be drawn from them. The defendant, upon whom the burden of proof lay (the plaintiffs\u2019 paper title having been admitted), failed to suggest the person by whom, or the precise time when the alleged dedication was made, or to show what particular land was the subject of it. For aught that appears in the evidence, the way, which was apparently traversed at various times, either may have lain comparatively close to, and have followed generally the contour of, the bank of the stream, or it may have run in a straight line farther south across what is now the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Equally suggestive wagon tracks on both lines now appear on the property, as is evidenced by the surveyor\u2019s plan produced by the plaintiffs, the accuracy of which is duly vouched; and such user as was shown may be accounted for on the assumption of the existence of a private roadway or of an understanding such as suggested above.\nThere is no evidence of there having been any municipal or parish organization whatever. The entries in the old book show no expenditure on the alleged highway of monies raised by public taxation. At the most, they indicate that some community funds belonging to the group of property owners in question were spent in repairs on some road or right-of-way lying south of the river under the supervision of men named by that group. To give to the presence of some stones or rocks in the river bed, said to indicate that a bridge formerly crossed the river at some point about midway between two bridges now existing on the respective lines of the Stewart Hill and Meadowvale side-roads, the significance claimed for them, requires an exercise of imagination which no court should be called upon to make. The same observation may be made in regard to the supposed remains of foundations of houses along the route of the alleged highway. As to the school house, said to have been located to the east of the Stewart Hill road, a private right-of-way would have served all the needs of the school children of any residents on the lots lying south of the river between the Meadowvale and Stewart Hill roads; and, for others, there was always available the main road running on the north side of the river.\nUnder all the circumstances, the absence of any mention of the highway, now claimed to have been dedicated, from the records of the Court of General Sessions in the District of Colchester, commented on so forcibly by Harris C.J., seems to me to be so significant as to be practically conclusive of the non-existence of the alleged highway at any early date; and, if dedication took place, it must have been at some very early date\u2014about 1790 is the time suggested.\nI should, perhaps, add that there is no evidence of any search having been made in the Registry Office, where one would expect to find a record of the alleged highway, if it, in fact, existed. In the absence of any plan being produced from the Registry Office showing such a highway it is fair to assume that there is none there. There is no suggestion of any grant having been made bordering upon such highway, or of the land which the highway would have occupied having been, at any time, excepted out of the grants of the property owned by the plaintiffs, or their predecessors in title\u2014property which, admittedly, extends from a line well to the south of any possible location of the highway in question northerly to the water\u2019s edge. However, it would be idle and foolish to contend, in view of the contrary opinions expressed by three of the learned judges in Nova Scotia, and by my brother New-combe, and more especially of the review of the testimony made by Graham and Ross JJ. in the court below, that there is nothing in the evidence suggestive of there having been a highway. No doubt, there are several circumstances quite consistent with, and, perhaps, even more readily explained by, the assumption that there was such a highway; but they do not, in my opinion, suffice to justify the reversal of the judgment to the contrary of the learned trial judge.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the action was rightly dismissed in the trial court for lack of evidence to prove dedication and I would, accordingly, with the utmost respect for those who have thought otherwise, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Paton.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: S.

APPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Tweedie J.[2], by which the appellant had been given the relief claimed by him.\nThe appellant was the holder of a lease of 240 acres of oil lands and entered into an agreement with the respondents to grant what is called a sub-lease of 80 acres of such lands, for the consideration of $40,000 payable $1,000 on the signing of the agreement which was made on the 4th of March, 1929, $10,000 on the 19th day of March, $10,000 on the 1st of April and $10,000 on the 15th of April and $9,000 on the 1st of May. The appellant did not personally appear; all the negotiations and acts on his behalf having been performed by W. M. Davidson, barrister, his attorney. The down payment of $1,000 was made but no further payment, though the trial judge finds that on the 15th of April the balance in full was offered and that actual tender of the amount was waived; and on the next day this action was begun, asking for rescission of the contract. The statement of claim alleges that \"the sub-lease was to be subject to the covenants, conditions, stipulations and agreements in the said head lease contained\" and that the head lease provided for the commencement of the drilling of a well upon the said premises by the 15th of April, 1929, and that the consideration for the granting of the said lease was \"the agreement on the part of the respondents to carry out the above mentioned terms of the head lease and in addition thereto the sum of forty thousand dollars\" and that the respondents have paid only $1,000 and \"have failed to carry out the terms of the said agreement which required the commencement of drilling upon the said leased premises before the 15th day of April, 1929.\" It further alleges that the agreement was induced by the fraudulent misrepresentations by the respondents that they were possessed of the means of carrying out the said agreement.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the appellants, finding the fraudulent misrepresentation established and holding the contract was induced by them.\nThe Appellate Division held that, on the facts of the case, even accepting the finding of the trial judge as to misrepresentation, it was too late, when the action was begun, for the appellant to rely on that ground and that, not until then, was any attempt made by the appellant to repudiate on that ground.\nOn the appeal to this court, the judgment of the court allowing the appeal with costs, was delivered by Lamont J., who held that there was evidence before the trial judge upon which the latter could find fraudulent misrepresentation and that, he having found it, this court was bound by his finding.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nR.

(1924) c. 95\u2014Mineral Act, R.S.B.C. (1924) c. 167, s. 19.\nAn oral agreement between a free miner and two prospectors whereby the latter were to do, on a certain mining claim, whatever work was necessary to keep up all assessments, record the same, manage and look after the claim, place it under Crown grant, handle, option and sell it, is no mere contract for work and labour, but makes the prospectors agents of the free miner in what they are to do and establishes a fiduciary relationship whereby the prospectors must in equity be held to have become trustees for the miner and they or their representatives must account to him for all sums of money received thereunder.\nUnder such arrangement, an action by the free miner for a share of the proceeds received and a declaration of trusteeship in respect to the moneys paid to the prospectors is not \" asserting an interest in a mineral claim which has been located and recorded by another free miner \" and sect. 19 of the Mineral Act (R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 167) does not apply.\nNor is the action barred by the Statute of Frauds (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 95), the agreement, being one only for the division of the proceeds of the sale of land, does not come within the 4th section of the statute.\nDiscussion of the doctrine of laches. When the action is not barred by any statute of limitations, mere lapse of time is not sufficient to deprive one of his equitable rights. In order to decide whether the remedy should be granted or withheld, the courts must examine the nature of the acts done in the interval, the degree of change which has occurred, how far they have affected the parties, and where lies the balance of justice and injustice.\nUnder an agreement for a division of the proceeds of a sale, the claimant can wait until the sale is completed by the payment of the price before starting his action for an account and for his share of the proceeds.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (42 B.C. Rep. 276) reversed. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison C.J.S.C.[2] which awarded the appellant $100,000 and reducing the amount to $15,789 as against the respondent Laura McEwan and dismissing the action as against the respondent Daniel Lindeborg.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. and E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent Lindeborg.\nR. M. Macdonald for the respondent McEwan.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellant Harris is a retired prospector. On the 25th of July, 1904, being then a free miner according to the Mineral Act of the province of British Columbia, he discovered and located a certain mining claim situated on the Salmon River, in the Stewart mining division of that province. He described it as the \" Jumbo \" and had it recorded under that name on the 8th of August, 1904. He did on the ground and recorded, in compliance with the statute, sufficient assessment work to keep the claim in good standing until the 9th of August, 1909.\nIn his action, the appellant alleged that in or about the month of June, 1908, while at Queen Charlotte Islands, he entered into an oral agreement with one James Proudfoot and one Hiram Stevenson whereby the latter were to do whatever work was necessary to keep up all assessments, record the same, manage and look after the claim, place it under crown grant, handle, option and sell it. For that, they were to receive two-thirds of all the money and profits derived therefrom and the appellant was to get one-third, after deducting all expenses.\nThe appellant further alleged that, pursuant to the agreement, Proudfoot and Stevenson associated with one Andrew Lindeborg and one Dan. Lindeborg on the basis that they were to have each a quarter interest and, to- gether with them, entered into possession of the Jumbo claim. They allowed the same to lapse, relocated and recorded it under the name of Big Missouri and grouped it along with certain other mining claims under the name of the Big Missouri group. Subsequently, they gave several options on this group of claims out of which they received various sums of money amounting to $300,000, but they have paid so far to the appellant only the sum of $364.20. He therefore prayed for an account of all sums of money received by the four associates from the options and from the final sale of the Big Missouri group of claims, and for the payment to him of $100,000, being the one-third share of moneys so received.\nIn addition to pleading laches, the Mineral Act and the Statute of Frauds, the defence raised was that the moneys paid to the appellant were voluntary gratuities and were not made in pursuance of any agreement whatever.\nIn the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the trial judge (Morrison C.J.)[3] , found that the agreement as pleaded was entered into between the appellant and Stevenson and Proudfoot;\nthat the Lindeborgs were brought into the agreement or that they intruded themselves on the footing of the agreement and identified themselves with it and were fully aware all along of such agreement.\nHe gave judgment for the appellant in the terms of the statement of claim. The Court of Appeal[4] set aside this judgment taking the view that the evidence negatived the finding against the Lindeborgs and accordingly dismissed the action against them. As against Proudfoot and Stevenson, for reasons later to be discussed, it was adjudged that the appellant do recover $15,789, less the sum of $521.40 found to have been paid to him on account.\nThe appellant Harris now appeals to this court to have the first judgment restored. There is also a cross-appeal on behalf of Proudfoot and Stevenson asking that the decision of the Court of Appeal be varied in so far as any sum was awarded to the appellant as against these respondents.\nOf the four associates who joined to form the Big Missouri group, three are now dead. Daniel Lindeborg (the only survivor) is now respondent, both personally and as the administrator of the estate of his late brother, Andrew Lindeborg. Laura McEwan, the other respondent, is the administratrix of the estate of Hiram Stevenson. For the purposes of the action, she represents both the latter and the estate of James Proudfoot.\nThe existence of an agreement entered into at Queen Charlotte Islands, in 1908, between Harris, on the one part, and Proudfoot and Stevenson, on the other, can hardly be disputed. It results from the evidence of Harris corroborated by several other miners and prospectors, from admissions by Proudfoot and Stevenson in conversations reported by witnesses heard at the trial and from letters addressed to Harris, written and signed by Proudfoot or Stevenson, each on behalf of the other. Two of these letters may be conveniently reproduced, because they have a particular bearing on the point we are now at, and also\u2014as regards one of them\u2014because it was made the basis of the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal and will have to be referred to later when we come to discuss the decision of that court.\nThe first letter was written by Stevenson, after the Jumbo claim had been re-located in his name and that of Dan. Lindeborg. They had then secured from one Edgecombe their first option on the group formed of the relocated claim and of other claims and they had received the first instalment on the option price :\nStewart, B.C.,\nSept. 27, 1909.\nMr. Harris Dear Friend,\nWe have made a deal on them claims on Salmon River me and Dan Lindeborg staked the Jumbo in ower names and turned it in with the others we called it the Big Mossourie we bonded ten claims between Lenderborg and Jim Proudfoot and we done some work on the mossouri after we staked it but count get much of a assay she pretty low grade ore you no that we don the best we could we give you five thousand dollars if that will be satictory to you and you will get yours per cent as the payments\u2014Comes do we got the first payment of one thousand dollars on the 15th Sep. we bonded for ninty five thousand and payments comes every ninty dayes. i got fifty three dollars for you as near as i can figer it out on the first Payment and if we never get any more you wount i am sending it over with tom McRostie and if he dont see you he will leave it Sandlands when you get it i wish you would send me a receate Well Harris Portland Canal is better this Summer then ever we bonded Claims on fish Crick to the same outfit.\nfrom Yours truly\nHiram Stevenson. The second letter was written by Proudfoot for the purpose of sending to Harris part of the latter's share under the same option :\nStewart, B.C.,\nSept. 12th, 1910.\nMr. W. Harris,\nDear Sir,\nAs requested by you I have thiss day mailled a check to the Canadian Bank of Commerce Prince Rupert for $184 20\/100 to be placed to your credet well frind they have not turned Salmon River down yet and if we get one or two of the big payments I will feel Safe.\nYours very truly\nJ. Proudfoot\nBox 32, Stewart, B.C.\nBoth letters point to the fact that Stevenson and Proudfoot felt themselves under a binding obligation towards Harris. Indeed, certain passages of the first letter are incompatible with the contention of the respondents that the moneys paid to Harris were voluntary gratuities.\nYou no that we don the best we could we give you five thousand dollars if that will be satictory to you and you will get yours per cent as the payments comes do *** I got fifty three dollars for you as near as I can figer it out.\nare not words suggestive of the intention to make a gift.\nThey are consistent only with the existence of a contract.\nWe agree with the trial judge who found that a contract existed. It should be noted that the Court of Appeal did not reverse that finding, and only decided that the letters brought about a modification in the agreement originally made.\nOf course, the appellant is met in limine by the objection that the agreement on which he relies was only verbal, that it was in respect to an interest in land and that it is therefore barred by section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 95) and by section 19 of the Mineral Act (R.S.B.C., c. 167). We will have to examine how far the appellant's case is affected by these sections. But we may start from the point that, subject to the objection, an oral agreement was proved to have existed and the applicability of these sections will depend, at least to a certain extent, upon the nature of that agreement.\nThe nature of the agreement made at Queen Charlotte Islands is therefore the first matter to be considered. In the appellant's testimony, the agreement is stated to have been as follows:\nQ. Now go on and tell me about that\u2014A. Well, I had this Jumbo claim up at the Portland Canal, and I had located some claims on Hughes Inlet at Jedway, and I wanted to prospect them more and see if I couldn't realize on them quicker than I could on the other. And they said they were going over there to the Portland Canal\u2014\u2014\nQ. Going back to the Portland Canal?\u2014A. Going back to the Portland Canal; and I says to them, I have some claims up there; and they said, well, we could do your work; I said, yes. And, boys, I said, I will tell you what I will do, you go up there and take care of those claims, and do the work on them, hold them, and we will just go in three and three on them; and hold them until they are sold; you can hold them anyway, and do the work until they are sold, and just divide up the money three and three. That is why I never undertook to bring suit or anything else, because I wanted to carry out my contract.\nQ. Well, did they agree to that?\u2014A. Yes, sir; that is what they agreed to do. They agreed to go up and keep\u2014do the work on them claims. There was nothing said about re-locating, and nothing else; they were to do the work. I was very anxious about that claim because it was a mine.\nQ. What claim?\u2014A. The Jumbo.\nQ. And any talk about any claims they would add?\u2014A. No, there was no talk about any claims that they had; I don't really think they had any at that time.\nQ. But any they would take afterwards?\u2014A. I told them anyway we wanted to hold them, they could add on to them, and make a group, and have a crown grant of them and take care of them, and when they were sold I was to retain my share, and each of them get a share.\nQ. Each get a share?\u2014A. Each get a share, yes, sir, that was the agreement.\nQ. And were they agreeable to that?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nMr. MACDONALD: Q. At the time of this conversation where you say this agreement was entered into on Queen Charlotte Islands, who were present?\u2014A. Well, I can name a few of them, quite a few.\nQ. There were a lot there, were there?\u2014A. Yes, all the old\u2014timers around, a good many of them. There was myself, Jack Peterson, Joe Davis, Tom Wilson, and Jimmy Lidden, I think, and McKay, quite a bunch of the boys there present.\nQ. And you were just standing in a group on the beach?\u2014A. Yes, talking to them, when we first commenced talking about it we were on the beach, you see, talking about it, and then we adjourned there and went up to this cabin of Jim Matthew's cabin, Shorty's cabin.\nQ. Well, where was the bargain struck?\u2014A. The bargain was wound up in this cabin. We wound it up there; and I called on the boys and said, Boys, you all understand this between us, and you witness this agreement, these men Shorty and Mr. Proudfoot goes over there and take care of them claims and works them, and holds them until they are sold, crown grant them or anything they like, and hold them until they are sold, and when they are sold we divide up the money even. That is why I never bothered the boys, because my contract was when this mine was sold I was to get my money, my third interest.\nQ. And did all these men you have mentioned hear the contract entered into?\u2014A. Yes. Q. And you called on them to witness it?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\n*****\nThey agreed to take charge of my property up there and keep it up and crown grant it if necessary, and hold it until the ground was sold, and then we were to divide even up, the money.\n*****\nMr. MACDONALD: What was said, if anything, about adding other claims to them?\u2014A. That is what they could do, they could add on or\u2014\nQ. I am asking you what was said?\u2014A. Well, that was what was said.\nQ. Who said it?\u2014A. We all said it, we agreed among ourselves, they agreed as well as I did, that they would take them and keep them up, and add on or handle them the same as\u2014until they were sold, and take care of them.\nQ. I want you to answer this question, who said anything about adding additional claims?\u2014A. I said it.\nQ. And what did you say with respect to that?\u2014A. What did I say?\nI say, you boys will take these claims and keep them up, do the assessment work, and keep them in good standing, crown grant them if you like, or any way until they are sold, one year or two years or five years\u2014them days we didn't know\u2014and when they are sold we distribute out the moneys three and three, one for each.\nQ. Now you haven't said a word there about adding other claims, was anything said by anybody about that?\u2014A. I don't know as there was anything said about it.\nQ. You don't know what?\u2014A. I don't know just what was said about adding other claims.\nTHE COURT: Was there anything said?\u2014A. There might have been said, I don't know. I couldn't say.\nThe appellant's version is substantially corroborated by several of the \" old-timers,\" whom Harris mentioned as having been present when the agreement was made in Shorty's (Stevenson's) cabin, at Jedway. As already mentioned, the trial judge not only believed Harris, but he found that the contract existed as stated by him and he acted upon it. On that point, we find ourselves in complete accord with the court of first instance.\nIn our view the contract disclosed establishes a fiduciary relation between Proudfoot and Stevenson on the one hand, and Harris on the other. It is not necessary to decide whether or not a partnership was constituted. It is sufficient that Proudfoot and Stevenson undertook to act as the agents of Harris to perform the necessary assessment work, and to record the same in his name. It was no mere contract for work and labour, because Proudfoot and Stevenson were to represent Harris in what they were to do. Harris was the owner of the claim; they were to do the assessment work for him, and for him and in his name they were to record it. The Court of Appeal appears to have taken the view that the existence of this fiduciary relationship was established. The powers of Proudfoot and Stevenson were very wide, and Harris was satisfied to leave it to them to take all the steps necessary to make it possible for them to dispose of the claim. It is true that full authority to obtain a Crown grant or to make a binding sale might have required a writing, but the parties had, no doubt, full confidence in one another. To repeat Harris's words, however, \" There was nothing said about relocating, and nothing else; they were to do the work,\" and if there was anything clearly expressed in the contract, it was that Proudfoot and Stevenson were to keep the Jumbo claim alive until it was sold. This they did not do. They allowed the claim to lapse, and they re-staked the ground under the name of the Big Missouri. We do not think they intended thereby to deprive Harris of what rightfully belonged to him. On the contrary, their subsequent declarations and their letters rather show that they followed the course they did as a matter of policy and as the means best adapted to bring about satisfactory results. Under any view, however, they must in equity be held to have become trustees for the appellant and they or their representatives must account to him for all sums of money they received through the options and the sale of the claim contributed by him under the original agreement,\u2014unless the defences under the Mineral Act and the Statute of Frauds should prevail.\nSection 19 of the Mineral Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 167) reads as follows:\nNo free miner shall be entitled to any interest in any mineral claim which has been located and recorded by any other free miner, unless such interest is specified and set forth in some writing signed by the party so locating such claim.\nOn behalf of the respondents, it is submitted that that section was expressly intended to put a stop to the practice of free miners asserting interests in each others' properties founded upon alleged verbal contracts. In the present case, however, we do not think the section has any application. Harris is not asserting an\ninterest in a mineral claim which has been located and recorded by another free miner.\nHe had a claim; he held the Jumbo claim and he says he went into an arrangement with Proudfoot and Stevenson to develop that claim. The agreement he invokes is not one concerning an interest in the claim itself, it relates to an interest in the proceeds of the sale. Harris now asks for his share of the price received and a declaration of trusteeship in respect to the moneys paid therefor. In that view of the case, the courts below rightly decided that the Mineral Act did not stand in the way of the appellant.\nNor do we think his action is barred by the Statute of Frauds (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 95). There is authority in this court to the effect that a partnership may be formed by a parol agreement notwithstanding it is to deal in land, and that the Statute of Frauds does not apply to such a case. (Archibald v. McNerhanie[5] , a British Columbia case).\nWhether, however, there was or was not a partnership, Proudfoot and Stevenson, having, by making use of the opportunity afforded them by their fiduciary position, got into their own names a half-interest in the mineral lands covered by the Jumbo, and in other mineral lands as well, could not escape the obligations of the original contract, by which the proceeds of the sale of the Jumbo were to be divided among the three interested persons equally. They were in a position in which, on these interests being converted into money, they were accountable, by virtue of their fiduciary relation, for one-third of those proceeds. An agreement for the division of the proceeds of the sale of land is not an agreement within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds. Stuart v. Mott[6] .\nIt is not even necessary to go that length in the present instance, for, in our opinion, the documentary evidence and particularly the letters are sufficient to satisfy the statute, which, under the circumstances, affords the respondents no protection.\nYet another defence is raised against the appellant's action. This defence is based upon the doctrine of laches, and it cannot be denied that the case presented on that ground by the respondents is worthy of serious consideration.\nWhere a person is obliged to apply for the peculiar relief afforded by equity to declare a trust or to enforce a contract, the principle is that he must come promptly. Now the respondents point to the following facts : The location by Harris of the Jumbo claim having lapsed, the ground was re-staked jointly by Stevenson and Dan. Lindeborg and was called \" Big Missouri.\" Shortly afterwards, Proudfoot, Stevenson, Dan. Lindeborg and Andrew Lindeborg grouped all their contiguous claims, ten in number, and gave the option to Edgecombe to which reference has already been made. It was then that Stevenson wrote to Harris the letter of the 27th of September, 1909 (above recited) and offered him $5,000 for his share, at the same time sending him the sum of $53 as the first payment. Harris immediately wrote and told Stevenson he was not satisfied and that he and Proudfoot had not done what they agreed to do.\nThey agreed to do the work instead of relocating it, and I am not satisfied.\nIt does not appear that this letter of protest was received by Stevenson, who wrote again on the 31st January, 1910:\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Jan. 31, 1910.\nMr. William Harris Dear frend I got a letter from you about a month ago I rote you in September from hear and I gess it must have gon a strae you no the claim you had on Salmon river me and Dan Lenderborg staked it and we Bonded all of ower Claims on Salmon River as near as I can figer it out you will get about five thousand Dollars out of it and as we get the Payments we Put your Share in the Canadian Bank of Comers hear.\nfrom Yours H Stevenson.\nThen, on April 7, 1910, a further sum of $100 was sent to Harris in a letter written by Andrew Lindeborg. On July 25, 1910, a cheque signed by James Proudfoot to the order of Harris and for the sum of $184.20 was deposited for the appellant in the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Prince Rupert Branch. On September 12, Proudfoot wrote the letter already reproduced and containing another cheque of $184.20 to Harris' order, always on account of his share of the Edgecombe option. Another letter dated October 3, 1910, emanating from the Manager of the bank at Prince Rupert, advised Harris that yet another sum of $80 was being sent to him under separate cover. The Court of Appeal found that Harris had received these various sums, and this was not disputed at bar.\nIn the meantime, around September, 1910, Harris went to Stewart, at the head of the Portland canal. There he met all four associates. His evidence is that he then re- newed his protest, told them that he was \" not satisfied the way they \" did with the mine, and (he) still retained his interest in that group of claims.\" The evidence goes on :\nQ. What did they say?\u2014A. They said, certainly you will get your interest in them claims the same as if we did the work, you will get it just the same by us re-locating it as you would if we done the work. Put it that way.\nQ. What interest: did you tell them?\u2014A. I told them I still retained my one\u2014third interest, according to my first contract, my first contract with them.\nQ. With Stevenson and Proudfoot?\u2014A. Yes; I never recognized Lindeborg, never seen him in the contract.\nQ. But they came in and said you could have the one\u2014third interest?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And that was all agreed to?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you were all there?\u2014A. Yes.\nWe have quoted the above verbatim on account of its bearing upon other points of the case, to which we will turn our attention later.\nThe next development was that Harris wrote to Dan. Lindeborg on the 7th of May, 1911. The letter was not found but was acknowledged by Lindeborg on the 15th of June, 1911. Harris swears to the contents of his letter and says he was inquiring about the options,\nhow they were getting along with them, and trying to keep in touch with (his) interest.\nThis is consistent with the terms of the reply by Lindeborg.\nNothing is shown to have passed between the parties from June, 1911, until April 30, 1919.\nDuring that period, no less than six options were executed concerning the Big Missouri group, although comparatively little money was paid on them, and they were all allowed to lapse. Harris was not advised of any one of them. Apparently he was kept in absolute ignorance of what was going on and he does not pretend having made any attempt to find out.\nProudfoot had died about Christmas, 1910, and Stevenson had been killed in action, in France, some time in 1917.\nIt was not until April 30, 1919, that Arthur J. Harris, the son of the appellant, broke this long silence by writing to Dan. Lindeborg. His letter begins in this way : It has been such a long time since we have been in communication with you boys that you are doubtless thinking that we have passed out. We have been talking quite often about the Big Missouri and other properties on Salmon River and have kept in touch with developments there. We are sure delighted to hear of the bright prospects for the Salmon River district.\nHe goes on rather lengthily to give a lot of family news, he inquires about the death of Stevenson (whom he calls Stevens) and says :\nYou are of course aware of the agreement that father and Mr. Stevens had in regards the Big Missouri, and father desires to know if that matter was fixed up before Mr. Stevens left.\nHe winds up by asking Lindeborg to write and let them know \" how everything is going.\" Lindeborg answered he had \" not heard if (Stevenson) made any provision for any agreement with (Harris)\" but he was forwarding the letter to Stevenson's sister. Almost a year elapsed before Harris' son wrote again to Dan. Lindeborg and got the reply (May 15, 1920) that the administrator of Proudfoot's estate \"had not been able to find anything among Jim's papers regarding any agreement of the sort mentioned.\"\nLindeborg added :\nso far we have not got anything near out of the property what it has cost us to hang on to it this many years.\nHarris was now living in Tacoma, State of Washington, U.S. At his request, on February 12, 1921, his son wrote again to Lindeborg complaining that the letters so far received from the latter were \" evasive and did not contain the information (they) wished.\" He asked for the address of the heirs of Stevenson and said that if they could not find out how they stood with respect to the agreement, Harris would\neither come up there himself or send a suitable representative to represent his interest, and would place the necessary papers in the hands of proper authorities for collection.\nThis brought the following reply :\nJune 22, 1921.\nMr. Arthur J. Harris,\n627 N. State Street,\nTacoma, Washington.\nDear Sir,\nYour letter of February 12th last was received by me on my return home and in answer will say that if you think my former letters have been evasive will try to make this plain as possible.\nFirst, you state you have not received the information desired, as near as I can remember you have never stated the nature of information wanted. Further you refer to an agreement between your father and myself. Of this I can inform you that there never has been any agreement, verbal or in writing, between your father and myself. If he has any agreement with other parties I have no knowledge of same.\nThe address of Administrator of the Proudfoot Estate is D. C. Barbrick, 6039 Sherbrooke St., Vancouver, B.C. For Stevenson Estate, address Mrs. Laura McEwan, Koch Siding, B.C.\nTrusting you will find this plain enough, I remain,\nYours truly,\nDan Lindeborg.\nThe correspondence then shifted from Lindeborg to Barbrick and Mrs. McEwan. Letters were exchanged between them and Harris' son, Harris seeking to find out if Proudfoot or Stevenson \"had made any provision for the agreement,\" (being told that there was none), insisting that he could \" make proof \" of his rights and asking that they should be recognized. The last letters were addressed to the administrators by A. J. Harris on April 4, 1922, and remain unanswered.\nThe present writ was issued only on July 18, 1928.\nThe respondents contend that Stevenson's letter of September 27, 1909, was a repudiation of the agreement, that the administrators challenged the appellant's claim as far back as 1922. They point to the long delay that ensued and to the change of circumstances: the introduction of the Lindeborgs as co-owners invoking a change of parties, the deaths of Proudfoot and Stevenson eliminating all possible evidence on their behalf, and the fact that the \" new parties were allowed to go on and spend money on the property and go to all the trouble, expense and risk for years.\" And they submit that it is impossible, under the circumstances, to avoid the effect of laches.\nIn Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[7] , it is said :\nThe doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where, by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, if founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any Statute of Limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\nLord Blackburn, in Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[8] , quotes the above passage and then adds the following comment:\nI have looked in vain for any authority which gives a more distinct and definite rule than this; and I think, from the nature of the inquiry, it must always be a question of more or less, depending on the degree of diligence which might reasonably be required, and the degree of change which has occurred, whether the balance of justice or injustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it. The determination of such a question must largely depend on the turn of mind of those who have to decide, and must therefore be subject to uncertainty; but that, I think, is inherent in the nature of the inquiry.\nThis suit, as we have seen, was not instituted until the 18th of July, 1928, more than six years after the date of the last letter sent on behalf of Harris and to which he got no reply; but the action is not barred by any statute of limitations, and mere lapse of time is not sufficient to deprive the appellant of his equitable rights against the respondents. In order to decide whether the remedy should be granted or withheld, we must examine the nature of the acts done in the interval, the degree of change which has occurred, how far they have affected the parties and where lies the balance of justice and injustice.\nWe may now apply this test to the several grounds just enumerated and put forward by the respondents as to why the defence of laches should be given effect to in the present case.\n1. We have already stated our reasons for construing the letter written by Stevenson on September 27, 1909, not as a repudiation, but, on the contrary, as an acknowledgment of the existence of an agreement between himself, Proudfoot and the appellant. True, it does not contain the whole tenor of the agreement, but if Harris is telling the truth about what took place upon receipt of that letter, he protested against anything in it not in conformity with the original agreement, he told the respondents he \" still retained (his) one-third interest according to (his) first contract\" and, he says, it was all agreed to at the interview at Stewart, in 1910. This evidence was accepted by the trial judge, and we see no reason why it should be disbelieved.\n2. The letters written by the administrators in 1921 and 1922 are not and could not be a denial of the agreement. The administrators did not know. Their letters are no more than answers to the demand for information coming from Harris, and advising him that, amongst the documents of the respective estates of Proudfoot and Stevenson, nothing was found to indicate the existence of an agreement concerning the Big Missouri.\n3. If the Lindeborgs ever became co-owners of the Jumbo or Big Missouri claim, it was in the month of August, 1909, before Harris went to Stewart and before he had with Proudfoot and Stevenson the understanding there arrived at whereby they agreed that, notwithstanding any re-staking, he still retained his one-third interest \" according to his first contract.\" At that time, if ever, the Lindeborgs had already been introduced as new parties.\nConsequently, we fail to see how, because of the appellant's delay in coming to court, the respondents can be prejudicially affected through a change which had occurred before the contract was re-affirmed at Stewart and before the period in respect of which laches is now charged.\n4. The fact that Stevenson and Proudfoot are both dead no doubt compels the court to sift thoroughly and with great care the evidence rendered on behalf of the appellant; but, in addition to the fact that the latter was amply corroborated, it is not disputed that the learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, and who believed the evidence for the plaintiff, was fully aware of the extent of his duty in the premises, and that he decided to act upon such evidence only because the truthfulness of the witnesses was made to him perfectly clear and apparent (In re Garnett[9] .\n5. As for the trouble and expense to which the respondents allege they went \" for years \" and the risk they incurred, suffice it to say that largely, if not entirely, through the Jumbo claim, which the appellant contributed to the common adventure, and which was, as the evidence shows, the \" big value \" in that group of claims, the respondents made profits admitted to have reached $300,000. It thus becomes an easy matter to decide whether the balance of justice or injustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it.\nWe have now examined, in the order they were presented by the respondents, each of the reasons they urge in support of their plea of laches and we have found that none of them calls for the application of the doctrine. On the part of Harris, there never was conduct from which an intention to abandon his interests can be gathered, and all the evidence shows, on the contrary, \" a settled determination to hold to his rights\" (Clarke v. Hart[10] ). Those rights, under the agreement, entitled him to divide the money only after the claim was sold. \" That is why I never bothered the boys,\" says Harris in his evidence, \" because my contract was when this mine was sold I was to get my money, my third interest.\" The Big Missouri group was sold to the Standard Mining Corporation for $275,000, the first payments under the option were made shortly before this action was commenced and, in fact, the last instalment of $100,000 was garnisheed and is now paid into court. The appellant could wait, if he so wished, until the sale was completed by the payment of the price before starting his action for an account and for his share of the profits.\nWe therefore agree with both courts that the defence based on laches, on the Statute of Frauds and on the Mineral Act, raised by all the respondents must fail. As a result, the conclusion already reached against Proudfoot and Stevenson must stand, and their representatives must account to the appellant.\nIn the case of the Lindeborgs, however, the story is different. They were not parties to the original agreement. There is no evidence that, at the time of relocating the Jumbo claim, the agreement was disclosed to them or that they knew of it. Fraud on their part is neither alleged, nor proven. Even if they became subsequently aware of the agreement existing between Harris, Proudfoot and Stevenson, that would not make the Lindeborgs partners. They could not become partners without the consent of all the other parties.\nConsent on the part of Harris could result perhaps from his acceptance of the proposition contained in the letter of the 29th of September, 1909, provided it was shown that Stevenson, when making the proposition, was acting for the four associates; but there is no evidence that the Lindeborgs ever bound themselves towards Harris or linked themselves with any bargain towards him. As for Harris, he does not pretend but denies having accepted Stevenson's offer. His conduct and testimony preclude the introduction of the Lindeborgs in any agreement. He stated most positively he \" never recognized Lindeborg, never seen him in the contract.\" His action, far from invoking the letter of the 29th of September, is the very negation of the existence of a modified bargain into which the Lindeborgs could be brought. Whatever part the Lindeborgs took in the whole matter is perfectly consistent with their understanding that Stevenson and Proudfoot were entitled to act as they did. Assuming that, at any time before September, 1910, they were put upon inquiry as to whether Harris had an interest and as to the nature and the extent of that interest, this was made clear as a result of the interview held at Stewart at that date, and where Harris, being fully conversant with all that Stevenson and Proudfoot had done, knowing that they had joined hands with the Lindeborgs, declared (to use his own words) :\nIt don't make any difference if you located it, if you can handle it better in your name it is alright,\nas long as he kept his interest with Stevenson and Proudfoot. This meant, if anything, that he was to look to Proudfoot and Stevenson alone for whatever share he was to get out of the sale of the Jumbo claim; it was a recognition on his part that the Lindeborg interests remained unaffected. Harris himself puts that interpretation upon the interview when he says: \"I never recognized Lindeborg, never seen him in the contract.\"\nFraud having been eliminated and there being with the Lindeborgs neither partnership, nor agency, they could not be declared trustees and, as far as they are concerned, the action against them was rightly dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nIt remains to establish the amount Harris is entitled to recover against Proudfoot and Stevenson. Strictly speaking, the action could have been disposed of merely by ordering an account; but, owing to a lack of definite records, the profits on the sale of the group of claims have been accepted by both sides as being $300,000.\nThe trial judge gave judgment in favour of Harris for one-third of that sum. The majority of the Court of Appeal thought the appellant should receive only five ninety-fifths of the $300,000, less the amounts already paid to him. This computation was made on the strength of the letter of the 29th of September, 1909, wherein Stevenson offered Harris $5,000 as his share of the $95,000. This, however, could serve as a basis of computation only if the proposition contained in the letter had been accepted by Harris and a new contract was thereby formed. We have already indicated that, in our view, that was not the case. Express acceptance by Harris was not established. Acceptance, whether express or by conduct, was neither invoked nor relied on by Proudfoot or Stevenson, who took the stand all through the case that no agreement of any kind was ever made. True, the appellant received and kept some moneys. The first sum of $53 enclosed in Stevenson's letter was approximately five ninety-fifths or one-nineteenth of the first Edgecombe payment. But if Harris told the truth about what followed\u2014and his evidence was believed by the trial judge\u2014his acceptance of that sum was of no consequence. The subsequent remittances made to him rather lend colour to his contention, for they show that the alleged one nineteenth proportion was not adhered to. None of the individual payments made to Harris after the first payment of $53 amounts to one-nineteenth, neither does the total received by him correspond with that proportion of the moneys which the respondents got under the options. We must therefore look for another basis and we think it should be found in the following way:\nThe Big Missouri group was formed of ten claims. Of these, the claim formerly known as the Jumbo was the only one covered by the agreement. On Harris' evidence, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the contract did not cover the adding of other claims. Proudfoot and Stevenson were to hold the Jumbo claim until it was sold. They were not to re-locate it, nor to admit others as partners in the working out of the contract. Harris was right in telling them, at Stewart in September, 1910: \"You boys haven't lived up to your agreement.\" Yet, being informed of what they had done, he added:\nI says, it don't make any difference if you located it, if you can handle it better in your name it is alright, as long as you keep my interest. And they agreed to it.\nWe have already referred to other parts of his evidence to the same effect. Harris\nstill retained (his) one-third interest, according to (his) first contract *** with them.\nNow the interest in question was an interest in the Jumbo claim (re-named the Big Missouri) and the one-third of the proceeds of that interest meant one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the Jumbo or Big Missouri claim. The respective values of that claim and of the other claims added to it for the purpose of forming the Big Missouri group are not in evidence, although it is abundantly clear that the Jumbo was the dominant claim and the trial judge so found. The amount of Harris' share is not to be calculated according to the principle which governs when a man intermingles his property with that of another without the approbation or knowledge of the latter. Here, Harris, after having acquired knowledge of the situation, approved of it and was willing to accept what his original contract would give him in full satisfaction of his interests. He approved of the method adopted by Proudfoot and Stevenson to bring about the sale of his claim and, as a consequence, in our view, his share is limited to one-third of the amount which, through the means so adopted and so approved, the latter got out of that sale, including the moneys paid on previous options.\nAs between the four associates: Proudfoot, Stevenson, Andrew and Dan. Lindeborg, we know that they were to divide in four equal shares. On that basis, out of the $300,000, the amount coming to Proudfoot and Stevenson was $150,000. It can hardly be contended by them that this sum of $150,000 does not stand wholly and exclusively for the value of the Big Missouri or Jumbo claim. The only other claim which they are known to have contributed to the group was a claim called \" Winner,\" staked and recorded by Proudfoot in August, 1909. This claim does not appear to have had any bearing on the price paid for the group.\nThe sale of the Jumbo claim having brought $150,000, Harris, Proudfoot and Stevenson must now, according to their agreement, \" divide up the money three and three.\" Proudfoot and Stevenson have received the money and they or their representatives must account to Harris who is entitled to recover from them $50,000 for his share. This was the conclusion of Galliher J.A., with whom we agree.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed to the extent indicated, with costs to the appellant before this court against the respondents Proudfoot and Stevenson. The cross-appeal of the latter is dismissed with costs and the appeal of Harris, so far as Andrew and Dan. Lindeborg are concerned, is also dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Burns, Walker & Thomson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. M.

A., a passenger steamer, left Vancouver, bound for Victoria in a dense fog. After passing the first narrows, she was running at a rate of twelve knots, on a course of S.W. \u215b S., which course she kept till the collision was imminent. She stopped her engines about a minute before the collision, upon hearing a signal from a tug to port, and one from a ship to starboard, the H., and which she first saw emerging from the fog at a distance of about 300 feet, and between two and three points on her starboard. The P. A. then attempted to clear the H. by putting her helm hard astar board with full speed ahead, but without success, the stem of the H. cutting into the P. A. on her starboard side, a little ahead of amidships; she was swinging with a speed of about eleven knots. The H., inward bound, passed Point Atkinson at 10.05 a.m. on a course of E. by N. and at a speed of four knots, but seeing the density of the fog decided not to enter the narrows, but to proceed cautiously, by \u201cslow ahead\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d alternatively, to a southerly part of English Bay, and altered her course at 10.25 to E.N.E. Later, at 10.50, hearing signals of other vessels, she changed her course E.S.E. giving proper signals. From 10 o\u2019clock to 11.12 she was proceeding by \u201cslow ahead\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d at close intervals. At 11-12 the H. heard the signal from the P. A. about 5 or 6 points on her port bow. She stopped her engine, blew the whistle, to which the P. A. replied. There followed another exchange of whistles, and while the P. A. was whistling for the third time, she emerged from the fog, heading for the H. The H. then reversed her engine full speed and put her helm hard aport, but too late to avert collision., When they first saw each other the P. A. was running at ten knots, and the H. at one and a half knots. The collision occurred about half a minute after the two steamships first saw each other.\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court ([1930] Ex. C.R. 10)) that, on the facts, the navigation of the H. was free from, blame. In the circumstances of the case, neither by the cases referred to nor by the practice of seamanship was the H. required to reverse before the P. A. became visible, as she could have come to a standstill within 30 feet. Upon the assumption that the P. A. was proceeding at moderate speed and obeying the injunctions of the pertinent collision regulations, the H., while the vessels were out of sight of each other in the fog, had no occasion to reverse the mere steerageway which she carried, while, on the other hand, it was a matter of prudence and good practice that the ship should not be put out of command, the advantages of maintaining steerageway having frequently been recognized by the courts. The cause, which brought about the collision, was the excessive and reckless speed of the P. A. in proceeding in the dense, fog which prevailed, and in a harbour where ships were so likely to be met, at the immoderate rate of twelve knots, when the visibility was only about 300 feet, and persisting in the maintenance of that speed, when she was aware that a steamship was approaching on her starboard bow, so as to involve risk of collision.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing with costs an appeal of Fred Olsen & Company, owners of the SS. Hampholm (Respondent), and dismissing with costs a cross-appeal of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Appellant), owners of the SS. Princess Adelaide, from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Martin, Local Judge in Admiralty for the British Columbia Admiralty District, in cross-actions brought and tried together on the same evidence, for damage sustained by the respective vessels of the parties as a result of a collision between the said vessels in English Bay, adjacent to the harbour of Vancouver, on the 19th of December, 1928. The Local Judge in Admiralty found both vessels to blame, the Princess Adelaide for excessive speed, and the Hampholm because she should have reversed sooner; and he apportioned the damages to be borne two-thirds by the owners of the Princess Adelaide and one-third by the owners of the Hampholm. The owners of the Hampholm appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada contending that the Princess Adelaide should have been held solely to blame. The owners of the Princess Adelaide cross-appealed, contending that it should have been found that the Hampholm did not stop her engines on first hearing the Princess Adelaide, and that a case for apportionment of damages according to degree of fault had not been made out, and that the damages should have been directed to be borne equally. The President of the Exchequer Court allowed the appeal of the owners of the Hampholm and dismissed the cross-appeal of the owners of the Princess Adelaide with costs.\nJ. E. McMullen for the appellants.\nW. M. Griffin K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014These two steamships collided in English Bay, the outer harbour of Vancouver, on the forenoon of 19th December, 1928, at about 11,14\u00bd o\u2019clock by the Hampholm\u2019s time, or 11.16 by the Princess Adelaide\u2019s time, which appears to have been somewhat faster. There were cross actions to recover damages, and these were, by consent, consolidated and tried together at Vancouver, before the learned local judge of the Exchequer Court for the British Columbia Admiralty District, who found fault on both sides, and apportioned the liability according to his finding of the degree of fault, as provided by the Maritime Conventions Act, R.S.C., 1914, 1927, c. 126, viz:\u2014 two-thirds on the part of the Princess Adelaide, and one-third on the part of the Hampholm, saying:\n* * * there is a great distinction between the conduct of the two vessels, the former (the Princess Adelaide) deliberately violated the Regula- tions in a gross degree, and the latter (the Hampholm) erred in her manner of endeavouring to carry them out.\nThere was an appeal to the President of the Exchequer Court, and he, finding the Princess Adelaide alone to blame, exonerated the Hampholm, and remitted the case for the assessment and recovery of the damages sustained by the Hampholm.\nThe case now comes before this court upon appeal from the latter judgment. It was argued at unusual length, although it transpires that the material facts are not disputed in any important particular, and the controversy may, I think, be disposed of with full justice to the parties on the assumption that they are as found by the learned local judge.\nOn the morning in question, the Hampholm, a Norwegian steamship of 4,480 tons gross, 395 feet long, 52 feet beam and 10 knots speed, inward bound from the Orient to Vancouver, entered English Bay at 10.05 o\u2019clock, passing Point Atkinson, which marks the entrance to the northward, about half a mile on her port hand. She evidently found it too thick to attempt the Narrows, and so proceeded cautiously, with the intention of anchoring at the usual anchorage in the southern part of the Bay. In doing this, she necessarily had to cross in a southeasterly direction the course of any outgoing vessel from the inner harbour which might attempt to navigate through the fog, which is described as \u201cdense\u201d\nThe Princess Adelaide is a single-screw steamship of Canadian registry, 3,060 tons gross, 290 feet long, 40 feet beam, and 16 knots speed. She plies daily between Vancouver and Victoria, carrying passengers for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. She left her berth at Vancouver in the fog at 10.43 a.m., passed through the Narrows, and, emerging into the Bay at Prospect Point at 11.01 o\u2019clock by her time, developed a speed of 12 knots, which she maintained upon her usual outward course, with little diminution, if any, until the moment of the collision.\nThe learned local judge, in his findings, states the matter thus:\nAt the time of collision the weather was calm, but with a dense fog and the tide at the last of the flood. According to the admission of the Princess Adelaide\u2019s master, she was running through the fog, after she left the Narrows, at a speed of twelve knots on a course which her master says was S.W. 3\/4 S, as he marked it on the Admiralty Chart, and he also says, and there is no sound reason to doubt that statement, that he did not change that course till the collision became imminent. He had stopped his engine about half a minute before the collision upon hearing the fog whistles from a tug to port, and then, again, from a ship to starboard that turned out to be the Hampholm, which he first saw emerging, from the fog at a distance of about 300 feet between 2 and 3 points on? his starboard bow, and tried to clear her by putting his helm hard astarboard with full speed ahead, but it was too late to avoid the collision, the stem of the Hampholm cutting into the Adelaide on her starboard side, a little forward amidships, as shown by the position of the models on exhibit 4, which is admitted by both parties to be substantially correct. At the moment of impact the Adelaide was still swinging, with a speed of about 11 knots, at least, to avoid the Hampholm, which still had I am satisfied, upon the conflicting evidence on the point, a slight amount of way on her when she sighted the Adelaide, but not exceeding 1\u00bd knots; her preliminary acts admits she had \u201csteerage way only.\u201d * * *\nThe Hampholm, inward bound to the Narrows, at 10.05 had passed and seen Point Atkinson, half a mile off, on a course E. by N., at a speed of about 4 knots, but shortly afterwards, in view of the density of the fog, had decided not to attempt to enter the Narrows, but to proceed cautiously, by \u201cslow ahead\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d alternately, to the usual anchorage in the southerly part of English Bay, which was in general the proper action to take in the circumstances, and to do so she altered her course at 10.25 to E.N.E. and continued on it at a decreasing alternate speed down to about 3 and 2 knots, and finally, owing to the signals of other vessels, again changed her course, at 10.50, to E.S.E., giving the proper signals and taking soundings.\nWhile on that course and at least as early as 11.12, she heard the signal of another vessel (which turned out to be the Adelaide) about 5-6 points on the port bow, upon which she stopped her engines and blew her whistle, to which the Adelaide replied, and after another exchange of whistles and when the Adelaide was whistling for the third time (if not the fourth, as the Hampholm\u2019s master gives it) she almost immediately emerged from the fog, at a distance of about 3-500 feet, and apparently heading almost directly for the Hampholm, or at least across her bow, upon which the Hampholm reversed her engines full speed and put her helm hard aport, but too late to avert the impact, as already noted. The master of the Hampholm says he was struck by the Adelaide less than \u201chalf a minute\u201d after sighting her.\nIt is, I think, worth mentioning an additional fact, about which there is no dispute, which is thus stated by Capt. Hunter, master of the Adelaide, speaking of the last signal which he had from the Hampholm:\nA. She just came in view then; I put the helm hard astarboard and put the engine full ahead.\nQ. Yes. What was the effect on your ship of putting the helm hard astarboard?\u2014A. Well, we swung to port about three-quarters of a point, and then I seen the Hampholm coming along and I thought that we might clear him by putting the helm hard aport and swinging the other way\u2014swinging around him, but he was coming too fast and we were too close together then.\nQ. Did the port helm order have any effect on the ship?\u2014A. Yes, it stopped the swinging.\nQ. Stopped the swing to port?\u2014A. Yes. Q. What course did the Hampholm appear to be on when you saw her?\u2014A. Oh, well, approximately she would be about\u2014I would say about south-east by south or thereabouts.\nQ. And what distance away did she seem to you?\u2014A. About 300 feet.\nQ. About 300 feet from your ship?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nLater on he says he went hard aport with a view to avoiding a collision, although it is difficult, upon his evidence, to understand the conjunction of these manoeuvres. He admits, however, that in the event the hard aport movement had no more effect than to stop the previous swing to port; but, if the captain thought that the hope of avoiding a collision could be realized only in this manner, it would seem to have been quite out of the reach of anticipation that he would allow so little time and space for the purpose:\u2014about half a minute, or less as found at the trial, and about 300 feet, according to his own testimony.\nNow the Adelaide contends, and the local judge agrees, that in the special circumstances of the case the Hampholm should have reversed her engines when she heard the second whistle from the Adelaide, or, at latest, upon hearing the third whistle, and that therefore, the Hampholm did not navigate with the requisite caution, and is consequently responsible for a degree of fault. Article 16 of the Collision Regulations admittedly applied. It provides that\nEvery vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nThis article is, of course, to be interpreted in connection with articles 27 and 29, which insist upon due regard to all dangers of navigation and collision, the practice of seamen and any special circumstances which may render a departure from the rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger; moreover, articles 19, 21, 22 and 23 have their application especially to the navigation of the Adelaide, and she certainly broke every one of these rules. It is said that, by reason of the fog and consequent difficulty of locating the respective positions, the starboard side rule could not operate until the vessels came within sight of each other, and so it may be; but, after that, it would seem that the rule could not with safety have been disregarded, unless overborne by special dangers or circumstances, and that, in any case, the previous navigation of the Adelaide should have been conducted in a manner which would have allowed of the possibility of avoiding the collision by the application of the rules laid down for common guidance.\nThere is abundant evidence to establish the cautious character of the Hampholm\u2019s navigation from the time she passed Point Atkinson. Her witnesses and records have been produced; and, from 10.56 o\u2019clock, when she was dead in the water, until 11.14\u00bd o\u2019clock, when the collision occurred, it is shewn by her testimony and bell-book that her engine movements were as follows:\n3 minutes stopped from 10.56 a.m. to 10.59 a.m.\n1 minute slow ahead from 10.59 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n1 minute stopped from 11 a.m. to 11.01 a.m.\n4 minutes slow ahead from 11.01 to 11.05 a.m.\n5 minutes stopped from 11.05 a.m. to 11.10 a.m.\n2 minutes slow ahead from 11.10 a.m. to 11.12 a.m.\n2 minutes stopped from 11.12 a.m. to 11.14 a.m.\n\u00bd minute full astern from 11.14 to 11.14\u00bd (collision).\nIt was at 11.12 a.m. that the Hampholm heard, two or three points forward of her beam, on her port side, the whistle of a vessel which was the Adelaide, and her engines were thereupon immediately stopped and remained so until, when two minutes later the Adelaide came into view, put full astern under a hard aport helm.\nMany cases h\u00e2ve been cited; but, neither by any of these, nor by the practice of good seamanship, does it appear that the Hampholm, in the circumstances of this case, was required to reverse before the Adelaide became visible; and, in my view, the navigation of the Hampholm is free from blame. Upon the conceded facts, she could have come to a standstill within 30 feet, but I think her master did well to keep his ship in hand. It must be remembered, as said in Marsden on Collision, 8th edition, p. 8:\nThe rules are not made merely for the sake of the vessel which has to observe them, but for the sake of other vessels which may be approaching, or may be manoeuvring at close quarters, and who have every right and reason to suppose the rules will be observed, and none to suppose they will be broken.\nAnd the same learned author says, at p. 403:\nIt would seem, therefore, that under the present law the duty to reverse does not arise (except, possibly, in the case of a steamship hearing the foghorn of a sailing ship close to her and forward) until the ships are in sight of each other, or until the course of the ship, whose duty it is to keep her course, is clearly indicated to the other by the different directions in which her whistle is heard.\nUpon the assumption that the Adelaide was proceeding at moderate speed and obeying the injunctions of the articles to which I have referred, the Hampholm, while the vessels were out of sight of each other in the fog, had no occasion to reverse the mere steerageway which she carried, while, on the other hand, it was a matter of prudence and good practice that the ship should not be put out of command. The advantage of maintaining steerageway is frequently recognized in the cases, and the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Umbria[2], says:\nIt is probably also true that, considering the great speed of the Umbria, it were better that the Iberia should keep her steerageway rather than stop her engines and reverse, since she would respond to her wheel more readily, if her engines were kept in motion than if her headway were entirely stopped. The case presented is not one where if both vessels had stopped and reversed, the collision might have been avoided; but whether, under the facts as they subsequently appeared to be, the Iberia could be deemed in fault for a manoeuvre which would have tended to avoid the collision rather than bring it about, by aiding her in keeping out of the way of the Umbria.\nEven the master of the Adelaide frankly testifies that he has no complaint. He says:\nQ. Now, have you any complaint to make with the manoeuvring\u2014 with the navigation of the Hampholm?\u2014A. No, sir.\nQ. So that, so far as she was concerned the accident was, as you state in this accident report, unavoidable?\u2014A. Unavoidable as far as I could see, yes.\nI cannot avoid the conclusion that the cause, and the only effective cause, which brought about the collision of these two vessels was the excessive and reckless speed of the Adelaide in proceeding in the dense fog which prevailed, and in a harbour where ships were so likely to be met, at the immoderate rate of 12 knots, when the visibility, as realized by her master and the officers and members of her crew who testified, was only about 300 feet, and persisting in the maintenance of that speed when she was aware, by the signals of the Hampholm heard in the Adelaide\u2019s wheelhouse, that a steamship was approaching on her starboard bow, so as to involve risk of collision. Let the visibility be increased, as suggested by the learned local judge, to 500 feet, or to 600 feet, as estimated by the Hampholm\u2019s witnesses; even then, as the event shews, the Adelaide entered the area of visibility with a speed which made it impossible for her, as the giving-way ship under article 19, or otherwise, by any action on her part, to keep out of the way, and for the Hampholm, notwithstanding the cautious character of her navigation, to resort to any manoeuvre which would successfully aid to avert the collision. See British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited v. Loach[3].\nThe cause of this accident was not unlike that in The Rosalind v. The Senlac[4]; and the following passage, from the judgment of Duff J., at pp. 69 and 70, may, in substance, be affirmed of the Adelaide, in place of the Senlac, and of the Hampholm, in place of the Rosalind.\nThe most ordinary attention to the most obvious risks of the situation would have led the Senlac, at the time she gave the starboard signal, to take such measures as might be necessary to avoid a collision; and this could easily have been done by simply stopping her engines. The truth seems to be that, at the moment the ships were in a position involving risk of collision, but no actual peril if both ships should be navigated with the caution which such a situation required; but that, while the Rosalind was navigated with care, the Senlac was navigated with a reckless disregard of the safety of both ships. It was this recklessness that was the proximate cause of the collision.\nAn appeal de plano to the Judicial Committee was dismissed, 25th October, 1909 ; Lord Macnaghten saying that their Lordships agreed with the Supreme Court of Canada in thinking that\nthe Senlac was navigated with a reckless disregard of her own safety and of the safety of any other vessel that might be approaching her. Their Lordships have had an opportunity of conferring with the Nautical Assessors, and that is their view also.\nThere are some observations in United States Shipping Board v. Laird Line[5], which, I think, have their application to the limit, in the special and unusual circumstances of this case. At page 291, Lord Dunedin said:\nAccordingly, the Rowan is hit by a consideration analogous to that which prevailed in the well-known case of the By well Castle[6], and many others\u2014namely, that it is not in the mouth of those who have created the danger of the situation to be minutely critical of what is done by those whom they have by their fault involved in the danger. And, at page 293, Lord Shaw, referring also to the case of the By well Castle[7], said:\nMy Lords, I have thought it right to cite these very authoritative judgments because, if the doctrine there laid down be lost sight of, a region of refinement is apt to be entered upon under which the true responsibility for the substantial wrongdoing may be improperly whittled down and a fanciful wrongdoing may be raised improperly into a region of substance as a contributing cause.\nMoreover the Supreme Court of the United States, in The Umbria[8], uses this language:\nOf course there is a point depending upon the number, distinctness and apparent position of the approaching signals, beyond which precautions are unnecessary and the master has the right to assume that he has shaken off the other vessel, but it is entirely clear that that point had not been reached in this case, and that the immediate cause of the collision was the order to go ahead at full speed before the course and position of the Iberia had been definitely ascertained. Indeed, so gross was the fault of the Umbria in this connection, that we should unhesitatingly apply the rule laid down in The City of New York[9], and The Ludvig Holberg[10], that any doubts regarding the management of the other vessel, or the contribution of her faults, if any, to the collision, should be resolved in her favour.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

While the train was approaching Piapot station, in Alberta, the appellant went to the rear end of the car in which he was riding and, just as he was stepping from the passage to the platform, and while his hand was on the door, there came a sudden jerk of the car, in consequence of which the boy was thrown to the platform and, the vestibule door being open, down the steps to the ground, where his legs came under the wheels and it was found necessary, by reason of his injuries, to amputate his right leg above the knee and his left foot above the ankle. The appellant, in 1928, nine years after the accident, brought an action to recover damages. The jury found that the respondent railway was negligent in that the \"exits of the train (were) not properly safeguarded,\" that the appellant was not \"guilty of negligence \" and that the \" proximate cause of the accident\" was the appellant's \" falling off the train,\" and the jury gave a verdict for $10,000. After the conclusion of the evidence, the respondent's counsel moved to dismiss the accident; and the trial judge, after the verdict of the jury, dismissed the appellant's action on the grounds that there was no negligence in law established by the evidence or found by the jury and that the action was barred by section 282 of the Railway Act, 1906. Two of the four judges sitting in the Court of Appeal held that the appellant had failed to satisfy the onus of proof which rested upon him of shewing negligence or want of care on the part of the respondent, a third one held there had been a mistrial and the fourth would have rendered judgment according to the verdict; the judgment of the trial judge was therefor affirmed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (42 B.C.

S. Robertson, K.C., for the appellant.\nA. MacMurchy, K.C., and H. J. Dempsey for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The action was brought on 17th May, 1928, to recover compensation for injuries which the plaintiff suffered in an accident which occurred on the defendant company's railway, at or near Piapot Station, in Alberta, on 28th March, 1919, when the plaintiff, then a boy of nine years, was crossing the continent as an immigrant, with his mother, in one of the defendant's vestibuled trains. While the train was approaching the station the boy went to the rear end of the car in which he was riding, and, according to the evidence which the jury accepts, just as he was stepping from the passage to the platform, and while his hand was on the door, there came a sudden jerk of the car, in consequence of which the boy was thrown to the platform and, the vestibule door being open, down the steps to the ground, where his legs, unfortunately, came under the wheels, and it was found necessary, by reason of his injuries, to amputate his right leg at or just above the knee, and his left foot above the ankle.\nThe case was tried on 25th November, 1928, before Morrison J., with a jury. Questions were submitted by the learned judge, and these, with the answers returned by the jury, are as follows:\nQ. Was the defendant guilty of negligence?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And if so, what was it?\u2014A. The exits of the train not properly safeguarded.\nQ. Was the plaintiff guilty of negligence?\u2014A. No.\nQ. What was the proximate cause of the accident?\u2014A. Falling off the train.\nQ. Damages, if any\u2014A. $10,000.\nThere is no objection that the charge was unfavourable to the defendant.\nAfter the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant's counsel had moved to dismiss the action; judgment upon this motion had been reserved until after the verdict, and, on 19th January, 1929, the learned judge having in the interval considered the matter, directed the dismissal of the action. He reviewed the evidence and expressed his conclusion as follows:\nThere was no evidence on which a jury could reasonably find that the defendant company had not complied with all the statutory requirements in handling this particular train. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that the train jerked at the particular juncture and about which the testimony was conflicting, would be sound ground, if believed by the jury, upon which negligence could be charged. The only ground so found by the jury was that in answer to the first question\u2014that brings me to Mr. McMullin's submission that there is no negligence in law established by the evidence or found by the jury and with which I agree. There was no legal duty imposed upon the defendant company to have vestibule doors at all. Skelton v. The London N.W. Railway Co.[2]. There was no evidence that they were defective or left in such a way as to invite a passenger to rely upon their structure or condition. The period in which the plaintiff was on the train and the warnings given him by a fellow passenger should have familiarized him with the inherent dangers and risks to which passengers are subjected when availing themselves of this mode of travel. It would be imposing too great an onus even upon a railway company to require that they must have an employee posted at each vestibule door of a car to prevent passengers from opening them. The platforms of a train in motion are taken to be danger spots and railway companies are obliged so to warn their passengers, which the defendant had done. Assuming I may have misconceived the law in this respect, I think the action is barred by virtue of section 282 of the Railway Act, 1906, re-enacted in section 390 of the Railway Act of 1919.\nAt the hearing before us it was urged, on behalf of the defendant, that the plaintiff was disentitled to recover, by reason of his breach of one of the defendant's printed regulations, at the time admittedly posted up in the car in which the plaintiff was riding. The regulation is in evidence, and it provides that\nNo person shall use the platform or any step of any car on any line of railway owned or leased or operated by the company as a place on which to stand or stay, but only as a place over which to pass in getting on or off a car, or from car to car; and no person shall travel or be in any baggage car or other car not intended for the conveyance of passengers.\nIt is, moreover, provided by section 390 of The Railway Act, 1919,\nNo person injured while on the platform of a car, or on any baggage or freight car, in violation of the printed regulations posted up at the time, shall have any claim in respect of the injury, if room inside of the passenger cars, sufficient for the proper accommodation of the passengers, was furnished at the time.\nThis is the clause to which the learned judge refers at the conclusion of his judgment.\nThe provincial Court of Appeal, consisting of four judges, was divided. The Chief Justice, with whom Galliher, J. A. agreed, holding that\nthe plaintiff has failed to satisfy the onus of proof which rested upon him of shewing negligence or want of care on the part of the defendants.\nMartin, J. A. considered that\nthere was a case to go to the jury on at least two heads of negligence, and that after the jury had found for the plaintiff the learned judge below should not, with respect, on the facts and findings, have acceded to defendants' motion to dismiss the action.\nBut, he held that there had been a mistrial because there was no definite finding as to the proximate cause of the accident, and that the answer, \"falling off the train,\" is,\nin the circumstances, meaningless and has no other effect than if the question had remained unanswered, and shews that the mind of the jury was not properly directed to the gist of the case.\nMacdonald, J., on the other hand, considered that the case should be governed by the verdict of the jury.\nAlthough, as said by the learned trial judge, the defendant was not expressly required to provide vestibule doors, such doors were, nevertheless, in common use, and, according to the evidence led by the defendant, it is part of the duty of the trainmen \"to see that they are kept closed when running \". Two of these witnesses testified that the doors were shut after leaving Tomkins, the last preceding station, and that, when they came through the train, about 25 or 30 minutes before reaching Piapot, where they slowed down to pick up an order, these doors were closed. There is no doubt, however, that the door at the platform where the boy fell, was open at the time. It is suggested that it might have been opened by a passenger; but this was the last of the passenger cars and was directly followed by the caboose, in which the train-crew rode, and immediately behind that came an official car at the end of the train, and there was evidence from which it may be inferred that the two trainmen, who, at the time of the accident, were on the platform or steps of the caboose, engaged in the reception of the order, did not perceive that the vestibule door was open while the train was slowing down for the order. The jury may, therefore, have considered that the proof of the closing of the door was not satisfactory, or that the fact was not adequately established. The case differs from that of Skelton v. London and Northwestern Railway Company[3], where the plaintiff failed by reason of his contributory negligence, although Willes J., following the leading case of Coggs v. Bernard[4], considered also that there was no proof of actionable negligence by the railway.\nVestibules upon passenger trains, while conceded not to be a statutory requirement, add much to the safety and convenience of travellers, and presumably have resulted from consideration of the duty which the railway companies, as carriers, owe to their passengers. The provision and use of vestibules are not, in my view, self-imposed or voluntary duties or precautions, in the sense in which Willes, J., used the term in Skelton's case[5] ; rather I think, it may be said that vestibules, for the class of cars upon which they are usually provided, are in practical use as a part of reasonable railway equipment, and cannot be neglected by the operator with due regard to the general safety, and so we find the defendant's servants instructed in their manipulation, and to keep them closed when the steps are not in use. Obviously, the jury considered that it was unsafe to leave the doors open and unguarded when the train was in motion.\nAs to the posted notice, forbidding the use of the platform or steps as a place whereon to stand or stay; it is to be observed that, according to the boy's testimony, he was not making use of them for either of these purposes, although, very possibly, he may have had the intention to do so. His several accounts of what happened are inconsistent, and for that reason, along with the other circumstances, I should feel better satisfied if the jury had denied the proof of his case; but what he maintained at the trial was that as he was in the act of passing through the door, which opened from the rear end of the car to the platform, and that, while he had his hand on the knob of the door, he was thrown down by a jolt of the train, and so fell from the steps to the ground. It must, I think, be assumed that the jury adopted this version of the facts, and it was within their province to do so; and assuming that to be right, the boy committed no breach of the regulation, and therefore section 390 of The Railway Act, 1919, does not apply to his case.\nAs to proximate cause, I would not impute any defect to the finding; the plaintiff's fall to the ground and injury sustained were natural and direct consequences of the open trap-door, and it is not charged that he lost his footing by reason of any contributory negligence.\nI would, in these circumstances, maintain the appeal with costs, and direct judgment to be entered pursuant to the findings. The plaintiff should also have the costs of the action and trial and of the provincial appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur Leighton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

The condition of the obligation was such, that if certain packages of alcohol entered for export, ex-warehouse, by the appellant corporation at Belleville, Ontario, for St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, should be duly shipped and exported and entered for consumption or warehouse at St. John\u2019s, and if proof of such exportation and entry was made in accordance with the requirements of the Warehousing Regulations in that behalf within ninety days from the date of the bond, to the satisfaction of the Collector of Inland Revenue for the division of Belleville, Ontario, or if the Consolidated Distilleries Limited, one of the appellants, should account for the said goods to the satisfaction of the said Collector then the obligation was to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and effect.\nHeld that the burden of proving the fulfilment of the entire condition of the bond was upon the appellants.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, maintaining the respondent\u2019s action with costs.\nThe facts of the case, as they appear in the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court, are as follows: On October 18, 1924, at the customs port of Belleville, Ont., the appellant corporation made an entry for the export, ex-warehouse, of twelve metal drums or packages of alcohol, to St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, on a through bill of lading. The alcohol went forward by the Canadian National Rail\u00adway on the 18th day of October, 1924; the car containing the same reached Montreal on the afternoon of October 20, following, and in this car was merchandise other than the twelve drums of alcohol. Before leaving Belleville, the car was sealed by both the railway and customs authorities; but when the car reached Montreal, these seals had been removed. The goods were placed in a shed at the Bona-venture station of the Canadian National Railway, Montreal, and there remained presumably under the usual guard and protection until 11 a.m., on October 22, when they were removed by a cartage company\u2014which company does all the carting for the Canadian, National Railway from its railway premises at Montreal to the harbour front for furtherance by water\u2014to the Canadian Merchant Marine steamship Canadian Sapper bound for St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland. This steamer did not sail until October 28, the goods in question meanwhile being stored on the deck of the steamer. She arrived at St. John\u2019s on November 5, but according to the evidence, the goods were not landed from the steamer until November 14, when they were entered into a customs warehouse on the following day, November 15. Early in January, 1925, it was discovered by the Customs authorities at St. John\u2019s, that the drums contained water only; this discovery was made owing to the fact that the contents had become frozen, causing the drums or packages to bulge. The respondent\u2019s action was brought in October, 1927, for $17,111.66, being $15,048.50, the amount of the bond and $2,069.16, interest on same from 18th of January, 1925.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. D. Kearney for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The facts of this case sufficiently appear in the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court. The condition of the bond sued upon is that if the goods in question\nshall be duly shipped, and shall be exported and entered for consumption or for warehouse at St. John\u2019s, Nfld., aforesaid, and if proof of such exportation and entry shall, in accordance with the requirements of the Warehousing Regulations in that behalf, be adduced within 90 days from the date hereof to the satisfaction of the said Collector of Inland Revenue for the Division of Belleville, or if the said bounden Consolidated Distilleries, Limited, shall account for the said goods to the satisfaction of the said Collector of Inland Revenue for the said Inland Revenue Division of Belleville, Ont., then this obligation to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.\nThe burden of showing the fulfilment of this entire condition was, in our opinion, upon the defendants. (R.S.C., 1906, c. 51.) The learned trial judge found that the goods in question had not been \u201cexported and entered for consumption or for warehouse at St. John\u2019s, Nfld.,\u201d but, on the contrary, that there had been, at the port of Montreal, a substitution of water for the alcohol shipped. While, upon the evidence, we would not be prepared, without further consideration, to maintain the finding of substitution at Montreal, the defendants certainly did not prove delivery at St. John\u2019s, Nfld., of the alcohol shipped.\nMoreover, it is abundantly clear that the remaining condition of the bond was not complied with, viz., that proof was not adduced\nof such exportation and entry * * * within 90 days from the date * * * (of the bond) to the satisfaction of the said Collector of Inland Revenue for the Division of Belleville;\nnor were the goods accounted for to his satisfaction.\nThe burden of proving the fulfilment of this alternative condition was clearly upon the appellants. They employed one Duncan to obtain the necessary landing certificate and it was duly given to him and was not by him returned to the appellants as they had expected. It was handed, some time in the middle of January (probably, according to the evidence, during the week of the 18th), to the Assistant Deputy Minister of Excise, not to prove delivery of the alcohol at St. John\u2019s, but because the fraud practised had then been discovered and Duncan appears to have been anxious to ingratiate himself with the Department. The appellants themselves subsequently obtained a duplicate of this certificate, which they appear to have delivered to the Excise officer at Belleville, about the 11th of February, 1925, well beyond the 90 days, which had expired on the 16th of January, 1925.\nFor these reasons, we would uphold the judgment imposing liability under the bond upon the appellants. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, Holden, Reward & Holden.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John D. Kearney.\n",

The K., being light, had moored previously to the south revetment wall of the canal near the place of collision on account of wind and rain, the night being also dark. When the O., approaching the entrance to the canal, came into relation with the K., the weather had cleared so far as to enable the K. safely, in the judgment of her master and pilot, to proceed upon her voyage; and, accordingly, her master gave the order to cast off. The K. then gave two blasts of her whistle, signalling her desire to pass on the starboard side of the O., a signal which the latter promptly answered in like manner, the two ships thus agreeing that they should pass green to green. The K. was shouldering her way along the canal wall and the O. was coming down on the opposite side, when suddenly the O. gave an alarm or danger signal of five or six blasts and reversed her engine at full speed astern. There was then, according to the findings, ample room, in canal navigation, between the starboard side of the K. and the blocks marking the northern side of the channel for the O. to pass. The result of the manoeuvre of the O. was that her stern struck the K\u2019s. starboard bow, forcing the K. against the south wall, where her stern struck. Both ships sustained damage and there was an action and a cross-action, which were tried together. The Local Judge in Admiralty at Montreal found the O. solely to blame. This judgment was reversed by the Exchequer Court of Canada, Audette J., who held that the K. was \u201cat fault for a collision which would not have happened had she lain fast at her berth and delayed casting off but a few minutes, * * * with the knowledge (she had) of a downbound vessel coming in at the time with the current, having thereby the right of way.\u201d Held (reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1930] Ex. C.R. 1) that the judgment of the Local Judge in Admiralty, holding the O. solely to blame, should be restored. Upon the facts, the Local Judge rightly held that the collision, having taken place on the south side of the canal, resulted from the faulty navigation of the O., by an abrupt and inconsistent manoeuvre, after exchange of the passing signal\u2019s, a manoeuvre intervening between the time when the K. got under way and the collision; and, therefor, it was not the untimely casting off of the K. to which the collision can be attributed\u2014 Although the action of those in charge of the K\u2019s. navigation was inconsiderate, in leaving her moorings and proceeding outward in the face of the incoming O., the K. should not be held responsible for such an error because it was not the cause of the damage which ensued. Tuff v. Warman (2 C.B.n.s. 740) and Radley v. London and Northwestern Ry. Co. (1 App. Cas. 754) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Audette J.[1], allowing with costs an appeal of Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., owners of the SS. Oxford, and dismissing with costs a cross-appeal of the Paterson Steamships Ltd., owners of the SS. Kingdoc, from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Philippe Demers, Local Judge in Admiralty for the Quebec Admiralty District, in cross-actions brought and tried together on the same evidence, for damage sustained by the respective vessels of the parties as a result of a collision between the said vessels at the upper end of the Lachine canal, near Montreal, on 5th June, 1927.\nE. Languedoc, K.C., for the appellant.\nA. R. Holden, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The SS. Kingdoc, while ascending the Lachine canal at its western exit, came into collision with the SS. Oxford, which had just begun her descent from Lake St. Louis. The accident occurred during the latter part of the middle watch, on 5th June, 1927. Both ships sustained damage, and there is an action and a cross-action. These were tried together before the local judge at Montreal, who sat with two assessors, and he found the Oxford solely to blame. Upon appeal to the Exchequer Court, Audette J., the learned judge who presided, and who also had an assessor, reversed the decision of the learned local judge, and now the owners of the Kingdoc appeal to this court. There is some conflict of fact, and the learned counsel for the respondent very judiciously bases his argument upon the passages which he maintains are not in dispute, realizing, no doubt, the \u201cgreat and almost insuperable difficulty\u201d with which an appellant is apt to encounter adverse findings of fact upon contradictory testimony. (Per Lord Kingsdown in The Julia[2]; per Lord Sumner in The Hontestroom v. The Sagaporack[3].\nThe material facts may thus be stated in short space and I extract the narrative from the respondent\u2019s factum:\nThe respondent Steamship Oxford had come down with the current through Lake St. Louis and when the Oxford reached the entrance of the Lachine Canal the appellant Steamship Kingdoc was still moored to the canal wall where she had remained since making fast there about an hour earlier. While the Oxford was coming down the narrow canal entrance between certain piers on the north side and the canal wall on the south side of the entrance, the Kingdoc cast off from her moorings and commenced to manoeuvre so as to get under way on her proposed voyage up the canal entrance to the lake. The wind was blowing from the southwest across the canal entrance and when the Oxford was trying to meet and pass the Kingdoc the latter\u2019s starboard side came into collision with the stem of the Oxford. The Kingdoc was light and the Oxford was fully loaded.\nIt should be observed that the navigation in this case is governed by the rules of the road for the Great Lakes, which include the St. Lawrence river as far east as the lower exit of the Lachine canal and the Victoria bridge at Montreal; they differ in several particulars from the international rules.\nThe learned Judge of Exchequer Court at the conclusion of his reasons for judgment, which are fully stated, propounds the following maxim, as governing his conclusion:\nMoored at the revetment wall of the Canal, the Kingdoc, a light ship of 250 feet in length, with a fresh breeze blowing strong enough to affect her, on a dark night, casting off and getting unnecessarily under way, in a canal of 275 feet in width, with the knowledge of a downbound vessel coming in at the time with the current, having thereby the right of way, (Rule 25) will be held at fault for a collision which would not have happened had she lain fast at her berth and delayed casting off but a few minutes.\nNow while I agree that, in the circumstances of this case, the action of those in charge of the Kingdoc\u2019s navigation was inconsiderate, in leaving her moorings and proceeding outward in the face of the incoming Oxford, which was close at hand and exhibiting both side lights; nevertheless, the learned\u2019s judge\u2019s statement requires qualification, for the offending ship should not be held responsible for such an error unless it be the cause of the damage which ensued, and we have here another instance of the application of the rule which was laid down in the well-known case of Tuff v. Warman[4], and restated by the House of Lords in Radley v. London and Northwestern Railway Company[5].\nIt is an undisputed fact that when the Oxford, approaching the entrance to the canal, came into relations with the Kingdoc, the weather had cleared so far as to enable the Kingdoc safely, in the judgment of her master and pilot, to proceed upon her voyage; and, accordingly, her master gave the order to cast off. The following passage occurs in Captain Redfearn\u2019s cross-examination:\nQ. At page 67 of the transcription of your evidence taken before the Wreck Commissioner I find the Commissioner said:\n\u201cQ. And in that case there, with a strong breeze blowing\u2014a fresh wind blowing\u2014and a light ship, it takes some time before you leave, and you cannot help getting an angle obliquely from the wharf, because your stern went away in the first place and all the movements of the helm and engines would only accentuate the position because you cannot fight against a wind?\u201d\nto which you answered:\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Would it have been better for you to wait long enough for the Oxford to pass?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. You realize that now?\u2014A. Yes, sir. If I had known what was going to happen I would never have left the pier.\nThe Kingdoc then gave two blasts of her whistle, signalling her desire to pass on the starboard side of the Oxford, a signal which the latter promptly answered in like manner; thus the two ships agreed that they should pass green to green. When this interchange of signals took place the Oxford was, of course, aware that the Kingdoc was no longer moored, and was outward bound; the situation was perfectly apparent; neither ship anticipated any unavoidable danger or obstruction in making the passage for which they had mutually stipulated. The narrow channel rule applied, subject to the understanding that each ship should keep to the side which she had elected to take; and the ships were very close to each other. The Kingdoc was shouldering her way along the canal wall, at a distance from her stem of about 30 feet, and from her stern of about 60 feet; the Oxford was coming down on the opposite side; when suddenly the Oxford gave an alarm or danger signal of five or six blasts and reversed her engine at full speed astern. The reason for this manoeuvre was not apparent to the Kingdoc; for, according to the findings, she was navigating as closely to the southern bank as she could safely go, and there was ample room, in canal navigation, between her starboard side and the blocks which mark the northern side of the channel, for the Oxford to pass.\nThe danger signal is explained by Mr. Austen, the first officer of the Oxford, who says:\nA. A short while after the Kingdoc appeared to have been blown across the canal, and I did not see where we were going to pass him starboard to starboard, so I blew the danger signal.\nQ. Five or six blasts?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. How far apart do you think the vessels were when you blew the danger signal?\u2014A. Roughly a couple of boat lengths.\nQ. That would be about 500 feet?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did they answer that danger signal?\u2014A. No, sir.\nQ. When you saw there was no room to pass was anything done with your engines?\u2014A. When I got no answer to the danger signal I put my ship full speed astern.\nQ. You gave that order on the telegraph?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did they obey it down below?\u2014A. Immediately.\nThe Oxford\u2019s stem struck the Kingdoc\u2019s starboard bow, at no. 2 hatch, 68 feet from the stem, forcing the Kingdoc against the south wall, where her stem struck. Evidently it was considered at the trial that the collision took place on the south side of the canal, and resulted from the faulty navigation of the Oxford, by an abrupt and inconsistent manoeuvre, after exchange of the passing signals. I am not convinced that the local judge reached an erroneous conclusion; certainly there was a cause intervening between the time when the Kingdoc got under way, and the collision; and if the accident was due to the cause found at the trial, it was not the untimely casting off of the Kingdoc, to which the collision can be attributed.\nFor these reasons, I think, with great respect, that the findings and judgment at the trial should be restored, and I would allow the appeal in each case with costs. The appellant should also have the costs of the appeal in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Errol Languedoc.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] [1930] Ex.

VII, c. 42, s. 1.\nA married woman, when authorized generally to maintain or defend an action, can appear as respondent before an appellate court without having obtained a new authorization, when she is seeking the confirmation of a judgment rendered in her favour. (Q.R. 48 K.B. 572 aff.)\nA deed of warranty signed by the husband and his wife separate as to property, both being shareholders of an incorporated company, in order to secure reimbursement of advances made or to be made by a bank to the company, the evidence disclosing no benefit derived by the wife from the transaction, is a deed where the wife joins her husband in an obligation which affects interests common to both. As such, it is illegal and void, so far as concerns the wife, as being in contravention of the provisions of article 1301 C.C.\nThe mere fact, however, that the obligation assumed by the wife with her husband is joint and several is not in itself sufficient to bring it within the article (art. 1301 C.C.).\nSince the amendment to art. 1301 C.C., enacted by 4 Ed. VII, c. 42, s. 1 (1904), ignorance on the part of the obligee (cr\u00e9ancier) that the money was borrowed for the husband\u2019s purposes will protect the rights of the obligee, provided the money was handed over to the wife herself and the obligee had no reason whatever to suspect that it would be used in any way for the husband\u2019s benefit; and if subsequently the wife invokes the nullity of her obligation, the burden is upon her to prove that the money was for the husband\u2019s benefit to the knowledge of the obligee.\nPer Anglin C.J.C.\u2014Upon the evidence, the wife had no personal interest to serve in becoming the guarantor for the company and, when she signed such guarantee, she must have done so with the idea of helping her husband rather than of serving her own interests.\u2014No opinion is expressed upon the validity of a guarantee given by a wife which, although it cannot be said to have been given \u201cpour son mari\u201d is given by her \u201cavec son mari\u201d.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 49 K.B. 67) aff. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Letellier J.[2] and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant bank brought an action against the respondent Audet and other defendants for the recovery of the sum of $10,134.25, upon two private deeds whereby the respondent and the other defendants agreed jointly and severally to guarantee the reimbursement by a certain company of which they were shareholders, of all advances made to the company by the Banque Nationale up to $10,000. The action was taken by the appellant bank, which had succeeded to the rights of the Banque Nationale, the company being insolvent and owing to the bank more than the full amount of the guarantee.\nCharles Fr\u00e9mont K.C. and A. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Pr\u00e9vost K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court (Anglin C.J.C. concurring in the conclusions reached by Rinfret J., but writing separately) was delivered by Rinfret J.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I concur in the conclusions reached by my brother Rinfret.\nIt seems to me that if a general authorization such as we have here may be sufficient to entitle a married woman, not only to maintain or defend an action, but also to prosecute an appeal against an adverse judgment, a fortiori and at all events must this be so where, as in the present case, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and here, she is not appellant, but respondent.\nOn the merits I am entirely satisfied that this case falls within the mischief aimed at by art. 1301 C.C. It is clear that the wife had no personal interest to serve in becoming the guarantor for the company and that, when she signed such guarantee, she must have done so with the idea of helping her husband rather than of serving her own interests. That being so, it is correct to say of her guarantee that it was given \u201cavec et pour son mari\u201d. I desire to express no opinion upon the validity of a guarantee given by a wife which, although it cannot be said to have been given \u201cpour son mari\u201d. is given by her \u201cavec son mari\u201d. It may, in some future case, be clear that the circumstances entitle her to invoke the protection of art. 1301 C.C. against liability on such a guarantee.\nRinfret, J. (delivering the judgment of the court).\u2014 Il se soul\u00e8ve une question pr\u00e9liminaire sur l\u2019appel. L\u2019intim\u00e9e est une femme mari\u00e9e. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie par l\u2019appelante en m\u00eame temps que plusieurs autres d\u00e9fendeurs, parmi lesquels se trouvait son mari.\nEn Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, elle a produit une comparution distincte de celle de ce dernier, bien que par l\u2019entremise des m\u00eames procureurs. La comparution de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se lit comme suit:\nNous comparaissons pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, Dame Albertine Audet, sous toutes r\u00e9serves que de droit.\nLa comparution de son mari a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e tr\u00e8s probablement dans le but de satisfaire le principe pos\u00e9 par la Cour de R\u00e9vision dans la cause de Ducasse v. Montgrain[3] que\nl\u2019assignation d\u2019une femme mari\u00e9e avec son mari rend ce dernier partie dans la cause; et s\u2019il ne compara\u00eet pas, il autorise tacitement son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 ester en justice.\nElle se lit comme suit:\nNous comparaissons pour le d\u00e9fendeur Edgar Lemieux personnellement, et non pas pour autoriser sa femme, sous toutes r\u00e9serves que de droit.\nSur production de ces comparutions, la demanderesse pr\u00e9senta une motion priant le juge de donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019autorisation \u00e0 \u201cester en jugement\u201d que lui refusait son mari.\nLa cour rendit le jugement suivant:\nLa cour, vu la motion faite de la part de la demanderesse \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la d\u00e9fenderesse, Dame Albertine Audet Lemieux, soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 ester et plaider en la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, le tout avec d\u00e9pens:\nParties ou\u00efes sur la pr\u00e9sente motion;\nAccorde ladite motion, le tout tel que demand\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e produisit alors son plaidoyer. Le proc\u00e8s suivit son cours et jugement intervint maintenant la contestation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et rejetant l\u2019action, quant \u00e0 elle, avec d\u00e9pens. Il n\u2019y a aucune discussion sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; mais, lorsque l\u2019appelante porta sa cause en appel, elle omit de faire signifier l\u2019inscription au mari et de faire renouveler pr\u00e9alablement l\u2019autorisation judiciaire permettant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019ester devant la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e fit alors une motion concluant \u00e0 ce que les proc\u00e9dures\u2019 en appel fussent d\u00e9clar\u00e9es informes, ill\u00e9gales et nulles, et que les parties fussent mises hors de cour.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi rejeta cette motion, monsieur le juge Dorion se d\u00e9clarant dissident[4].\nPuis, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 au m\u00e9rite[5], l\u2019appelante, en venant devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, proc\u00e9da de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019elle avait fait devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, sans signification au mari, et sans nouvelle demande d\u2019autorisation \u00e0 la femme.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend donc que toute la proc\u00e9dure est entach\u00e9e d\u2019une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 fatale, par suite du d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation, \u00e0 la fois devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et devant cette cour; et, de ce chef, elle nous demande de rejeter l\u2019appel.\nLe moyen soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appuie sur les articles suivants du code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec:\n176. La femme ne peut ester en jugement sans l\u2019autorisation ou l\u2019assistance de son mari, quand m\u00eame elle serait non commune ou marchande publique. Celle qui est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens ne le peut faire non plus si ce n\u2019est dans les cas de simple administration.\n178. Si le mari refuse d\u2019autoriser sa femme \u00e0 ester en jugement ou \u00e0 passer un acte, le juge peut donner l\u2019autorisation.\n181. Toute autorisation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, m\u00eame stipul\u00e9e par contrat de mariage, n\u2019est valable que quant \u00e0 l\u2019administration des biens de la femme.\n183. Le d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation du mari, dans le cas o\u00f9 elle est requise, comporte une nullit\u00e9 que rien ne peut couvrir et dont se peuvent pr\u00e9valoir tous ceux qui y ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel.\nLes articles correspondants du Code Napol\u00e9on comportent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame texte, sauf que\nla nullit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e que par la femme, par le mari, ou par leurs h\u00e9ritiers.\nIci le moyen est soulev\u00e9 par la femme. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous ne voyons pas que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on puisse tirer un argument de la diff\u00e9rence entre les textes du code fran\u00e7ais et du code de Qu\u00e9bec. Nous pouvons donc sans danger chercher la solution dans la doctrine et la jurisprudence des deux pays.\nLa question y est tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que faisait observer monsieur le juge Dorion en enregistrant sa dissidence en Cour du Banc du Roi.\nNaturellement, personne ne conteste le principe que la femme, m\u00eame s\u00e9par\u00e9e de corps et de biens, ne peut ester en justice sans l\u2019autorisation ou l\u2019assistance de son mari, ou, en cas de refus du mari, sans l\u2019autorisation d\u2019un juge, ni que ce principe soit d\u2019ordre public. La divergence d\u2019opinions commence sur la question de savoir si l\u2019appel constitue une nouvelle instance; et bon nombre d\u2019auteurs enseignent que la femme mari\u00e9e a besoin d\u2019une nouvelle autorisation pour plaider en appel. La Cour de Cassation, en France, vient de r\u00e9affirmer dans un arr\u00eat tout r\u00e9cent (Parisot et autres c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Le Nickel)[6] que le principe s\u2019impose \u00e0 tous les degr\u00e9s de juridiction.\nOn admet cependant que l\u2019autorisation de suivre l\u2019instance en appel peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019autorisation \u201c d\u2019ester en jugement\u201d en premi\u00e8re instance[7]. Une autorisation de ce genre n\u2019est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 la prescription de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 contenue dans l\u2019article 181 du code civil (Boitard, Proc\u00e9dure civile, 15e \u00e9d., par Glasson, T. 2e, p. 60). Le mari ne pourrait autoriser g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sa femme \u00e0 s\u2019engager dans tout proc\u00e8s o\u00f9 elle pourrait \u00eatre partie; mais rien ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il l\u2019autorise, une fois pour toutes, \u00e0 suivre un proc\u00e8s dans toutes ses phases.\nDans ces conditions, ainsi qu\u2019on l\u2019a fait remarquer (Laurent, Suppl\u00e9ment aux principes de droit civil, t. 1er, n\u00b0 594, p. 391), la discussion se r\u00e9sout en une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019autorisation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e. Il est \u00e9vident que si, dans ses termes, elle est express\u00e9ment limit\u00e9e au recours en premi\u00e8re instance, elle devra \u00eatre restreinte \u00e0 ce degr\u00e9 de juridiction. Si, au contraire, elle s\u2019\u00e9tend express\u00e9ment \u00e0 tous les degr\u00e9s de juridiction, elle permet \u00e0 la femme qui l\u2019a obtenue d\u2019ester en appel sans autorisation nouvelle. Il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider comment il faut interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019autorisation du mari (ou du juge) lorsque l\u2019autorisation ne pr\u00e9cise pas et est donn\u00e9e en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La doctrine et la jurisprudence se prononcent dans les deux sens.\nLa Cour de Cassation a jug\u00e9, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que l\u2019autorisation accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une femme mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet de former une demande en justice ne suffit pas pour l\u2019habiliter \u00e0 appeler du jugement qui a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Une nouvelle autorisation est n\u00e9cessaire. (Consulter sur ce point Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du droit fran\u00e7ais, vbo. Autorisation de femme mari\u00e9e, nos 657, 658 et 659.)\nD\u2019autre part, la m\u00eame cour a jug\u00e9 que la femme autoris\u00e9e par son mari \u00e0 intenter une demande en justice n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019une nouvelle autorisation pour d\u00e9fendre en appel le jugement prononc\u00e9 en sa faveur (Bonnieu c. Dineux[8]; Pissard c. Maury)[9]. M\u00eame dans la cause de Sarlandie, c. Sarlandie (3)[10], l\u2019autorisation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la femme par le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal civil de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa demande en s\u00e9paration de corps a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e suffisante pour habiliter la femme \u00e0 plaider tant sur sa demande principale que sur la demande incidente qui s\u2019y rattachait, et pour lui permettre d\u2019ester en appel sur ces demandes sans recourir \u00e0 une nouvelle autorisation.\nCependant, il semblerait que la cour ait voulu faire une distinction entre l\u2019autorisation de plaider et celle de former une demande en justice. L\u2019autorisation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la femme g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et lui permettant de se porter d\u00e9fenderesse ne pourrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e extensivement[11]. Dans la cause de Parisot c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Le Nickel[12], \u00e0 laquelle nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, le rapport ne fait pas voir si l\u2019autorisation \u00e9tait sp\u00e9ciale ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le jug\u00e9 semble indiquer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait sp\u00e9ciale. Il se lit:\nSp\u00e9cialement la femme autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 plaider en premi\u00e8re instance a besoin d\u2019une nouvelle autorisation pour suivre l\u2019instance en appel.\nDans cet \u00e9tat de choses, la doctrine a \u00e9volu\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nSi la femme a perdu en premi\u00e8re instance et veut elle-m\u00eame interjeter appel, elle doit obtenir pour cela une nouvelle autorisation. Mais si la femme a gagn\u00e9 son proc\u00e8s en premi\u00e8re instance et si elle est assign\u00e9e en appel, elle peut, sans nouvelle autorisation, r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette assignation en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIl semble que cette distinction satisfasse la raison. Elle est admise express\u00e9ment par le code civil dans le cas du tuteur qui veut appeler d\u2019un jugement (art. 306 C.C.). Le mari ou le juge, pour accorder l\u2019autorisation d\u2019ester en jugement, s\u2019est bas\u00e9 sur la justesse et la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 apparentes des droits que la femme mari\u00e9e entendait faire valoir, soit en demandant, soit en d\u00e9fendant. Il est raisonnable d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019autorisation qu\u2019ils ont donn\u00e9e comme s\u2019\u00e9tendant \u00e0 la juridiction d\u2019appel dans des conditions identiques. (Voir Garsonnet, Trait\u00e9 de proc\u00e9dure, 3e \u00e9d., vol. 6, p. 37.) Si la situation que le mari ou le juge avait envisag\u00e9e s\u2019est maintenue, si les droits que la femme a obtenu l\u2019autorisation de faire valoir ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus par le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, il est logique de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019autorisation d\u2019ester en jugement donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la femme sans restriction, et qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e, comme persistant devant les tribunaux d\u2019appel o\u00f9 elle se contente de d\u00e9fendre ses positions. Si, au contraire, le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 contre les pr\u00e9tentions de la femme, les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019autorisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e sont modifi\u00e9es et l\u2019on ne saurait pr\u00e9sumer que le mari ou le juge a eu l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tendre son autorisation \u00e0 un appel dans des conditions qui ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre identiques. C\u2019est la solution qui est propos\u00e9e par Laurent (Suppl\u00e9ment aux principes de droit civil, t. 1er, n\u00b0 594, p. 391) et \u00e0 laquelle se rallient Colin et Capitant (Cours \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, 5e \u00e9d., vol. 1er, p. 628) et Planiol et Ripert (Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, vol. 2, p. 372, n\u00b0 458).\nAvec eux, nous trouvons que cette solution est tr\u00e8s raisonnable et qu\u2019il faut l\u2019admettre lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit pour la femme mari\u00e9e qui a gagn\u00e9 son proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9fendre devant la Cour du Banc du Roi le jugement qu\u2019elle a obtenu en premi\u00e8re instance.\nIci, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 \u201cester et plaider en la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit\u201d. Les pr\u00e9tentions qu\u2019elle a soumises au juge pour le justifier de lui accorder son autorisation ont pr\u00e9valu dans le premier jugement. Devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, la situation non seulement n\u2019est pas chang\u00e9e, mais, la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tant en faveur du jugement, elle s\u2019est m\u00eame am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, le premier juge lui ayant donn\u00e9 raison. Le mari n\u2019est pas intervenu pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher de suivre l\u2019instance en appel; le jugement qui l\u2019a autoris\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire, on doit supposer que l\u2019autorisation avait pour but de l\u2019habiliter \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre ses droits jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient d\u00e9finitivement reconnus, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire devant toutes les juridictions, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 jugement final.\nIl en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement si le premier jugement ou la Cour du Banc du Roi avait donn\u00e9 tort \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Un jugement contraire \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions e\u00fbt chang\u00e9 la situation. Il lui e\u00fbt fallu une nouvelle autorisation pour interjeter appel.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019accord avec la Cour du Banc du Roi qui a rejet\u00e9 ce moyen pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Nous ajouterons d\u2019ailleurs que, dans une question de cette esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un d\u00e9faut absolu d\u2019autorisation, mais de la forme que devait prendre l\u2019autorisation pour habiliter la femme mari\u00e9e \u00e0 ester en appel, ce nest pas sans beaucoup d\u2019h\u00e9sitation que nous aurions pu \u00eatre amen\u00e9s \u00e0 mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement du plus haut tribunal de la province.\nPassons maintenant \u00e0 la discussion du m\u00e9rite de cette cause.\nL\u2019appelante, qui \u00e9tait la demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a demand\u00e9 jugement contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et plusieurs autres d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement et solidairement pour la somme de $10,134.25. Cette poursuite est bas\u00e9e sur deux actes sous seing priv\u00e9, respectivement en date du 30 avril et du 13 novembre 1924, en vertu desquels les d\u00e9fendeurs se sont port\u00e9s garants conjointement et solidairement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de $10,000 en faveur de la Banque Nationale pour le parfait remboursement par la compagnie Pannonia Limit\u00e9e, de Qu\u00e9bec, de toutes sommes que la compagnie devait ou pourrait devoir dans la suite \u00e0 ladite banque. La compagnie a fait faillite et s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e endett\u00e9e envers la banque pour pr\u00eats, avances, escomptes et d\u00e9couverts, pour un montant exc\u00e9dant celui de la garantie; et la demanderesse appelante, qui est maintenant aux droits et obligations de la Banque Nationale, r\u00e9clame donc de tous les garants le montant de la garantie en principal et int\u00e9r\u00eats. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 les actes pour se rendre au d\u00e9sir de son mari, sans rien conna\u00eetre de leur contenu ou de leur objet, non plus que des affaires de la compagnie Pannonia; qu\u2019elle est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de son mari; et que ces\nactes de garantie constituent des cautionnements dans lesquels la demanderesse s\u2019oblige avec et pour son mari en contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les actes de garantie nuls d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue quant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action de la banque contre cette derni\u00e8re. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement confirm\u00e9 en appel, pour les motifs qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e par une femme mari\u00e9e \u201cavec\u201d son mari; et, en outre, qu\u2019en s\u2019engageant en l\u2019occurrence conjointement et solidairement avec lui, elle s\u2019obligeait aussi \u201cpour\u201d lui.\nL\u2019appelante nous demande d\u2019infirmer ces deux jugements en nous soumettant qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas, au sens l\u00e9gal, d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e par une femme mari\u00e9e \u201cavec ou pour son mari\u201d, mais d\u2019une garantie pour un tiers: la compagnie Pannonia. Elle ajoute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait actionnaire de cette compagnie et qu\u2019en devenant garante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e pour sa propre affaire.\nL\u2019article 1301 C.C. est sans doute l\u2019un des plus connus du code civil; mais, pour l\u2019intelligence de la discussion, il vaut mieux en citer le texte une fois de plus:\n1301. La femme ne peut s\u2019obliger avec ou pour son mari, qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute obligation qu\u2019elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi.\nNous avons vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens. Elle rencontre donc une premi\u00e8re condition de l\u2019application de l\u2019article; elle n\u2019a pu s\u2019obliger, et elle ne s\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9e, \u201cen qualit\u00e9 de commune\u201d.\nA premi\u00e8re vue, elle ne s\u2019est pas non plus oblig\u00e9e pour son mari. Elle s\u2019est port\u00e9e garante pour la compagnie Pannonia. Ce point, cependant, n\u2019est pas aussi clair que s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un tiers qui f\u00fbt absolument ind\u00e9pendant du mari. Le mari \u00e9tait actionnaire dans la compagnie. La preuve n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas si ses actions \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es enti\u00e8rement ou si elles \u00e9taient encore sujettes \u00e0 appel. Si le mari les avait compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9es, il avait tout de m\u00eame des int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la compagnie. La situation n\u2019est pas strictement la m\u00eame que s\u2019il s\u2019agissait du cas o\u00f9 la femme aurait garanti la dette d\u2019un tiers, dans laquelle le mari n\u2019aurait aucune esp\u00e8ce d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Dans l\u2019examen de ce litige, l\u2019on ne saurait \u00e9carter cet aspect de la, question.\nNous ne croyons pas, cependant, que le seul fait que la femme s\u2019est port\u00e9e garante conjointement et solidairement avec son mari soit suffisant pour dire que, par l\u00e0. elle s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e pour lui. Il est vrai que, par suite de la solidarit\u00e9. elle pourra \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer le plein montant de la dette; mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 une cons\u00e9quence de la nature de l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle a personnellement contract\u00e9e. Elle s\u2019est port\u00e9e garante solidairement. La loi veut que dans ce cas elle soit passible du paiement de toute la dette. En s\u2019acquit-tant, elle ne paie pas pour un autre; elle satisfait pour elle-m\u00eame l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle a contract\u00e9e. C\u2019est seulement lorsque\nl\u2019affaire pour laquelle la dette a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e solidairement ne concerne que l\u2019un des cod\u00e9biteurs (que) celui-ci est tenu de toute la dette vis-\u00e0-vis des autres cod\u00e9biteurs qui ne sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 lui que comme ses cautions (art. 1120 C.C.).\nSi l\u2019intim\u00e9e payait la dette de la compagnie Pannonia, elle ne paierait pas \u00e0 titre de caution de ses autres cod\u00e9biteurs solidaires, ni par cons\u00e9quent de son mari. Elle n\u2019est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e la caution que de la compagnie Pannonia.\nLes avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e nous ont fait remarquer que cette obligation l\u2019exposait \u00e0 rembourser \u00e0 son mari une partie des frais qu\u2019il aurait lui-m\u00eame encourus dans des proc\u00e9dures institu\u00e9es contre lui pour le recouvrement de la dette. En effet,\nl\u2019obligation contract\u00e9e solidairement envers le cr\u00e9ancier, se divise de plein droit entre les cod\u00e9biteurs, qui n\u2019en sont tenus entre eux que chacun pour sa part (art. 1177 C.C.).\nCela ne veut pas dire que, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, le cod\u00e9biteur solidaire qui se laisse poursuivre aura contre les autres un recours pour ses frais. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ces frais auront \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus par sa propre faute et il devra seul les supporter. En principe, ces frais ne sont que l\u2019accessoire de la dette; ils ne peuvent en changer la nature; et cette consid\u00e9ration ne saurait affecter la discussion.\nH ne manque pas d\u2019arr\u00eats dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 que son obligation f\u00fbt solidaire avec son mari. Nous pourrions citer mainte et mainte cause o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable pour avoir sign\u00e9 des billets provisoires avec lui. Il suffira de rappeler le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Jodoin[13]. En cette affaire, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de madame Jodoin poursuivaient la Banque d\u2019Hochelaga en revendication de certaines actions de compagnies transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la banque en garantie de billets promissoires\nsigned by the husband in his own name and also in her name as her \u201cprocureur\u201d or attorney.\nMadame Jodoin \u00e9tait donc oblig\u00e9e solidairement avec son mari. Elle fut condamn\u00e9e sur le motif que\nthe whole affair was the wife\u2019s affair * * * The wife certainly had the benefit of the advances.\nOn voit que le fait de solidarit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 sa condamnation; l\u2019existence de la solidarit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e suffisante pour entacher d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle avait contract\u00e9e.\nIl est juste de faire remarquer que, dans cette cause, il s\u2019agissait \u00e9galement d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e par une femme mari\u00e9e \u201cavec * * * son mari\u201d. Elle fut quand m\u00eame tenue responsable par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Cela nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner l\u2019autre motif donn\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi en la pr\u00e9sente cause pour confirmer le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nLa question pr\u00e9sente de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s et elle n\u2019est pas sans avoir donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 beaucoup de commentaires. Depuis le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Trust & Loan Company of Canada v. Gauthier[14], l\u2019on peut dire que la jurisprudence est fix\u00e9e sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que l\u2019on doit donner \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 C.C. lorsque la femme s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e pour son mari. Il ne reste plus, dans ce cas, qu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser la port\u00e9e de l\u2019amendement de 1904 qui a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article tel qu\u2019il se lisait alors les mots. \u201csauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi\u201d. (4 Ed. VII, c. 42, s. 1.) Mais il est loin d\u2019en \u00eatre ainsi lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une femme qui s\u2019oblige simplement \u201c avec * * * son mari\u201d; et le jugement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce para\u00eet bien \u00eatre all\u00e9 plus loin qu\u2019on l\u2019a jamais fait sur cette mati\u00e8re.\nIl est n\u00e9cessaire de se rappeler que les statuts ant\u00e9rieurs au code d\u00e9fendaient \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de se porter caution pour les dettes, obligations ou engagements contract\u00e9s par le mari avant le mariage ou pendant la dur\u00e9e du mariage (4 Vict. c. 30, art. 36);\net, plus tard,\npour les dettes, engagements ou obligations qui pourront avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9s ou faits en aucun temps pendant la dur\u00e9e de tout tel mariage (Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada, c. 37, art. 55).\nLe 12 mars 1853, la Cour du Banc de la Reine, en appel, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans la cause de Jodoin v. Dufresne[15], d\u00e9cida que la femme ne pouvait s\u2019obliger avec son mari autrement qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de commune en biens et que, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un cautionnement par une femme, conjointement avec son mari, pour un tiers, \u00e9tait nul d\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de l\u2019ordonnance 4 Vict., c. 30, \u00e0 laquelle il vient d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Suivant le rapport, qui est tr\u00e8s succinct, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutenait\nque toute obligation consentie par la femme avec son mari pour un tiers est plut\u00f4t pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation du mari que de celle du tiers.\nC\u2019est en se basant sur ce jugement, auquel d\u2019ailleurs ils r\u00e9f\u00e8rent dans leur projet, que les codificateurs propos\u00e8rent la r\u00e9daction de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. tel qu\u2019il se lit dans le code. Dans leur cinqui\u00e8me rapport (p. 214) ils expliquent que\nCet article est substitu\u00e9 au 1431e du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui est supprim\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement, vu que la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019il contient a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e par notre l\u00e9gislation. (S.R.B.C., c. 37, s. 55.) D\u2019apr\u00e8s cette loi, de date comparativement r\u00e9cente (4 V. c. 30), la femme ne peut s\u2019obliger pour son mari, que comme commune; toute obligation qu\u2019elle contracte autrement est nulle. L\u2019article du code, conforme \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, reconna\u00eet la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle obligation en faveur des tiers; seulement la femme, dans ce cas, a son recours contre le mari ou ses h\u00e9ritiers pour le montant qu\u2019elle est appel\u00e9e, m\u00eame en renon\u00e7ant, \u00e0 payer en vertu de tels actes. Notre article est diff\u00e9rent; l\u2019acte par lequel la femme s\u2019oblige pour son mari, ne la lie nullement si elle renonce. Les engagements qu\u2019elle contracte avec son mari ont \u00e9t\u00e9, dans notre article, assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019elle contracte directement pour lui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s une pr\u00e9somption admise par les tribunaux, qui ont justement donn\u00e9 cette extension \u00e0 la loi.\nIl est donc certain que les commissaires charg\u00e9s de codifier le droit civil ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat de Jodoin v. Dufresne15 comme une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e contract\u00e9e avec son mari cr\u00e9ait la pr\u00e9somption que c\u2019\u00e9tait une obligation pour son mari. Il est non moins certain, quel qu\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le v\u00e9ritable sens de cet arr\u00eat, que ces m\u00eames commissaires ont propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019accepter cette \u201cpr\u00e9somption admise par les tribunaux\u201d et d\u2019assimiler (c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019expression dont ils se servent) \u201cles engagements que la femme mari\u00e9e contracte avec son mari\u201d aux engagements que la femme \u201ccontracte i directement pour lui\u201d.\nC\u2019est dans ces conditions que la l\u00e9gislature a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019article 1301 C.C. tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait soumis par les codificateurs ; et l\u2019on peut en conclure qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le code avec l\u2019esprit dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9.\nIl convient de noter que l\u2019arr\u00eat de Jodoin v. Dufresne[16] a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019observations int\u00e9ressantes dans Hamel v. Panet. On trouve le rapport officiel de cette cause devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans 2 App. C. 121. Mais le volume 3 des Quebec Law Reports contient \u00e9galement, \u00e0 la page 173, un rapport d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la m\u00eame cause devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, la Cour du Banc de la Reine et le Conseil Priv\u00e9. L\u2019on y voit que plusieurs des juges ont \u00e9mis des doutes sur la solidit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision dans Jodoin v. Dufresne16.\nLe juge-en-chef Meredith, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, s\u2019exprime comme suit:\nI am not inclined to think that the provision of the Registry Ordinance, which is an exceptional law, ought to be so extended as to deprive a married woman of her common law right, in good faith, and with the express consent of her husband, to become surety for a debt really due by a third party * * *\nThe Court of Appeals, however, it seems, has held such a suretyship to be null.\nEn Cour du Banc de la Reine, monsieur le juge McCord ajoutait:\nThat section prohibits a married woman from incurring any liability for debts or obligations entered into by her husband, but it does not prohibit her from becoming liable for debts due by third parties * * *\nShe had a perfect right, with the consent of her husband, to become liable alone for her son\u2019s debts, and that right could not be impaired by the fact that her husband likewise became surety.\nEnfin le Conseil Priv\u00e9, parlant par la bouche de Lord Selborne, fait le commentaire suivant:\nBy the law of Lower Canada (it is not necessary to refer to the text), it is provided that a married woman shall not become surety for the debts of her husband; and it has been decided upon that law, in the case of Jodoin v. Dufresne (1)16, that all engagements, though with third parties and not creditors immediately of the husband, which the wife enters into concurrently with the husband, are to be treated constructively as his liabilities; that is to say, that the contract, whether it be of suretyship for somebody else or of any other kind, is to be treated as primarily his contract, and the wife as brought in by him. to secure the liability which he is going to contract. Their Lordships wish it to be distinctly understood that they express no opinion upon the question, whether that case of Jodoin v. Dufresne17 was well decided or not. It is not in their opinion now necessary to say a word which will detract from its authority, whatever that may be; but they also desire to say nothing which can be deemed to add to its authority.\n(Dans le rapport officiel, ce passage se trouve aux pages 152 et 153.)\nMais, comme on le voit, les doutes ou les r\u00e9serves exprim\u00e9s dans les passages des jugements que nous venons de reproduire s\u2019adressaient \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure au code (4 V. c. 30 et S.R.B.C. c. 37). C\u2019est cette l\u00e9gislation que les tribunaux \u00e9taient charg\u00e9s d\u2019appliquer, tant dans la cause de Jodoin v. Dufresne[17] que dans la cause de Hamel v. Panet (2)[18]. L\u2019on ne peut en tenir compte pour interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 1301 du code civil, en pr\u00e9sence de la d\u00e9claration des codificateurs que cet article est une modification, ou, si l\u2019on veut, une \u201cextension\u201d \u00e0 la loi ant\u00e9rieure, par laquelle ils adoptent la pr\u00e9somption admise dans la cause de Jodoin v. Dufresne17. Ils d\u00e9clarent vouloir \u201cassimiler\u201d les engagements que la femme contracte avec son mari aux engagements qu\u2019elle contracte directement pour lui. A partir de ce moment, il ne s\u2019agit plus d\u2019un simple jugement que l\u2019on peut continuer de discuter et que les tribunaux sup\u00e9rieurs peuvent infirmer. Le principe pos\u00e9 dans ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 dans la loi et il ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019appliquer.\nDans les circonstances, interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u201cavec\u201d dans l\u2019article 1301 C.C. comme ayant le m\u00eame sens que \u201cpour\u201d serait aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9claration des codificateurs dans leur rapport et contreviendrait \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019est jamais pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 parler pour ne rien dire, d\u2019o\u00f9 il faut conclure qu\u2019en ajoutant le mot \u201cavec\u201d au mot \u201cpour\u201d, ils ont voulu indiquer quelque chose de plus que \u201cpour\u201d le mari. C\u2019est ce qui fait dire aux Lords du Conseil Priv\u00e9 (Trust & Loan Co. v. Gauthier[19]):\nTheir Lordships cannot accede to the argument that the language used and deliberately adopted in the code must be narrowed and held to have no greater effect than the previous law for which it has been subtituted.\nUne discussion int\u00e9ressante s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9e parmi les commentateurs de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., ainsi que dans les arr\u00eats des tribunaux, sur la question de savoir si les mots \u201cavec son mari\u201d cr\u00e9aient une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure ou seulement une pr\u00e9somption juris tantum. Nous mentionnons la chose pour indiquer qu\u2019elle ne nous a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 et, incidemment, pour d\u00e9clarer que nous n\u2019entendons pas trancher le d\u00e9bat dans le pr\u00e9sent jugement, qui s\u2019appuie sur d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations.\nIl nous faut cependant \u00e9carter de ce d\u00e9bat l\u2019argument tir\u00e9 des nombreuses d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e, nonobstant le fait qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e avec son mari, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable, lorsque l\u2019obligation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e pour ses propres affaires ou, au moins, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en avait retir\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. (N.B. La plus notoire est celle de La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Jodoin[20], d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e.) Tous ces jugements peuvent s\u2019expliquer par le motif que ces cas ne tombent vraiment pas sous l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. Cet article d\u00e9fend \u00e0 la femme de \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d, et les codificateurs ne se sont pas expliqu\u00e9s sur le sens qu\u2019ils donnaient \u00e0 ce mot dans leur projet. Mais, d\u2019autre part, il r\u00e9sulte du passage de leur rapport que nous avons reproduit plus haut qu\u2019en employant le mot \u201cobliger\u201d, ils n\u2019ont pas entendu introduire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard une innovation dans le code. Ils ont soin de d\u00e9clarer que la seule \u201cextension \u00e0 la loi\u201d dans leur projet est l\u2019addition du mot \u201cavec\u201d aux mots \u201cpour son mari\u201d. Or, il est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019histoire de cette l\u00e9gislation, depuis le droit romain jusqu\u2019aux statuts ant\u00e9rieurs au code, de comprendre, par l\u2019expression \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., uniquement le cautionnement de la femme avec ou pour son mari.\nCette interpr\u00e9tation est maintenant fix\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence (Lebel v. Bradin, Cour du Banc du Roi[21]; Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8r es[22]; Banque Canadienne v. Carette[23]. Voir 4 Ed. VII, c. 42, qui d\u00e9clare que l\u2019article 1301 C.C. ne s\u2019est jamais appliqu\u00e9 aux achats, ventes ou \u00e9changes d\u2019immeubles, ni aux baux emphyth\u00e9otiques faits par la femme mari\u00e9e). Il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e pour ses propres affaires ou pour son propre compte, qu\u2019elle soit ou non commune avec son mari, n\u2019\u00e9tant jamais, \u00e0 proprement parler, un cautionnement de sa part, ne constitue pas un acte o\u00f9 elle \u201cs\u2019oblige\u201d au sens de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. et ne tombe pas sous le coup de cet article.\nLe principe que l\u2019engagement de la femme mari\u00e9e n\u2019est pas nul, bien qu\u2019elle se soit oblig\u00e9e avec son mari, s\u2019il appara\u00eet qu\u2019il a pour objet ses propres affaires, ou que la femme en a tir\u00e9 profit, est de jurisprudence constante. Cependant, pour les raisons que nous venons d\u2019en donner, ce principe ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une exception \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 C.C. introduite par les tribunaux. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t, dans chacun de ces cas, une constatation que l\u2019obligation n\u2019est pas un cautionnement et que, ne l\u2019\u00e9tant pas, elle n\u2019est pas couverte par l\u2019article du code.\nEn plus, il est tr\u00e8s important de se rappeler que l\u2019article 1302 du code civil suppose le cas o\u00f9 le mari \u201cs\u2019oblige pour les affaires propres de sa femme\u201d, et fournit donc un exemple d\u2019une obligation de la femme avec son mari, qui n\u2019est pas entach\u00e9e d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Comme nous le fait observer monsieur le juge Monk dans Mailhot v. Brunelle[24]:\nThere is nothing in the law which prevents a wife from borrowing money. The mere circumstance of the husband being jointly and severally bound with the wife does not indicate that there is any illegality in the transaction. The wife cannot become security for her husband, except as \u201ccommune en biens\u201d, but the husband may be jointly and severally bound with the wife where it is her debt.\nComme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9, cependant, il est arriv\u00e9 rarement que nos tribunaux aient eu \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019article 1301 C.C. d\u2019une fa\u00e7on aussi rigoureuse que dans le cas qui nous occupe. Nous avons repass\u00e9 attentivement tous les arr\u00eats sur lesquels le savant procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a attir\u00e9 notre attention, dans son factum et \u00e0 l\u2019argument, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions. Le motif de chacun de ces jugements est que l\u2019emprunt a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour les affaires du mari; l\u2019argent pr\u00eat\u00e9 a servi pour le mari ou, au moins, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que la femme a eu le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cet argent.\nPour ne citer que les deux arr\u00eats sur lesquels peut-\u00eatre le savant procureur a le plus insist\u00e9:\nDans la cause de Ledere v. Ouimet[25], l\u2019obligation d\u2019une femme mari\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019endossement \u201cpour aval\u201d d\u2019un billet promissoire fait conjointement avec son mari fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle. Le jugement fait voir\nque le billet en question repr\u00e9sentait la valeur de marchandises vendues et livr\u00e9es par les demandeurs au d\u00e9fendeur (i.e. le mari) Mo\u00efse-Arthur Ouimet seul.\nLe billet avait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour les affaires du mari. En plus, la femme avait endoss\u00e9 le billet, et le jugement d\u00e9clare que sa signature consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un endossement ordinaire\nse trouve avoir cautionn\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de son mari qui \u00e9tait l\u2019endossement la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant sur le billet; et que si, au contraire, cette signature ne doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e que comme un aval, la d\u00e9fenderesse se trouve avoir contract\u00e9 conjointement avec son mari une obligation qui ne concerne pas ses affaires \u00e0 elle.\nL\u2019autre cause est celle de Gagnon v. Boivin[26]. L\u2019action \u00e9tait en recouvrement du solde du prix de vente d\u2019un fonds de commerce constat\u00e9 par les billets \u00e0 ordre de la femme et diverses factures. Le motif du jugement est que la preuve a \u00e9tabli que les billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sans consid\u00e9ration pour elle-m\u00eame et uniquement pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de son mari. C\u2019est le mari seul qui faisait affaires; c\u2019est lui qui, en fait, \u00e9tait le v\u00e9ritable commer\u00e7ant; et la vente, bien que, en apparence, faite au mari et \u00e0 la femme, \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 lui seul.\nLe premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la pr\u00e9sente cause est que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est port\u00e9e caution avec son mari pour la dette d\u2019un tiers en une autre qualit\u00e9 que celle de commune en biens. De ce chef, la cause para\u00eet donc de prime abord \u00eatre r\u00e9gie par le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 dans l\u2019article 1301 du code civil (Lebel v. Bradin[27]).\nToutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait actionnaire de la compagnie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle elle a sign\u00e9 les actes de garantie. Les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 sa souscription aux actions de la compagnie ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 certains commentaires de la part du juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui indiqueraient qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est gu\u00e8re rendu compte de l\u2019op\u00e9ration dans laquelle elle s\u2019engageait lorsqu\u2019elle a consenti \u00e0 devenir actionnaire; mais elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre relev\u00e9e de sa souscription, et d\u2019ailleurs elle n\u2019aurait pu l\u2019obtenir dans un litige engag\u00e9 uniquement avec la Banque Canadienne Nationale. Elle doit donc \u00eatre tenue pour actionnaire; et il faut partir de l\u00e0 pour envisager la situation: l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est port\u00e9e caution des dettes d\u2019une compagnie dans laquelle elle \u00e9tait actionnaire.\nD\u2019autre part, la preuve ne laisse aucun doute sur le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a certainement tir\u00e9 aucun profit de l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle a contract\u00e9e.\nMais le mari de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait lui aussi actionnaire de la compagnie pour laquelle elle s\u2019est port\u00e9e caution. C\u2019\u00e9tait tout autant, et plus (si l\u2019on tient compte du nombre des actions), son affaire \u00e0 lui que son affaire \u00e0 elle. Il s\u2019ensuit que tout en s\u2019obligeant pour sa propre affaire elle s\u2019est en m\u00eame temps oblig\u00e9e pour son mari. C\u2019est l\u00e0, suivant nous, l\u2019un des cas o\u00f9 la fonction du mot \u201cavec\u201d dans l\u2019article 1301 C.C. entre en jeu et o\u00f9 son addition au mot \u201cpour\u201d rend l\u2019article s\u00fbrement applicable. La femme et le mari avaient des int\u00e9r\u00eats conjoints dans l\u2019affaire cautionn\u00e9e et l\u2019obligation que la femme a assum\u00e9e \u00e9tait donc \u00e0 la fois \u201cavec\u201d et \u201cpour\u201d son mari.\nLa cause qui nous para\u00eet se rapprocher davantage de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle est celle de Chapdelaine v. Vall\u00e9e[28]. L\u2019action \u00e9tait port\u00e9e conjointement contre deux d\u00e9fendeurs, mari et femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, sur un \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 en vertu duquel ils promettaient\nconjointement et solidairement payer la somme de $182 pour trois voitures achet\u00e9es dudit Andr\u00e9 Chapdelaine, pour notre usage commun.\nLa Cour de R\u00e9vision du district de Montr\u00e9al a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle l\u2019obligation comme \u00e9tant en contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nLa cons\u00e9quence de cette d\u00e9cision est que l\u2019obligation contract\u00e9e par la femme avec son mari est sans effet lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas uniquement pour sa propre affaire mais l\u2019est \u00e9galement pour le compte de son mari.\nC\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs la conclusion qu\u2019il est possible de tirer du jugement de cette cour dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin[29], o\u00f9 l\u2019argent pr\u00eat\u00e9 sur vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e; mais o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u201cqu\u2019une tr\u00e8s grande partie\u201d avait servi \u00e0 payer les dettes du mari. C\u2019est s\u00fbrement ce que dit Lord Lindley, en rendant le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Trust & Loan Company v. Gauthier[30], lorsque, \u00e0 la page 100, il s\u2019exprime comme suit: Except in dealing with their common property, she is not to bind herself with him, i.e. she is not to join him in any obligation which affects him.\nEt, plus loin, il se demande:\nWhat then is meant by \u201cfor him\u201d? Does it mean jointly with him, or as his surety and nothing more? or does it mean for him generally, i.e. in any way for his benefit?\nEt il donne la r\u00e9ponse suivante (p. 101):\nTheir Lordships gather from the decisions referred to in the argument and in the published commentaries on the Code Civil that the words \u201cfor her husband\u201d are now judicially held to mean generally in any way for his purposes as distinguished from those of his wife; and that ignorance on the part of her obligee (cr\u00e9ancier) cannot avail him if it is proved that she in fact bound herself for her husband. These conclusions are in their Lordships\u2019 opinion sound and in accordance with the language of art. 1301 and with its evident object.\nNotre conclusion est que, dans cette cause-ci, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont eu raison de consid\u00e9rer les actes de garantie consentis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme entach\u00e9s de la nullit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nIl reste toutefois \u00e0 discuter la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de bonne foi et que, comme telle, ses droits sont sauvegard\u00e9s par l\u2019article.\nDans la cause de Lederc v. B\u00e9dard[31], la Cour de R\u00e9vision \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec (Dorion J.) s\u2019est demand\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait la port\u00e9e de cet amendement. Elle fait remarquer avec justesse qu\u2019il\nne peut pas \u00eatre question de bonne foi lorsque le contrat prend la forme d\u2019un cautionnement par la femme de l\u2019obligation du mari. C\u2019est l\u00e0 ce qui est express\u00e9ment prohib\u00e9 par la loi.\nLorsque l\u2019obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e avec le mari, l\u2019amendement vient certainement confirmer le droit du cr\u00e9ancier de prouver que la femme s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e pour sa propre affaire. Mais ce droit avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu au cr\u00e9ancier par la jurisprudence.\nIl reste le cas o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e s\u2019oblige seule avec l\u2019autorisation de son mari. Les tribunaux ont toujours annul\u00e9 cette obligation lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 leur satisfaction que, nonobstant ses termes apparents, l\u2019obligation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9e par la femme, suivant l\u2019expression du Conseil Priv\u00e9 \u201cin any way for her husband\u2019s purposes\u201d. Mais le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans lequel cette expression se rencontre (Trust & Loan v. Gauthier)[32] ajoutait : Ignorance on the part of the lender that the money was borrowed for the husband\u2019s purposes is of no avail, and the burden is on him to prove that it was not so borrowed.\nLedere v. B\u00e9dard[33] a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019amendement de la loi 4 E. VII c. 42, s. 1 fait na\u00eetre la pr\u00e9somption que le pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e seule, quoique autoris\u00e9e de son mari, lui a profit\u00e9 \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame. Par suite, si elle invoque la nullit\u00e9 de son obligation pour violation de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., c\u2019est sur elle que tombe le fardeau de la preuve que le pr\u00eat a profit\u00e9 \u00e0 son mari \u00e0 la connaissance du pr\u00eateur.\nA son tour, la Cour de R\u00e9vision, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans la cause de Laberge v. Vezeau[34], consid\u00e8re que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la bonne foi, dont parle l\u2019amendement, peuvent consister dans le paiement fait par le cr\u00e9ancier directement \u00e0 la femme elle-m\u00eame et dans l\u2019ignorance du pr\u00eateur que l\u2019argent avanc\u00e9 par lui est pour l\u2019avantage du mari. Dans ce cas, il y a pr\u00e9somption que le pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 la femme seule, s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens et autoris\u00e9e par son mari, n\u2019a profit\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 elle-m\u00eame; et la femme qui invoque la nullit\u00e9 de son obligation pour violation de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. doit prouver que le pr\u00eat a profit\u00e9 \u00e0 son mari \u00e0 la connaissance du pr\u00eateur.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Lebel v. Bradin[35], dont nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9, contient une \u00e9tude tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te de toutes les questions qui se soul\u00e8vent en vertu de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. et de l\u2019amendement de 1904. Sa conclusion est que, sous l\u2019effet de cet amendement, le cr\u00e9ancier qui pr\u00eate \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens seule, pour \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9 de bonne foi, doit verser le produit de l\u2019emprunt \u00e0 la femme elle-m\u00eame, et il doit ignorer et n\u2019avoir aucune raison de croire que cet argent pourra servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats du mari. Le cr\u00e9ancier, dans ce cas, n\u2019est pas responsable si subs\u00e9quemment la femme remet les fonds emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 son mari; car depuis l\u2019amendement il n\u2019est plus tenu de surveiller l\u2019emploi des deniers provenant du pr\u00eat qu\u2019il lui a fait.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de dire que les d\u00e9finitions que nous venons de rapporter \u00e9puisent tous les cas o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier pourra, en vertu de l\u2019amendement, \u00e9tablir une bonne foi suffisante pour sauvegarder ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nullit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1301 C.C. Mais \u00e0 la suite de ces d\u00e9finitions, l\u2019on doit s\u00fbrement d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre question de bonne foi dans le cas d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e express\u00e9ment par la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e pour son mari. Dans le cas d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e par la femme mari\u00e9e seule, soit express\u00e9ment soit apparemment pour elle-m\u00eame, les droits du cr\u00e9ancier seront sauvegard\u00e9s m\u00eame si l\u2019argent est subs\u00e9quemment employ\u00e9 pour les fins du mari, lorsque les circonstances \u00e9tabliront les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de bonne foi indiqu\u00e9s par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Lebel v. Bradin[36].\nDans le cas o\u00f9 la femme s\u2019oblige avec son mari, l\u2019amendement permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir la bonne foi du cr\u00e9ancier. Mais la loi pr\u00e9sume contre lui; et c\u2019est donc \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il incombe de la prouver.\nNous ne trouvons pas, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la rencontre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019appelante peut invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019amendement. D\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 furent sign\u00e9s les deux actes de garantie, elle connaissait toutes les circonstances qui entra\u00eenent la nullit\u00e9 de ces actes: le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019un des co-signataires et le fait que son mari \u00e9tait actionnaire dans la compagnie pour laquelle elle se portait caution. Par suite, il est impossible de dire que l\u2019appelante a contract\u00e9 de bonne foi. Il s\u2019agit, bien entendu, de la bonne foi au sens l\u00e9gal et suivant le texte de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nNous concluons donc que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: G\u00e9rin-Lajoie & Beaupr\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pr\u00e9vost, Taschereau & Bresse.\n[1] (1930) Q.R. 49 K.B. 67.\n[2] (1930) Q.R. 49 K.B. 67, at 68.\n[3] (1914) Q.R. 46 C.S. 511.\n[4] (1929) Q.R. 48 K.B. 572.\n[5] (1930) Q.R. 49 K.B. 67.\n[6] S. 27. 1. 56.\n[7] D.P. 58. 1. 104.\n[8] D.P. 1873. 1. 438.\n[9] D.P. 1879. 1. 158.\n[10] S. 1885 1. 61.\n[11] S. 78. 1. 341; S. 79. 1. 252.\n[12] S. 27. 1. 56.\n[13] [1895] A.C. 612.\n[14] [1904] A.C. 94.\n[15] (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n15 (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n[16] (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n16 (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n16 (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n17 (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n[17] (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n[18] (1876) 3 Q.L.R. 173.\n17 (1853) 3 L.C.R. 189.\n[19] (1904) A.C., at 101.\n[20] [1895] A.C. 612.\n[21] (1913) 19 R.L.N.S. 16.\n[22] [1927] Can.

If the heirs or legal representatives against whom it is set up do not \u201cdeclare under oath that they do not know\u201d the writing or signature of the testator, the will must be presumed to be acknowledged. Such a presumption is juris tantum and the burden of proving that the writing or the signature was forged is then upon the party repudiating the will.\nDugas v.

Le demandeur a produit comme exhibit un inventaire, en date du 27 ao\u00fbt 1903, d\u00e9montrant que la valeur de la succession \u00e9tait de $8,437.05. Par son action, l\u2019appelant r\u00e9clame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de 174\/672 de ces biens, sujet \u00e0 l\u2019usufruit et jouissance pendant la vie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Je doute que la valeur des biens r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant soit de $2,000; mais vu qu\u2019il demande par son action l\u2019annulation du testament olographe qui a institu\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur l\u00e9gataire universel de toute la succession, je crois qu\u2019il vaut mieux pour cette cour, vu que la question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans la cause et que les parties de consentement sont devant nous, accepter sa juridiction en la mati\u00e8re.\nLe testament attaqu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 par un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, district de Montr\u00e9al, le 20 ao\u00fbt 1903, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, appuy\u00e9 par l\u2019affidavit de Louis-Barth\u00e9l\u00e9mi Houle, notaire de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, qui a jur\u00e9 devant le d\u00e9put\u00e9 protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,\nque le testament olographe de dame Cordelia Dorais, \u00e9pouse de monsieur Stephen Vall\u00e9e, employ\u00e9 civil de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9 de la main de la testatrice, qu\u2019il connaissait sa signature et son \u00e9criture, l\u2019ayant vue \u00e9crire et signer en plusieurs circonstances; que la signature Cordelia Dorais est la signature personnelle de ladite testatrice.\nL\u2019original de cette preuve et v\u00e9rification, avec l\u2019affidavit du notaire Houle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate comme exhibit du demandeur appelant.\nL\u2019article 857 C.C. d\u00e9clare que le testament olographe, apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a son effet jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9; et l\u2019article 858 C.C. ajoute que la v\u00e9rification ainsi faite du testament n\u2019en emp\u00eache pas la contestation par ceux qui y ont int\u00e9r\u00eat. Les termes de ce dernier article semblent permettre, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s un intervalle aussi long que celui qu\u2019on a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler en cette cause, de 1903 \u00e0 1927, de contester le testament apr\u00e8s que les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 sa confection, ou l\u2019ayant prouv\u00e9 lors de la v\u00e9rification, sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s. A moins d\u2019une plus courte prescription, il semble que l\u2019action en contestation est ouverte pendant trente ans. Apr\u00e8s ce laps de temps, le document devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ancien; et d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles de la preuve, en Angleterre du moins, il ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en prouver l\u2019\u00e9criture et la signature. Phipson On Evidence, 3rd Ed., p. 467. Langelier, De la preuve, n\u00b0 285.\nIl se peut cependant qu\u2019un l\u00e9gataire en vertu d\u2019un testament olographe, ou d\u2019un testament fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d\u2019Angleterre, et qui, depuis la date de la v\u00e9rification est en possession de fait des biens qui forment l\u2019objet de son legs (comme c\u2019est la cas ici), soit \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019une action en revendication, quant aux meubles, par la prescription de trois ans (art. 2258 C.C.), et, quant aux immeubles, par la prescription de dix ans (art. 2251 C.C.).\nDans la cause de Dugas v. Amiot[1], notre coll\u00e8gue, monsieur le juge Rinfret, parlant au nom de la cour, fut amen\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner la port\u00e9e des articles 857 et 858 du code civil, et exposa les arguments que pouvaient invoquer les h\u00e9ritiers \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pr\u00e9somption en faveur d\u2019un testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, alors que la loi n\u2019exige m\u00eame pas \u201cque l\u2019h\u00e9ritier du d\u00e9funt soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification\u201d et que cette derni\u00e8re a pu avoir lieu hors de sa connaissance.\nMais une contestation, institu\u00e9e comme la pr\u00e9sente, plus de vingt-quatre ans apr\u00e8s le jugement de v\u00e9rification, montre le danger de la situation et la difficult\u00e9 dans laquelle peut se trouver le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, alors que les \u201ct\u00e9moins comp\u00e9tents \u00e0 rendre t\u00e9moignage\u201d, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ceux qui ont connu le testateur et qui \u00e9taient familiers avec son \u00e9criture et sa signature, sont morts, disparus, ou ont perdu la m\u00e9moire des faits.\nPour d\u00e9cider la cause de Dugas v. Amiot1, la cour n\u2019a pas eu \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir sur qui, de l\u2019h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gal ou du l\u00e9gataire en vertu d\u2019un testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, retombe le fardeau de la preuve de l\u2019\u00e9criture ou de la signature du testateur. Dans cette esp\u00e8ce, la v\u00e9rification du codicille, dont il s\u2019agissait, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue au moyen d\u2019un affidavit dont la fausset\u00e9 \u00e9tait reconnue. La v\u00e9rification fut mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, les parties se trouv\u00e8rent au m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient auparavant. Le jugement fut donc que la partie qui avait invoqu\u00e9 le testament olographe avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019en prouver l\u2019\u00e9criture et la signature; et, comme la cour fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle n\u2019y avait pas r\u00e9ussi, elle fut d\u00e9bout\u00e9e des fins de son action.\nDans la cause actuelle, la situation est diff\u00e9rente; et nul ne pr\u00e9tend ici que le jugement de v\u00e9rification qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu puisse \u00eatre r\u00e9tract\u00e9 pour une des causes qui, \u201cen mati\u00e8re ordinaire, feraient accueillir une requ\u00eate civile\u201d. Ce fut l\u2019existence d\u2019une de ces causes qui, dans Dugas v. Amio)[2] fit r\u00e9voquer la v\u00e9rification. Ici la v\u00e9rification subsiste et, comme la cour le disait dans cette autre cause, elle peut \u201cconstituer une preuve provisoire\u201d ou prima facie. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 857 du code civil, elle fait \u201cdonner effet au testament jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9 sur contestation et il s\u2019ensuit que si aucune preuve quelconque n\u2019\u00e9tait faite, le testament serait tenu pour valide et conserverait tout son effet.\nNous pourrions dire en plus que nous sommes tout de m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un document sous seing priv\u00e9 auquel s\u2019appliquent les articles 1222 et 1223 C.C:\n1222. Les \u00e9critures priv\u00e9es reconnues par celui \u00e0 qui on les oppose, ou l\u00e9galement tenues pour reconnues ou prouv\u00e9es, font preuve entre ceux qui y sont parties, et entre leurs h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, de m\u00eame que des actes authentiques.\n1223. Si la personne \u00e0 laquelle on oppose un \u00e9crit d\u2019une nature priv\u00e9e ne d\u00e9savoue pas formellement son \u00e9criture ou sa signature, en la mani\u00e8re r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le code de proc\u00e9dure civile, cet \u00e9crit est tenu pour reconnu. Ses h\u00e9ritiers ou repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux sont oblig\u00e9s seulement de d\u00e9clarer sous serment qu\u2019ils ne connaissent pas son \u00e9criture ou sa signature.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, le demandeur n\u2019a pas jur\u00e9 ne pas conna\u00eetre l\u2019\u00e9criture et la signature de Cordelia Dorais; et, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins de preuve contraire, le testament, en vertu des articles ci-dessus, doit\nl\u00e9galement \u00eatre tenu pour reconnu et prouv\u00e9 et faire preuve de m\u00eame qu\u2019un acte authentique.\nCeci n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas une pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure en faveur du l\u00e9gataire, mais juris tantum. Comme le disait Sir Hippolyte LaFontaine, pour la Cour du Banc de la Reine re Brown v. Dow[3],\nLes pr\u00e9somptions juris font la m\u00eame foi qu\u2019une preuve, et elles dispensent la partie en faveur de qui elles militent d\u2019en faire aucune, pour fonder sa d\u00e9fense ou ses d\u00e9fenses; mais, et c\u2019est en cela qu\u2019elles diff\u00e8rent des pr\u00e9somptions juris et de jure, elles n\u2019excluent pas la partie contre qui elles militent \u00e0 faire la preuve du contraire, et si cette partie vient \u00e0 bout de la faire, elle d\u00e9truira la pr\u00e9somption.\nLe demandeur en cette cause semble l\u2019avoir compris et a assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la preuve. Il ne s\u2019est pas content\u00e9 de prouver sa vocation \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 comme h\u00e9ritier ab intestat de son fils, qui \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame l\u2019un des h\u00e9ritiers ab intestat de sa grand\u2019m\u00e8re d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e; mais il a voulu, par des experts et par des comparaisons d\u2019\u00e9critures, d\u00e9montrer que le testament olographe n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de l\u2019\u00e9criture et ne portait pas la signature de Cord\u00e9lia Dorais. Certains experts ont m\u00eame jur\u00e9 que, dans leur opinion, la comparaison du testament avec certains \u00e9crits du d\u00e9fendeur Vall\u00e9e d\u00e9montrait que ce dernier avait forg\u00e9 le testament et la signature de sa femme. Cette preuve allait plus loin que les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de Taction qui se contentait de nier l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 du testament. Vall\u00e9e et son procureur ont \u00e9videmment cru qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas, quant \u00e0 eux, \u00e0 prouver l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 du document; et Vall\u00e9e, mis dans la bo\u00eete, s\u2019est content\u00e9 de jurer positivement que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas lui qui avait \u00e9crit ce testament. Il faut noter cependant qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0, dans son examen \u201con discovery\u201d, cit\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s, jur\u00e9 que le testament \u00e9tait de l\u2019\u00e9criture appliqu\u00e9e de la d\u00e9funte.\nL\u2019un des t\u00e9moins de la demande, dame Ad\u00e9line Dorais, s\u0153ur de Cord\u00e9lia Dorais, la testatrice, semble avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, comme celle de sa s\u0153ur, la signature et la fa\u00e7on dont elle faisait certaines lettres. Mais son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas satisfaisant quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture courante de la d\u00e9funte, ce qui n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant, d\u2019ailleurs, lorsqu\u2019on l\u2019interroge \u00e0 ce sujet vingt-quatre ans apr\u00e8s la mort de sa s\u0153ur.\nNous avons dans cette affaire, de part et d\u2019autre, des opinions d\u2019experts qui, de bonne foi, se contredisent. Sauf le t\u00e9moin Ad\u00e9line Dorais, que je viens de mentionner, et l\u2019affirmation du demandeur dans son examen pr\u00e9alable, nous n\u2019avons personne qui jure positivement conna\u00eetre l\u2019\u00e9criture de la d\u00e9funte ou l\u2019avoir vu \u00e9crire et signer son testament. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, nous avons, militant en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance:\n1o Le d\u00e9faut d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Au point de vue pratique, Vall\u00e9e n\u2019aurait gagn\u00e9 rien en forgeant ce document, sauf la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens de sa femme dont cette derni\u00e8re lui avait donn\u00e9 l\u2019usufruit sa vie durant par leur contrat de mariage;\n2\u00b0 Il semble peu probable qu\u2019il aurait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9sh\u00e9riter son petit-fils Mendoza pour lequel, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la lettre exhibit P-3, il semble avoir une grande affection en cette ann\u00e9e 1903.\nPour ma part, je partage l\u2019opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a vu et entendu ces t\u00e9moins et qui semble expliquer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante pourquoi l\u2019\u00e9criture du testament est plus redress\u00e9e et plus appliqu\u00e9e que l\u2019\u00e9criture courante de pr\u00e9tendues lettres famili\u00e8res de la testatrice produites comme exhibits.\nD\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019y a pas de preuve que ces documents, base de la comparaison, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crits par la d\u00e9funte. On a eu recours au t\u00e9moignage de Vall\u00e9e on discovery:\nQ. Voulez-vous prendre connaissance de cette autre lettre et nous dire si vous reconnaissez l\u00e0 r\u00e9criture de votre femme?\u2014R. Je ne reconnais pas cette \u00e9criture-l\u00e0.\nQ. Connaissez-vous r\u00e9criture de Madame Vall\u00e9e, votre femme?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Pr\u00e9tendez-vous que ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019\u00e9criture de Madame Vall\u00e9e, cela?\u2014R. Bien, je ne puis pas dire exactement, mais ce n\u2019est pas son \u00e9criture appliqu\u00e9e.\nQ. Est-ce que ce serait son \u00e9criture pas appliqu\u00e9e?\u2014R. Je ne le sais pas, je n\u2019ai jamais eu ses lettres, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que j\u2019en vois.\nQ. C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que vous voyez des lettres de Madame Vall\u00e9e?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que vous voyez son \u00e9criture?\u2014R. Sur des lettres.\nQ. Vous savez \u00e0 qui est adress\u00e9e cette lettre-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Oui, je vois qu\u2019elle est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 ma fille.\nQ. Vous voyez les initiales \u00e0 la fin?\u2014R. Oui, je vois bien cela.\nQ. Ce sont ses initiales?\u2014R. Si c\u2019est son \u00e9criture, c\u2019est son \u00e9criture pas appliqu\u00e9e, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9criture courante. Je ne reconnais pas son \u00e9criture appliqu\u00e9e, elle \u00e9crivait mieux que cela.\n(Me St-Germain, C.R.: Je produis cette lettre comme pi\u00e8ce P-5. C\u2019est une lettre en date du 3 octobre mil neuf cent deux (1902), adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Madame Billette.)\nQ. Voulez-vous prendre connaissance de cette autre lettre, encore adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Madame Billette, et nous dire si cette \u00e9criture-l\u00e0 est l\u2019\u00e9criture de Madame Vall\u00e9e en date du trente (30) novembre mil neuf cent deux (1902)?\u2014R. Si c\u2019est son \u00e9criture, c\u2019est son \u00e9criture n\u00e9glig\u00e9e.\nQ. Voyez-vous une diff\u00e9rence entre la premi\u00e8re lettre que je vous ai exhib\u00e9e et l\u2019autre du mois de novembre?\u2014R. Celle du mois de novembre, le trente, est mieux \u00e9crite.\nQ. Est-ce que vous reconnaissez plus l\u2019\u00e9criture de votre femme sur la seconde que sur la premi\u00e8re?\u2014R. Je la connais un peu plus, mais ce n\u2019est pas son \u00e9criture ordinaire.\nQ. Vous reconnaissez plus son \u00e9criture sur la seconde lettre?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. Mais ce n\u2019est pas son \u00e9criture ordinaire?\u2014R. Non. Quand elle avait son \u00e9criture appliqu\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait bien fait.\nQ. En avez-vous de son \u00e9criture appliqu\u00e9e?\u2014R. J\u2019ai son testament, si vous voulez le voir.\nQ. Vous ne l\u2019avez pas ici?\u2014R. J\u2019ai une copie que j\u2019ai fait faire du testament.\n(Me St-Germain, C.R.: Je produis comme pi\u00e8ce P-6 une lettre du trente (30) novembre mil neuf cent deux (1902), adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Billette, \u00e0 Valleyfield.)\nQ. Voulez-vous prendre connaissance d\u2019une autre lettre encore adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Madame Billette\u2014elle est \u00e0 la mine, celle-l\u00e0\u2014lettre en date du seize (16) octobre?\u2014R. Je ne la reconnais plus celle-l\u00e0.\nQ. Vous voyez toujours ses initiales, l\u00e0, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u2014R. Oui. Q. Ce sont bien ses initiales, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u2014R. Oui, c\u2019est C.S.V., mais je ne la reconnais pas pour sa vraie \u00e9criture, je ne connais pas du tout son \u00e9criture l\u00e0-dessus.\nQ. A part de son testament, avez-vous en votre possession des lettres qui vous permettraient de reconna\u00eetre son \u00e9criture?\u2014R. Quand le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9, j\u2019\u00e9tais accompagn\u00e9 du notaire Houle * * *\nQ. Ce n\u2019est pas la question que je pose. Je vous demande si \u00e0 part de son testament vous avez en votre possession de son \u00e9criture?\u2014R. Non.\nQ. Vous n\u2019en avez pas?\u2014R. Non.\nQ. Vous n\u2019avez absolument aucun document?\u2014R. J\u2019avais un livre dans lequel \u00e9taient ses comptes et je pense que ce livre-l\u00e0 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison, quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9, ou qu\u2019il est chez le notaire Houl\u00e9.\n(Me St-Germain, C.R.: Je produis comme pi\u00e8ce P-7 une lettre en date du seize (16) octobre.)\nQ. Voulez-vous prendre connaissance de ce manuscrit, qui est une pri\u00e8re, et voulez-vous dire si vous reconnaissez cette \u00e9criture-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Ce n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose du tout.\nQ. Celle-l\u00e0, vous ne la reconnaissez pas comme l\u2019\u00e9criture de madame Vall\u00e9e?\u2014R. Non, du tout.\nQ. Savez-vous de qui est cette \u00e9criture?\u2014R. Je ne le sais pas.\nQ. Mais sur cet \u00e9crit-l\u00e0, vous n\u2019avez aucun doute que ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019\u00e9criture de madame Vall\u00e9e?\u2014R. Je n\u2019ai aucun doute.\n(Me St-Germain, C.R.: Je produis comme pi\u00e8ce P-8 ce manuscrit.)\nLe demandeur se contente de dire qu\u2019il a trouv\u00e9 ces lettres dans une bo\u00eete dans laquelle on gardait des papiers de famille.\nJe ne crois pas que le demandeur ait fait une preuve suffisante pour nous permettre de changer l\u2019\u00e9tat de choses qu\u2019il a laiss\u00e9 subsister du vivant de son fils. Le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sur l\u2019affidavit d\u2019un homme de profession maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, qui a jur\u00e9 positivement bien conna\u00eetre r\u00e9criture et la signature de Cordelia Dorais, et que l\u2019\u00e9criture et la signature sur le document aujourd\u2019hui attaqu\u00e9 \u00e9taient bien celles de la d\u00e9funte \u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur. Cet affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit par le demandeur et nous pouvons en prendre connaissance pour ce qu\u2019il peut valoir, bien qu\u2019il ne fasse pas partie de la preuve en cette cause.\nJe crois que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a tr\u00e8s bien expos\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles il a conclu au renvoi de l\u2019action. Les experts donnent des opinions; mais la cour, avec l\u2019aide de leur t\u00e9moignage, doit pour maintenir l\u2019action arriver \u00e0 une certitude morale en faveur de la demande: pour la rejeter il suffit qu\u2019elle reste dans le doute. Le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est que la comparaison des \u00e9critures, les circonstances de la cause, le laps de temps que l\u2019on a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 s\u2019assurer de la disparition des t\u00e9moins qui auraient pu identifier la signature et r\u00e9criture laissent dans l\u2019esprit un doute suffisant pour conclure raisonnablement que le demandeur n\u2019a pas d\u2019une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante \u00e9tabli ce qu\u2019il avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 de prouver, savoir, que le testament en question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit, ni sign\u00e9 par Cordelia Dorais, et que la preuve en cette cause doive pr\u00e9valoir sur le jugement de v\u00e9rification d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur.\nDans ces conditions, je suis d\u2019avis de renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain & St. Germain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Vall\u00e9e & Perron.\n[1] [1929] Can.

Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, [1931] S.C.R. 321\nDate: 1930-12-23\nSociety Brand Clothes Ltd Appellant; (Plaintiff)\nand\nAmalgamated Clothing Workers of America and Others Respondents.\n1930: October 22, 23, December 23.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nLabour union\u2014Unincorporated association\u2014Legal entity\u2014Whether suable\u2014Point raised at trial\u2014Law of foreign country\u2014Arts. 79, 176 C.C.P.\nThe respondent, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, having its principal place of business in the city of New York, was described in the proceedings as \u201can unincorporated association\u201d; the other respondents were also described as unincorporated bodies having their head offices and principal place of business in the city of Montreal. They filed an appearance by counsel and pleaded to the merits of an action in damages. At the trial, counsel for the respondents raised orally for the first time the point that, not being legal entities, they were not suable.\nHeld that the respondents could not be legally sued.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Newcombe, Rinfret and Cannon JJ.\u2014An unincorporated labour union has no legal existence and cannot be considered in law an entity distinct from its individual members and is not suable in the common name.\nPer Duff and Rinfet JJ.\u2014The question whether the respondent, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, is or is not a \u201cperson\u201d in the judicial sense, i.e., whether or not the members of the collectivity described as such constitute a judicial person distinct from the personality of the individuals, is a question to be decided by the law of New York; and, according to that law, the above unincorporated labour union is not a judicial person in the pertinent sense.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe and Cannon JJ.\u2014There is nothing in the record to show that the respondents are \u201cforeign corporations or persons duly authorized to appear in judicial proceedings under any foreign law.\u201d (Art. 79 C.C.P.).\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret and Cannon JJ.\u2014The point that a defendant is not a suable legal entity can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. Art. 176 C.C.P. does not apply to the incapacity of a defendant where it appears throughout on the face of the proceedings. The courts should proprio motu take notice that an aggregate voluntary body, though having a name, cannot appear in court as a corporation, when in reality not incorporated.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014This case is distinguishable from the case of Payette v. United Brotherhood of Maintenance of the Way Employees (25 Q.P.R. 78).\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 48 K.B. 14) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, P. Cousineau J.[2], and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action in damages and quashing an interlocutory injunction against respondents.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. Weinfield K.C. for the appellant.\nP. Bercovitch K.C. and J. Spector for the respondents.\nThe judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe and Cannon JJ. (Rinfret J. concurring but writing separately) were delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The defendants were sued for damages and an injunction under the following designation:\nAmalgamated Clothing Workers of America, an unincorporated association, having its head office and principal place of business for the province of Quebec in the city and district of Montreal, and all the local branches of the said Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America existing in the city and district of Montreal, and the \u201cMontreal Joint Board\u201d of the said Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, an unincorporated subsidiary association of the said Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, having its head office and principal place of business in the city and district of Montreal. The trial judge and a majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissed the action against these defendants on the ground that, being unincorporated and not possessing any civil personality, they could neither legally be constituted defendants, nor be sued.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously allowed the appeal, however, and maintained the action against some additional individual respondents, who were condemned to pay to the plaintiff appellant the sum of $6,286.02; and also upheld and declared absolute and permanent as against them the interim injunction which had been granted pending the trial. Mr. Justice Rivard and Mr. Justice Hall, dissenting, would likewise have maintained the appeal against the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and would have included them in the foregoing condemnation. Rivard J., in his opinion, seems to go further than the formal judgment and would also hold responsible the \u201cMontreal Joint Board,\u201d the other respondent.\nThe individual defendants did not appeal from this condemnation; and, so far as they are concerned, the judgment is final and binding on both parties.\nThe plaintiff, however, has come before this court seeking judgment against the two unincorporated bodies, and the only question before us is whether or not an unincorated labour union may be considered in law an entity distinct from its individual members, suable in the common name and liable to damages recoverable out of the common fund; or, in other words, does legal theory conform to industrial reality and subject an unincorporated collectivity to responsibility for its tortious acts?\nWe cannot add much that would be useful to the remarks of the learned trial judge and to the opinion of Mr. Justice Bond in the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The respondents are not sued as a corporation, or partnership or as entities having legal existences distinct from that of their individual members, but as \u201cunincorporated associations.\u201d An attempt was made, however, to show that because in the state of New York, where the first named respondent has its principal establishment, an unincorporated association can be sued through its president or its treasurer, under art. 79 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, that association may be sued and brought before the courts of that province. In the State of New York, there is the following statutory provision:\nAction of Proceeding against Unincorporated Associations\nAn action or special proceeding may be maintained, against the president or treasurer of such an association, to recover any property, or upon any cause of action, for or upon which the plaintiff may maintain such an action or special proceeding, against all the associates, by reason of their interest or ownership therein, either jointly or in common of their liability therefor, either jointly or severally. Any partnership, or other company of persons, which has a president or treasurer, is deemed an association within the meaning of this section.\nOn this point we share the views of Mr. Justice Bond, who says:\nIt is to be observed, however, from a reading of this section, that while headed as an action against an unincorporated association, the text indicates that the action which is contemplated, and may be maintained is one against the president or treasurer of such association in a representative capacity as representing all the individual members, and moreover, is applicable only to certain restricted oases, for or upon which the plaintiff may maintain such an action or special proceeding against all the associates by reason of their interest or ownership, or their liability jointly or in common. The law in question does not purport to incorporate such an association, nor does it appear to recognize such an association, except in so far as it authorizes action against the president or the treasurer under certain particular circumstances, and in the event of a judgment being obtained, the same may be satisfied out of any personal or real property belonging to the association or owned jointly or in common by all the members thereof. (Section 15). In other words, this law appears to create or authorize what, in other jurisdictions, are frequently termed \u201crepresentative\u201d or \u201cclass\u201d actions. The organization itself is not authorized to appear in judicial proceedings.\nIn this instance, the writ was not issued against either the president or the treasurer, and nothing shows that the defendants now before the court are, to use the terms of 79 C.C.P., \u201cforeign corporations or persons duly authorized under any foreign law.\u201d\nBut it is claimed that the respondents could not raise this point orally at the trial, because they had not, either by way of preliminary motion or by their plea to the merits, alleged that they are not an entity known to the law and capable of appearing in court proceedings.\nOur present Chief Justice, in Local Union No. 1562, United Mine Workers of America et al v. Williams et al[3], said, at page 257:\nWhile I should have thought it better, had the defence in addition to the bare denial of incorporation contained a plea that the Local Union is not registered, is not a partnership, and, as an entity not known to the law, cannot be sued by its adopted name, (R. 93), I incline to think this issue was sufficiently raised by the explicit traverse of the allegation that the Local Union is a body corporate. But, if not, the objection of suing the Local Union being its non-existence as an entity known to the law, I confess my inability to understand how any conduct of those representing that body, such as that here relied on, can create an estoppel which would justify the granting of a judgment against it. A judgment should not wittingly be entered against a non-entity.\nBrodeur J., concurred with Anglin J., as did also Duff J., who said (at p. 246):\nIn order to prevent misconception, I ought to state * * * that this is not, in my judgment, a proper case for amendment, and, moreover, that in disposing of the appeal, we are bound to give effect to the contention that the Union is not a suable entity.\nMignault J., dissented, dubitante, and Idington J., also dissented.\nThis question is referred to, in his opinion, by Mr. Justice Rivard, as follows:\nDans de telles conditions, pourrait-on pr\u00eater aux unions non incorpor\u00e9es une sorte de quasi-personnalit\u00e9 civile qui les rende aptes au moins \u00e0 \u00eatre poursuivies? (Cf. United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co[4], C. Supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis, 5 juin 1922; D.P. 22-2-153, et note de M. Edouard Lambert.) Pareille solution ne contredirait ni notre d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire de Rother[5], ni celles de l\u2019honorable Juge Charbon-neau dans Coumoyer v. La Fraternit\u00e9 unie des charpentiers et. menuisiers d\u2019Am\u00e9rique[6] et l\u2019honorable juge Rinfret dans Payette v. The United Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees and Railway Shop Laborers (C.S. Montr\u00e9al 3 f\u00e9vrier 1923)[7]; mais il serait contraire aux principes de l\u2019adopter comme r\u00e8gle absolue.\nJe ne crois pas cependant qu\u2019il soit plus n\u00e9cessaire de prononcer l\u00e0 dessus qu\u2019il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait dans ces causes.\nDans la cause des United Mine Workers of America v. Williams, jug\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada[8], \u201cthe issue of want of legal entity was sufficiently raised by the explicit denial of the allegation that the local union was a body corporate.\u201d\nDans notre esp\u00e8ce, ce moyen de contestation est-il soulev\u00e9? L\u2019est-il en la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il faut dans notre syst\u00e8me de proc\u00e9dure? Je ne le crois pas.\nLes deux associations ou unions sont bien d\u00e9crites, dans les brefs de sommation, comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas incorpor\u00e9es; mais elles n\u2019ont pas m\u00eame pris acte de cette particularit\u00e9 dans leur description par les demanderesses, et, dans leurs plaidoyere, elles se sont bien gard\u00e9es d\u2019y faire la moindre allusion. Elles n\u2019en ont donc tir\u00e9 aucun moyen de d\u00e9fense quelconque. Loin de soulever l\u2019objection par exception, elles ne l\u2019ont pas m\u00eame ins\u00e9r\u00e9e ou fait pressentir dans leurs plaidoyers au fonds. En somme, elles ont acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 la citation en justice qu\u2019on leur a faite, elles l\u2019ont accept\u00e9e telle qu\u2019elle. Elles n\u2019ont pas comparu pour dire qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient ill\u00e9galement amen\u00e9es devant le tribunal; au contraire, prenant avantage de l\u2019invitation que leur faisaient les demanderesses \u00e0 ester en justice, elles ont pr\u00e9tendu faire rejeter les actions au m\u00e9rite. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en dernier ressort et en plaidant oralement devant la cour qu\u2019elles proposent ce moyen. Il est trop tard.\nWith respect, we cannot agree with this contention; and we feel that Article 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure which says that\nIrregularities in the writ or service or in the declaration are waived by the appearance of the defendant and his failure to take advantage of them within the delays prescribed.\ncannot apply to incapacity of a defendant where it appears throughout on the face of the proceedings, and we feel inclined to accept the view that a court should proprio motu take notice that an aggregate voluntary body, though having a name, cannot appear in court as a corporation, when in reality not incorporated.\nMoreover, the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Coronado case[9], although discussed by the parties and in the judgments a quo, was not mentioned in the evidence given by the two experts called by the parties to prove, as a fact, the foreign law. These two New York lawyers did not refer to it as part of the law of the state of New York which was in issue between the parties, probably because this judgment does not apply to, and does not bind the state courts or govern their practice.\nNor can the defendants be deemed quasi-corporations under the provisions of the Professional Syndicate Act of Quebec, 14 Geo. V, c. 112, now c. 255, R.S.Q. (1925), which they have not carried out; neither have they availed themselves of c. 125 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1906), (now c 202 R.S.C. (1927)), which contains the following provisions:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, \u201ctrade union\u201d means such combination, whether temporary or permanent, for regulating the relations between workmen and masters, or for imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business, as would, but for this Act, have been deemed to be an unlawful combination by reason of some one or more of its purposes being in restraint of trade.\n6. Any seven or more members of a trade union may, by subscribing their names to the rules of the union and otherwise complying with the provisions of this Act with respect to registry, register such trade union under this Act, but if any one of the purposes of such trade union is unlawful, such registration shall be void.\n18. The trustees of any trade union registered under this Act, or any other officer of such trade union who is authorized so to do by the order thereof, may bring or defend, or cause to be brought or defended, any action, suit, prosecution or complaint, in any court of competent jurisdiction, touching or concerning the property, right or claim to property of the trade union, and may, in all cases concerning the property, real or personal, of such trade union, sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, in any such court, in their proper names, without other description than the title of their office.\n29. The purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful, so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise, or so as to render void or voidable any agreement or trust.\nThe defendants have not registered under these provisions, no doubt because any advantage that they might secure under s. 29 of the Trade Union Act is already theirs under the following sections of the Criminal Code:\n497. The purposes of a trade union are not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, unlawful within the meaning of the last preceding section.\n498. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding four thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, or to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or, if a corporation, is liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and not less than one thousand dollars, who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company.\n(a) to unduly limit the facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing in any article or commodity which may be a subject of trade or commerce; or\n(b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce in relation to any such article or commodity; or\n(c) to unduly prevent, limit, or lessen the manufacture or production of any such article or commodity, or to unreasonably enhance the price thereof; or\n(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or property.\n2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to combinations of workmen or employees for their own reasonable protection as such workmen or employees.\n590. No prosecution shall be maintainable against any person for conspiracy in refusing to work with or for any employer or workman, or for doing any act or causing any act to be done for the purpose of a trade combination, unless such act is an offence punishable by statute.\nIt is therefore clear that the defendants have not the status of quasi-corporations to which the decision of the House of Lords in Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants[10], might be applied.\nWe must accordingly reach the conclusion that, while, under the prevailing policy, our legislation gives to unincorporated labour organizations a large measure of protection, they have no legal existence; they are not endowed with any distinct personality; they have no corporate entity; they constitute merely collectivities of persons. The acts of such an association are only the acts of its members. Therefore, it cannot appear before the courts and its officers have no capacity to represent it before the tribunals of the province of Quebec, where \u201cnul ne plaide au nom d\u2019autrui,\u201d (Art. 81 C.C.P.). However cogent the reasons that may be urged in favour of authorizing and legalizing proceedings against unincorporated bodies, the Superior Court, and this court, cannot, under article 50 C.C.P., do more than order and control these bodies \u201cin such manner and form as by law provided.\u201d The province of Quebec has not yet legislated to give legal existence to or recourse against unincorporated bodies. The existing legislation compels us to reach the conclusion that Parliament and the legislature have not deemed it proper or necessary to compel, even international trade unions, although governed by foreign administrators, to acquire legal existence and liability in Canada through registration. We must, accordingly, ignore the industrial reality and must refuse to regard an unincorporated labour union as, in law, an entity distinct from its individual members. We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument it appeared to be quite clear that the impleadibility of the respondents, which the respondents disputed, could only be sustained if the respondents could be brought within art. 79 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is in these words:\nAll foreign corporations or persons, duly authorized under any foreign law to appear in judicial proceedings, may do so before any court in the province.\nAdmittedly the respondents are not a corporation, whether they are or are not a \u201cperson\u201d in the juridical sense, that is to say, whether or not the members of the collectivity, described as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, constitute a juridical person distinct from the personality of the individuals, is a question which is to be decided by the law of New York. The law of New York upon this subject was fully discussed in the evidence. The effect of that evidence is a question of fact. There is no collectivity in Quebec distinct from the body which has its domicile in New York. I have examined the testimony of the professional witnesses and the authorities cited by them with the greatest care; and in the result I think the weight of argument to be adduced from what is said and from the materials referred to, lies on the side of the negative. My conclusion, that is to say, is that, in point of fact, such a collectivity is not by the law of New York a juridical person in the pertinent sense.\nRinfret J.\u2014Je concours dans le jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue monsieur le juge Cannon.\nEntre la pr\u00e9sente cause et celle de Payette v. United Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees & Alfred D\u00e9rome & al.[11], (o\u00f9 si\u00e9geant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, j\u2019ai rendu un jugement que l\u2019on nous a cit\u00e9), je vois plusieurs distinctions \u00e0 faire.\nDans la cause de Payette, la d\u00e9fenderesse, au bref d\u2019assignation, \u00e9tait assign\u00e9e sous la d\u00e9signation suivante: \u201cCorps l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9 de D\u00e9troit, dans l\u2019Etat de Michigan, un des Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique\u201d. Jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre elle sous cette d\u00e9signation; elle avait accept\u00e9 ce jugement; et la question de sa pr\u00e9tendue incapacit\u00e9 \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9e par des tiers-saisis, au cours de la contestation de leur d\u00e9claration, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une saisiearr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement.\nEn outre, aucune loi sp\u00e9ciale de l\u2019Etat du Michigan, o\u00f9 la d\u00e9fenderesse avait son principal bureau d\u2019affaires, n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e dans la cause, et la seule r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fournie \u00e0 la cour \u00e9tait la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis dans la cause de Coronado Coal Company of Arkansas v. United Mine Workers of America[12] comme \u00e9tant la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui s\u2019appliquait. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9signation qui lui \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e au bref, la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait donc apparemment une corporation; et, comme l\u2019a justement fait remarquer monsieur le Juge Bond, en appel, le jugement re Payette11 repose sur le motif qui y est exprim\u00e9 comme suit:\nMais ce n\u2019est pas la d\u00e9fenderesse qui soul\u00e8ve ces moyens. Le premier point pourrait donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 sur le simple motif que les tiers-saisis excipent du droit d\u2019autrui et que la d\u00e9signation de la d\u00e9fenderesse ne concerne qu\u2019elle-m\u00eame. Il y a jugement contre elle, sous le nom et la description qui lui sont donn\u00e9s dans le bref de saisie-arr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement. Elle a comparu sur ce dernier bref; et elle ne se plaint ni du jugement rendu sur l\u2019action principale, ni de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de son assignation ou de sa description dans la saisie-arr\u00eat. Cela sera amplement suffisant pour disposer du premier point.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America est d\u00e9crite comme \u201can unincorporated Association\u201d; The Montreal Joint Board est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u201can unincorporated subsidiary association of the said Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America\u201d et les \u201cLocal Unions\u201d Nos. 115, 167, 209, 247 et 277 comme\nbeing unregistered and unincorporated subsidiary branches in the city and district of Montreal of the said Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.\nEn outre, le principal bureau d\u2019affaires de Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America est \u00e0 New-York. La loi sp\u00e9ciale de l\u2019Etat de New-York est prouv\u00e9e, et elle n\u2019a pas pour effet de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 ces associations la personnalit\u00e9 civile; elle n\u2019en fait ni une corporation, ni une personne; elle se contente d\u2019\u00e9tablir une proc\u00e9dure pour permettre d\u2019assigner les associations de ce genre sans exiger la d\u00e9signation et l\u2019assignation de tous les membres de l\u2019association.\nDans les circonstances, l\u2019article 79 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse intim\u00e9e, qui, aux yeux de la loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re, (qui est, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, celle de l\u2019Etat de New-York), n\u2019est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e ni comme \u201cune corporation\u201d, ni comme une \u201cpersonne\u201d et ne peut comme telle \u201cester en justice\u201d.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weinfield & Sperber.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bercovitch, Cohen & Spector.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 48 K.B. 14.\n[2] (1929) Q.R. 67 S.C. 388.\n[3] (1919) 59 Can.

The legislature, in enacting article 7405 R.S.Q. 1909, now article 30 of R.S.Q. 1925, c. 244 (An Act respecting life insurance by husbands and parents), although authorising in general terms the transfer of a life insurance policy by the insured and the beneficiaries, did not intend to make any change as to the provisions of the Civil Code which deal with personal incapacities and contraventions of public order, and notably as to the prohibition contained in article 1301 C.C.\nLaframboise v.

Elle stipule que,\nat the end of the policy-year falling nearest to age eighty-four, if the insured is then living, or, on receipt and approval of the proofs of the death of the said insured,\nla compagnie paiera la somme de mille piastres ($1,000) \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, si le terme de paiement \u00e9choit sa vie durant; \u00e0 ses ex\u00e9cuteurs, administrateurs ou ayants cause, si le montant de la police devient payable par suite de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.

La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 le jugement et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les transports nuls comme \u00e9tant en contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. Elle a condamn\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 remettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les polices d\u2019assurance dans les quinze jours de la signification du jugement; et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par elle de ce faire dans ce d\u00e9lai, \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la somme de $4,000, avec d\u00e9pens, tant de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que de la Cour du Banc du Roi; monsieur le juge Bernier \u00e9tant dissident.\nNous pouvons, d\u00e8s l\u2019abord, disposer de trois des moyens soulev\u00e9s dans l\u2019action de \u013eintim\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de ceux que nous avons indiqu\u00e9s ci-dessus comme moyens (a), (c) et (d)\u00b7\nIl est acquis au dossier que la demanderesse n\u2019a rien re\u00e7u personnellement de la banque comme consid\u00e9ration du transport des polices d\u2019assurance.\nEn outre, il n\u2019est plus discut\u00e9 que, nonobstant leurs termes qui comportent une cession des polices \u00e0 la banque sans aucune restriction, les transports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s seulement en garantie collat\u00e9rale des dettes du mari. Il y avait divergence entre les parties sur le point de savoir si la garantie fut donn\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du billet de $10,000 de la compagnie Wedgerite, dont le mari \u00e9tait responsable, ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les dettes du mari envers la banque. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 que la preuve ne permettait pas de d\u00e9cider que les polices avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es seulement en garantie du billet Wedgerite. La Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 du m\u00eame avis. Sur ce point, nous sommes d\u2019accord avec ces deux cours; et d\u2019ailleurs, les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des transports en faveur de la banque nous paraissent d\u00e9cisifs.\nD\u2019autre part, M. Morency, qui \u00e9tait un des inspecteurs de la Banque Nationale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a accept\u00e9 les transports, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les quatre polices \u00e9taient mentionn\u00e9es dans son rapport d\u2019inspection d\u2019octobre 1919 comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9tenues non pas en paiement pro tanto, mais en garantie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du compte de Poulin, le mari de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En plus, la banque, dans son factum, admet\nque les polices d\u2019assurance en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la Banque Canadienne Nationale par J.-Ed. Poulin, le mari de l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour garantir son compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que le litige doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 du point de vue d\u2019un transport par une femme mari\u00e9e en garantie des dettes de son mari, et non pas, ainsi que la plaidoirie \u00e9crite lavait d\u2019abord soumis, comme un transport pur et simple d\u2019une femme mari\u00e9e en paiement des dettes de son mari.\nCette distinction est tr\u00e8s importante; car, comme nous l\u2019avons fait remarquer entre autres dans la cause de Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[2],\nl\u2019on est d\u2019accord, en effet, pour interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 1301 du code civil comme une prohibition \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de cautionner, de garantir, de s\u2019engager pour l\u2019avenir \u201cavec ou pour son mari\u201d; et il est admis que l\u2019acte juridique ainsi proscrit par le l\u00e9gislateur est le contrat de garantie ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. Le mot \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d, dans cet article, doit s\u2019entendre comme indiquant seulement le contrat de cautionnement.\n(Lehel v. Brodin[3]). Par cons\u00e9quent, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 purement et simplement ses droits dans les polices, la question de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. se pr\u00e9senterait sous un jour tout diff\u00e9rent. Nous tenons \u00e0 bien d\u00e9finir ce point imm\u00e9diatement pour \u00e9viter toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur ce que nous pourrons dire au sujet de cet article par la suite de notre jugement.\nNous devons \u00e9carter \u00e9galement l\u2019article 1265 du code civil. Le contrat de mariage entre les \u00e9poux Poulin ne fait pas mention de ces polices d\u2019assurance; et ces derni\u00e8res n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019\u00e9pouse intim\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution des conventions matrimoniales. Dans ce contrat, il est fait don \u00e0 la future \u00e9pouse, \u00e0 titre de donation entre vifs et irr\u00e9vocable, d\u2019une somme de $5,000 courant, qu\u2019elle a droit d\u2019exiger une fois pour toutes et ce par elle \u00e0 prendre sur les plus clairs et apparents biens, tant mobiliers, immobiliers, polices d\u2019assurance de vie que autres g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques du futur \u00e9poux, soit de son vivant ou \u00e0 la mort de ce dernier, au choix de la future \u00e9pouse et sur sa premi\u00e8re demande;\nmais lorsque Poulin attribua \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des polices d\u2019assurance, il \u013ea fait, suivant son propre aveu, \u201cpour prot\u00e9ger son \u00e9pouse et ses enfants d\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u201d. Il ne le fit pas en paiement de la donation contenue au contrat de mariage et cela ne fut pas accept\u00e9 comme tel par \u013eintim\u00e9e. En transportant ces polices \u00e0 la banque, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a donc fait aucun changement aux conventions matrimoniales contenues au contrat de mariage. C\u2019est ce que la Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement d\u00e9cid\u00e9, d\u2019accord en cela avec la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; et l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a si bien vu qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son factum qu\u2019elle \u201cn\u2019insiste pas sur cette pr\u00e9tention devant cette honorable cour\u201d.\nCependant, l\u2019admission que les transports des polices d\u2019assurance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par \u013eintim\u00e9e non pas en cession pure et simple \u00e0 la banque, mais seulement en garantie collat\u00e9rale des dettes du mari, entra\u00eene comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil en vertu duquel\nla femme ne peut s\u2019obliger avec ou pour son mari qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute autre obligation qu\u2019elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi.\nLa banque a pr\u00e9tendu que la prohibition contenue dans cet article ne visait que la garantie personnelle de la femme mari\u00e9e et ne comprenait pas la garantie r\u00e9elle. L\u2019honorable juge LaFontaine, le pr\u00e9sent juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de Joubert et Turcotte v. Kieffer[4] a fait de cette question une \u00e9tude approfondie, \u00e0 laquelle nous ne saurions rien ajouter, et o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que par le mot \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d il faut entendre\ntout engagement quelconque par lequel une femme mari\u00e9e prend \u00e0 sa charge le paiement d\u2019une dette de son mari, soit qu\u2019elle contracte une obligation personnelle, comme dans le cautionnement, ou qu\u2019elle engage ses biens seulement, comme dans le contrat d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ou de gage.\nC\u2019est ce que cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin[5], et de nouveau dans la cause de Rodrigue v. Dostie[6]. Nous croyons que la Cour du Banc du Roi a eu raison d\u2019appliquer ces arr\u00eats; et nous approuvons \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard les raisons donn\u00e9es par M.M. les juges Dorion et Rivard.\nL\u2019on a pu voir, par l\u2019analyse que nous en avons faite, comme d\u2019ailleurs par les termes m\u00eames des transports \u00e0 la banque, que tous les droits et avantages inh\u00e9rents aux polices du vivant du mari vont \u00e0 ce dernier et sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s en sa faveur. Le capital lui-m\u00eame des polices appartiendra au mari, s\u2019il \u00e9cheoit pendant sa vie. Il en est ainsi des dividendes et de tout paiement de la valeur au comptant (\u201ccash surrender value\u201d), au cas o\u00f9 elle serait r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, \u00e0 certaines p\u00e9riodes fix\u00e9es, avant la mort de l\u2019assur\u00e9. Les droits de l\u2019\u00e9pouse intim\u00e9e se limitent au montant qui deviendrait d\u00fb par suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari, et \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019elle lui survive. Ce sont l\u00e0, il est vrai, des droits al\u00e9atoires et incertains; mais ce sont des droits tout de m\u00eame. Ils font partie des biens \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019y a pas renonc\u00e9, comme le pr\u00e9tend la banque. Cette pr\u00e9tention serait exacte si les transports devaient \u00eatre pris \u00e0 la lettre; mais nous avons vu que la v\u00e9ritable transaction entre la banque, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et son mari a \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement une garantie donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la banque pour les dettes du mari.\nDans la cause de Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[7], dont l\u2019appelante s\u2019est beaucoup r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, le mari, dans le contrat de mariage, avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme la jouissance et l\u2019usufruit d\u2019un immeuble, et en plus une somme de $1,800 garantie par hypoth\u00e8que sur cet immeuble. Plus tard, lorsque le mari vendit l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 un tiers, l\u2019\u00e9pouse renon\u00e7a\nsp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 tous droits qu\u2019elle avait sur ledit immeuble, y compris ceux pouvant lui r\u00e9sulter de son contrat de mariage.\nElle renon\u00e7ait donc \u00e0 la jouissance et usufruit \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019immeuble, et \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que qui garantissait le don de $1,800.\nCette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la donation de la jouissance et usufruit de l\u2019immeuble, qui devait prendre effet apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari, \u00e9tait une donation \u00e0 cause de mort, qui n\u2019emp\u00eachait pas le mari d\u2019ali\u00e9ner l\u2019immeuble \u201c\u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et pour son propre avantage\u201d, en vertu de l\u2019article 823 du code civil. L\u2019intervention de l\u2019\u00e9pouse dans l\u2019acte de vente pour abandonner \u00e0 l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur cette jouissance et usufruit n\u2019avait donc rien ajout\u00e9 au titre que le mari avait le droit de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 cet acqu\u00e9reur. D\u2019autre part, la cour a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la renonciation en faveur du m\u00eame acqu\u00e9reur \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que garantissant le don de $1,800, et qui laissait subsister l\u2019obligation personnelle du mari, ne constituait pas une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1265 du code civil. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 tout l\u2019effet de ce jugement.\nL\u2019appelante ne peut donc invoquer en sa faveur cet arr\u00eat de Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res (1), avec lequel le pr\u00e9sent litige n\u2019a aucune analogie. Ici, d\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019y a pas eu de renonciation de la part de l\u2019\u00e9pouse. Il n\u2019y a eu ni abandon, ni cession de ses droits. Elle a engag\u00e9 ses droits en garantie des dettes de son mari; elle s\u2019est donc oblig\u00e9e sur ces biens; et, comme le fait remarquer M. le juge Dorion en Cour du Banc du Roi, l\u2019obligation personnelle, dans l\u2019\u00e9volution de notre droit, n\u2019est rien autre chose, en d\u00e9finitive, qu\u2019un \u201cengagement sur les biens seulement\u201d. La seule diff\u00e9rence entre une promesse de payer et un transport en garantie est que, dans ce dernier cas, l\u2019obligation se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 la valeur du bien donn\u00e9 en gage; mais il n\u2019en constitue pas moins un engagement de payer. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l\u2019\u00e9pouse a engag\u00e9 ses biens avec l\u2019id\u00e9e de retour. Les biens qu\u2019elle transportait \u00e0 la banque devaient retourner \u00e0 elle si les dettes du mari \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es et lorsqu\u2019elles le seraient. Elle n\u2019a pas ali\u00e9n\u00e9. Elle a \u201c engag\u00e9 l\u2019avenir\u201d.\nIl faut dire, par cons\u00e9quent, que les transports d\u2019assurance dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande la nullit\u00e9 tombent sous le coup de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil; et, de tous les moyens soulev\u00e9s devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi, il ne reste donc que le suivant:\nL\u2019article 7405 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1909, qui \u00e9tait la loi en vigueur lorsque les transports furent effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a-t-il pour effet de les soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil?\nL\u2019article 7405 fait partie de la loi dont nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9, \u201cDe l\u2019assurance sur la vie des maris et parents\u201d, et se lit comme suit:\n7405. Les polices d\u2019assurance effectu\u00e9es ou appliqu\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente section, sont insaisissables pour les dettes des personnes assur\u00e9es ou qui doivent en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier.\nPendant qu\u2019il est entre les mains de la compagnie, le montant de l\u2019assurance est aussi insaisissable pour les dettes de l\u2019assur\u00e9, ainsi que pour celles des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, et doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 de la police, de la d\u00e9claration d\u2019application ou de toute r\u00e9vocation qui s\u2019y rapportent. Cette insaisissabilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019applique cependant pas \u00e0 une police, en tout ou en partie, qui peut \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e et appartenir \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nL\u2019assur\u00e9 et les parties avantag\u00e9es peuvent de concert transf\u00e9rer la police.\nUne r\u00e8gle fondamentale est que les statuts doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, autant que possible, en harmonie avec le droit commun. Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir eu l\u2019intention de modifier le droit commun au del\u00e0 de ce qu\u2019il en d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment.\nIt is a sound rule to construe a statute in conformity with the common law rather than against it, except where or so far as the statute is plainly intended to alter the course of the common law. (The Queen v. Morr\u00ecs[8]).\nL\u2019article 1301 du code civil a pour but la protection de la femme mari\u00e9e contre le danger d\u2019engager ses biens ou sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle, o\u00f9 elle pourrait se laisser entra\u00eener sous l\u2019influence de son mari ou m\u00eame par simple affection pour lui. La loi de l\u2019assurance sur la vie des maris et parents proc\u00e8de \u00e9galement d\u2019une id\u00e9e de protection. Lorsqu\u2019elle fut adopt\u00e9e, en 1865, elle \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9e: \u201cActe pour assurer aux femmes et aux enfants le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des assurances sur la vie de leurs maris et de leurs parents\u201d (29 V., c. 17). D\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de \u013eassur\u00e9, le montant de l\u2019assurance d\u00fb sur la police \u00e9tait payable au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sans qu\u2019il p\u00fbt \u00eatre \u201cr\u00e9clam\u00e9 par aucun cr\u00e9ancier, ou cr\u00e9anciers, que ce soit\u201d (art. 5).\nLe principe de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil existait d\u00e8s lors dans la loi du Bas-Canada. Sans doute, l\u2019origine en remonte au s\u00e9natus-consulte vell\u00e9ien; mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9, dans l\u2019ancien droit ant\u00e9rieur au code civil, au statut 4 V., c. 30, art. 36 (1841), reproduit avec modifications dans les statuts refondus du Bas-Canada (1861, c. 37, art. 55) et plus tard dans le code, o\u00f9 il est demeur\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour.\nLa premi\u00e8re loi d\u2019assurance sur la vie des maris et parents ne contenait pas de clause d\u2019incessibilit\u00e9; mais il est \u00e9vident que les avantages r\u00e9sultant de ces sortes d\u2019assurances en faveur de la femme mari\u00e9e restaient subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 la prohibition qui lui d\u00e9fendait de les engager pour le compte de son mari. En d\u2019autres termes, ces avantages \u00e9taient r\u00e9gis par la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. En 1869, par la loi 32 V., c. 39, il fut permis \u00e0\ntoute personne dont la vie est assur\u00e9e * * * par acte notari\u00e9 ou autre instrument par \u00e9crit, et sans aucun endossement sur la police (de) c\u00e9der et transporter \u00e0 titre de s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, pour toute somme de deniers ou autrement, aucune partie des droits qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de dans la dite police, pourvu qu\u2019elle ne soit pas moindre que le quart du montant d\u2019icelle.\nPar l\u00e0 \u013eassur\u00e9 \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 transporter ses droits; mais ceux des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires restaient intacts.\nEn 1870, par la loi 33 V., c. 21, le l\u00e9gislateur permit \u00e0 la personne assur\u00e9e \u201cd\u2019emprunter, sous la garantie de la police, telle somme qui sera n\u00e9cessaire \u201cpour maintenir la dite police en vigueur\u201d. Il fut d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les sommes ainsi emprunt\u00e9es constitueraient\nla premi\u00e8re charge sur les polices, nonobstant toute telle indication de paiement en faveur de la femme ou des enfants * * * pourvu que les sommes ainsi emprunt\u00e9es n\u2019exc\u00e8dent pas le montant de la prime d\u2019une ann\u00e9e.\nMais, en 1878 (41-42 V., c. 13), les lois ant\u00e9rieures furent abrog\u00e9es. Le pouvoir de l\u2019assur\u00e9 d\u2019emprunter sur la garantie de la police la somme n\u00e9cessaire pour la maintenir en force fut accord\u00e9 sous une forme nouvelle. Cependant, l\u2019autorisation \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 de c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e0 titre de s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale pour toute autre somme de deniers (contenue dans la loi de 1869) ne fut pas conserv\u00e9e dans la nouvelle loi; et, au contraire, il y fut d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 (art. 26) que les polices d\u2019assurance r\u00e9gies par la loi\nne seront pas saisissables pour dettes dues soit par le personne assur\u00e9e, soit par les personnes devant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la police, et seront incessibles par toutes telles personnes.\nCette insaisissabilit\u00e9 et cette incessibilit\u00e9 furent maintenues dans les statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888 (art. 5604) et demeur\u00e8rent en vigueur jusqu\u2019en 1898. Pendant tout ce temps, par cons\u00e9quent, non seulement les avantages de la femme mari\u00e9e r\u00e9sultant de ces polices d\u2019assurance tombaient sous le coup de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil, mais il \u00e9tait m\u00eame d\u00e9fendu \u00e0 toute personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans ces polices, soit comme assur\u00e9e, soit comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, de les c\u00e9der \u00e0 qui que ce soit.\nC\u2019est alors que la l\u00e9gislature, par la loi 61 V., c. 40 (1898), a fait dispara\u00eetre de l\u2019article 5604 des statuts refondus de 1888 les mots \u201cet sont \u00e9galement incessibles par ces personnes\u201d, et a ajout\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019article, l\u2019alin\u00e9a suivant: L\u2019assur\u00e9 et les parties avantag\u00e9es peuvent de concert transf\u00e9rer la police.\nEt c\u2019est depuis ce temps que la loi existe telle qu\u2019elle se lit dans l\u2019article 7405 des statuts refondus de 1909 et encore maintenant dans l\u2019article 30 du chapitre 244 des statuts refondus de 1925. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1898, il n\u2019est pas douteux que l\u2019article 1301 du code civil s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 ce genre de transaction. La loi sp\u00e9ciale de l\u2019assurance des maris allait m\u00eame plus loin que cet article. En 1898, les polices qui \u00e9taient jusqu\u2019alors incessibles sont devenues cessibles. C\u2019est tout ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 le droit commun. Par exemple, on ne peut d\u00e9duire de cette l\u00e9gislation qu\u2019on ait voulu autoriser un incapable, tel que le mineur ou l\u2019interdit, \u00e0 c\u00e9der la police autrement que par les voies pr\u00e9vues dans le code civil et le code de proc\u00e9dure civile. On ne peut, non plus, en d\u00e9duire que le l\u00e9gislateur ait voulu priver la femme mari\u00e9e de la protection \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301, surtout dans une loi comme celle des assurances qui s\u2019inspire essentiellement de l\u2019id\u00e9e de protection pour l\u2019\u00e9pouse et les enfants.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi et le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Trust & Loan v. Gauthier[9] et la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin[10] et dans celle de Rodrigue v. Dostie[11] ont affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019article 1301 du code civil contient une r\u00e8gle d\u2019ordre public. Il n\u2019est pas possible de penser que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu mettre cette r\u00e8gle de c\u00f4t\u00e9, il ne l\u2019e\u00fbt pas fait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on absolument expresse.\nTo alter any clearly established principle of law, a distinct and positive enactment is necessary. (Craies On Statute Law, 3rd Ed., p. 112.)\nLe l\u00e9gislateur, par l\u2019amendement de 1898, n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il a fait dispara\u00eetre l\u2019incessibilit\u00e9 des polices d\u2019assurance qui existait jusque-l\u00e0. Il a autoris\u00e9, entre autres, la femme mari\u00e9e, de concert avec son mari, \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer les polices d\u2019assurance dont il s\u2019agit; mais il n\u2019a nullement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il entendait \u00e9carter la r\u00e8gle contenue dans l\u2019article 1301 C.C. Et en \u013eabsence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration expresse \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, surtout dans une mati\u00e8re \u010fordre public comme celle-ci, il ne nous est pas permis de pr\u00eater aux termes du l\u00e9gislateur une intention plus \u00e9tendue que celle qui appara\u00eet par le langage qu\u2019il a employ\u00e9. (Vacher v. London Society of Compositors)[12]. Il ne faudrait rien moins qu\u2019un texte bien positif pour y trouver une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 un article que tous les tribunaux ont appliqu\u00e9 jusqu\u2019ici avec un soin jaloux. La r\u00e9daction actuelle du statut autorise le transfert de la police par toutes les personnes avantag\u00e9es agissant de concert. Elle permet au mari de c\u00e9der ou engager ses droits dans la police. Elle permet \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de c\u00e9der ses droits conform\u00e9ment au droit commun; mais elle ne valide pas une infraction \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. La distinction signal\u00e9e par Pothier subsiste. (Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[13]; Rodrigue v. Dostie)[14].\nToutefois, l\u2019article 1301 du code civil ne contient de prohibition que contre la femme; il n\u2019en contient pas contre le mari. Si les transports attaqu\u00e9s par \u013eintim\u00e9e sont nuls quant \u00e0 elle, ils valent pour les droits du mari. Nous avons vu que les polices d\u2019assurance contenaient en faveur de ce dernier des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciables. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour les raisons qu\u2019elle a invoqu\u00e9es, pouvait conclure \u00e0 l\u2019annulation des transports seulement en ce qui la concerne. Le mari lui-m\u00eame n\u2019est partie dans la cause que pour autoriser son \u00e9pouse. Il n\u2019a pas pris de conclusions personnelles. Il n\u2019est pas mis en cause. Les transports effectu\u00e9s par le mari en faveur de la banque conservent leur plein effet pour tous les avantages qui lui reviennent et pourraient m\u00eame entra\u00eener le paiement du capital d\u0117s polices d\u2019assurance, s\u2019il \u00e9cheoit du vivant du mari.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi va trop loin en annulant ces transports dans leur entier et en ordonnant \u00e0 la banque de livrer et remettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les polices dont il s\u2019agit dans les quinze jours de la signification du jugement, ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par elle de ce faire dans ce d\u00e9lai, en la condamnant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la somme de $4,000 avec d\u00e9pens. Ce jugement doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. Les transports sont annul\u00e9s quant \u00e0 \u013eintim\u00e9e seulement. En cons\u00e9quence, \u013eappelante a le droit de garder les polices d\u2019assurance et ne peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer la somme de $4,000 si elle ne les remet pas \u00e0 \u013eintim\u00e9e. Nous ne voyons pas bien, d\u2019ailleurs, la raison de cette condamnation alternative de $4,000. La possession d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance n\u2019emporte pas en soi le droit au paiement du montant de l\u2019assurance. Les polices, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ne sont que des documents qui prouvent les contrats. Le montant de l\u2019assurance est payable \u00e0 la personne que ces contrats d\u00e9signent, quel que soit celui qui a les polices en sa possession. En vertu de ces contrats, c\u2019est The \u00c6tna Life Insurance Company qui doit payer la somme de $4,000. Au moyen des transports, les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires lui avaient indiqu\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la Banque Nationale. Le r\u00e9sultat du pr\u00e9sent jugement est tout simplement que cette indication de paiement est annul\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Les droits de cette derni\u00e8re pourront \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la compagnie d\u2019assurance par la signification du jugement, si toutefois elle n\u2019est pas suffisamment li\u00e9e par suite du fait qu\u2019elle est mise-en-cause.\nCette modification n\u2019entra\u00eene pas de changement dans l\u2019adjudication des frais faite par la Cour du Banc du Roi; mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra payer les frais d\u2019appel devant cette cour.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Parent, Taschereau & Cannon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pr\u00e9vost, Taschereau & Bresse.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 47 K.B. 104.\n[2] [1927] Can.

Mcleod, William Warren, and C. E. Sibbald (Defendants) Respondents\n1930: October 13; 1930: December 23.\nPresent:\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nTrade name\u2014Action by first user in territory to restrain use by business competitor in that territory\u2014Extensive prior use in similar business by another in other territories\u2014Equitable principles. The action was to restrain defendants from using a certain trade name in connection with motor passenger transportation business in Alberta; the plaintiff claiming, as first user in the territory, an exclusive right to the name in that business in that territory.\nHeld (Cannon J. dissenting), that the judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., 24 Alta. L.R. 486, which (by a majority, reversing judgment of Ives J.) dismissed the action, should be affirmed, on the ground that, in view of the existing prior extensive use of the name by a certain company and its affiliated corporations in the tourist transportation business in other territories, the use by plaintiff of that name in a like business was not proper, being a use that would mislead the tourist public, and therefore plaintiff had not shown a right to the use entitling it to claim the protection of a court of equity (McAndrew v. Bassett, 4 De G. J. & S. 380, at 384; In re Heaton's Trade-Mark, 27 Ch. D. 570).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which (Clarke and Lunney JJ. A. dissenting) allowed the defendants' appeal from the judgment of Ives J., and dismissed the plaintiff's action.\nEach of the plaintiff and defendant companies had its headquarters at Banff, Alberta.\nThe plaintiff, in its statement of claim, alleged (inter alia) that it had been carrying on the business of motor passenger transportation under the trade name of \"Royal Blue Line\" in the province of Alberta, and, until the alleged infringement hereinafter mentioned, had had the exclusive use thereof within that province; that the defendant companies caused the said name to be used in connection with their businesses, which were similar to, and were carried on within the same area as, the plaintiff's business; that the individual defendants were the directors of and in control of the first defendant company and caused to be incorporated the second defendant company for the purpose of using such trade name; that the defendant companies, and the individual defendants through the medium of one or other of such companies, threatened and intended to continue the use of such trade name; and that by such use the defendants were infringing on the plaintiff's right to the exclusive use of said trade name throughout Alberta; and it claimed an injunction, a declaration that it was entitled to the sole and exclusive use of the trade name in connection with such businesses throughout Alberta, and damages.\nThe defendants denied the plaintiff's allegations, and denied that plaintiff had any right to any exclusive use of the said trade name or that plaintiff had any rights therein or thereto.\nA motor transportation company, of the State of Massachusetts, U.S.A., called the \"Royal Blue Line Company, Inc.\", had for a number of years (long before the plaintiff used the trade name in question) used the words \"Royal Blue Line\" in connection with its tourist sight seeing business. It carried on business in some cities in the United States and (by an organization which it controlled) in the province of Nova Scotia; and the same kind of business under the same name was carried on by affiliated companies under agreement with it in various other cities and places in the United States, and also in a number of cities in Canada, but not in the province of Alberta. The defendant, the Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Co. Ltd., entered into an agreement with the Massachusets company, which agreement contained a grant of a right to said defendant company to use (in Banff and within a certain radius therefrom) the name \"Royal Blue Line\". This agreement was entered into on a date some time after the plaintiff had begun to use the name, but the negotia- tions for an agreement had begun some time before the agreement and possibly, on the evidence, before such use by plaintiff. After the agreement the defendants advertised \"Royal Blue Line\", and the plaintiff complained and brought the present action.\nThe main question dealt with by the courts was whether or not the plaintiff had acquired a right to the name in the territory in question which enabled it to ask that defendants be restrained from using it.\nIves J. gave judgment for the plaintiff, declaring it entitled to the sole and exclusive use of the trade name in connection with motor transportation businesses and lines throughout Alberta, and granted an injunction against the defendants.\nThe Appellate Division[2], by a majority, reversed the judgment of Ives J., and dismissed the plaintiff's action. Clarke and Lunney, JJ. A., dissented, upholding the judgment at trial, subject to a modification to confine the operation of the judgment to territory in which the plaintiff carried on its operations.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (special leave to do so being\" granted by the Appellate Division). By the judgment now reported its appeal was dismissed with costs, Cannon J. dissenting.\nA. J. Thomson, K.C., and C. C. McLaurin for the appellant.\nH. G. Nolan for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff in this action invokes the equitable jurisdiction of the court for the protection of its alleged right to the trade name of \"Royal Blue Line\" by an injunction to restrain the defendants from making use of that name. In such a case the well-known maxim of equity clearly finds its application,\u2014\"He who comes into equity must come with clean hands\".\nAs stated by Lord Westbury, L.C., in McAndrew vs. Bassett[3], dealing with a case of an alleged infringement of a trade mark, The essential ingredients for constituting an infringement of that right probably would be found to be no other than these: first, that the mark has been applied by the plaintiffs properly, that is to say, that they have not copied any other person's mark, and that the mark does not involve any false representation.\nThe first enquiry must, therefore, be whether or not the plaintiff has shown a right to the use of the trade name in question for which he is entitled to claim the protection of a court of equity. With Mr. Justice Mitchell[4], I am of the opinion that\nthe plaintiffs have not made out a case sufficient to entitle them to the sole and exclusive use of the trade name \"Royal Blue Line\" in connection with their motor transportation businesses * * *.\nWhile the statement of defence does not directly charge fraud against the plaintiff in making use of the name \"Royal Blue Line\", at the outset of the trial of the case its counsel stated that the right of the plaintiff or defendants, or either of them, to the use of the name \"Royal Blue Line\" in Alberta was the issue to be tried. The plaintiff's exclusive right to use the name in the province of Alberta is also expressly denied in paragraph 2 of the statement of defence. Without, therefore, determining whether the plaintiff has been guilty of such fraud in the appropriation of that name as would justify an injunction being granted against them at the suit of the United States Company (The Royal Blue Line, Inc.), the evidence seems to establish that the plaintiff took this name for trade purposes knowing that it was already in use by the American company, and its affiliated corporations, in a large way, both in the United States and Canada, and that the reputation of the American Royal Blue Line would be quite likely to result in a large body of trade coming to the plaintiff through the use of this name, which it could not otherwise look for. This, in my opinion, amounts to a use of the name calculated to mislead the public to such an extent that its use by the plaintiff cannot be said to have been proper.\nIn In re Heaton's Trade Mark[5], the court was called upon to deal with the rights of persons outside its jurisdiction. The application was to register a trade mark which the applicant had used for half a century in the manufacture of steel. The application was opposed by a Swedish manufacturer who, and whose predecessors, had used, in the manufacture of steel, the same trade mark for more than a century and a half. They had learned quite recently of its use by the applicant. Kay J. refused an injunction because, in his opinion, to grant it would be sanctioning what he deemed to be a continuing misrepresentation. If that principle should govern in the present case, and I think it should, it cannot be said of the plaintiff that it is coming with clean hands to seek the aid of a court of equity. Its manager testifies that of the business of the Royal Blue Line buses operated by it, ninety-five per cent. comes from United States tourists. To them the use of the name by the plaintiff company would probably indicate connection with the United States Royal Blue Line, Inc.\nI agree with the conclusions of the Chief Justice of Alberta, which he states in the following terms[6]:\nIt seems clear, therefore, that the Court should not assist the plaintiff in its attempt to appropriate by prior use in [the province of Alberta] a name the use of which by it will deceive that public which it is particularly seeking to reach and serve.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The plaintiff company, simulating the colour and name of the Royal Blue Line omnibuses, seeks to obtain fares, by thus imposing upon travellers stopping at Banff, in the Rocky Mountains of Canada, the belief that they are being served by the widely known and reputable line of that name, having its seat or headquarters at Boston, Massachusetts, with affiliations and agencies, such as are described in the evidence, in various parts of the United States, Canada and Cuba.\nOn behalf of the plaintiff company it is sought to justify this method of business upon two grounds. First, it is said that the plaintiff, having painted its cars so recently as August, 1927, had anticipated the defendants, who, a few months later, by leave and licence of the Boston company, advertised and, subject to the stipulated conditions, were preparing to operate a competing line as Royal Blue. Secondly, the plaintiff affirms in effect that it is entitled to the exclusive use of the Boston company's name and description in the province of Alberta, because, at the time when the plaintiff began to use them, the Boston line was not doing business there. These are the plaintiff's pretentions; and they are prompted by the fact that Banff is a tourist resort, frequented by visitors from the United States, among whom the name and service of the Royal Blue Line, and its affiliations, are so well known as to create a preference for their omnibuses, which thus become favoured competitors for the patronage that the plaintiff covets.\nThe plaintiff is seeking an injunction; and it is, in my opinion, clear enough that its application is in conflict with equitable principles. I would dismiss the appeal, for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta[7], and upon the authorities to which he refers.\nCANNON, J. (dissenting).\u2014The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta granted special leave to appeal from its majority judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action for an injunction which had been granted by the trial judge; Clarke and Lunney JJ.A., who had dissented, were in favour of continuing the injunction with certain modifications.\nThe plaintiff, who had been carrying on a sightseeing business\u2014with also a more or less incidental stage patronage\u2014in and about Banff for many years, inaugurated in 1927 a service under the trade name of \"Royal Blue Line\" between Banff and Calgary. The buses were painted a cream colour with royal blue badges on each side and with the words \"Royal Blue Line\" in four-inch gold letters painted thereon; and, in addition, the words \"Brewster Transport Company\" in gold letters appeared on the windshields.\nFrom 1927 until the date of the action, the plaintiff extended this Royal Blue Line service in sightseeing trips from Banff in different directions. It got out schedules, time-tables and tariffs, which were placed in hotels in Banff and on the prairie, and advertised in newspapers and by other means of publicity.\nThe evidence establishes the accuracy of the finding of the trial judge that the plaintiff's business under that name and its advertising increased during 1928 and 1929. The plaintiff learned of the name \"Royal Blue Line\", being used by the first named defendant company in February, 1929, by seeing a folder of that company styled \"Sightseeing in the Canadian Rockies\", advertising tours to Banff, Lake Louise and other localities within the territory served by the plaintiff. This folder had printed on it \"Royal Blue Line operated by Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Company\". On March 6th, 1929, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote the following letter:\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada,\nMarch 6th, 1929.\nRocky mountain Tours and Transport Co., Ltd.,\nBanff, Alberta.\nDear Sirs:\nIt has been drawn to our attention that you are using the name Royal Blue Line in connection with your Sight Seeing Business, even going the length to issue a folder using that name and on behalf of the Brewster Transport Company, Limited, we have to point out that this name has been used quite extensively in this Province, and also we believe in British Columbia, by it for several years. Their busses have been operating between Banff and Calgary and other points with this name plainly printed on the bodies and the name in the minds of the public must signify that any busses or advertising matter bearing such name are operated, issued or sponsored by the Brewster Transport Company, with the consequence that your use of the name is necessarily calculated to deceive the travelling public and result in a considerable number to use your busses in the belief that they are patronizing the lines operated and controlled by our client.\nWe are informed that the name Royal Blue Line is used by some transportation concerns in the States, but our client was the first to adopt it in this Province and has established a valuable good will by its use.\nThe use of this name by you is, therefore, unwarranted, and an infringement of our client's property in the same, and we must accordingly ask you to discontinue its use forthwith and recall any and all advertising matter you may have issued or caused to be issued in which your name is associated with the name Royal Blue Line, or in which you hold yourselves out as the operators of the Royal Blue Line in this Province.\nWe need hardly add that failure to comply with this request will result in our client being compelled to take steps to enjoin the infringement and to recover any damage it may have or may hereafter sustain by your user of this name.\nWould you kindly acknowledge this letter shortly and we trust that having brought the fact of our client's right to your notice you will not delay in abandoning the use of this name in your business.\nYours faithfully,\nFENERTY & McLAURIN,\nPer C. C. McL. This communication was answered as follows:\n600-603 Lancaster Building,\nCalgary, Canada,\nMarch 27th, 1929.\nMessrs. Fenerty & McLaurin,\nBarristers, Solicitors,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nRe Rocky Mountain Royal Blue Line Motor Tours Limited.\nMr. McLeod has forwarded to us your letter to the Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Co., Ltd., of March 6th, asking us to reply.\nWe have formed a company for him known as the \"Rocky Mountain Royal Blue Line Motor Tours Limited\" and this company and this company will carry on all business connected with their tours.\nMr. McLeod will not be back until about the middle of April, so that it is difficult for us to give you any more information until that time. You can take it, however, that the Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Company will be making no use of the name Royal Blue Line or that any use made by them of that name will be by the Company, Rocky Mountain Royal Blue Line Motor Tours Limited.\nYours faithfully,\nBENNETT, HANNAH & SANFORD.\nPer P. L. Sanford.\nPLS\/JM\nAfter further correspondence, an action was launched on the 10th May, 1929, setting forth the prior use by plaintiff for several years past of the trade name and style of \"Royal Blue Lines\" in the province of Alberta, which name had become a valuable asset to the plaintiff, and the defendants' infringement and illegal adoption of the same.\nThe plaintiff claimed:\n(a) An injunction restraining the Defendants and each of them, their servants, agents and employees from using the trade name \"Royal Blue Line\" in conjunction with the motor transportation business or other business carried on by the Defendants or any of them of a similar nature within the Province of Alberta.\n(b) A declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to the sole and exclusive use of the trade name \"Royal Blue Line\" in connection with motor transportation businesses and lines throughout the Province of Alberta.\n(c) Damages in the sum of $1,000.\n(d) Costs of this action.\nThe statement of defence amounts to a general denial of all the allegations and makes no reference to a contract between the defendant and the Royal Blue Line Company Inc. of Massachusetts, nor does it contain any allegation of fraud against the plaintiff in using in its operations the name and style of \"Royal Blue Line\". I have reached the conclusion that the appellant should succeed. It is common ground that the appellant was the first to use the name \"Royal Blue Line\" in the province of Alberta. It is also admitted by defendants' manager, McLeod, that the public is bound to be confused if both companies continue to use the same name in carrying on their business in the same territory, which means that the plaintiff would lose customers, who, by mistake, would go to the defendants under the impression that they were dealing with the plaintiff.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal thought that the plaintiff could not succeed, because it had failed to establish its right to the use of the name which it adopted in 1927; the learned Chief Justice [8] considered its conduct as an \"attempt to appropriate by prior use in [the province of Alberta] a name the use of which by it will deceive that public which it is particularly seeking to reach and serve\". This view is based on the fact that, since 1912, a company incorporated in Boston has been doing an extensive business as \"The Royal Blue Line\" in some parts of the United States and Canada. This company had, however, never thought of doing business in Alberta before it granted, in the latter part of 1928, a licence to the \"Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Company, Limited\" to use its trade name in connection with the \"sightseeing and motor touring business in said Banff and to operate in and from Banff for a radius of not exceeding five hundred miles. These tours to originate and terminate in Banff, Alberta\". This agreement or licence, which, although not invoked in the pleadings, was filed, despite plaintiff's solicitor's objection, is not transferable, as appears by its last clause.\nIn my opinion, this contract and the prior use of the name \"Royal Blue Line\" outside of the province of Alberta cannot be considered in deciding the issue between the parties. The non-transferable licence was granted to the \"Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Company Limited\". That defendant undertook by its solicitors' letter of 27th March, 1929, to make no use of the name Royal Blue Line. As to the second defendant, Rocky Mountain Royal Blue Line Motor Tours Limited, this company was organized evidently with a view to providing a way of escape from the false situation in which the first-named defendant was found by its solicitors; this clearly appears from the same letter of March 27th, 1929. Moreover, this new company, whose corporate name includes the words \"Royal Blue Line\", was brought into existence in order to carry on an unfair competition with plaintiff's business in the Banff territory. They cannot rely to improve their position upon any dealing with the United States company, as they did not make any contract with the latter, and the only licence from this company contains a prohibition against the defendant Rocky Mountain Tours and Transport Company Limited transfering whatever rights they may have acquired under the agreement; so that the second-named defendant stands in the position of having been incorporated, under a name including the words \"Royal Blue Line,\" after the plaintiff's solicitors had written to its co-defendant protesting against the use of that name for transportation purposes in the Banff territory.\nAs to the respective rights of the Boston company and the plaintiff, while they are really not at stake in this case, out of respect for the majority opinion of the learned judges of the appellate court, I cite, in support of my view that the Boston company has no status to object to the use made of the name \"Royal Blue Line\" by the plaintiff in Alberta, Hanover Star Milling Company v. Metcalf[9], where the Circuit Court of Appeal for the Seventh District found:\nWhere two parties independently employ the same trade-mark or name, not in general use and susceptible of adoption, upon goods of the same class but in separate and remote markets, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant in the absence of intent on the part of the later adopter to take the benefit of the reputation, or to forestall extension of the trade, of the earlier adopter.\nWhile property in a trade-mark is not limited, so far as its use has extended, by territorial bounds, the earlier adopter may not monopolize markets that his trade has never reached and where the mark signifies not his goods but those of another.\nI cannot conceive, for instance, that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company could enjoin an Alberta hotelkeeper, who did not claim to be in any way connected with that company, from calling his hotel \"Chateau Frontenac\" on the ground that this name is now known and used in the city of Quebec to designate a hotel where the company's services give satisfaction to the travelling public.\nLike most cases of this description, this suit must be decided upon the facts. We have before us the ordinary case of parties competing under the same trade name, in the same market; and prior appropriation settles the question in favour of the plaintiff. It has not been alleged, and it was not proved, that the Brewster Transport Company had selected the name with any design inimical to the interest of the Massachusetts company who, in 1927, were not doing business in Alberta and had not yet done anything to extend their trade to that territory. We must refrain, however, from deciding the rights of the Boston company as against the plaintiff, since it is not a party to the present case. Whether or not the foreign company can restrain the plaintiff is not a question before us.\nIt may be stated that no question relative to trade marks, or the right to particular designations or slogans which may be acquired under statutory enactment is involved in this appeal. The only rights which the plaintiff or the defendants could have, or could assert, in this action are those arising out of the actual appropriation and use by the plaintiff of a certain trade name in the particular vicinity, and out of the defendants' interference, through unfair competition with the business growing out of such use by the plaintiff. Manager McLeod, one of the individual defendants, admits that the Boston company never did business in Alberta until they got in touch with him and his company. It is clear that the Boston company never acquired any rights in or to the exclusive appropriation of the name in question through any use thereof in that province. Never having acquired that right, it is obvious that it could not transfer it to the defendants herein.\nThe incorporation of the \"Rocky Mountain Royal Blue Line Motor Tours Limited\" following, as it did, the advertising campaign of the other defendant company, was, in my opinion, unfair trade dealing, even if it did not amount to the invasion of an exclusive right of property in a trademark. It may be accepted in principle that, in the interest of fair commercial dealings, courts of equity, at the instance of a person who has been first in the field doing business under a given name, and has earned the good will of the public by a sufficient and satisfactory service and by extensive advertising, will protect him to the extent of making competitors take reasonable precautions to prevent deceit upon the public and consequent injury to the business of the person first in the field. Relief in such cases really rests upon the deceit or fraud which the later comer into the business field is practising upon the public\u2014in order to annex the earlier comer's patronage. The United States courts have repeatedly applied the foregoing rule and would probably refuse to interfere, at the instance of the Boston Blue Line Corporation, if the latter, not having been actually engaged in business in the locality, and having no customers there, sought to enjoin a defendant from the use in the locality of the same trade name. Eastern Outfitting Co. v. Manheim[10].\nIn the case of Sartor v. Schaden[11], the court applied the principle in the terse statement that \"there cannot be unfair competition unless there is competition\".\nIn England, in Knott v. Morgan[12], it was held that persons operating omnibuses bearing the name \"London Conveyance Company\" were entitled to relief against the acts of the defendant in painting the words \"Conveyance Company\" and \"London Conveyance Company\" in such characters and on such parts of his omnibus as exactly to resemble the same words on the omnibuses of the plaintiffs, and in reproducing a symbol which was also painted on the omnibuses of the plaintiffs, and imitating the green livery and gold hatbands by which the plaintiffs distinguished their coachmen and conductors, the Master of the Rolls saying:\nIt is not to be said that the plaintiffs have any exclusive right to the words \"Conveyance Company\" or \"London Conveyance Company,\" or any other words; but they have a right to call upon this court to restrain the defendant from fraudulently using precisely the same words and devices which they have taken for the purpose of distinguishing their property, and thereby depriving them of the fair profits of their business by attracting custom on the false representation that carriages, really the defendant's, belong to, and are under the management of, the plaintiffs.\nIn London General Omnibus Co. v. Felton[13], it was decided that, while an omnibus proprietor is not entitled to any monopoly in the construction of the omnibuses, or in such details as garden seats, special staircases, and the like, or in the colours employed in painting the wheels and body, a competitor is not entitled to arrange the general appearance of his omnibuses in such a way as to pass them off for those of another proprietor, the court remarking that the general appearance was to be looked at, and that it was therefore useless to compare the points of similarity one by one, and that this was certainly not less important when it was borne in mind that omnibuses are not merely stationary, but also moving objects.\nAn injunction should be granted in a form which is suitable and legitimate for the particular circumstances of the case. Montgomery v. Thompson[14]. As to the exact form of the injunction, appellant's counsel, at the argument, stated that they would be satisfied to accept the limitations suggested by Mr. Justice Clarke, in his dissenting opinion, in the following words[15], which I am disposed to adopt:\nI think, however, the judgment is objectionable in form inasmuch as it gives the plaintiff the exclusive use of the trade name in connection with motor transportation businesses and lines throughout the Province of Alberta. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff operates or intends to operate in the vast areas of the Province not at present occupied by it, viz., the territory including Jasper Park and the Peace River Country to the West, North and East of Edmonton and the part of the Province East of the Calgary and Edmonton route. In such parts I see no objection to the use of the name by others who would not be in competition with the plaintiff. I see no reason either for confining the plaintiff to the Province of Alberta in the use of its name. Trade knows no Provincial boundary. I think the proper order is to confine the operation of the judgment to territory in which the plaintiff carries on its operations.\nWith this modification, I would allow the appeal, with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 24 Alta.

By section 10 (1), it was provided that, \"for the purpose of controlling and regulating, under this Act, the marketing of any product within its authority (the) Committee shall, so far as the legislative authority of the province extends, have power to determine at what time and in what quantity, and from and to what places, and at what price the product may be marketed, and to make orders and regulations in relation to such matters.\" By sec\u00adtion 10 (k), the committee was also given the power \"for the purpose of defraying the expenses of operation, to impose levies on any product marketed.\" By subsection 3 of section. 16, as enacted by the Amendment Act of 1928, c. 39, it was provided that \" the committee may fix licence fees to be paid by shippers.\"\nHeld that this legislation is ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nPer Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ\u2014Such legislation is referable to the exclusive Dominion power to regulate trade and com\u00admerce. (Section 91 (2) B.N.A. Act.)\nNewcombe J. however is careful expressly to reserve the position that the legislation would also be ultra vires of the province even if not within any of the Dominion enumerated powers.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014The provisions of the statute, which authorize the committee to impose levies and to fixe licence fees are ultra vires, the levy not being within section 92 (2) and the licence not being within section 92 (9) of the B.N.A. Act.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The levy is an export tax falling within the category of duties of customs and excise and, as such, as well as by reason of its inherent nature as an indirect tax, could not competently be imposed by the provincial legislature.\n*PRESENT:\u2014Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming the judgment of the trial court, Murphy J.[1], and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe action was brought at Grand Forks, on the 9th of August, 1929, by the appellant, a fruit rancher and shipper of fruit against the respondent, the Committee of Direc\u00adtion, claiming that the Produce Marketing Act was ultra vires, and for a declaration that he was under no obligation to obtain a licence from the Committee of Direction or to pay levies imposed or to otherwise observe the rules, regulations and orders passed by the Committee under the Produce Marketing Act, and for an injunction restraining the Committee from collecting such licence fees and levies or otherwise restricting the appellant from marketing the fruit and vegetables grown by him, and also for an injunc\u00adtion restraining the Committee from enforcing the general regulations passed by it and for damages. The action was brought as a test case for the purpose of determining whether or not the Produce Marketing Act was intra vires of the legislature of the province of British Columbia. The action was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Murphy at Vancouver on the 6th of March, 1930, who dismissed the appellant's action on the 11th of March, 1930. The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which affirmed the judgment of the trial judge. The appellant obtained special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the 12th of September, 1930. The Attorney-General of Canada was granted leave to intervene before the Supreme Court of Canada.\nH. S. Wood K.C. and C. F. R. Pincott for the appellant.\nH. B. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nF. P. Varcoe for the intervenant.\nThe judgments' of Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. were delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant, who is the plaintiff in the action giving rise to the appeal, claims a declaration that the respondent is not possessed of the authority which it is professing to exercise in control of the marketing outside the province of tree fruits and vegetables grown or produced within a defined area in British Columbia, over which the respondent professes to exercise jurisdiction.\nBy the Produce Marketing Act (s. 3), which was passed in 1927, there was constituted a Committee of Direction, ' under the name which the respondent bears, with \" ex\u00adclusive power to control and regulate \" under the Act,\nthe marketing of all tree fruits and vegetables (including tomatoes and melons), being products grown or produced in that portion of the prov\u00adince contained within\nspecified boundaries including what is described as the Grand Forks district, where the appellant has been for some years a fruit rancher and shipper. Two of the mem\u00adbers of the Committee are selected by the Growers and Shippers Federation of British Columbia, which is a so\u00adciety of fruit growers and shippers incorporated under the Societies Act, while the third member of the Committee, the chairman, is named by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The powers of the Committee are set forth in general terms, in the first paragraph of s. 10 (1) which reads thus :\n10. (1). For the purpose of controlling and regulating, under this Act, the marketing of any product within its authority, a Committee shall, so far as the legislative authority of the Province extends, have power to determine whether or not and at what time and in what quantity and from and to what places and at what price and on what terms the product may be marketed and delivered and to make orders and regula\u00adtions in relation to such matters.\nThen follows a series of sub-paragraphs, in which are more specifically described functions and powers: to esti\u00admate the quantity of any product to be available for marketing and at what times and places; to fix the quan\u00adtities which may from time to time be marketed at any place by a shipper; to fix the place or places from which any such product may be delivered or dispatched for marketing; to make arrangements for carriage from time to time ; to set minimum and maximum prices for any such product; to require returns; to have inspection of books and other documents; to prescribe the terms of sale of a product including the minimum brokerage which may be paid in respect thereto.\nMarketing is defined as\nthe buying and selling of a product and includes the shipping of a product for sale or for storage and subsequent sale and the offering of a product for sale and the contracting for the sale or purchase of a product, whether the shipping, offering or contracting be to or with a purchaser, a shipper or otherwise, but does not relate to the marketing of a product for consumption outside the Dominion and \" market \" has a correspond\u00ading meaning.\nHaving regard to this definition, it is obvious that the scope of the marketing operations affected by s. 10 does not exclude the shipping for delivery outside the province of British Columbia, or the offering or contracting for sale of the products to which the section applies to or with persons outside the province.\nThe Committee also has power for the purposes of defraying the expenses of operation \" to impose levies on any product marketed,\" which levies \" shall be payable at such rates and in such manner and at such times \" as may be determined by the Federation. By s. 15, shippers are obliged to comply with every determination, order or regu\u00adlation of the Committee, and any contract made by a shipper in violation of this provision is void. By s. 16, shippers are prohibited from doing any act \" within the meaning of marketing or selling \" in relation to any product \" which is subject to the control and regulation\" of the Committee, without having obtained a shipper's licence \" to market and sell such products.\" By the 3rd subsection, as amended in 1928\nthe Committee may fix licence fees to be paid by shippers. Shippers of carload lots play be classified with reference to the quantity of product marketed and the fee may vary accordingly, but shall not in any case exceed twenty dollars; and in the case of other shippers the fee shall not exceed five dollars,\nThe Committee is also invested by the same section with authority to suspend or cancel the licence of a shipper\nfor violation of this Act or of any determination, order or regulation made by it under this Act.\nMarketing or selling by a shipper without a licence is an \" offence against the Act,\" and so also is the failure of any shipper to comply with any determination, order or regu\u00adlation of the Committee. The penalty for an \" offence against the Act \" is under s. 20, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, for an individual who is a shipper, and, for a corporation who is a shipper, a fine not exceeding $10,000.\nThe plaintiff's main contention on this appeal is that the respondent Committee is destitute of the powers it assumes to execute because the statute is ultra vires. This proposition is based on two general grounds. First, it is said that the substantive enactments of the statute are enactments on the subject of \" trade and commerce \" within the meaning of these words as used in head 2 of s. 91 of the British North America Act; then it is said that the statute directly and substantively regulates the conduct of people outside the province and thereby purports to operate within a sphere beyond the control of the pro\u00advincial legislature. Furthermore, particular provisions are attacked upon special grounds. These will be discussed.\nIt will not be necessary to pass upon the second of these grounds. What, if any, limitations affect the authority of a provincial legislature to determine, for the province, the legal effect, within the province, of extra-provincial acts, and to prescribe the rules of law, which, except in matters governed by s. 91, the provincial courts are to ob\u00adserve in controversies arising in relation to such acts, is a subject of multifarious ramifications, of great importance, and, in some respects, not free from difficulty. The prud\u00adent course would appear to be to express no opinion upon the points which have been raised within the limits of that subject in the present litigation; because in my opinion, the appeal can be determined without any reference to them. It must be understood that it is not intended to throw out or intimate any view upon any of those points.\nIt should perhaps be noted that the section, which defines, in general terms, the power of the Committee of Direction as a power\nto determine at what time, and in what quantity and from and to what places, and at what price the product may be marketed, and to make orders and regulations in relation to such matters,\nlimits, in explicit terms, the scope and operation of the power in this fashion : \" so far as the legislative authority of the province extends.\" It has been pointed out, however, with perfect accuracy, that the section proceeds in a series of subsections to a specification of the powers with which the Committee is endowed, and that in bestowing these specified powers, the section does not, in express terms, impose any such limitation. As against this, it may no doubt be said that the specification is intended only as an exposition and elaboration of the powers embraced within the general words, and that consequently the quali\u00adfication quoted affects all these specified powers. It is to be observed also that the definition of \" marketing \" does indisputably point to an intention that the jurisdiction of the Committee in controlling the action of shippers shall run beyond the boundaries of the province. As to that again, it may be argued, that it is within the authority of the provincial legislature, in dealing with a subject matter falling within s. 92, to legislate conditionally as well as absolutely. The legislature, although convinced of its own power to pass a given enactment, is quite competent, it may be contended, not without plausibility, to make the legal effectiveness of its enactment dependent upon the condition that the matter of it is within those classes of matters in relation to which it is competent to it to make rules of law. It is not necessary, however, to decide upon the effect of these qualifying words in s. 10, for the purpose of dealing with any branch of the appeal; and no opinion is expressed thereon. The Committee of Direction, in re\u00adspect of the matters complained of by the appellant, acted systematically on the view that they possessed the powers ex facie given them by the statute, when read irrespect\u00adively of the qualifying words; and even if the effect of them is to provide an answer to the allegation that the legislation is ultra vires, they provide no answer to the charge that, in the matters complained of, the Committee was exercising an authority it did not possess, because the legislature of British Columbia is incompetent to invest it with such authority. And, if the charge can be made good, that the Committee has been employing its ostensible powers to put into effect orders, rules and determinations to which the legislature is not competent to impart compul\u00adsory force, the appellant, in so far as they prejudice him, is entitled to a declaration to that effect.\nBefore proceeding to discuss the question arising in re\u00adlation to head no. 2 of s. 91, I shall consider, first of all, the levies imposed upon the appellant by s. 10 (k), and the demands for the payment of such levies. I think the contention of the appellant is well founded, that such levies so imposed, have a tendency to enter into and to affect the price of the product. I think, moreover, that levies of that character, assuming for the moment they come under the head of taxation, are of the nature of those taxes on com\u00admodities, on trade in commodities, which have always been regarded as indirect taxes. If they are taxes, they cannot be justified as Direct Taxation within the province. That they are taxes, I have no doubt. In the first place they are enforceable by law. Under s. 13 they can be sued for, and a certificate under the hand of the chairman of the Committee is prima facie evidence that the amount stated is due; and the failure of a shipper to comply with an order to pay such a levy would appear to be an offence under the Act by s. 15. Then they are imposed under the author\u00adity of the legislature. They are imposed by a public body. This Committee, of which the chairman is appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and which is invested with wide powers of regulation and control over the fruit and vegetable industry within a great extent of territory, constituted by, and acting in every way under, the author\u00adity of the statute, exercising compulsory powers as well as inquisitorial powers of a most exceptional character, is as\u00adsuredly a public authority. The levy is also made for a public purpose. When such compulsory, not to say dicta\u00adtorial, powers are vested in such a body by the legislature, the purposes for which they are given are conclusively pre\u00adsumed to be public purposes. Indeed, when one considers the number of people affected by the orders of this Com\u00admittee, and the extent of the territory over which it exe\u00adcutes its orders and directions, it becomes evident that, in point of their potential effect upon the population of the territory and of the interest of the population in the Com\u00admittee's activities, the operations of the Committee, as contemplated by the statute, greatly surpass in public im\u00adportance many municipal schemes, the levies for the support of which nobody could dispute, would come under the head of taxation.\nThis brings us to the question whether the levies com\u00adplained of are levies which can be brought under head no. 9 of s. 92. The words are these :\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licences in order to the rais\u00ading of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes.\nThe question has never yet been decided whether or not the revenue contemplated by this head can in any circum\u00adstances be raised by a fee which operates in such a man\u00adner as to take it out of the scope of \" direct taxation.\" Prima facie, it would appear, from inspection of the lan\u00adguage of the two several heads, that the taxes contem\u00adplated by no. 9 are not confined to taxes of the same character as those authorized by no. 2, and that accordingly imposts which would properly be classed under the general description \" indirect taxation\" are not for that reason alone excluded from those which may be exacted under head 9. On the other hand, the last mentioned head authorizes licences for the purpose of raising a revenue, and does not, I think, contemplate licences which, in their primary function, are instrumentalities for the control of trade-even local or provincial trade.) Here, such is the primary purpose of the legislation. The imposition of these levies is merely ancillary, having for its object the creation of a fund to defray the expenses of working the machinery of the substantive scheme for the regulation of trade. Even the licence fee is discretionary with the Com\u00admittee. This part of the statute would appear to be ultra vires. The levy authorized is not within s. 92 (2), and the licence is not within s. 92 (9).\nIt follows that the appellant is entitled to succeed upon that branch of his claim which affects the levies in ques\u00adtion.\nComing now to the first ground of attack, namely, that the statute constitutes an attempt to regulate trade within the meaning of head no. 2 of s. 91. To repeat the general language of s. 10 (1), the functions of the Committee are\nfor the purpose of controlling and regulating the marketing of any product within its authority,\nand for that purpose the Committee is empowered\nto determine whether or not and at what time, and in what quantity and from and to what places and at what price and on what terms the product may be marketed and delivered.\nAs I have said, the respondent Committee has attempted (in professed exercise of this authority) and in this liti\u00adgation asserts its right to do so\u2014to regulate the market\u00ading of products into parts of Canada outside British Col\u00adumbia. It claims the right under the statute to control (as in fact it does), the sale of such products for shipment into the prairie provinces as well as the shipment of them into those provinces for sale or storage. The moment his product reaches a state in which it becomes a possible article of commerce, the shipper is (under the Committee's interpretation of its powers), subject to the Committee's dictation as to the quantity of it which he may dispose of, as to the places from which, and the places to which he may ship, as to the route of transport, as to the price, as to all the terms of sale. I ought to refer also to the provision of the statute which prohibits anybody becoming a licensed shipper who has not, for six months immediately preceding his application for a licence, been a resident of the province, unless he is the registered owner of the land on which he carries on business as shipper. In a statute which deals with trade that is largely interprovincial, this is a significant feature. It is an attempt to control the manner in which traders in other provinces, who send their agents into British Columbia to make arrangements for the shipment of goods to their principals, shall carry out their interprovincial transactions. I am unable to con\u00advince myself that these matters are all, or chiefly, matters of merely British Columbia concern, in the sense that they are not also directly and substantially the concern of the other provinces, which constitute in fact the most exten\u00adsive market for these products. In dictating the routes of shipment, the places to which shipment is to be made, the quantities allotted to each terminus ad quem, the Committee does, altogether apart from dictating the terms of contracts, exercise a large measure of direct and immediate control over the movement of trade in these commodities between British Columbia and the other provinces.\nSuch matters seem to constitute \" matters of interpro\u00advincial concern,\" that is to say, of direct, substantial and' immediate \" concern,\" to the receiving province as well as to the shipping province. Otherwise you seem to denude the phrase of all meaning. No doubt the Committee also regulates the local trade in British Columbia, but the regu\u00adlation of the trade with other provinces is no mere inci\u00addent of a scheme for controlling local trade; it is of the essence of the statute and of the object and character of the Committee's activities. We have not here to do with any mere matter of contract or of civil status, with the right, for example, to sue in the provincial courts. Contract is no doubt involved, as the control of property is in\u00advolved; but the central purpose of the legislation is to assume direct control of the trade as trade. Its aim is to regulate the producer and shipper as trader; as proprietor and contractor, it affects him directly and necessarily, but only as a means of governing him in carrying on his trade.\nThe scope which might be ascribed to head 2, s. 91 (if the natural meaning of the words, divorced from their context, were alone to be considered), has necessarily been limited, in order to preserve from serious curtailment, if not from virtual extinction, the degree of autonomy which, as appears from the scheme of the Act as a whole, the provinces were intended to possess. Therefore, it has been found necessary to say that this head does not comprise the regulation, by a system of licences, of a particular business within any one or within all of the provinces. But there is no lack of authority for the proposition that regulations governing external trade, that is, trade between Canada and foreign countries, as well as regulations in mat\u00adters affected with an interprovincial interest, or regulations which are necessary as auxiliary to some Dominion measure relating to trade generally throughout the Dominion, and dealing with matters not falling within s. 92, such as, for example, the incorporation of Dominion companies, are within the purview of that head. In the elucidation of the words by Sir Montague Smith in Parsons case[2], it is pointed out that there is a field over which the powers given by that head may operate quite consistently with the settled principle (Montreal Street Rly. Co. v. City of Montreal[3], which precludes the Dominion from inter\u00adfering (in attempted exercise of the authority thereby given) with matters which are not of unquestionably Cana\u00addian interest and importance, or which are in each province of local or private interest only. Sir Montague Smith's words are these (Parson's case)[4]:\nConstruing therefore the words \"regulation of trade and commerce \" by the various aids to their interpretation above suggested, they would include political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of parliament, regulation of trade in matters of interprovincial concern, and it may be that they would include general regulation of trade affect\u00ading the whole Dominion. Their Lordships abstain on the present occasion from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the Dominion Parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the present case to say that, in their view its authority to legislate for the regula\u00adtion of trade and commerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade, such as the business of fire insurance in a single province. This passage received formal approval by the Judicial Committee in Wharton's case[5], where Lord Haldane said:\nTheir Lordships find themselves in agreement with the interpreta\u00adtion put by the Judicial Committee in Citizens' Insurance Co. v. Parsons[6], on head 2 of s. 91, which confers exclusive power on the Dominion Parliament to make laws regulating trade.\nIn the Insurance case[7], it was laid down that\nthe authority of the Dominion Parliament to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not extend to the regulation by a licensing system of a particular trade in which Canadians would otherwise be free to engage in the provinces.\nThe distinction signalized in these cases is that indicated above, and fully expounded in Montreal Street Ry. v. City of Montreal[8], between what is national in its scope and concern and that which in each of the provinces is of private or local, that is to say, of provincial, interest.\nThe judgment of Lord Haldane in the Board of Com\u00admerce case[9], requires special examination. And, first of all, it is necessary to remember what it was the Judicial Committee was there dealing with. The Board of Com\u00admerce Act, 1919, had set up a Board endowed with most extraordinary powers, both regulative and inquisitorial, enabling it to examine minutely into the affairs of everybody, traders and non-traders alike, with the view to discovering and preventing the hoarding of the necessaries of life (as defined by the Board), or unfairness in the prices exacted from the purchasers of such commodities, and to promulgate regulations and particular orders in regard to all these things. There are few incidents of the daily economic life of private persons which the powers of the Board were not capable of reaching. These powers extended to matters of interprovincial concern, no doubt, but the predominant feature of the statute was its attempt to control matters of individual and local interest. An attempt was made to support the enactment as enacted under the residuary powers of s. 91, and also by reference to head no. 2 of the same section, Trade and Commerce. As to the first of these arguments, the contention was that, the matter of the legislation being the subjects of hoarding and fair prices, it must in the circumstances of the time be held to have a distinct Dominion aspect, to have, that is to say, in each province, an aspect which was the concern of the Dominion as a whole, and which therefore would fall within the same category as the subject matter dealt with in Russell's case[10] ; that the subject matter of the legislation was not property and civil rights within the provinces, nor was it in each of the provinces substanti\u00adally of local or private interest, but was strictly a matter of national concern in the sense in which those words were used in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[11].\nWhile the legislation dealt with matters which undoubt\u00adedly were of Dominion competence, it was, I repeat, mainly designed for the minute regulation of the affairs of indi\u00adviduals, in such a manner that, if it was to take effect, the Board established thereby might supersede the provincial legislatures in no unimportant degree. It is with refer\u00adence to this state of affairs that the language which now follows must be interpreted: \" It can, therefore,\" said Lord Haldane,\nbe only under necessity, in highly exceptional circumstances, such as cannot be assumed to exist in the present case, that the liberty of the in-habitants of the provinces may be restricted by the Parliament of Can\u00adada, and that the Dominion can intervene in the interests of Canada as a whole in questions such as the present one. For, normally, the sub\u00adject-matter to be dealt with in the case would be one falling within s. 92. Nor do the words in s. 91, the \"Regulation of trade and commerce,\" if taken by themselves, assist the present Dominion contention. It may well be, if the Parliament of Canada had, by reason of an altogether exceptional situation, capacity to interfere, that these words would apply so as to enable that Parliament to oust the exclusive character of the provincial powers under s. 92.\nLord Haldane then proceeds to refer specifically to Wharton's case[12], and to the Insurance case[13]. He lays down two propositions, but these, as we shall see, do not derogate from the proposition in Wharton's case, in which the language in Parson's case[14] is explicitly approved. He says nothing about it, and for a very good reason. In the Board of Commerce case[15], he is not dealing, as we have seen, with matters that Sir Montague Smith mentions as constituting a field for the operation of the Dominion power in relation to trade and commerce, after excluding from the operation of that power matters possessing, in themselves, no immediate interprovincial concern or na\u00adtional concern, but possessing only a local or private in\u00adterest in each of the provinces. Such matters-matters which in the passage quoted are designated as properly within the field of s. 91 (2)\u2014were not before the Board, because while the statute legislated upon them, its enact\u00adments included local matters also, to which, as I have said, the statute was mainly directed; and the operation of the statute in relation to the two classes of matters was so inseparable, that it must be ultra vires, as a whole, unless Dominion jurisdiction over such local matters could be maintained.\nOf the two propositions, enunciated by Lord Haldane, both of which are expressed in the affirmative, the first is that, while s. 91, head 2, was, in Wharton's case (1), held to be susceptible of lending aid to Dominion powers con\u00adferred by the general language of s. 91,\nthat was because the regulation of the trading of Dominion Companies was sought to be invoked only in furtherance of a general power which the Dominion Parliament possessed independently of it.\nThe matters in respect of which head 2 was invoked in Wharton's case[16], and to which Lord Haldane herein refers, were not, in fact, in themselves, matters belonging to or immediately connected with the subject of interpro\u00advincial trade or that of foreign trade. They were matters connected with the exercise, within each of the provinces, by Dominion trading companies of their constitutional capacities, which they had received from the Dominion; matters which, in each of the provinces, would have fallen within the subjects described in head 13 or head 16 of s. 92, had it not been for the language of head 11, by virtue of which the provincial jurisdiction in relation to \" incor\u00adporation of companies \" was confined to the creation of \" companies with provincial objects,\" and, accordingly, the subject of the incorporation of companies with \" objects \" other than \" provincial \" was relegated to the residuary capacity of the Dominion, under the reservation expressed in the general words of section 91.\nThe British North America Act treats a trading com\u00adpany created by the Dominion, under this residuary authority, as endowed with the status of an incorporated trading company in all the provinces; and its status and constitu\u00adtion as a corporation as being, therefore, matters not of provincial, but of direct and immediate national concern. Consequently, as Lord Haldane observes, the manner in which such trading companies shall be permitted to trade within each of the provinces acquires character as a matter of interest throughout the Dominion. Matters, otherwise of local concern only, and, so long as they continue to be so, outside the scope of head 2 of section 91, may become, in virtue of their relation to the trading activities of such companies, matters of national concern, and, in so far as they are so, subject to regulation under that head. It seems hardly necessary to observe that, here, there is nothing pointing to the conclusion that the regulative authority in respect of Trade and Commerce, in its appli\u00adcation to matters which, in themselves, are involved in in\u00adterprovincial or foreign trade, can only be invoked in aid of the execution of some power which the Dominion possesses independently of that head. Lord Haldane's proposition is strictly limited to matters which, in themselves, and inde\u00adpendently of their connection with a Dominion trading company, would be of local concern only.\nHis Lordship's second proposition is that\nwhere there was no such power in that Parliament, as in the case of the Dominion Insurance Act, it was held otherwise, and that the authority of the Dominion. Parliament to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce did not, by itself, enable interference with particular trades in which Canadians would, apart from any right of interference conferred by these words above, be free to engage in the provinces[17].\nThe statute which the Board had to consider in the Insur\u00adance case[18] was one which professed to regulate, by a licensing system, the whole business of insurance, including business entirely local, within a particular province; and his Lordship is here dealing with the business of insurance in so far as it might be regarded as a branch of trade, as a local matter. In the same judgment, the Dominion Parliament was held to be empowered, in \" regulation of Trade and Commerce,\" to regulate the conditions upon which a foreign insurance company should be entitled to carry on its busi\u00adness in a single province in Canada. The authorities relied upon were principally Hodge v. The Queen[19], and the decision on the McCarthy Act Reference[20], which affirmed the exclusive authority of the provinces to regulate local trade within their own borders.\nI do not think further examination of the authorities would be useful. The more recent cases leave entirely untouched the view embodied in the passage quoted from Parsons case[21], and expressly adopted in Wharton's case[22], that foreign trade and trading matters of interpro\u00advincial concern are among the matters included within \u2014the ambit of head 2, s. 91.\nIt is not necessary, for the purposes of this appeal, to determine whether or not this statute could, in its entirety, be lawfully enacted by the Dominion Parliament alone. It is sufficient, for our present purposes, that in its character\u00adistic and ruling provisions (the qualifying words in s. 10 being neglected), it aims at control of trade \"in matters of interprovincial concern,\" in such a degree as to exclude it from the category of legislation in respect of matters local in the provincial sense; and that the Committee of Direction construes the powers it derives from the Act as enabling it to exercise such control, and executes those powers accordingly.\nIn the result, the appeal should succeed with costs throughout. The appellant is entitled to a declaration that he is not liable to the imposition of any levy by the re\u00adspondents on, or in respect of, any product marketed by him; and that the respondents have no authority in any manner, to regulate or control the \"marketing\" (in the sense defined by the Act) of his product for consumption beyond the boundaries of British Columbia.\nNEWCOMBE J: The legislation in question, unless within property and civil rights in the province or private and local matters in the province, is clearly incompetent to the legislature; and, if it come within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91, it is, by the concluding paragraph of that section, not within any of the enumerations of s. 92. Now I wish to exclude, for the purposes of this judg\u00adment, any conclusion as to what the result would he if the Produce Marketing Act of British Columbia were not within any of the Dominion enumerated powers; there it appears that differences might emerge, and these are sub\u00adjects of debate in which it is not necessary that we should now engage, because I am in complete agreement with the majority of my learned brothers that the legislation is re\u00adferable to the exclusive Dominion power to regulate trade and commerce.\nI thought there were two ways, either of which would serve to demonstrate the invalidity of the Act, and I had proposed to shew, independently of s. 91, that the legisla\u00adtion was neither property and civil rights nor private and local matters in the province; and, consequently, not within any of the provincial enumerations\u2014a ratio decidendi which I thought free from difficulty. But, seeing that the majority of the Court has reached practically the same result by the other route, holding that the subject, matter is embraced in the regulation of trade and commerce, where I think it strictly belongs, I am content, for the present purposes, to leave the extent of the provincial field, as defined by s. 92, unexplored.\nCANNON J.\u2014My brother Duff has in his opinion gone into all the details of the Act and regulations and, to avoid repetition, I will shortly state my views.\nThe Act, if restricted to the local provincial market, would, according to the evidence, have affected less than ten per cent of the fruit and vegetables grown in British Columbia; its intent and purpose was to regulate the trade outside the province. Its actual operation affects the shipment to points in Canada outside of British Columbia of about 90 per cent of the products.\nThe Act is intended to operate interprovincially, and its clauses and the regulations adopted to carry it out con\u00adstitute barriers to free trade between the provinces and clash with section 121 of the British North America Act, 1867, which, in enacting that\nall articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other provinces,\nprevents, in my humble opinion, any hindrance, such as that now before us, by legislation of the untrammelled commerce between the provinces in all \" articles of the growth, produce or manufacture\" of any one of them.\nBy the Produce Marketing Act of 1927, the province of British Columbia imposed levies on the fruits or veget\u00adables grown or produced in a large area, including appel\u00adlant's farm, and obliged all shippers to secure a licence to market and sell products of the province anywhere within the Dominion under a penalty for each contravention. Even leaving aside the licence, and considering only the levy, I believe, as pointed out by my brother Duff, that such imposts on commodities, on trade in commodities, have always been regarded as indirect taxes for a public purpose and come under the head of \" taxation \"\u2014which is dealt with in Part VIII of the British North America Act, where is found article 121. It may be considered as an excise tax which necessarily has a tendency to affect, and affects, the price of the product to the customer in another province. To use the words of Lord MacMillan, in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Company[23], the levy in question\nis an export tax falling within the category of duties of customs and excise, and as such, as well as by reason of its inherent nature as an. indirect tax, could not competently be imposed by the provincial legislature.\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that this legislation is an attempt to impose by indirect taxation and regulations an obstacle to one of the main purposes of Confederation, which was, ultimately, to form an economic unit of all the provinces in British North America with absolute freedom of trade between its constituent parts.\nThe appellant is entitled to a declaration that he is not liable to the imposition of any levy by the respondent on any product marketed by him, and that the respondent has no authority in any manner to regulate or control the .marketing and sale by him of any product to any point beyond the boundaries of British Columbia, with costs throughout against respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pincott & Pincott.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

Therefore, a by-law passed by a meeting, presided over by the mayor, and at which all six councillors were present, will be held to be regularly adopted if carried by a vote of three in favour and two against, one councillor refusing to vote.\nThe notice of motion required by Art. 389 of the Municipal Code for the passing of a by-law, which merely mentions the object of the by-law without giving in detail its provisions and conditions, is good within the requirements of that article.\nThe allegation, that a by-law has not been adopted by a majority vote as required by the Municipal Code, raises a question of ultra vires sufficient to justify the party attacking it proceeding by action before the Superior Court under the provisions of Art. 50 \u0421.P.C.\nWhen a by-law and a contract are approved a second time by a municipal council, under art. 107 M.C., because the head of the council refused to sign them, they are, as a result of the second vote, legal and valid ipso facto as if they had been signed. Therefore, the fact that a notarial deed based on the by-law and incorporating the contract is closed immediately after the second meeting of the council and without awaiting fifteen days after the publication of the by-law, is immaterial and does not affect the validity of the contract.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 48 \u041a.B. 549) rev.

Ils concluent \u00e9galement \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un contrat bas\u00e9 sur ce r\u00e8glement.\nIls ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le r\u00e8glement est injuste, ill\u00e9gal, ultra vires et nul pour un bon nombre de raisons qui ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Ils ont ajout\u00e9 que le contrat intervenu \u00e0 la suite du r\u00e8glement est aussi ill\u00e9gal, nul et inexistant, comme cons\u00e9quence de la nullit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement, et parce qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 avant que le r\u00e8glement ne f\u00fbt en vigueur. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu le contrat, de m\u00eame qu\u2019elle avait refus\u00e9 de mettre le r\u00e8glement de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 le jugement sur le motif principal que le r\u00e8glement n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement adopt\u00e9. Nous verrons par la suite en quoi consiste ce motif. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019avaient offert aucune preuve de quelques-unes de leurs all\u00e9gations sp\u00e9ciales et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir aucun acte \u010finjustice ou de man\u0153uvre frauduleuse de la part du conseil municipal. Cette partie du jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de s\u2019en occuper ici; d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question devant cette cour. Cela fait dispara\u00eetre l\u2019argument que le prix fix\u00e9 pour effectuer l\u2019achat de l\u2019aqueduc est exorbitant et constitue une exploitation des contribuables, celui que le r\u00e8glement ne pourvoit pas \u00e0 la protection du village contre l\u2019incendie, et que l\u2019aqueduc, m\u00eame avec les am\u00e9liorations projet\u00e9es, sera insuffisant pour cette fin, et aussi celui qui a trait aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de fermer les tuyaux de service des abonn\u00e9s et de les priver d\u2019eau dans un certain nombre de cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement. Du moment, en effet, que l\u2019accusation d\u2019injustice est \u00e9cart\u00e9e, il ne reste plus, pour chacun de ces points, que la question du pouvoir de la corporation municipale; et les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de nous signaler un article du code qui prohibait, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les conditions ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le r\u00e8glement et dans le contrat. La corporation mise-en-cause avait le droit de conc\u00e9der le privil\u00e8ge exclusif que ces derniers comportent. D\u00e8s que les conditions qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9fendues par le code municipal et qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas injustes, le conseil \u00e9tait souverain pour juger de leur opportunit\u00e9. Il va de soi que les tribunaux ne pouvaient en faire un cas d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, ni intervenir dans la discr\u00e9tion du conseil municipal.\nNous pouvons de m\u00eame \u00e9carter tout de suite la pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019avis qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait insuffisant. Cet avis se lisait comme suit:\nAvis de motion est donn\u00e9 par monsieur le conseiller * * * que le 20 juillet courant, \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance sp\u00e9ciale de ce conseil, il sera propos\u00e9 et pass\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant soit l\u2019achat de l\u2019aqueduc de la Corporation d\u2019Aqueduc de St-Casimir ou l\u2019octroi d\u2019une franchise \u00e0 cette m\u00eame compagnie pour l\u2019approvisionnement d\u2019eau aux contribuables de St-Casimir.\nL\u2019objection qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite est que cet avis ne contient pas les d\u00e9tails de toutes les clauses et conditions du r\u00e8glement. Nous croyons que, sous ce rapport, il est suffisant pour rencontrer les exigences de l\u2019article 359 du Code Municipal. Il suffit qu\u2019il fasse mention de l\u2019objet du r\u00e8glement qui doit \u00eatre propos\u00e9. Il est de la m\u00eame nature que l\u2019avis de promulgation (art. 366 \u0421.\u041c.). En indiquant l\u2019objet du r\u00e8glement, \u013eavis de motion ou l\u2019avis de promulgation informe tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de la nature de l\u2019ordonnance municipale projet\u00e9e ou adopt\u00e9e et constitue un avertissement qu\u2019elle est susceptible de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur toutes les questions qui se rattachent \u00e0 l\u2019objet mentionn\u00e9. L\u2019avis n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019aller au del\u00e0. Il est facile de voir qu\u2019en poussant la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses cons\u00e9quences logiques, toute modification importante du projet de r\u00e8glement serait prohib\u00e9e lorsque ce projet viendrait devant le conseil. Les conseillers seraient contraints d\u2019adopter ou de rejeter le r\u00e8glement en bloc. Un amendement qui ne serait pas couvert en d\u00e9tail par l\u2019avis de motion pr\u00e9alable se trouverait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019art. 359 tel qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par l\u2019argument qu\u2019on nous a soumis; et l\u0435 r\u00e8glement ainsi amend\u00e9 ne pourrait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 avant qu\u2019un nouvel avis ne f\u00fbt donn\u00e9. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi pour dire que cela n\u2019est jamais entr\u00e9 dans l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\nIl y a le fait que l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en la forme alternative:\nil sera propos\u00e9 * * * un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant soit \u013eachat de \u013eaqueduc * * * ou \u013eoctroi d\u2019une franchise, etc.\nCe moyen n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 ni devant nous, ni devant les autres cours. Pour cette raison, nous \u00e9vitons de nous prononcer l\u00e0-dessus. Dans le cas actuel, tous les membres du conseil \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents lors de la s\u00e9ance convoqu\u00e9e par cet avis. Personne n\u2019a alors soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objection \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avis. On a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la discussion en assumant que tout \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier. Nous n\u2019entendons pas \u00e9mettre une opinion sur ce point. Nous constatons seulement qu\u2019un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9; il comprenait l\u2019octroi d\u2019une franchise; le conseil au complet \u013ea accept\u00e9 comme satisfaisant. Dans les circonstances, toute irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de cette forme alternative de l\u2019avis serait au moins couverte par l\u2019article 14 du Code Municipal.\nIl nous reste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le point sur lequel la Cour du Banc du Roi s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e pour infirmer le jugement et le moyen subsidiaire qui concerne seulement le contrat consenti apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement. L\u2019avis de motion que nous avons reproduit ci-dessus ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, le conseil s\u2019assembla \u00e0 une session sp\u00e9ciale le 20 juillet 1928. Tous les membres \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents, \u00e0 savoir: six conseillers et le maire. L\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 et du projet du contrat qui y \u00e9tait annex\u00e9 fut propos\u00e9e. Le secr\u00e9taire en fit la lecture, puis voici comment le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la s\u00e9ance rapporte ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9:\nOn prend le vote sur la proposition de monsieur Gingras. Se prononcent pour l\u2019adoption de ce r\u00e8glement, M.M. Eudore Gingras, Charles Tessier et Joseph Bourbeau.\nSe prononcent contre: MM. Ovide Langlois et Xavier Frenette.\nLe conseiller Napol\u00e9on Trottier d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il ne vote pas sur cette question, qu\u2019il a des raisons l\u00e9gales qui l\u2019en emp\u00eachent, vu qu\u2019il a eu des menaces.\nLe r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 est donc adopt\u00e9 sur division. Le secr\u00e9taire demande \u00e0 M. le maire de signer ce r\u00e8glement, mais celui-ci refuse de le signer s\u00e9ance tenante.\nL\u2019article 107 du code municipal (paragraphes 3 et 4) est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que si le chef du conseil refuse d\u2019approuver et signer un r\u00e8glement et un contrat, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier les soumet de nouveau \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration du conseil \u00e0 sa session g\u00e9n\u00e9rale suivante, ou, apr\u00e8s avis, \u00e0 une session sp\u00e9ciale. Si une majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil approuve de nouveau le r\u00e8glement et le contrat,\nils seront l\u00e9gaux et valides comme s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par le chef du conseil et nonobstant son refus.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, un avis de convocation fut signifi\u00e9 aux membres du conseil pour une session sp\u00e9ciale qui serait tenue le 30 juillet. Le motif de cet avis \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\n1. Vu le refus de monsieur le maire de signer le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 cinquante-six accordant une franchise \u00e0 la Corporation d\u2019Aqueduc de St-Casimir, le dit r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par le conseil \u00e0 sa session du 20 juillet courant, ce r\u00e8glement sera soumis au conseil pour \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 de nouveau.\n2. Divers comptes approuv\u00e9s \u00e0 la session du 20 courant seront de nouveau soumis \u00e0 l\u2019approbation du conseil pour les m\u00eames raisons.\n3. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la session du 20 juillet courant sera aussi soumis \u00e0 l\u2019approbation du conseil.\nCette session sp\u00e9ciale eut lieu; et, de nouveau, tous les membres du conseil \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Voici l\u2019extrait du proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e:\nLecture est donn\u00e9e de l\u2019avis de convocation et du certificat de signification du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier attestant que le dit avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres du conseil.\nLecture est faite du r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 de cette municipalit\u00e9 et du projet de contrat y annex\u00e9, et il est propos\u00e9 par M. Eudore Gingras, second\u00e9 par M. Charles Tessier, tous deux \u2018conseillers, vu le refus de monsieur le maire de signer le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 adopt\u00e9 par le conseil \u00e0 sa session du 20 juillet courant et octroyant une franchise \u00e0 la Corporation d\u2019Aqueduc de St-Casimir, que ledit r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 et le projet de contrat y annex\u00e9 soient approuv\u00e9s tels que d\u00e9j\u00e0 approuv\u00e9s pour leur donner force l\u00e9gale malgr\u00e9 le refus du maire de signer.\nLe vote est pris. Se d\u00e9clarent contre cette proposition MM. les conseillers Ovide Langlois et Xavier Frenette. Votent pour: MM. les conseillers Eudore Gingras, Charles Tessier, Joseph Bourbeau et Napol\u00e9on Trottier, cette r\u00e9solution se trouvant donc adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 absolue des membres du conseil.\nA la suite de cette s\u00e9ance, le maire refusa de nouveau de signer le r\u00e8glement et le contrat, sur quoi, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019article 107 du code municipal, ce r\u00e8glement et ce contrat furent consid\u00e9r\u00e9s\nl\u00e9gaux et valides comme s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par le chef du conseil, et nonobstant son refus.\nLe jour m\u00eame, le contrat fut clos devant Mtre Joseph Lacoursi\u00e8re, N.P. Le 4 ao\u00fbt, le r\u00e8glement fut publi\u00e9; et, suivant la loi, il vint en vigueur 15 jours apr\u00e8s sa promulgation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le 19 ao\u00fbt 1928 (arts. 365 et 366 \u0421.\u041c.). Les demandeurs-intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9tendu que le r\u00e8glement\nn\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 la session du 20 juillet 1928, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a recueilli l\u2019adh\u00e9sion que de trois membres du conseil, alors que le conseil si\u00e9geait au complet;\nque, tel que constat\u00e9 le 30 juillet 1928, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 du v\u00e9to du maire, qui a refus\u00e9 de signer; que ce v\u00e9to n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, le r\u00e8glement n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau soumis au conseil apr\u00e8s le 30 juillet; et que, \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par les parties, il n\u2019\u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 de la part de la corporation municipale par aucun r\u00e8glement r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement adopt\u00e9 par son conseil, vu que m\u00eame le pr\u00e9tendu r\u00e8glement du 30 juillet n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore en vigueur.\nIl est \u00e9vident que si l\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du 20 juillet a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, celle du 30 juillet a rencontr\u00e9 toutes les exigences de la loi, malgr\u00e9 le refus du maire; et il s\u2019ensuit que si nous partageons l\u2019opinion de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, cela dispose de toutes les autres pr\u00e9tentions des demandeurs en ce qui concerne le r\u00e8glement. L\u2019all\u00e9gation que les parties ont sign\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment le 30 juillet n\u2019affecte que la validit\u00e9 du contrat. L\u2019argument des intim\u00e9s est bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 122 du code municipal:\n122. Toute question contest\u00e9e est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des membres pr\u00e9sents, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 les r\u00e8glements ou une disposition de la loi exigent un plus grand nombre de voix concordantes.\nIl est n\u00e9cessaire de reproduire \u00e9galement la version anglaise, parce que le texte n\u2019en est pas semblable:\n122. Every disputed question is decided by a majority of the votes of the members present, excepting in cases where any by-law or provision of law requires a greater number of concordant votes.\nOn remarque qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas dans la version fran\u00e7aise de mots correspondant \u00e0 \u201cof the votes\u201d dans la version anglaise. Nous \u00e9mettrons tout d\u2019abord l\u2019opinion que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence de ces mots, les deux versions ont le m\u00eame sens et veulent dire la m\u00eame chose; mais il n\u2019y a pas \u00e0 nier qu\u2019il existe \u201cune diff\u00e9rence entre les textes fran\u00e7ais et anglais\u201d. Dans ce cas, l\u2019article 15 du code municipal \u00e9dicte la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019il faut suivre:\n15. Lorsqu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre les textes fran\u00e7ais et anglais du pr\u00e9sent code, dans quelque article fond\u00e9 sur les lois existantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de sa promulgation, le texte le plus compatible avec les dispositions des lois existantes doit pr\u00e9valoir.\nLe code municipal actuel est entr\u00e9 en vigueur par proclamation le 1er novembre 1916. Il succ\u00e9dait au code de 1871, o\u00f9 les articles correspondants se lisaient comme suit:\n133. Toute question contest\u00e9e est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des membres pr\u00e9sents, sauf les cas o\u00f9 le vote des deux tiers des membres du conseil ou des membres pr\u00e9sents est requis par les dispositions de ce code.\n133. Every disputed question is decided by a majority of the votes of the members present, excepting in cases where in conformity with the provisions of this code, the votes of two-thirds of the members of the council or of the members present are required.\nLa m\u00eame difference existait donc entre les deux articles. L\u00e0 encore, le code de 1871 indique la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre (art. 18) et elle est la m\u00eame que celle qui nous est donn\u00e9e par l\u2019article 15 du pr\u00e9sent code. Il faut donc recourir aux \u201clois existantes\u201d \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la promulgation du code de 1871; et c\u2019est le texte le plus compatible avec ces lois qui doit pr\u00e9valoir. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019Acte des Municipalit\u00e9s et des Chemins du Bas-Canada, de 1855 (Statuts du Canada, 18 Victoria, c. 100). Au titre \u201cSessions des conseils municipaux, art, XII, parag. 6, on trouve ce qui suit: 6. Toutes questions contest\u00e9es seront d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 des voix des membres pr\u00e9sents, non compris le pr\u00e9sident; et, au oas de partage \u00e9gal des voix, le pr\u00e9sident aura voix pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante.\nLe texte angais est:\n6. All disputed questions shall be decided by a majority of the votes of the members present, not including the chairman; and when the votes are equally di vised, the chairman shall give the casting vote.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e dans l\u2019article 15 du pr\u00e9sent code, c\u2019est donc la version anglaise de l\u2019article 122 qui doit pr\u00e9valoir, si l\u2019on croit que vraiment la version fran\u00e7aise doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente.\nCette constatation simplifie singuli\u00e8rement la solution de la question soulev\u00e9e par les demandeurs. Ils affirment que, en vertu de l\u2019article 122 du code municipal, une question contest\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e que par la majorit\u00e9 absolue de tous les membres pr\u00e9sents. En se bornant au texte fran\u00e7ais, les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que, \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du 20 juillet, il e\u00fbt fallu d\u00e8s lors quatre votes au moins pour constituer la majorit\u00e9 requise. La loi \u00e9tant exprim\u00e9e par la version anglaise, elle exige seulement \u201ca majority of the votes of the members present\u201d. Grammaticalement et litt\u00e9ralement, cela veut dire: la majorit\u00e9 de ceux qui votent. Or, le 20 juillet, le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 a obtenu cette majorit\u00e9. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement.\nC\u2019est bien ainsi, d\u2019ailleurs, que tout le conseil du village de St-Casimir l\u2019a compris, tel que cela appara\u00eet par les proc\u00e8s-verbaux des sessions des 20 et 30 juillet, et par l\u2019avis de convocation \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re s\u00e9ance. Le r\u00e9sultat auquel cette cour en arrive est exactement celui que le conseil de St-Casimir avait en vue lorsqu\u2019il a tenu ses deux s\u00e9ances.\nLe proc\u00e8s-verbal de la s\u00e9ance du 20 juillet d\u00e9clare que le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0 par le conseil. L\u2019avis de convocation de la session du 30 juillet fait la m\u00eame d\u00e9claration et est donn\u00e9 pour se conformer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 107 C.M. Enfin, le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la session du 30 juillet d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que, \u00e0 cette date, le conseil entendait suivre les prescriptions de cet article; et la r\u00e9solution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 absolue porte\nque ledit r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 et le projet de contrat y annex\u00e9 sont approuv\u00e9s tels que d\u00e9j\u00e0 approuv\u00e9s pour leur donner force l\u00e9gale malgr\u00e9 le refus du maire de signer. Nous soulignons ces faits simplement pour indiquer que, de la part du conseil et de la corporation de St-Casimir, on a bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement comme adopt\u00e9 d\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance du 20 juillet, et l\u2019on a tenu celle du 30 juillet uniquement pour purger le refus du maire.\nNous avons dit au commencement de cette discussion que, \u00e0 notre avis, malgr\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence du texte, la version fran\u00e7aise ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans un sens plus restreint que la version anglaise. Il y a des cas o\u00f9 le code exige pour la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une question la majorit\u00e9 absolue de tous les membres du conseil. Il y en a d\u2019autres o\u00f9 il requiert le concours des deux tiers de tous les membres. M\u00eame sans la disposition prevalente du texte anglais, nous aurions \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 envisager les mots \u201cla majorit\u00e9\u201d, dans le texte fran\u00e7ais, comme ayant trait \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des votes; et les mots \u201cdes membres pr\u00e9sents\u201d comme ayant pour but d\u2019indiquer qu\u2019il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire que ce vote repr\u00e9sente la majorit\u00e9 de tous les membres du conseil pr\u00e9sents ou non.\nLa suite de l\u2019article 122 C.M. l\u2019indique, en ajoutant: \u201csauf dans le cas o\u00f9 les r\u00e8glements ou une disposition de la loi exigent un plus grand nombre de voix concordantes\u201d. Cela r\u00e9sulte \u00e9galement de l\u2019article 123 \u0421.\u041c., qui dit que\nle chef du conseil ou le pr\u00e9sident ne peut voter qu\u2019en cas de partage \u00e9gal des voix.\nLe chef du conseil ou le pr\u00e9sident sont des membres du conseil. Ils sont compris dans le terme \u201cmembres pr\u00e9sents\u201d de l\u2019article 122 C.M. Il n\u2019est pas plausible de penser que le l\u00e9gislateur e\u00fbt voulu que le maire ou le pr\u00e9sident compt\u00e2t dans le nombre des membres pr\u00e9sents pour former la majorit\u00e9 exig\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 que le code ne lui perm\u00eet pas de voter.\nIl existe une autre consid\u00e9ration pour adopter cette interpr\u00e9tation. C\u2019est l\u2019importance de sauvegarder les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les droits des tiers. Il est d\u00e9sirable que ceux-ci, en recevant la copie certifi\u00e9e d\u2019une r\u00e9solution d\u2019un conseil municipal, puissent la consid\u00e9rer comme ayant la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire. Ils ne peuvent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pour savoir si l\u2019un ou plusieurs des conseillers \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s dans le vote qui s\u2019est donn\u00e9 ou s\u2019ils se sont \u00e0 bon droit abstenus de voter. Les questions de ce genre doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance m\u00eame du conseil et par le conseil lui-m\u00eame, afin que, une fois le vote donn\u00e9, sa l\u00e9galit\u00e9 sous ce rapport ne soit plus en doute. L\u2019article 124 du Code municipal le d\u00e9montre. Il d\u00e9fend \u00e0 un membre du conseil de voter sur une question dans laquelle il a un \u201cint\u00e9r\u00eat personnel distinct de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des autres contribuables\u201d; mais si, \u00e0 raison de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat, le droit de vote du conseiller ou du maire sont mis en doute, il faut qu\u2019il y ait objection; et cette objection est d\u00e9cid\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement par le conseil lors du vote. Cette d\u00e9cision du conseil est, dans un certain sens, finale (Provost v. Corporation de la Paroisse de Sainte-Anne de Varennes)[2]. En effet, si le conseil d\u00e9cide que le membre a un int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel, il ne vote pas. S\u2019il vote sans objection, malgr\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel, il est passible d\u2019une amende; mais\nce vote ne vicie pas les proc\u00e9dures du conseil \u00e0 \u013e\u00e9gard des tiers de bonne foi.\nCe souci de prot\u00e9ger les tiers, comme il est naturel, appara\u00eet constamment dans le code municipal; et, pour en donner un exemple, on trouve dans le rapport des commissaires relatif au code de 1916, les passages suivants:\nThe amendment made by article 14 to article 16 of the old code tends to make it more difficult to annul municipal proceedings because of non-observance of formalities.\n* * *\nArticle 124 amends article 135 of the old code in such a way as to protect third parties in good faith who negotiate with municipal corporations.\nC\u2019est la situation que nous avons ici. La corporation d\u2019Aqueduc de St-Casimir, l\u2019appelante, est un \u201ctiers de bonne foi\u201d qui a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec une corporation municipale. Ces d\u00e9clarations des commissaires, exprim\u00e9es d\u2019ailleurs dans le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 124 \u0421.\u041c., ont d\u2019autant plus d\u2019importance que c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cet article que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont discut\u00e9 relativement au cas du conseiller Trottier et de sa d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il s\u2019abstiendrait de voter parce qu\u2019il avait \u201cdes raisons l\u00e9gales qui l\u2019en emp\u00eachent, vu qu\u2019il a eu des menaces\u201d.\nIci le conseiller Trottier a fait sa d\u00e9claration. Aucun membre du conseil n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objection \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019abstienne de voter. Il n\u2019y a donc pas eu d\u2019enqu\u00eate devant le conseil pour savoir quelle \u00e9tait la port\u00e9e des menaces qu\u2019on lui avait faites. Tout le conseil a accept\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration, et \u013eon a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au vote sans tenir compte de sa pr\u00e9sence. Nous ne sommes pas pr\u00eats \u00e0 dire, en l\u2019absence de preuve faite en cette cause sur la nature et le but des menaces qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un cas pr\u00e9vu par \u013earticle 124 (voir Guay v. Corporation du Village de la Malbaie[3]; B\u00e9lair v. Royal Electric Co.[4]. Apparemment le conseil fut de cet avis, comme le prouve le fait qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration. Rien dans le dossier n\u2019est venu d\u00e9montrer que Trottier avait eu tort de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il ne devait pas voter, et que le conseil s\u2019\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9 en se rangeant \u00e0 son avis. Or, s\u2019il ne devait pas voter, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 124 \u0421.\u041c., cela nous ram\u00e8ne de nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 122, pour dire qu\u2019en pareil cas, et m\u00eame ind\u00e9pendamment de la version anglaise, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9vident qu\u2019un conseiller qui n\u2019a pas le droit de vote ne peut pas \u00eatre inclus parmi les \u201cmembres pr\u00e9sents\u201d, dont la majorit\u00e9 doit d\u00e9cider une question.\nPour ces raisons \u00e9galement, nous serions d\u2019avis que le vote du 20 juillet \u00e9tait suffisant pour adopter le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56. Comme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, nous ajouterions que, pour les fins de ce vote, Trottier devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 absent. A vrai dire, d\u2019ailleurs, cette solution est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, puisque de cette fa\u00e7on la pr\u00e9sence de membres du conseil qui s\u2019abstiennent de voter ne peut contribuer \u00e0 former le quorum et emp\u00eache ainsi une question d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par un nombre de membres inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui est requis pour tenir une session du conseil et exp\u00e9dier les affaires.\nIl suit de tout ce que nous venons de dire que nous sommes d\u2019avis que le r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 56 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du 20 juillet. Le maire ayant refus\u00e9 de signer le r\u00e8glement et le contrat apr\u00e8s leur adoption par le conseil, nous avons vu qu\u2019\u00e0 une s\u00e9ance suivante r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement convoqu\u00e9e la majorit\u00e9 absolue des membres du conseil a de nouveau approuv\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement et le contrat. En pareil cas, suivant l\u2019article 107 du code municipal, paragraphe 4, tels r\u00e8glement et * * * contrat sont l\u00e9gaux et valides comme s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par le chef du conseil et nonobstant son refus.\nCette disposition de la loi \u00e9carte \u013eobjeetion soulev\u00e9e par les demandeurs-intimes \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du contrat et bas\u00e9e sur le fait que ce dernier aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par les parties le jour m\u00eame de \u013eadoption d\u00e9finitive du r\u00e8glement, le 30 juillet, sans attendre l\u2019expiration des quinze jours apr\u00e8s \u013eavis de publication.\nLa franchise a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9e \u00e0 \u013eappelante par la corporation du village de St-Casimir en vertu des pouvoirs accord\u00e9s par le paragraphe 2 de \u013earticle 408 du code municipal. Ces pouvoirs s\u2019exercent par r\u00e8glement. Le r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait tout ce qu\u2019il fallait pour accorder cette franchise. Il suffisait que l\u2019appelante en accept\u00e2t les conditions pour que le contrat f\u00fbt complet. Cette acceptation pouvait prendre n\u2019importe quelle forme; et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019incorporer dans un document notari\u00e9, comme la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u le 30 juillet par devant ma\u00eetre Joseph Lacoursi\u00e8re, N.P., reproduisait, pour ainsi dire, mot pour mot le texte du r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56. Ce contrat n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire et il \u00e9tait surerogatoire. Les relations entre la Compagnie d\u2019Aqueduc et la Corporation Municipale de St-Casimir eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 exactement les m\u00eames si ce document n\u2019e\u00fbt pas exist\u00e9, \u00e0 la seule condition que la compagnie e\u00fbt manifest\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation municipale son acceptation des termes du r\u00e8glement.\nDans les circonstances, l\u2019attaque contre le contrat, d\u00e8s que le r\u00e8glement est maintenu, n\u2019a plus aucune importance; et nous aurions pu lui appliquer ce passage du jugement de M. le Juge Rivard dans la cause de Roy v. Corporation \u010f Aubert Gallion[5]:\nTout para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ouvertement \u00e0 la connaissance du conseil et m\u00eame du public, sans fraude et de bonne foi. Il n\u2019en est, du reste, r\u00e9sult\u00e9 rien dont les contribuables puissent se plaindre.\nEn vertu de \u013earticle 107, la seconde approbation donn\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil le 30 juillet a eu pour effet de rendre le r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 56 et le contrat qui y \u00e9tait annex\u00e9 ipso facto\nl\u00e9gaux et valides comme s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par le chef du conseil et nonobstant son refus. En pareil cas, de la part de la corporation du village de St-Casimir, le contrat n\u2019avait plus besoin d\u2019\u00eatre sign\u00e9, puisque la r\u00e9solution qui \u013eapprouvait pour la seconde fois avait le m\u00eame effet qu\u2019une signature. Naturellement, le tout restait subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le r\u00e8glement f\u00fbt publi\u00e9. R\u00e8glement et contrat n\u2019ont eu force et effet que quinze jours apr\u00e8s cette publication.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que nous sommes d\u2019avis que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi doit \u00eatre infirm\u00e9, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli, et l\u2019action des demandeurs-intimes doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nLa conclusion \u00e0 laquelle nous en sommes arriv\u00e9s nous dispense de discuter le point qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 de savoir si les demandeurs, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pouvaient se pourvoir au moyen de l\u2019action directe devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en vertu de l\u2019article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, et s\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb suivre la m\u00e9thode pourvue par les articles 430 et suivants du Code municipal. Qu\u2019il nous suffise de dire que, suivant nous, l\u2019all\u00e9gation que le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 56 n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 requise en vertu du code soulevait un cas d\u2019ultra vires qui justifiait la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Shannon Realties Co. v. Ville de St-Michel[6], tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment appliqu\u00e9 par cette cour dans les causes de C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Corporation du Comt\u00e9 de Drummond[7], et Donohue v. Corporation of the Parish of St. Etienne de la Malbaie[8]. A cela vient s\u2019ajouter le fait que les intim\u00e9s demandaient l\u2019annulation d\u2019un contrat et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas ouverture \u00e0 une action de ce genre en vertu de l\u2019article 430 du code municipal.\nUne objection plus s\u00e9rieuse e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 que les demandeurs n\u2019ont pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat direct, imm\u00e9diat, sp\u00e9cial et distinct des autres contribuables.

National Fruit Co. Ltd., [1931] S.C.R. 60\nDate: 1930-11-03\nIsaac Stanley (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe National Fruit Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1930: October 15; 1930: November 3.\nPresent: Anglin \u0421.J.C. and Newcombe, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nNegligence\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014\u201dUltimate\u201d negligence\u2014Motor vehicles\u2014Motor truck striking pedestrian\u2014Restricted vision of driver by reason of car in front\u2014Duty of driver in such case.\nPlaintiff, a pedestrian, who had started to cross a street intersection diagonally, was struck by defendant\u2019s truck, which was making a left turn behind a sedan car. The trial judge found that the accident was caused by the truck driver\u2019s negligence and gave judgment to plaintiff for damages. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal, Sask., which held that, under all the circumstances, the accident was not attributable to negligence of the truck driver (24 Sask. L.R. 137). Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissenting): The judgment at trial should be restored. An important finding by the trial judge, which had support in the evidence and should be accepted, was that plaintiff did not move from the moment he stood still to permit cars ahead of the truck to pass him to the moment he was struck. It was therefore obvious that the truck, in making the turn, did not follow the sedan\u2019s track but turned further to the right, that is, made a wider curve (towards the plaintiff); in doing so, the truck driver was driving over a portion of the street not shewn by the passing of the sedan to be clear of traffic, and (as he kept his truck only 6 or 8 feet behind the sedan) without having in view the portion of the street where plaintiff stood. There was a duty upon the truck driver not to drive over a portion of the street of which he had, by reason of keeping so close to the sedan, only a restricted vision, and on which he knew pedestrians were in the habit of crossing, except at a rate of speed which permitted him to stop within the limits of his restricted vision; and that duty he failed to observe. The trial judge\u2019s finding that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence could not, on the evidence, be said to be wrong; and, even if his failure to look out for the truck\u2019s approach was negligence, it did not contribute to the accident except in the sense that it was a sine qua non; the real cause of the accident was the subsequent and severable negligence of the truck driver (Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute, [1922] 1 A.C. 129, referred to).\nPer Anglin C.J.\u0421. (with whose conclusion Smith J. concurred) (dissenting): The evidence in support of the trial judge\u2019s findings, that defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries and that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, leaves their accuracy doubtful, to say the least. His finding that, even if plaintiff was guilty of negligence, the defendant might, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the consequences thereof (Tuff v. War-men, 5 C.B.N.S., 573) was not warranted by the evidence. It appeared from the judgment of the trial judge that, while he took into account \u201cultimate\u201d negligence of defendant in so far as defendant might actually have avoided the consequence of any contributory negligence of plaintiff, his mind had not been directed to an important aspect of the case, namely, that class of \u201cultimate\u201d negligence considered in B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach, [1916] 1 A.C. 7.19, i.e., disabling negligence anterior in fact to plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, but of such a character that its effects endured and became operative after such contributory negligence had intervened. The Court of Appeal, while finding, on evidence which could not be said to be insufficient to justify it, that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, did not consider or pass upon the question of \u201cultimate\u201d negligence. A new trial was necessary in order that all the issues in the action might be fully considered and determined.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Bigelow J. in favour of the plaintiff in an action for damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of being knocked down by the defendant\u2019s truck, which, at the time of the accident, was being driven by the defendant\u2019s servant in the course of his duties. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored (Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissenting, who held that there should be a new trial.)\nRussell Hartney for the appellant.\nA. E. Bence K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Newcombe, Lamont and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan (1), reversing the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiff in an action for damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of being knocked down by the defendant\u2019s truck, which, at the time of the collision, was being driven by the defendant\u2019s servant. The learned trial judge found that the driver of the truck had been guilty of negligence causing the accident by (a) driving at a rate of speed and in a manner dangerous to the public on a public highway under the circumstances; (b) not keeping a proper look-out for pedestrians; (c) driving his truck too close to the car in front which obstructed his view. The relevant provisions of the Vehicles Act (1924, c. 42) are:\u2014\n26. No person shall drive a motor vehicle on a public highway recklessly or negligently, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public having regard to all circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the highway, and the amount of traffic which actually is at the time, or might reasonably be expected to be on the highway.\n43 (3). When loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle, shall be upon such owner or driver.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] held that the defendant had discharged the onus resting on it under section 43, and had established that the damage suffered by the plaintiff was not the result of negligence or improper conduct on the part of its driver.\nThe scene of the accident was in the public street in Saskatoon at the intersection of 20th Street and Avenue A. Both streets are paved. Avenue A runs north and south and is 46 feet wide from curb to curb, while 20th Street runs east and west and is 56 feet wide from curb to curb. It does not, however, run farther east than Avenue A, so that any vehicle coming east on 20th Street must turn either north or south on Avenue A. The plaintiff, on the afternoon of the accident, had been walking north on the side-walk on the east side of Avenue A, about opposite the south sidewalk of 20th Street. Being desirous of going to the King Edward Hotel on the north west corner of Avenue A and 20th Street, instead of crossing the avenue and then 20th Street at right angles, which crossings were marked on the pavement by yellow lines, he started to go diagonally across Avenue A. Having proceeded about 20 feet he saw an automobile coming along the avenue from the south, and also a Ford sedan, followed by a truck, coming along 20th Street from the west. He stood still to allow them to go by. To the northwest from where he stopped and in the general direction of the King Edward Hotel there was on the street a silent policeman around which, to the east, vehicles, coming off 20th Street and going north on Avenue A, had to pass.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s story is that when he saw the car coming from the south, and the sedan and the truck coming from the west, all these cars were travelling at about 15 miles per hour; that as the sedan came to the intersection it slackened its speed to permit the car from the south to pass, as it had the right of way; that the sedan fell in behind the car from the south\u2014three or four feet behind it; that the car from the south passed between him and the silent policeman at a distance of about two feet from him; that the sedan following, likewise passed him but at a distance of about six feet. After that he has no recollection of the immediate subsequent events. The plaintiff was struck by the radiator of the truck and very severely injured. He says, when he was struck, he had not moved from the spot where he was standing when the first car went by. In this he was corroborated by an independent witness, Charles Leasch, and the learned trial judge found as a fact that he had not moved. When asked why he was not looking out for the truck, the plaintiff said:\u2014\nI was watching the car ahead of the truck. The truck was behind that car, and the car was coming quite close to me then; it was coming quite close to the other car, and I was watching the two, the first one, and the other one coming quite close to it, and I was watching the first car, ahead of the truck, and it disappeared just as it was passing me.\nThe plaintiff was, therefore, aware that the truck was coming towards him behind the sedan.\nThe story of Harry Dunlop, the defendant\u2019s driver, is that he was driving a one ton truck 16 feet 8 inches long; that he followed a Ford sedan down 20th Street and around the turn at the intersection; that the moment the sedan had passed him the plaintiff again started on his way across the street and stepped in front of the truck; that the truck was proceeding around the intersection six or eight feet behind the sedan and at a speed of about 10 miles per hour; that he did not see the plaintiff until the sedan got out of the way; that the plaintiff was then about six feet in front of him and it was too late to avoid the accident; that the moment he saw the plaintiff he applied the brakes and stopped the truck. The truck, according to the tests made subsequent to the accident, could be stopped in 7 feet 10 inches, if going at ten miles per hour, and in 53 feet, if going twenty miles per hour. A policeman, at the scene of the accident almost immediately after it happened, measured the skid marks made by the wheel of the truck after the brakes were applied and stated that the wheel had skidded eight feet.\nDunlop further says that but for the sedan \u0456n front of him he could have seen the plaintiff whom he struck with his radiator but that at no time after he saw the plaintiff could he have done anything to avoid the accident. He admits, however, that he knew that pedestrians were in the habit of walking diagonally across Avenue A. The witness, Leasch, testified that when they were taking the plaintiff from under the truck Dunlop said: \u201cGod, I did not see that man,\u201d and the witness, Morley, testified that after the accident he got on the truck with Dunlop and asked him how the accident happened and that Dunlop replied that \u201che did not know how it happened, he never saw the man.\u201d Dunlop says these statements are not correct. These, in my opinion, constitute the material parts of the evidence given at the trial.\nThe plaintiff being injured by reason of a motor vehicle on the highway the statute places upon the defendant the burden of proving that his injuries did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of its driver. As to the degree of care which a driver of a motor vehicle must exercise I agree entirely with what was laid down by Mr. Justice Turgeon, in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, when he said[3]:\u2014\nHe must exercise at all times the same measure of caution as might be expected, in like circumstances, of a reasonably prudent man. He must take proper precautions to guard against risks that might reasonably be anticipated to arise from time to time as he proceeds on his way. This degree of care, and nothing more, is required of him, except in cases specially provided for, with which we are not concerned here.\nThe difficulty, however, is in determining what a reasonably prudent man would have done under the circumstances. That responsibility is placed in the first instance upon the tribunal whose duty it is to find the facts\u2014in this case the trial judge.\nThe first act of negligence on the part of the defendant found by the trial judge was that its driver was proceeding at a rate of speed dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances. The rate of speed was stated by Dunlop to be 10 miles per hour, and, by other witnesses, at varying rates between 10 and 20 miles\u2014the highest being 20 miles. The trial judge made no finding as to the rate Dunlop was driving \u2018at the time of the accident. I do not think that the absence of a finding as to the rate is material in this case. What the learned judge in effect did find was that the rate at which the truck was being driven\u2014whether it was 10 miles per hour or 20 miles\u2014was too fast a rate to enable Dunlop to stop the truck between the time he was first able to see the plaintiff and the time when the accident happened. If there was a duty resting on the driver to have his truck so under control that he could stop it within the distance at which he could see pedestrians on a street on which he knew pedestrians were in the habit of crossing diagonally, his rate of speed prevented him from performing that duty and therefore may well be called dangerous. Whether or not there was such a duty I shall deal with later.\nThe second and third findings as to the driver\u2019s negligence are as follows:\u2014\n(2) He was not keeping a proper lookout for pedestrians. Knowing that this was a busy intersection where there was a large pedestrian traffic, it seems to me that it was his duty to be on the look-out for pedestrians, and to operate his car so that he could stop immediately. This is not the case of a man stepping in front of a car. * * * (3) The driver of the truck was following too close to the car in front. This obstructed his vision of the plaintiff, and he should have gone much more slowly, if he had done what an ordinary prudent and cautious man would do. I think he was negligent in not slacking his speed, so as to eliminate the possibility of danger to others, when his sight was interfered with by the car in front.\nThe only evidence as to the look-out kept by the defendant\u2019s driver was that of the driver himself. He says he was watching the car in front of him and keeping a lookout \u201cfor anything that came up,\u201d but that he could not see the plaintiff nor could the plaintiff see him until the sedan in front got out of the way.\nIn determining whose want of care was really responsible for the accident, there is one finding made by the trial judge which, in my opinion, is of the utmost importance. That is his finding that the plaintiff did not move from the moment he stood still on the street to permit the cars to pass him to the moment he was struck by the truck. That finding was based upon evidence which the trial judge was entitled to credit and, in my opinion, it cannot now be successfully assailed. Starting with the fact that the plaintiff did not \u2018alter his position on the street, it is not difficult to see what must actually have happened. Both the car from the south and the Ford sedan passed the plaintiff without injuring him, going between him and the silent policeman. Dunlop was following the sedan. If he had kept to the course taken by the sedan he too would have gone by the plaintiff without injuring him. He, however, struck the plaintiff with the centre of his radiator. To do that it is obvious that when the sedan turned to the left around the intersection Dunlop did not follow in the sedan\u2019s track but turned farther to the right, that is, he was making a wider curve than that made by the sedan. That he would do so is most probable seeing that he had a long heavy truck which, the evidence shews, ordinarily requires a wider space to make the turn than does a Ford sedan. In taking that wider curve Dunlop was driving his truck over a portion of the street not shewn by the passing of the sedan to be clear of traffic. Of the portion of the street on which the plaintiff was standing Dunlop had no view, as his line of vision was obstructed by the sedan in front of him. That he could not have a view of it will be readily understood when it is remembered that he was sitting on the left hand side of the truck and that the sedan was only six or eight feet in front of him. The question then is, was there a duty resting upon Dunlop not to drive over a portion of the street of which he had only a restricted view, and on which he knew pedestrians were in the habit of crossing, except at a rate of speed which permitted him to stop his truck within the limits of his restricted vision? In my opinion such a duty rested on him. A one ton truck driven by gasoline is an instrumentality fraught with danger to pedestrians crossing the street unless care is taken by its driver. If Dunlop had permitted someone to bandage his eyes so that on making the turn at the intersection he could not see a pedestrian in front of him, and he struck and injured the pedestrian, who remained in the same place on the street, could it reasonably be contended that the driver was not guilty of negligence causing the accident? In my opinion it could not, for I do not think any reasonably prudent man would continue to drive his car when he could not see the portion of the street over which he was to pass. What is the difference between such a case and the present one where the driver was unable to see the plaintiff in time to stop his car before injuring him, by reason of the fact that he permitted his vision to be obstructed by the sedlan, to which he kept too close, so close that he could not keep a proper lookout for pedestrians? I can see none. Dunlop\u2019s duty towards the plaintiff was to keep his truck so under control that, if the plaintiff should happen to be on that portion of the street which Dunlop could not see when making the turn, the truck could be stopped or turned aside without injuring the plaintiff. This duty he could have performed by allowing a greater distance to separate him from the sedan, or by reducing his speed. With great deference, therefore, I am unable to take the view of the Court of Appeal that the defendant disproved negligence on the part of its driver.\nAs to the sounding of the horn: the statute calls for it when \u201cit is reasonably necessary to notify pedestrians or others of the approach of the vehicle.\u201d As the plaintiff was well aware of the near approach of the truck, I share the doubt of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that any good purpose would have been served by sounding it. The learned trial judge found that there had been no negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The plaintiff started to walk diagonally across the street; he reached a point part way between the silent policeman and the curb, but a little east of the silent policeman, and there stopped in the line taken by traffic going north on Avenue A. He knew that the truck was following close to the sedan; he stood looking at the passing cars and paying no attention to the approaching truck, evidently assuming that as the car from the south and the sedan had passed between him and the silent policeman, the truck would do the same. Can it be said that a man who walks into the line of traffic knowing that several cars are approaching, and does not look to see if he is out of danger, is exercising that care and prudence to avoid accident which it is the duty of every person using the highway to exercise when others are likewise using it? In my opinion a failure, in certain circumstances, to watch out for an approaching car might properly be characterized as negligence by a tribunal whose duty it is to pass upon it. As long ago as the case of Cotton v. Wood[4], Erie C.J., laid down the duty of pedestrians in these words:\u2014\nIt is as much the duty of foot-passengers attempting to cross a street or road to look out for passing vehicles as it is the duty of drivers to see that they do not run over (foot-passengers.\nHis Lordship was there dealing with horse-drawn vehicles. To-day we have the much more rapid and therefore much more dangerous motor cars, which, I cannot help thinking, imposes upon their drivers a greater duty to take care than was imposed upon the drivers of more slow going vehicles. The trial judge, however, held that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct did not amount to contributory negligence; and I am not prepared to say he was wrong; in fact, in this case, I think he was right. Even if we admit that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to look out for the approach of the truck was negligence on his part, the real question is, did that negligence contribute to the accident? Was the real cause of the accident the failure of the plaintiff to watch out for the truck or the failure of the defendant\u2019s driver to keep himself in a position to see the part of the street over which he was driving his truck in making the turn around the intersection?\nIn his classic judgment in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute[5], Lord Chancellor Birkenhead said:\u2014\nIn all cases of damage by collision on land or sea, there are three ways in which the question of contributory negligence may arise. A. is suing for damage thereby received. He was negligent, but his negligence had brought about a state of things in which there would have been no damage if B. had not been subsequently and sev er ably negligent. A. recovers in full: see among other cases Spaight v. Tedcastle[6] and The Margaret[7].\nAt the other end of the chain, A.\u2019s negligence makes collision so threatening that though by the appropriate measure B. could avoid it, B. has not really time to think and by mistake takes the wrong measure. B. is not held to be guilty of any negligence and A. wholly fails. The Bywell Castle[8]; Stoomvaart Maatchappy Nederland v. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co.[9].\nIn between these two termini come the cases where the negligence is deemed contributory, and the plaintiff in common law recovers nothing, while in Admiralty damages are divided in some proportion or other.\nAfter reviewing a great many of the cases on the subject the Lord Chancellor sums up the result in these words:\u2014\nUpon the whole I think that the question of contributory negligence must be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common-sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it. And while no doubt, where a clear line can be drawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look to, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together, and the second act of negligence is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligent, while not held free from blame * * * might, on the other hand, invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision.\nAssuming, for the purpose of what I am about to say, that the plaintiff was negligent, the situation, in my opinion, brought about by his negligence would not have resulted in damage to him but for the subsequent and severable negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s driver, as is established, it seems to me, by the fact that both the other cars passed him without doing any damage. There is, I think, in this case a clear line to be drawn between the negligence of the plaintiff and that of the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct contributed to the accident only in the sense that it was a sine qua non. If he had not been on the street the accident, of course, would not have happened, but I cannot find anything in his conduct which provoked, induced or in any way assisted in bringing about the negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver. Neither do I find that the negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver was so interwoven with the state of things brought about by the conduct of the plaintiff that the plaintiff should be held equally guilty of causing the accident. A driver who, in broad daylight, runs down a pedestrian standing still on a street on which he knows pedestrians are in the habit of walking and on which there is no opposing or crossing traffic, assumes a heavy burden when he seeks to shew that he was not guilty of the negligence or improper conduct which caused the accident. It is not, in my opinion, sufficient for the defendant to say\u2014as in effect it says here: \u201cTrue our driver ran down the plaintiff and injured him because he did not see him in time to stop the truck, but the plaintiff should have looked out for the truck and got out of the way.\u201d\nI agree, therefore, with the trial judge that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAnglin C. J. \u0421. (dissenting).\u2014In this case the trial judge found negligence on the part of the defendant to have been the sole cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. He negatived any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The evidence in support of both these findings leaves their accuracy, in my opinion, doubtful, to say the least. Towards the close of his judgment he said,\nBut even if the plaintiff could be said to be negligent, in standing where he was, or otherwise, his negligence was not, in my opinion, the proximate cause of the accident. The old case of Tuff v. Warman[10], which is still good law, decides that his contributory negligence would not disentitle him to recover, if the defendant might, by the exercise of care on his part, have avoided the consequences of the neglect or carelessness of the plaintiff. The defendant could have avoided this -accident by the use of the ordinary care of a reasonable man for the reasons I have given above, and I therefore conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed. The evidence does not warrant this finding.\nNo other allusion is made to \u201cultimate\u201d negligence. It is reasonably obvious, from the passage quoted, that while the trial judge took into account \u201cultimate\u201d negligence of the defendant, in so far as he might actually have avoided the consequence of any contributory negligence of the plaintiff, he did not consider, and did not express any opinion upon, the question whether, when he did see, or should first have perceived, the plaintiff\u2019s danger, the defendant\u2019s servant could, but for some preceding disabling negligence on his part, have avoided running him down.\nIt is this latter class of \u201cultimate\u201d negligence which the Privy Council considered in B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach (1), i.e., disabling negligence \u2018anterior in fact to the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, but of such a character that its effects endured and became operative after such contributory negligence had intervened.\nThe Court of Appeal, on the other hand, found, upon evidence, which I am unable to say was insufficient to justify such finding, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. They, however, did not consider or pass upon the question of \u201cultimate\u201d negligence. We are, therefore, without any finding by either of the provincial courte upon the issue dealt with in the Loach case[11]. We cannot tell what the finding of the learned trial judge upon this, not improbably, vital question, would have been had his mind been directed to that aspect of the case. In the absence of such a finding it is impossible to hold that this action was fully tried.\nIn my opinion, therefore, a new trial is necessary in order that all the issues in the action may be fully considered and determined. I, therefore, refrain from further comment upon the evidence.\nThe costs of the appeal to this Court must be borne by the respondent. The costs of the abortive trial and the appeal to the Court of Appeal should abide the event of the new trial.\nSmith J. (dissenting).\u2014I would order a new trial in this action; costs of the appeal to this Court to be borne by the respondent; costs of the abortive trial and the appeal to the Court of Appeal to abide the event of a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Russell Hartney.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bence, Stevenson, McLorg & Yanda.\n[1] (1929) 24 Sask.

The words \u201cen gage\u201d modify not only the word \u201cdonne,\u201d but also the words \u201cc\u00e8de\u201d and \u201ctransporte\u201d, so that the instrument should be read as if \u201cen gage\u201d were after each word. Smith J. dissenting.\nThe words \u201cto cede and transfer\u201d, in s. 13 of the Special Corporate Powers Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 227, do not imply an absolute transfer, but merely a transfer in warranty, in view of the addition of the words \u201cfor the same purposes\u201d, thus referring to the words \u201cpurposes therein set forth\u201d immediately proceding, which purposes are to secure any bonds, etc. Anglin \u0421 J.C. and Smith J. contra.\nPer Duff, Newcombe, and Rinfret JJ.\u2014The modification effected in the existing civil law, as to hypothec and pledge, by 4 Geo. V, c. 51, when it inserted articles 6119\u0430, 6119b and 6119c into the Joint Stock Companies Act of 1909, has been merely to extend the principle of conventional hypothec to moveables and future property and to make future proporty susceptible of being pledged; but the main change was to enact that \u201cthe mortgagor or pledgor (will) be permitted by the trustee to remain in the possession and use of the property so mortgaged or pledged\u201d (art. 6119b)\u2014The translation of the words \u201cnantir\u201d and \u201cnantissement\u201d by \u201cmortgage\u201d and \u201cmortgaging\u201d, in the English version of the statute, is not appropriate and may be misleading; there is no connection between the \u201cnantissement\u201d of the civil law and the \u201cmortgaging\u201d of the English common law. Therefore that statute should not be interpreted according to the rules governing \u201cmortgage\u201d of the English common law; and the power given to the debtor by the statute to hypothecate and pledge his property as security for the payment of the bonds does not constitute a \u201ctrust\u201d within the meaning of the equity jurisprudence, the idea of \u201ctrust\u201d never having found place in the civil law in Quebec.\nPer Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014The system of civil law in Quebec does not admit the notion of the English common law as to beneficial ownership residing in one person and legal title in another. In Quebec, both are invariably united upon the same head, the right of ownership being indivisible.\nPer Smith J. (dissenting).\u2014The words \u201ccede and transfer\u201d imply the passing of the ownership to the transferee, with power to take possession and sell, according to the ordinary meaning of the words. These words in Art. 6119a must be given the same interpretation; otherwise they do not add anything to the words, \u201chypothecate, mortgage and pledge\u201d which immediately precede them.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench Q.R. 48 K.B. 390) aff., Smith J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec (1) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Letellier J. and dismissing appellants\u2019 petition.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the Judgments now reported. The appellants were granted special leave to appeal to this court on December 9, 1929, by\nSmith J.\u2014The bankrupt company was authorized to make an issue of bonds on the security of its property, consisting mainly of land and an apartment building that it was about to construct on it. It made a deed to a trustee of this property, ceding and transferring the property, as provided in the statute, 14 Geo. V, c. 63, s. 1, on the strength of which bonds were sold to the amount of over $400,000.\nThe building was partly constructed, and a contractor, who was a director to whom a large amount was owing, applied to have the company declared bankrupt, and an order was made accordingly.\nCertain of the bondholders, claiming to hold bonds to an amount exceeding twenty-five per cent., petitioned the trustee to take possession of the property, pursuant to a term in the trust deed imposing upon the trustee the duty of taking possession on presentation of such petition and the deposit of a sufficient amount to guarantee his costs and disbursements. No amount was deposited for this purpose, and the trustee took no action.\nThe liquidator in bankruptcy applied to the court for an order for sale of the property, which was granted. The appellants, a committee of bondholders acting for themselves and others in these proceedings, made to the Superior Court a request in the form of an opposition to the judgment for sale, which request was refused, and on an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench in appeal, the judgment of the Superior Court was sustained, and the present application is for leave to appeal to this court.\nThe judgments below are put upon the sole ground that the appellants have no status in the matter, as any proceedings on their behalf should be taken by the trustee under the trust deed. It is contended before me on behalf of the appellants that there was no jurisdiction in the courts below to order a sale of the property in question, because, under the trust deed, the ownership of the property passed to the trustee for the bondholders, and that only the equity of redemption of the property passed to the liquidator in bankruptcy. The order for sale in question purports to deal with the whole interest in the property, that is, with the ownership or legal estate. On behalf of the liquidator it is argued that under the law of Quebec legal ownership under the trust deed remained in the bankrupt company, and that the trustee for the bondholders would have a right only to rank on the property in the hands of the liquidator according to the priority of the various creditors; and that the statute referred to above does not in fact alter this rule of the Quebec law. This is a question concerning which there may be considerable doubt, and it is one of very great importance. It is also a matter of doubt as to whether the holders of bonds would not have a direct interest to prevent the property which stands as their security, being sold and disposed of by an order of the court where, as alleged, there was no jurisdiction to make such order. This is a point quite different from the mere matter of the trustee taking possession, and may not come within the section of the trust deed referred to, which provides merely for what is to be done to oblige the trustee to take possession. It may be, if the legal estate and ownership of the property was vested in the trustee for the bondholders, that it was the duty of the trustee to oppose any attempt to dispose of the property so vested in him without his consent, and that failing in that duty the bondholders for whom it is his duty to act had a right to act on their own behalf, because of a direct interest in preventing the disposal of their property under an order of the court acting without jurisdiction.\nIn view of the large amount involved and the great importance of these questions to the bondholders, and in view of the importance to bondholders in general holding bonds under trust deeds made in Quebec in this form under the statute referred to, I think that leave to appeal should be given.\nTerms, however, should be imposed because leave involves a stay of the sale, and considerable expense for the care and preservation of the property in the meantime. The building has not been completed, but is enclosed, and is provided with oil heating apparatus. The expense of a caretaker and of fuel will continue, and the extra expense caused by the delay of the sale should be paid by the applicants from the date of the postponement until a new date can be fixed after the disposal of the proposed appeal or until possession is obtained on behalf of the bondholders.\nThe amount required as security for the appeal is $500, and an additional amount will be required for the purpose indicated, making a bond in all of $2,500. Upon supplying such bond to the satisfaction of the registrar, leave is given to appeal, and all further proceedings are stayed in the meantime.\nThe argument on the appeal was first heard before this court on the 12th and 13th of February, 1930; and, on April 10, 1930, the following judgment was rendered.\nThe Court.\u2014The appellants contend that the trust deed executed by Les Appartements Lafontaine, Limit\u00e9e, to the Sun Trust Company had the effect of transferring to the latter, as trustee for the bondholders, the ownership of the property described in the deed.\nIn the course of the consideration so far given to this appeal, it has become apparent that, should this court hold the view of the appellants to be correct, it might follow that the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy had no jurisdiction to make the order now impeached and that the liquidators had no authority to sell; nor could such authority be vested in them by the assent of the trustee for the bondholders.\nThis would give the appellants a status to come into court to protect their security thus being surrendered contrary to their rights under the trust deed.\nBut we are satisfied that the adjudication upon the questions so raised would indirectly, if not directly, affect the position of the majority of the bondholders and of the trustee, The Sun Trust Company.\nA judgment setting aside the order authorizing the sale by the liquidators on the ground that the trustee for the bondholders is the owner and thus defining his duties in the future should not, in our opinion, be rendered before he has been given an opportunity of being heard. On the other hand, such judgment, if given now, would not bind him, and, if the trustee should elect not to act according to it, would only lead to further litigation, without any immediate or practical advantage being secured.\nIt is important, in the interest of all concerned and to avoid further useless expense from the care and preserva- tion of the property, that the matter be finally disposed of with as little delay as possible.\nUnder the circumstances, before expressing any view upon the merits of the appeal now before us, and so that the judgment to be delivered by us may be more fully effective, we direct that this appeal shall stand over and that, at the instance of the appellants, The Sun Trust Company, Limited, in its capacity as trustee for the bondholders herein, be made an additional party to the appeal, as provided by Rule 50 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada. Upon the necessary suggestion being entered by the appellants and notice thereof duly served, the appeal may be inscribed at the head of the Quebec list for the next term of the court, when The Sun Trust Company, Limited, may be heard to have the suggestion set aside, should it be so advised, and, in any event, upon the merits of the pending appeal.\nThe rehearing on the appeal took place on the 1st of May, 1930, the trustee for the bondholders being then represented by counsel.\nL. G. Belley, K.C., and R. V. Sinclair, K.C., for the appellants.\nL. St. Laurent, K.C., for the respondents.\nJ. L. Perron, K.C., for the trustee.\nAnglin C. J. \u0421.\u2014While I am entirely convinced by the reasoning of my brother Smith that it is impossible to disregard the presence of the words \u201cc\u00e8de et transporte\u201d inserted in the statute, or to give to them any other effect than that of vesting in the trustee for bondholders where the trust instrument conforms precisely to the statute, as so amended, the properties to be held as security for payment of the bonds, I find myself unable to accept his view that the contract now in question has that effect. On the contrary, it seems to me that the addition to the words \u201cc\u00e8de\u201d and \u201ctransporte\u201d of the words \u201cet donne en gage, au \u0442\u00ea\u0442\u0435 titre\u201d, (clause 1, c. III, of the trust deed), makes it reasonably clear that the intention of the parties was merely to hypothecate the property as security for the bonds. I regard the word \u201cen gage\u201d as modifying not only the word \u201cdonne\u201d, but also the words \u201cc\u00e8de\u201d and \u201ctransporte\u201d and that the instrument should be read as if \u201cen gage\u201d were after each word, viz., \u201cc\u00e8de en gage, transporte en gage et donne en gage, au m\u00eame titre.\u201d\nFor this reason I agree with my brother Rinfret that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014After much fluctuation of opinion, I have come to concur with my brother Rinfret. I desire to emphasize one point, and it is this. If my brother Smith\u2019s view of the statute be the right one, then it introduces into the law of Quebec a legal institution which is virtually a new one. If the intention had been to do that, which would be nothing short of a revolutionary proceeding, I think it would have been expressed in language quite unmistakeable, language to which no other meaning could be ascribed.\nI ought, I think, to add this, that at the conclusion of the first argument, and indeed for some time after the second argument, I thought my brother Smith was right, and more than once expressed myself in that sense. But I have changed my opinion and to that opinion I must now give effect.\nThe judgments of Newcombe and Rinfret JJ. were delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Les Appartements Lafontaine, Limit\u00e9e, une compagnie incorpor\u00e9e en vertu de la loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec (S.R.Q. de 1925, c. 223), dans le but de construire une maison de rapport, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un emprunt de $900,000 au moyen d\u2019une \u00e9mission d\u2019obligations.\nA cette fin, un contrat, appel\u00e9 acte de fiducie, fut consenti par la compagnie en faveur de The Sun Trust Company, Limited, qui fut choisie comme fiduciaire et \u00e0 qui furent transf\u00e9r\u00e9s les biens donn\u00e9s en garantie de l\u2019emprunt ainsi que les pouvoirs jug\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour accomplir sa mission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des porteurs d\u2019obligations.\nLa compagnie est tomb\u00e9e en faillite et les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s syndics. Le seul actif \u00e9tait la maison de rapport, construite avec le produit de l\u2019emprunt, qui \u00e9tait alors en la possession de la compagnie et apparemment affect\u00e9e de plusieurs privil\u00e8ges enregistr\u00e9s par des ouvriers, des fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux et des constructeurs.\nLes syndics obtinrent l\u2019autorisation de vendre cette maison aux ench\u00e8res, par jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en mati\u00e8re de faillite rendu le 12 juin 1929. Cette autorisation fut accord\u00e9e sur une requ\u00eate, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la compagnie \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble, et bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 45 de la Loi de faillite qui pourvoit \u00e0 la vente par le syndic, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, d\u2019un bien immobilier sur lequel existe une hypoth\u00e8que ou un privil\u00e8ge.\nLes appelants, qui sont des porteurs d\u2019obligations, ont pr\u00e9tendu que leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient l\u00e9s\u00e9s par ce jugement dans une affaire o\u00f9 ni eux, ni le fiduciaire qui les repr\u00e9sente n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s. Ils ont form\u00e9 tierce-opposition (Art. 1185 C.P.C.; Loi de Faillite, r\u00e8gle 173) concluant \u00e0 ce que le jugement autorisant la vente soit cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 et \u00e0 ce que la maison de rapport\nsorte de la faillite et retombe entre les mains des porteurs de d\u00e9bentures en vertu de l\u2019acte de fiducie et de la loi, pour qu\u2019ils puissent en disposer suivant leurs droits.\nCette tierce-opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et par la Cour de Banc du Roi[1] sur le motif que les appelants \u00e9taient sans int\u00e9r\u00eat comme sans droit d\u2019intervenir pour emp\u00eacher la vente par les syndics, vu que cette initiative appartenait uniquement au fidiciare, except\u00e9 si vingt-cinq pour cent en valeur des porteurs d\u2019obligations s\u2019unissaient pour le requ\u00e9rir et avaient\nau pr\u00e9alable indemnis\u00e9 le fiduciaire, \u00e0 sa satisfaction, pour tous les frais, d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et dommages qu\u2019il pourra encourir \u00e0 cette fin.\nCe sont l\u00e0, en effet, deux conditions sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es dans le contrat de fiducie. Il n\u2019est m\u00eame pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les appelants repr\u00e9sentent vingt-cinq pour cent en valeur des porteurs d\u2019obligations et il est admis qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas indemnis\u00e9 le fiduciaire. A moins de remplir ces conditions, nul porteur d\u2019obligation ne peut contraindre le fiduciaire \u00e0 agir ou ne peut agir individuellement. Ces restrictions se rencontrent d\u2019habitude dans les contrats de ce genre. Elles ont pour but d\u2019assurer au fiduciaire la discr\u00e9tion convenue dans l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs et surtout de concentrer entre ses mains l\u2019institution des proc\u00e9dures et l\u2019adoption contre la compagnie des recours exig\u00e9s par les circonstances, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que le bon fonctionnement de la fiducie ne soit compromis par les activit\u00e9s d\u2019une petite minorit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame d\u2019un seul des porteurs d\u2019obligations, dont le nombre et le personnel varient suivant le jeu des n\u00e9gociations. Il est reconnu que ces stipulations tendent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat general. En pareille mati\u00e8re, la compagnie contracte avec le fiduciaire pour le compte des obligataires g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et non pour chacun d\u2019eux individuellement.\nIci, le fiduciaire\u2014qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie aux proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ou la cour du\u2019 Banc du Roi\u2014a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause par cette cour. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne croyait pas devoir s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la vente qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e. La raison en est que cette vente, faite par le syndic\nen ex\u00e9cution des dispositions (de la Loi de Faillite) a le m\u00eame effet qu\u2019une vente faite par le sh\u00e9rif (art. 45-3)\net permettra donc de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur un titre absolument clair, tandis que le fiduciaire ne pourrait vendre que sujet aux privil\u00e8ges enregistr\u00e9s sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014ce qui affecterait s\u00e9rieusement les ench\u00e8res ou les offres d\u2019achat et, par cons\u00e9quent, les chances de disposer de l\u2019immeuble. La d\u00e9cision du fiduciaire para\u00eet proc\u00e9der d\u2019une sage discr\u00e9tion.\nIl faut donc dire que les jugements port\u00e9s en appel sont justifi\u00e9s par le contrat de fiducie et sont l\u00e9galement bien fond\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins que les appelants n\u2019aient raison de pr\u00e9tendre\nque la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question en cette cause n\u2019est pas un bien cessible en vertu de la loi de faillite, vu qu\u2019elle ne faisait pas partie des biens de la faillite.\nDans ce cas, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait sans juridiction pour en ordonner la vente sous l\u2019empire de cette loi, et les appelants, dans les circonstances, devraient \u00eatre admis \u00e0 intervenir pour prot\u00e9ger leurs droits. C\u2019est sur ce point que la permission d\u2019appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 avec raison accord\u00e9e et c\u2019est celui qu\u2019il nous reste maintenant \u00e0 examiner.\nLa question de savoir si la maison de rapport dont il s\u2019agit faisait partie des biens de la compagnie qui, lors de sa faillite, sont d\u00e9volus aux syndics, d\u00e9pend \u00e9videmment des termes du contrat de fiducie. Sans doute, ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi des pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux de certaines corporations (S.R.Q. 1925, c. 227), mais c\u2019est le contrat, et non le statut, qui doit d\u00e9terminer la nature des relations de la faillie, du fiduciaire et des porteurs d\u2019obligations.\nIl peut \u00eatre utile toutefois de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au statut pour mieux p\u00e9n\u00e9trer le sens du contrat, car il est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce dernier est calqu\u00e9 sur le premier, et nul ne pr\u00e9tend que le contrat outrepasse les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le statut.\nIl faut bien pr\u00e9ciser, d\u00e8s l\u2019abord, que nous n\u2019avons pas ici \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer si le fiduciaire pouvait, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration de faillite, r\u00e9clamer la possession de l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des syndics. Nous avons vu que le fiduciaire ne fait pas cette demande. Il affirme m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des porteurs d\u2019obligations de la faire. C\u2019est la situation oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 celle qui fut jug\u00e9e dans la cause de \u0421\u0430n\u0430dian Brass and Bedstead v. Duclos & La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Administration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale[2], que les appelants nous ont cit\u00e9e. L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans La Manufacture des Seaux de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res v. Bisson[3], qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9, ne s\u2019applique pas davantage puisque, dans cette affaire, le fiduciaire avait pris possession avant la faillite.\nNous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 trancher ici une question de possession, mais une question de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nOr, il convient peut-\u00eatre de souligner que le syst\u00e8me de droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ne comporte pas la conception de la common law qui reconna\u00eet le beneficial ownership dans une personne et le legal title dans une autre. Dans le Qu\u00e9bec, les deux sont invariablement r\u00e9unis sur la m\u00eame t\u00eate. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est unique. L\u2019usufruit, la substitution, la fiducie, le nantissement, le gage, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, le privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e8rent sur la chose des droits plus ou moins \u00e9tendus (Arts. 94, 944, 981a, 1966, 1968, 1983, 2016 C.C.) mais ne transmettent jamais la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Pour nous limiter aux pouvoirs dont parle le statut: \u201chypoth\u00e9quer, nantir ou mettre en gage\u201d (Art. 227, s. 10), l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que n\u2019accorde au cr\u00e9ancier que le droit de\nfaire vendre (l\u2019immeuble) en quelques mains qu\u2019il soit, et d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le produit de la vente suivant l\u2019ordre du temps, tel que fix\u00e9 dans le code\n(Art. 2016 C.C). Le d\u00e9biteur qui a consenti une hypoth\u00e8que reste propri\u00e9taire et en possession. Le nantissement et le gage constituent un m\u00eame contrat avec la seule diff\u00e9rence que le premier s\u2019adresse aux immeubles et le second, aux meubles (Arts. 1966, 1967, 1968 C.C). Le d\u00e9biteur qui donne en gage ou en nantissement demeure propri\u00e9taire (Art. 1972 C.C), mais ne conserve pas la possession (Art. 1970 C.C). En vertu du code, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, le gage ou le nantissement ne peuvent \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9s que sur des biens pr\u00e9sents; l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux immeubles (Art. 2016 C.C).\nL\u2019innovation apport\u00e9e par le statut 4 Geo. v, c. 51, en introduisant dans les statuts refondus de 1909 les articles 6119a, 6119b et 6119c (maintenant les articles 10, 11 et 12 du \u0441. 227 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de 1925) a donc \u00e9t\u00e9\u2014et a \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement:\n(1) d\u2019\u00e9tendre l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle aux biens mobiliers et aux biens futurs;\n(2) d\u2019appliquer le nantissement ou le gage \u00e0 des biens qui pouvaient \u00e9galement \u00eatre futurs, mais surtout \u00e0 des biens dont le d\u00e9biteur \u201cconservait la possession et l\u2019usage\u201d.\nPour le reste, ce dont parle le statut, c\u2019est l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que telle qu\u2019elle a toujours exist\u00e9, ce sont le nantissement et le gage tels qu\u2019ils ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us dans le droit fran\u00e7ais et dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il importe donc de noter que, dans la version anglaise du statut, les mots \u201cmortgage\u201d ou \u201cmortgaging\u201d comme \u00e9quivalents de \u201cnantir\u201d ou \u201cnantissement\u201d de la version fran\u00e7aise sont: ou bien une impropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de langage qui peut malheureusement pr\u00eater \u00e0 confusion ou bien l\u2019emploi d\u2019un mot anglais dans une acception toute autre que celle qui lui est attribu\u00e9e dans le syst\u00e8me de droit pr\u00e9valant dans les autres provinces du Canada. Il n\u2019y a pas de connexit\u00e9 entre le \u201cnantissement\u201d du droit civil et le \u201cmortgage\u201d de la \u201ccommon law\u201d. Mais il est certain que le sens du statut est conforme \u00e0 la conception du \u201cnantissement\u201d et oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 celle du \u201cmortgage\u201d, puisque le statut lui-m\u00eame le d\u00e9clare:\nLes droite que conf\u00e8rent sur les immeubles l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et le nantissement * * * sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s dans le code civil etc.\n(Voir tout l\u2019article 12 du c. 227). Il faut donc bannir toute id\u00e9e de \u201cmortgage\u201d, dans l\u2019acception que lui donne la common law, de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du statut et, par cons\u00e9quent aussi, de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat bas\u00e9 sur ce statut.\nDe m\u00eame (sauf \u00e0 discuter l\u2019article 13), le statut ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la compagnie rien autre chose que le pouvoir d\u2019hypoth\u00e9quer, de nantir ou de mettre en gage les biens destin\u00e9s \u00e0 garantir le paiement des obligations., Comme nous venons de le voir, ces d\u00e9nominations sont employ\u00e9es dans le sens qu\u2019elles ont au code civil. Elles n\u2019impliquent donc aucunement le \u201ctrust\u201d, tel qu\u2019on l\u2019envisage en droit anglais. Le statut dit que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, le nantissement ou le gage \u201cpeuvent \u00eatre constitu\u00e9s\u201d par \u201cacte de fid\u00e9icommis\u201d et la version anglaise s\u2019exprime: \u201cby trust deed\u201d. Il est \u00e0 peine besoin d\u2019insister pour d\u00e9montrer que c\u2019est seulement un nom ou une \u00e9tiquette que l\u2019on donne au contrat. Le \u201ctrust\u201d, sauf dans la forme restreinte o\u00f9 on le trouve au chapitre de la fiducie (Code civil, livre troisi\u00e8me, titre deuxi\u00e8me, chapitre IVa), n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me l\u00e9gal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, qui ne comprend d\u2019ailleurs aucun m\u00e9canisme (machinery) pour le faire fonctionner. Il serait inconcevable que le l\u00e9gislateur, par l\u2019usage, non pas m\u00eame du mot \u201ctrust\u201d, mais de l\u2019appellation \u201ctrust deed\u201d, e\u00fbt voulu introduire d\u2019un seul coup le \u201ctrust\u201d anglais avec sa complexit\u00e9 et ses multibles aspects si fonci\u00e8rement \u00e9trangers \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie du droit de Qu\u00e9bec. On ne cr\u00e9e pas, de fa\u00e7on aussi sommaire, une r\u00e9volution aussi profonde. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019expression \u201ctrust deed\u201d se rencontre dans \u013earticle 11 en rapport, toujours et seulement, avec l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, le nantissement ou le gage que la compagnie peut, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 12, consentir suivant les r\u00e8gles du code civil. Cela est d\u00e9cisif. Ce n\u2019est pas en l\u2019appelant \u201ctrust deed\u201d que l\u2019on modifiera le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019acte par lequel la compagnie peut accorder une hypoth\u00e8que, un nantissement ou un gage r\u00e9gis par les principes du droit civil.\nDe m\u00eame que nous avons banni de notre interpr\u00e9tation le conception du \u201cmortgage\u201d de la common law, pour les raisons que nous venons de donner, il convient donc \u00e9galement d\u2019en \u00e9carter la conception du \u201ctrust\u201d anglais.\nNous en venons maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 du chapitre 227 (S.R.Q. 1925). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la loi en 1925, alors que les articles 10, 11 et 12 remontent \u00e0 1914. Il se lit comme suit:\n13. Il est et il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 loisible \u00e0 une compagnie vis\u00e9e par les articles de la pr\u00e9sente section, en sus de les hypoth\u00e9quer, nantir e\u0163 mettre en gage pour les fins mentionn\u00e9es auxdits articles, de c\u00e9der et transporter, pour les m\u00eames fins, lesdits biens au fid\u00e9icommissaire, avec pouvoir, au cas de d\u00e9faut par la compagnie de remplir les conditions de l\u2019acte de fid\u00e9icommis, de prendre possession des biens c\u00e9d\u00e9s et transport\u00e9s, de les administrer et de les vendre pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des obligataires.\nNous ne voyons pas que cet article modifie la fa\u00e7on de voir que nous avons jusqu\u2019ici expos\u00e9e.\nLes mots \u201cc\u00e9der et transporter\u201d employ\u00e9s seuls comportent une ali\u00e9nation absolue. Mais ils ne sont pas employ\u00e9s seuls dans cet article. Au point de vue l\u00e9gal, il y a la m\u00eame diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019entre les expressions \u201cdonner\u201d et \u201cdonner en gage\u201d. a phrase se lit: de c\u00e9der et transporter, pour les m\u00eames fins, lesdits biens au fid\u00e9icommissaire, avec pouvoir * * * de prendre possession des biens c\u00e9d\u00e9s et transport\u00e9s, de les administer et de les vendre pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des obligataires.\n\u201cPour les m\u00eames fins\u201d r\u00e9f\u00e8rent aux \u201cfins mentionn\u00e9es auxdits articles\u201d, qui les pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent imm\u00e9diatement dans la m\u00eame phrase. Or, \u201cles fins mentionn\u00e9es auxdits articles\u201d et pour lesquelles la compagnie est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u201chypoth\u00e9quer, nantir et mettre en gage\u201d sont (art. 10): \u201cpour garantir le paiement des bons, obligations etc\u201d. C\u00e9der pour garantir, transporter pour garantir, c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose que c\u00e9der ou transporter en garantie; et ce n\u2019est pas c\u00e9der et transporter d\u2019une fa\u00e7on absolue. Une cession ou un transport pur et simple est final et constitue une ali\u00e9nation d\u00e9finitive. Une cession ou un transport en garantie implique une id\u00e9e de retour. Les mots \u201cc\u00e9der et transporter\u201d ne sont donc pas employ\u00e9s ici dans leur sens int\u00e9gral et ne signifient pas une ali\u00e9nation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils sont qualifi\u00e9s par les mots\navec pouvoir * * * de prendre possession des biens c\u00e9d\u00e9s et transport\u00e9s, de les administrer et de les vendre pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des obligataires,\nqui seraient parfaitement inutiles si \u201cc\u00e9der et transporter\u201d devaient \u00eatre pris dans le sens d\u2019ali\u00e9ner. Il est clair qu\u2019une ali\u00e9nation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 emporterait le pouvoir de prendre possession, d\u2019administrer et de vendre. Il serait absolument oiseux de le dire. On ne peut supposer que le l\u00e9gislateur a parl\u00e9 pour ne rien dire. Les r\u00e8gles ordinaires d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation exigent que tous les mots employ\u00e9s trouvent leur utilit\u00e9. Ici, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de ces mots est expliqu\u00e9e par le code civil. Une hypoth\u00e8que, en droit civil, ne permet pas au cr\u00e9ancier de prendre possession et de vendre lui-m\u00eame. Il faut qu\u2019il fasse saisir et vendre par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 judiciaire. De m\u00eame, un nantissement ou un gage, suivant le code, ne conf\u00e8re pas le droit de disposer du bien gag\u00e9 (Art. 1971 C.C), \u00e0 moins d\u2019une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale. C\u2019est pour assurer au fid\u00e9icommissaire ces pouvoirs, que le code ne donnait pas, que l\u2019amendement de 1924 (14 Geo. V, c. 63), devenu l\u2019article 13, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9. Le pr\u00e9ambule du statut de 1924 le d\u00e9montre. Il d\u00e9bute:\nAttendu qu\u2019il y a des doutes si, en vertu des articles 6119a et suivants des Statuts Refondus, 1909, etc. une compagnie peut c\u00e9der et transporter \u00e0 un fid\u00e9icommissaire, avec pouvoir * * * de prendre possession, d\u2019administrer et de vendre les biens qu\u2019elle est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 hypoth\u00e9quer, nantir et mettre en gage. Il n\u2019entrerait jamais dans l\u2019esprit d\u2019un l\u00e9gislateur du Qu\u00e9bec de dire \u201cqu\u2019il y a des doutes\u201d sur la question de savoir si le pouvoir \u201cd\u2019hypoth\u00e9quer, nantir et mettre en gage\u201d comprend le pouvoir de \u201cc\u00e9der et transporter\u201d en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Nous avons vu que les deux pouvoirs sont distincts au point de se repousser l\u2019un l\u2019autre. Mais il pouvait certainement y avoir \u201cdes doutes\u201d si une compagnie autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u201chypoth\u00e9quer, nantir et mettre en gage\u201d pouvait en m\u00eame temps permettre au fid\u00e9icommissaire,\nau cas de d\u00e9faut par la compagnie de remplir les conditions de. l\u2019acte de fid\u00e9icommis, de prendre possession, d\u2019administrer et de vendre les biens.\nC\u2019est ce doute que le statut de 1924 (maintenant l\u2019art. 13 du \u0441 227) a voulu faire dispara\u00eetre. Par l\u00e0, il est devenu certain qu\u2019un contrat de ce genre pouvait se faire. C\u2019est un contrat particulier avec des stipulations sp\u00e9ciales, en dehors de celles pr\u00e9vues dans les chapitres du code relatifs au nantissement, au gage et \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, mais restant quand m\u00eame subordonn\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles du droit commun dans ses principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et dans tout ce qui n\u2019est pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 y d\u00e9roger express\u00e9ment.\nBien entendu, ce n\u2019est pas le \u201ctrust\u201d dans le sens du common law. Le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 13 le prouve. Il est admis que jusque l\u00e0 le \u201ctrust\u201d n\u2019existait pas dans la loi de Qu\u00e9bec. Or, l\u2019article 13 est d\u00e9claratoire. Il sp\u00e9cifie qu\u2019il n\u2019institue aucun droit nouveau. Il dit que ce qui est permis par cet article \u201cest et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 loisible\u201d. Ce ne peut dont \u00eatre le \u201ctrust\u201d.\nComme par une co\u00efncidence assez curieuse, si elle n\u2019est pas voulue, on trouve dans le code civil, au chapitre de la fiducie, le mot \u201ctransporter\u201d employ\u00e9 dans un sens \u00e9galement restreint. L\u2019article 981a permet \u00e0 \u201ctoute personne capable de disposer librement de ses biens\u201d de \u201ctransporter des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res ou immobili\u00e8res \u00e0 des fiduciaires * * * pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des personnes etc.\u201d. Dans ce texte, le mot \u201ctransporter\u201d est moins qualifi\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne l\u2019est dans l\u2019article 13 du statut. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas pour effet de transmettre le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux fiduciaires. L\u2019article suivant (981b) le dit:\nLes fiduciaires, pour les fins de la fiducie, sont saisis, comme d\u00e9positaires et administrateurs, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des donataires ou l\u00e9gataires des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res ou immobili\u00e8res transport\u00e9es en fiducie.\nIl est impossible de ne pas voir l\u2019analogie entre ces articles du code et le statut que nous \u00e9tudions. Il est naturel et logique que nous en tenions compte. Sur ce point, il est int\u00e9ressant de lire le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 re O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[4].\nL\u2019analyse que nous venons de faire du statut va nous aider \u00e0 comprendre l\u2019acte de fiducie que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter et dont, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, d\u00e9pend la nature des droits respectifs de la faillie ou de ses syndics, d\u2019une part, et du fiduciaire, d\u2019autre part.\nAyant pos\u00e9 le principe que, suivant le droit de. Qu\u00e9bec, la maison de rapport doit \u00eatre ou bien hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e, nantie ou mise en gage, (et alors elle est encore dans le domaine de la faillite) ou bien ali\u00e9n\u00e9e (et alors c\u2019est le fiduciaire qui doit en revendiquer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9); ayant reconnu qu\u2019entre ces deux possibilit\u00e9s, il n\u2019existe pas de r\u00e9gime interm\u00e9diaire semblable au trust de la common law, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019acte de fiducie qui est devant nous appartient \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie. Dans l\u2019intention des parties, c\u2019est un contrat de garantie et non un contrat d\u2019ali\u00e9nation; c\u2019est un emprunt et non un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCela ressort d\u2019abord de la d\u00e9claration de la compagnie par laquelle d\u00e9bute l\u2019acte de fiducie:\nc. La Compagnie a besoin pour les fins de son entreprise de faire un emprunt de $900,000, au moyen d\u2019une \u00e9mission d\u2019obligations garantie par hypoth\u00e8que sur tous ses biens meubles et immeubles, pr\u00e9sents et futurs.\nPar toute la suite de l\u2019acte, on ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re, en aucun cas, aux biens affect\u00e9s par le contrat, autrement que comme biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s:\nChapitre I, art. 2: \u201cprivil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent acte de fiducie\u201d.\nChapitre II, art. 7: \u201cIls jouiront des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que que comporte le pr\u00e9sent acte\u201d.\nart. 19\u2014(2e. sous-parag. a): \u201cpouvant prendre rang avant l\u2019inscription hypoth\u00e9caire pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9e\u201d.\nart. 19. (2e sous-parag. b): \u201caucune hypoth\u00e8que prenant rang avant celle des pr\u00e9sentes\u201d.\nart. 19 (2e sous-parag. c. 3e alin\u00e9a): \u201cpouvant passer ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sent acte\u201d.\nChapitre IV.\u2014La compagnie s\u2019engage:\nart. 3\u2014\u201dDe maintenir et respecter les garanties cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sent acte etc.\u201d\nart. 4\u2014\u201dDe payer toutes taxes qui pourront affecter les biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d.\nart. 5\u2014\u201dDe ne faire aucune d\u00e9molition ni changement aux immeubles hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d.\nart. 6a.\u2014\u201dDe maintenir les biens hypoth\u00e9clu\u00e9s\u201d. Chapitre VII, art. 2: \u201cdevra prendre possession des biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d.\nart. \u0417: \u201cni proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la vente forc\u00e9e des biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d. Chapitre VIII, art. 10:. \u201cprendre possession des biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d \u201cpourra remettre \u00e0 la Compagnie les biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d.\nNous ne voulons pas attribuer trop d\u2019importance aux mots, mais ce qui donne de la force \u00e0 ceux-ci, c\u2019est que nulle part dans le contrat les biens ne sont d\u00e9crits sous une autre forme, sauf en deux endroits auxquels nous reviendrons.\nPar ailleurs, les clauses de l\u2019acte de fiducie sont celles d\u2019un contrat d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et de gage et non celles d\u2019un contrat de cession. Il est pass\u00e9\nafin de garantir * * * le paiement des obligations (c. III, art. I). La compagnie * * * consent \u00e0 ce que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, le gage et le transfert que comportent les pr\u00e9sentes aient leur plein effet et garantissent par priorit\u00e9 * * * le paiement des obligations (Chapitre III, dernier paragraphe.)\u2014La Compagnie pourra avec le consentement du fiduciaire, vendre pour le tout ou en partie, les biens meubles et immeubles dont elle n\u2019aura plus besoin et le fiduciaire, advenant telle vente, devra donner quittance et d\u00e9charger de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que pr\u00e9sentement \u00e9tablie sur ces biens (C. VI\u2014art. I).\nL\u2019article 2 du chapitre VI est au m\u00eame effet. Si, dans le cas de d\u00e9faut de la compagnie, le fiduciaire prend possession des biens et les vend, il pourra\nen donner bons titres, pour et au nom de la Compagnie. (C. VIII, art. 10). Les argents provenant de l\u2019administration des biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s (toujours la m\u00eame d\u00e9signation) ou de la vente d\u2019iceux par le fiduciaire\nseront d\u2019abord imput\u00e9s aux frais et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, au paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats et du principal des obligations, et \u201cle surplus, s\u2019il y en a, sera remis \u00e0 la Compagnie\u201d (c. X, art. 2). La clause 16e du chapitre IX pr\u00e9voit le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019ensemble des obligations permettra\n\u00e0 la Compagnie de cr\u00e9er et d\u2019\u00e9mettre d\u2019autres obligations et valeurs prenant rang pari passu avec les obligations \u00e9mises en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes, ou avec priorit\u00e9 sur icelles.\nChacune de ces clauses n\u2019est compatible qu\u2019avec l\u2019id\u00e9e du titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 reposant sur la t\u00eate de la compagnie. Aucune d\u2019elle ne se concilie avec un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant au fiduciaire, surtout si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que par la sixi\u00e8me des clauses finales de l\u2019acte, la Compagnie \u201cconstitue le fiduciaire son mandataire irr\u00e9vocable\u201d.\nMais voici qui, \u00e0 notre humble avis, est d\u00e9cisif. C\u2019est la clause II du chapitre VIII, qui r\u00e9git la mani\u00e8re dont la fiducie prend fin:\n11. Sur preuve du paiement ou du rachat de toutes les obligations, ou sur preuve qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvu \u00e0 leur paiement en la mani\u00e8re prescrite aux pr\u00e9sentes, et sur paiement de tous ses frais et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s ainsi que de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, le fiduciaire devra \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de la Compagnie et aux d\u00e9pens d\u2019icelle, lui donner quittance finale et mainlev\u00e9e de toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques prises en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes.\nAinsi, le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est bien rest\u00e9 entre les mains de la compagnie, puisque, sur paiement des obligations, on ne pourvoit pas \u00e0 une r\u00e9trocession \u00e0 la compagnie. Il suffit au fiduciaire de\ndonner quittance finale et mainlev\u00e9e de toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques prises en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes.\nL\u2019acte de fiducie, d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre, ne conf\u00e8re au fiduciaire que les droits d\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire ou gagiste et non ceux d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire. Le sens de l\u2019acte, tant dans son texte que dans son esprit, est celui du contrat d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et de nantissement. Il faut y ajouter le texte des obligations elles-m\u00eames, dont les appelants sont porteurs, et qui se lit\nElle est garantie pari passu par premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que sur tous les biens de la Compagnie sujette \u00e0 toutes les conditions et restrictions de l\u2019acte de fiducie etc.\nSi l\u2019obligation donne \u00e0 son porteur une hypoth\u00e8que sur \u201ctous les biens\u201d, elle ne peut en m\u00eame temps, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du fiduciaire, le constituer propri\u00e9taire d\u2019aucun des biens.\nBref, dans tout ce long document de vingt-neuf pages imprim\u00e9es, les seuls mots sur lesquels les appelants puissent s\u2019appuyer pour leur pr\u00e9tention sont \u201cc\u00e8de et transporte\u201d dans la phrase: \u201cc\u00e8de, transporte et donne en gage\u201d de l\u2019article I du chapitre III, et \u201cc\u00e9d\u00e9s\u201d dans la phrase: \u201chypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s, c\u00e9d\u00e9s et mis en gage\u201d du chapitre V. Voici comment ils s\u2019y rencontrent:\nCHAPITRE III\nHypoth\u00e8ques\nI. En consid\u00e9ration du paiement de un dollar, ($1) que lui fait le fiduciaire, dont quittance, afin de garantir \u00e9galement et proportionnellement, \u201cpari passu\u201d, le paiement des obligations \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9mises en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes, dont le principal s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 la somme de neuf cent mille piastres ($900,000), afin de garantir en outre le paiement d\u2019une somme additionnelle de cinquante mille piastres (850,000) pour couvrir, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence au capital des obligations, le montant des int\u00e9r\u00eats, frais, d\u00e9penses et autres accessoires, et pour assurer l\u2019accomplissement de toutes les conditions et conventions du pr\u00e9sent acte, la Compagnie hypoth\u00e8que, gr\u00e8ve et affecte, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de neuf cent cinquante mille piastres ($950,000) en faveur du fiduciaire, acceptant, pour lui-m\u00eame et pour les porteurs d\u2019obligations, et lui c\u00e8de, transporte et donne en gage, au m\u00eame titre, tous ses biens meubles et immeubles, de quelque nature qu\u2019ils soient, pr\u00e9sents et futurs,\u2019 situ\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, y compris ses entreprises, franchises, client\u00e8le, achalandage, privil\u00e8ges et contrats et plus sp\u00e9cialement les biens et l\u2019actif ci-apr\u00e8s au long d\u00e9crits, savoir:\nCet immeuble connu comme \u00e9tant les subdivisions num\u00e9ros deux cent soixante-dix et trois cent trente-quatre du lot originaire num\u00e9ro, quatre mille trois cent quatre-vingt-un-A (4381-A-270 et 334) du cadastre officiel pour \u00ede quartier Montcalm de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, formant ensemble un emplacement born\u00e9 en front au sud-est par l\u2019a Grande All\u00e9e, en arri\u00e8re au nord-ouest par les subdivisions num\u00e9ros deux cent soixante-neuf et trois cent trente-trois du m\u00eame lot, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au nord-est par l\u2019Avenue Turnbull, et au sud-ouest par l\u2019Avenue de la Tour, mesurant cent cinquante-six pieds de largeur par cent trente-deux pieds et six-dixi\u00e8mes sur l\u2019Avenue Turnbull, et cent trente-trois pieds et quatre dixi\u00e8mes sur l\u2019Avenue de la Tour, formant une superficie totale de vingt mille sept cent quarante-sept pieds carr\u00e9s, plus ou moins, mesure anglaise, avec les b\u00e2tisses actuellement en construction, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances.\nLe susdit emplacement a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par la Compagnie de M, Rodolphe E.

C\u2019est, en effet, la seule mani\u00e8re d\u2019emp\u00eacher qu\u2019ils ne se trouvent en conflit avec tout le reste du contrat, comme nous l\u2019avons vu; ou m\u00eame de leur donner un sens qui soit logique. Autrement cette phras\u00e9ologie signifierait que la compagnie aurait \u00e0 la fois ali\u00e9n\u00e9 et mis en gage les m\u00eames biens, ce qui est l\u00e9galement impossible. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019on pourrait consid\u00e9rer la phrase comme \u201cdistributive\u201d, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les mots \u201chypoth\u00e8que, gr\u00e8ve et affecte\u201d s\u2019appliqueraient \u00e0 certains biens, et les mots \u201cc\u00e8de et transporte\u201d \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens. Mais, en outre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien dans tout le contrat, qui pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019exercice par le fiduciaire des droits d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire, la premi\u00e8re des \u201cclauses finales\u201d rend les dispositions de l\u2019acte applicables \u201c\u00e0 tous les biens dont la Compagnie fera subs\u00e9quemment l\u2019acquisition\u201d; et surtout: il ne s\u2019agit en cette cause que de la maison de rapport. L\u2019immeuble qui la constitue (terrains et constructions) est le seul qui soit d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019acte parmi les biens que la compagnie \u201chypoth\u00e8que, gr\u00e8ve et affecte * * * c\u00e8de, transporte et donne en gage\u201d. Or, dans le chapitre I des \u201cd\u00e9finitions et interpr\u00e9tations\u201d du contrat, on trouve:\n10. \u201cBiens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d signifie les biens sp\u00e9cialement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes et tous les autres biens pr\u00e9sents et futurs de la compagnie.\nLa maison de rapport est le seul immeuble \u00e0 qui les mots \u201cles biens sp\u00e9cialement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s\u201d puissent s\u2019appliquer, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 2042 du Code civil.\nEn lisant, comme nous l\u2019avons dit: \u201cc\u00e8de en gage, transporte en gage et donne en gage\u201d, tout se concilie. On ne fait aucune violence au texte et l\u2019on a un sens qui se tient et qui est en harmonie \u00e0 la fois avec l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019acte et avec le droit civil et la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nNous sommes, en cons\u00e9quence, d\u2019avis que la maison de rapport n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la faillie. Comme telle elle est d\u00e9volue aux syndics, et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant en mati\u00e8re de faillite, avait juridiction pour en ordonner la vente ainsi qu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe syndic est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer la vente dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai \u00e0 partir du pr\u00e9sent jugement que celui qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nSmith J. (dissenting).\u2014Les Appartements Lafontaine, Lt\u00e9e. is a joint stock company that is in bankruptcy. Prior to the bankruptcy, it was the owner of a parcel of land in the city of Quebec on which it proposed to erect an apartment building.\nBy by-law of the 26th May, 1928, its shareholders authorized an issue of bonds aggregating $900,000 to be secured by a trust deed to a trustee, the proceeds to be used for the erection of the building. A trust deed was accordingly executed to the Sun Trust Company as trustee for the bondholders of the company\u2019s property and assets present and future, and bonds to the amount of $460,000 were sold to the public, and a contract was entered into with \u0422. E. Rousseau, one of the directors of the company, for the construction of the apartment house. After the building had proceeded far enough to be enclosed, the contractor, claiming that there was $163,165 due to him and his sub-contractor, suspended operations and presented a petition in bankruptcy against the company, upon which it was declared bankrupt, and on the 12th of January, 1929, the respondents were appointed interim receivers, and took possession of the property. On the 30th April, 1929, the respondents were appointed trustees, with five inspectors, one of whom was the manager of the Sun Trust Company.\nThe trustee for the bondholders filed a claim under the trust deed for $463,000, declaring that the same was secured on the property of the bankrupt.\nOn the 11th June, 1929, the inspectors gave the trustees in bankruptcy permission in writing to sell the real estate of the bankrupt, in accordance with section 45 of the Bankruptcy Act, and on the 12th June, 1929, Chief Justice Lemieux made an order authorizing the trustees to sell accordingly.\nThe present appellants thereupon filed an opposition to this order, and on the presentation of the petition before Mr. Justice Letellier, the trustees in bankruptcy and the trustee for the bondholders appeared, by counsel, and opposed the objection. The learned judge held that the petitioning bondholders had no status, and that the trustee for the bondholders represented them.\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), and was dismissed. There is no specific reference, either in the petition or in the reasons for judgment, to the effect of R.S.Q. (1909) s. 6119a, enacted by 4 Geo. V, and 14 Geo. V., c. 63, s. 1, now R.S.Q. (1925), c. 227, s. 10 and 14 inclusive, but Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau, reading the judgment of the court, says:\nIl est \u00e0 peine n\u00e9cessaire de dire qu\u2019en cas de faillite et sauf les recours que la loi laisse au cr\u00e9ancier garanti, les biens du failli passent au syndic. It is doubtful if the learned judge had here in mind the effect of a trust deed of a corporation made to secure a bond issue in pursuance of the Acts referred to, which is the question here to be considered.\nBy the Civil Code, a hypothec does not pass the title and ownership of the property to the mortgagee as in the case of a mortgage at English common law, and only entitles the creditor to have the property sold and to have a preference on the proceeds. Arts. 2016, 2053 C.C.\nMoveables are not ordinarily susceptible of hypothecation; Art. 2022 C.C.\nBoth immoveables and moveables may be pledged, and the pledge of immoveables is subject to the rules contained in the second chapter, relating to pawning, in so far as they can be made to apply. Art. 1967 C.C. The pledging of moveable property is called \u201cpawning\u201d, and the pawning of a thing gives to the creditor a right to be paid from it by privilege and preference before other creditors; and the privilege subsists only while the thing pawned remains in the hands of the creditor or the person appointed by the parties to hold it. Arts. 1968, 1969, 1970 C.C. Immoveable property, to be acquired, in future, cannot be hypothecated; Art. 2037 C.C; and, as moveable property to be acquired cannot be given into possession, it cannot ordinarily be pledged. The ownership of things does not pass to the pledgee. Art. 1972 C.C.\nBy 4 Geo. V., c. 51, s. 1, there was introduced into the R.S.Q. (1909) the following articles:\n6119a. Notwithstanding any existing law any joint stock company, incorporated under an Act of the legislature of the province of Quebec, or by letters-patent, or any company so incorporated outside the province, if empowered thereto by its charter or its letters-patent, may by authentic deed\u2014for the purpose of securing any bonds, debentures or debenture stock which it is by law entitled to issue\u2014hypothecate, mortgage or pledge any property, moveable or immoveable, present or future, which it may own in the province.\n6119b. Such hypothecation, mortgage or pledging may be by trust deed to any trustee, and such security shall be good and valid, notwithstanding that the mortgagor or pledgor may be permitted by the trustee to remain in the possession and use of the property so mortgaged or pledged.\n6119c. The rights which such hypothec and mortgage give upon immoveables, and the manner in which they must be registered, shall be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code in the title of Privileges and Hypothecs and that of Registration of Real Rights, and they shall be subject thereto. The mortgaging and pledge of moveables shall confer a privilege upon moveables present and future, ranking immediately after the other privileges on moveables enumerated in articles 1994, 1994a, 1994b and 1994c of the Civil Code. Such hypothec and such privilege shall take effect only from the date of the registration of the deed by which they are constituted, in the Registry office of the registration division in which the company has its head office in the province, and also in any other division in which it has a place of business.\nThe Registrar shall inscribe the trust deed creating a hypothec upon or a pledge of the moveables, in a register which he shall keep for that purpose, and which shall be at all times, during office hours, open to inspection by the public. The registrar may exact, for such registration and for such inspection, the fee which shall from, time to time be fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nBy 10 Geo. V, c. 72, s. 1, new articles were substituted for articles 5957 to 6090 R.S.Q. (1909) inclusive, article 6009c of which provides that, if authorized by bylaw, the directors may,\nnotwithstanding article 2017 of the Civil Code, hypothecate, mortgage, or pledge the moveable or immoveable property, present or future, of the company, to secure any such debentures, or other securities, or give part only of such guarantee for such purposes; and constitute the hypothec, mortgage or pledge mentioned in this subparagraph, by trust deed, in accordance with articles 6119b and 6119c, or in any other manner.\nBy 14 Geo. V., c. 63, it is enacted as follows:\nWhereas doubts have arisen as to whether, under articles 6119a and following of the Revised Statutes, 1909, as enacted by the Act 4 George V, chapter 51, section 1, a company may cede and transfer to a trustee, with power, in the event of the failure of the company to fulfil the conditions of the trust deed, to take possession of, administer and sell the properties which it is authorized to hypothecate, mortgage and pledge:\nTherefore, His Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, enacts as follows:\n1. It is and always has been lawful for a company falling under articles 6119a and following of the Revised Statutes 1909, besides hypothecating, mortgaging and pledging for the purposes set forth in the said articles, to cede and transfer, for the same purposes, the said properties to the trustee, with power in the event of the failure of the company to fulfil the conditions of the trust deed, to take possession of the properties ceded and transferred, to administer and sell them for the benefit of the bondholders.\nArticles 6119a, 6119b and 6119c, and s. 1 of 14 Geo. V., c. 63, are now sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Special Corporate Powers Act, R.S.Q. (1925), c. 227; and article 6009c of 10 Geo. V., c. 72, is now s. 67c of the Quebec Companies Act, c. 223, R.S.Q. (1925), slightly varied, the first lines reading, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the Civil Code\u201d, and the final part reading:\nBy trust deed in accordance with sections 11 and 12 of the Special Corporate Powers Act (c. 227). A corporation may acquire, alienate and possess property, art. 358 C.C.; and it is suggested that a corporation has the right to cede and transfer its property to secure its bonds independently of these statutes. A joint stock company is a creature of statute law, and when it is given, by express statutory provision, power to secure its bonds on its property by a specific method, as here, it may be limited by implication to that method, and we must therefore determine what is authorized by these statutes dealing with the matter.\nIt is argued that a trust deed, made in terms authorized by this legislation, has not the effect of passing the ownership of the property to the trustee in derogation of articles 1972 and 2053 because article 6119c provides that the rights which such hypothec and mortgage give in immoveables shall be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code in the title of privileges and hypothecs; and the rights conferred by the mortgage and pledge of moveables are stated to be a privilege ranking after certain other privileges set out in the code.\nWe must first note the language at the beginning of article 6119a: \u201cNotwithstanding any existing law\u201d, indicating that the very object of the article was to give to companies the right, by authority of this article, to do what it was thought could not otherwise be done by reason of existing law. It is, however, contended that the special rights, which the statute purports to give, are those set out in the article itself, namely, the right to hypothecate, mortgage and pledge immoveable and moveable property, present and future, and the power to make valid securities of the kind mentioned, though the mortgagor or pledgor be permitted to remain in possession.\nThere could be no doubt about the legislation going to this extent, expressly provided for, in derogation of the provisions of the Civil Code. The statute of 14 Geo. V., c. 63, however, recites that doubts had arisen as to whether, under articles 6119a and following, a company may cede and transfer to a trustee, with power, in the event of the failure of the company to fulfil the conditions of the trust deed, to take possession of, administer and sell the properties which it is authorized to hypothecate, mortgage and pledge. It is then enacted that it is and has always been lawful for a company, falling under the articles referred to, besides hypothecating, mortgaging and pledging for the purposes set forth in the articles, to cede and transfer, for the same purposes, the said properties, with the powers mentioned in the recital. This is a declaration by the legislature that these special rights are given by the articles in question, in addition to those expressly mentioned, notwithstanding anything in the Civil Code and notwithstanding the provisions of art. 6119c.\nA deed that cedes and transfers property passes the ownership to the transferee, according to the ordinary meaning of the words. If this is not the intention of the Act, what do the words \u201ccede and transfer the property\u201d give in addition to what is given by the other words, \u201chypothecate, mortgage and pledge,\u201d already appearing in article 6119a?\nIt is argued that the question intended to be set at rest by 14 Geo. V., \u0441 63, was the right of the trustee to take possession of the properties, and to administer and sell them for the benefit of the bondholders. If that was all that was intended, it was only necessary to declare that it is and always has been lawful, under article 6119a, to hypothecate, mortgage and pledge, with power to the trustee to take possession, etc.\nBy the language of the statute, it is to a trust deed which cedes and transfers the property that the power to take possession and sell attaches. The construction contended for would attach the power to take possession and sell to every hypothec and pledge, and would give no effect to the words, \u201ccede and transfer.\u201d It seems to me that the very object of the statute was to declare that it is and always has been lawful for the company under article 6119a to do something more than hypothecate, mortgage and pledge property to a trustee for the purposes named, namely, to cede and transfer the same; that is, to transfer the ownership of it to a trustee, with the powers mentioned. This is the right that a company has under the English common law, which gives to a trustee for bondholders higher rights than are given by hypothec and pledge under the Civil Code. The object, therefore, seems to be to extend to a trustee for bondholders of a company having property in Quebec the fuller rights over the property given in security that would be given by a mortgage under the English common law, which transfers the ownership to the trustee.\nArticle 6119c was in the statute when 14 Geo. V., c. 63, was enacted, and, if I am right as to what was intended by the latter statute, the provisions of this article become subject to whatever modification is necessary to give full effect to article 6119a, according to the interpretation to be placed on it, as declared by the later statute of 14 Geo. V.\nIt remains to be determined whether or not we have in this case a trust deed made in pursuance of the power given by the statute in terms that transfer to the trustee the ownership in the property with the powers there mentioned. The language of the deed is:\n* * * la companie hypoth\u00e8que, gr\u00e8ve et affecte, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de neuf cent cinquante mille piastres ($950,000) en faveur du fiduciaire, acceptant, pour lui-m\u00eame et pour les porteurs d\u2019obligations, et lui c\u00e8de, transporte et donne en gage, au m\u00eame titre, tous ses biens meubles et immeubles * * *\nIt is contended that the later words of conveyance should be read \u201cc\u00e8de en gage, transporte en gage et donne en gage\u201d, which amount only to the creation of a \u201cdroit de gage\u201d, and leaves the ownership in the debtor company until the property has been appropriated by the trustee in satisfaction of his claim, after default, or has been sold for that purpose. It is pointed out that throughout the document it is described as \u201chypothec\u201d and \u201cgarantie\u201d, and that many of its provisions have reference only to a document of that character. It has, however, the words \u201ccede and transfer\u201d, and gives power to the trustee to take possession of the property and \u201cadminister the affairs of the company\u201d, and to sell the property. These powers are not connected with the words \u201ccede and transfer\u201d, as in the statute, and they are not set out in the exact language of the statute where the power is to take possession of the property, \u201cto administer and sell for the benefit of the bondholders\u201d. In the clause giving power to sell it is not stated to be for the benefit of the bondholders, and nothing is said as to what is to be done with the proceeds. On a sale by the trustee, he is empowered to deliver the property sold to the buyer on receipt of the price, and to give him \u201cbons titres, pour et en nom de la Compagnie\u201d.\nI think the words of the conveyance, \u201cc\u00e8de et transporte\u201d found in the document, have the effect of transferring the ownership, and the trustee, having thus become vested with the ownership, is bound to deal with the the property as provided in the deed. It may, I think, be implied that power given by the deed to the trustee to administer the affairs of the company and to sell, is for the benefit of the bondholders, and that, therefore, the trust deed, though badly drawn, comes within the description in the statute.\nThe property, therefore, became vested in the trustee for the bondholders, and all that passed to the liquidator was the right that the bankrupt had to get it back on payment of the bonds. The order in question, however, authorizes the liquidators to sell and convey this property in full ownership, though they are not possessed of the ownership.\nThe authority relied on for this is s. 45 of the Bankruptcy Act. That section relates only to hypothecs and pledges, and this being a security of a different character, having a different effect, that section does not apply. The sections of the Bankruptcy Act which give jurisdiction to the liquidator to sell property the ownership of which is vested in a creditor as security for his debt are those under the heading \u201cProof by Secured Creditors\u201d, commencing with s. 106. There were no proceedings taken to bring these sections into operation.\nIt was argued that the trustee for the bondholders had a right to represent them, and appeared by counsel to oppose the opposition and to express approval of the order.\nIt is quite clear, as has been held in the court below, that the appellants failed to establish default on the part of the trustee by failure to take possession of the property at the request of certain bondholders, because they did not fulfil the conditions set out in the trust deed required to be fulfilled before the trustee was under obligation to take possession. If, however, the view that I have expressed as to the effect of the trust deed is correct, the liquidators had no authority to sell, and the court no jurisdiction to authorize a sale, and the trustee could not by assent vest the liquidators with authority to sell. The trustee had the ownership of the property vested in it to hold for the bondholders, and, on the assertion by the liquidators of an adverse title to ownership, the trustee took the attitude, quite possibly in good faith under the impression that the trust deed is merely a hypothec, of abandoning its ownership to the adverse claimant. This gave the appellants a status to come into court to protect their security thus being voluntarily surrendered.\nIt appears that there are builders\u2019 liens registered against the property which, it is said, give the lienholders priority over the trustee for the bondholders on the increased value added to the property by the building, and that therefore the trustee will be unable to exercise its power of sale, and that a sale by direction of the court will be necessary in any case. We are, however, concerned only with the jurisdiction to make the particular order in question in the bankruptcy proceedings, and have nothing to do with what may be done by the trustee under whatever powers he may have, or with what the court may order in other proceedings.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

Town of Strasbourg, [1931] S.C.R. 72\nDate: 1930-10-15\nCanadian Utilities Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Town of Strasbourg Respondent.\n1930: October 15.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE ASSESSMENT COMMISSION FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Assessment for \u201cspecial franchise\u201d\u2014Town Act, Sask., 1927, c. 24, s. 413 (6).\nAppellant had a special franchise for supply of electric light and power to respondent town. It had only a distribution system within the town, its generating plant being elsewhere. The town assessed the pole line and distribution system at $3,000 and the franchise at $7,000. Appellant contended that, as it had no property in the town except that assessed at $3,000 as aforesaid, the $7,000 assessment on the franchise was illegal, being contrary to s. 413 (6) of the Town Act, Sask., 1927, c. 24.\nHeld (Newcombe J. dubitante): The assessment did not violate s. 413 (6). Assessment must be made of the land and, \u201cin addition,\u201d of the special franchise according to the method of determination laid down. Any argument that might otherwise be based on \u201cdouble assessment\u201d was met by the express statutory provision. There was nothing to shew that the assessment at $7,000 for the franchise was not correct or that the assessment had been made on a wrong basis.\nAPPEAL by the Canadian Utilities Limited from the decision of the Assessment Commission of Saskatchewan dismissing its appeal from the decision of the Court of Revision of the Town of Strasbourg confirming the assessment made by the assessor of said town of the appellant\u2019s property situate therein for the year 1929.\nOn 21st August, 1928, the respondent town, which owned an electric light and power generating plant and distribution system, by agreement sold to the appellant all its property used or acquired for or in connection with it (but excluding the power house building and land) for the price of $12,000, and by agreement on the same date granted to the appellant (subject to the terms and provisions of the agreement) an exclusive franchise for a period of 20 years for the supply of electric light and power to the town. (It was admitted that the franchise so granted was a special franchise within the meaning of the Town Act, Sask., 1927, \u0441 24). The total consideration paid by the appellant to the respondent in respect of the sale and franchise agreements was the said sum of $12,000. The appellant supplies electric light and power to some forty cities, towns and villages in the province of Saskatchewan. Its method of operation is to establish a generating plant in a central town from which transmission lines are built to several towns and villages in which the appellant maintains a distribution system and which are thus supplied from the central plant. Since the said agreements the appellant has been supplying the respondent town with electric light and power from a generating plant situate at the town of Nokomis; it has not had any generating plant within the respondent town but has there a distribution system including poles, wires and transformers.\nThe assessor of the respondent town proceeded to assess the appellant in respect to its property and franchise within the town for the year 1929. He assessed the \u201cpole line\u201d at $3,000 and the \u201cfranchise\u201d at $7,000, making in all $10,000. It is stated in the judgment of the Assessment Commission that \u201cthe assessor submitted that in making the assessment of $10,000 he proportioned the amounts as follows: $3,000 to land which represents pole line and distribution system, and $7,000 to the special franchise.\u201d\nAppeals taken by the appellant to the Court of Revision and then to the Assessment Commission were dismissed. Special leave was granted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe Town Act, Sask., 1927, c. 24, enacts, by s. 410, that, subject to the other provisions of the Act, the municipal and school taxes of the town shall be levied upon (1) lands; (2) businesses; (3) income; and (4) special franchises. Sec. 413 provides the mode of assessing land and businesses, and also, by subsecs. 6 and 7, enacts as follows:\n(6) The Owner of a special franchise shall not be assessed in respect of business or income in respect of such franchise, but in addition to an assessment on land shall be assessed for the actual cost of the plant and apparatus less a reasonable deduction for depreciation.\n(7) No person who is assessed in respect of any business or special franchise or of any income derived therefrom shall be liable to pay a licence fee to the town in respect of the same business or special franchise.\n\u201cLand\u201d is defined in s. 2 (12) as follows:\n\u201cLand\u201d includes lands, tenements and hereditaments and any estate or interest therein, or right or easement affecting the same; and\n(a) buildings or parts of buildings, structures, machinery or fixtures, erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to, land; and (b) structures or fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to, any highway, lane or public place or water, but not the rolling stock of a railway, electric railway, tramway or street railway;\n\u201cSpecial franchise\u201d is defined in s. 2 (27) as follows:\n\u201cSpecial franchise\u201d means every right, authority or permission to construct, maintain or operate within the town in, under, above, on or through any highway, road, street, lane, public place or public water within the jurisdiction of the town, any poles, wires, tracks, pipes, conduits, buildings, erections, structures or other things for the purposes of bridges, railways or tramways or for the purpose of conducting steam, heat, water, gas, oil, electricity or any property, substance or product capable of being transported, transmitted or conveyed for the supply of water and heat, power, transportation, telegraphic or other service;\n\u201cIncome\u201d is defined in s. 2 (10).\nThe appellant did not appeal against the assessment of the pole line at $3,000, and for the purposes of this appeal it was admitted that this was a proper assessment.\nIt was contended by the appellant that the legislature has laid down an arbitrary mode for the assessment of a special franchise; and the assessment must be restricted as provided in ss. 6 of s. 413; and, as the \u201cpole line\u201d (which, it was submitted, was \u201cland\u201d within the meaning of the Act, but whether treated as land or as plant and equipment was immaterial, as the result would be the same) was the only property which the appellant had within the town, and as this had been assessed at $3,000, the total assessment should have been $3,000 and no more.\nE. C. Leslie for the appellant.\nNo one appeared for the respondent.\nAt the close of the argument of counsel for the appellant, the members of the Court retired for consultation, and on their returning to the Bench, the Court orally delivered judgment, dismissing the appeal without costs.\nAnglin C. J. \u0421\u2014The majority of the Court is of the opinion that this appeal fails.\nIn the first place, the appeal is confined to one ground only,\u2014ground no. 2 in the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Assessment Commission, viz: that \u201cthe assessment of the franchise was not made in accordance with the provisions of the Town Act.\u201d Ground no. 3 (that \u201cthe value placed upon the franchise for assessment purposes was excessive\u201d), was abandoned below and was not urged here.\nAs to ground no. 2, as we read the statute, assessment must be made both of the land and of the special franchise. Then, as the majority of us think, the statute proceeds clearly to determine how the assessments are to be made; and, as to a \u201cspecial franchise,\u201d it must be assessed at the actual cost of the plant and apparatus, less a reasonable deduction for depreciation. The fact that the poles (which apparently constitute the chief, but not necessarily the sole, plant and apparatus in the town) may have already been taken into account as part of the land assessed at $3,000 is beside the question, the statute directing that the special franchise shall be assessed \u201cin addition\u201d and that for the purpose of ascertaining its value the assessor shall take the actual cost price of the plant and apparatus less a reasonable deduction for depreciation. The express provision of the statute answers any argument which might otherwise be based on \u201cdouble assessment.\u201d The actual cost of the plant and apparatus (including franchise) was $12,000, plus expenditures subsequently made by the company in replacements and renewals, etc. There is nothing to show that the assessment at $7,000 for the \u201cspecial franchise\u201d is not correct, or that that assessment has been made on a wrong basis.\nThat being so, the appeal fails, and must be dismissed.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I am not satisfied that the statute has made clear how the assessment in respect of the franchise is to be ascertained. I think it improbable that it was intended that the cost of the land should figure twice in the assessment; and, with all due respect, I am not at all persuaded that the result which my Lord, the Chief Justice, has reached is borne out by the words of the Act. It is the duty of the authority which urges the tax to establish that it is imposed with reasonable clearness; and I am not satisfied\u2014I shall not dissent, because the respondent has not been heard, and my learned brothers are in agreement with the opinion that has been expressed,\u2014but I may say that I am very doubtful about it.\nThe other members of the Court concurred with Anglin, \u0421. J. \u0421.\nAnglin \u0421. J. \u0421. (After discussing with counsel the matter of costs).\u2014The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacPherson, Leslie & Paul.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Burlington, [1931] S.C.R. 76\nDate: 1930-06-10\nJames Richardson & Sons Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Steamer \u201cBurlington\u201d (Defendant) Respondent.\n1930: May 2; 1930: June 10.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nShipping\u2014Bill of lading\u2014Law of United States\u2014International law\u2014Art. 8 C.C.\nThe appellant company contracted with the respondent ship for the carriage of a cargo of wheat from Buffalo to Montreal. The bills of lading were signed in the United States of America, both the shipper and the shipowner being American subjects. The respondent alleged that the bill of lading was issued subject to the Harter Act passed by the Congress of the United States in 1893, although no special reference was made to the exemptions mentioned in that Act, while the appellant alleged that that Act did not apply as it was not referred to or made part of the contract.\nHeld that the obligations of the parties under the contract were governed by the laws of the United States, the law of the flag in this case being the same as the lex loci contractus. Lloyd v. Guibert (L.R. 1 Q.B. 115) foll.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Lam ont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\u2014The intention of the parties, unless it is clearly shown that they intended to apply the law of Canada, must be taken as accepting, to all intents and purposes, the law of the United States, to which they were both subject as American citizens when they contracted for the carriage of ar\u0131 American cargo, in an American ship, from an American port, especially since the loading, transhipment at Buffalo and most of the navigation was to take place in American territory. If a contract of carriage were to be governed by the law of the country of destination because the last act of the contract,\u2019 the delivery, is to be performed there, then the contract of carriage would have to be governed by the laws of different countries when goods shipped together would have several destinations in such countries, which case is inconceivable.\nHeld, also, that the act of the oiler in removing by mistake the cover or bonnet of the sea-cock instead of the plates on the air-pump, thus causing damage to the cargo by water, was a fault in the \u201cmanagement\u201d of the ship.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The rule governing the case is that enunciated by Willes J. in Lloyd v. Guibert cited above that, where the contract of affreightment does not provide otherwise, the law applicable is the law of the flag.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1929] Ex. C.R. 196) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, Demers J.[1], dismissing with costs the appellant\u2019s action as consignee of certain cargo of grain against the respondent ship for loss and damage to the cargo whilst on the ship.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the appellant.\nE. M. McDougall K.C. and C. R. McKenzie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The appellant, in opening the case, declared that he accepted the facts as summarized in respondent\u2019s factum as follows:\nA cargo of grain belonging to the appellant was shipped from Chicago, in the state of Illinois, U.S.A., under a through bill of lading dated August 1, 1927, destined for Montreal, P.Q., for transhipment at the port of Buffalo, N.Y., where it was loaded on the respondent ship on August 8, 1927, and consigned to the appellant at the port of Montreal, where the said ship arrived safely on the 11th day of August, 1927.\nShortly after the arrival of the said ship the chief engineer, in connection with the management thereof, instructed one of the oilers, named Montroy, to pump up the boilers, close the sea-cock valve off and to take certain covers off the air-pump.\nThe said Montroy by mistake removed the cover or bonnet off the sea-cock instead of the plates off the air-pump thus causing a sudden inrush of water into the engine room which could not be checked. In order to prevent the ship sinking at her berth in deep water, she was beached but with a bad list to port, submerging her hatches and bringing about the resultant damage to the appellant\u2019s cargo.\nThe Harter Act, which the trial judge has applied to this case, was passed by the Congress of the United States of America on the 13th February, 1893; the respondent was found to be entitled to the exemption set forth in section 3 thereof, which enacts that if the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise to or from any port in the United States of America shall exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, neither the vessel, her owner, agent or charterers shall become or be held responsible for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the said vessel. The first and main question to be determined is whether or not the so called Harter Act governs this case.\nThe bills of lading were signed in the United States of America, both the shipper and the shipowner being American subjects. No special reference was made to the exemptions of the Harter Act. It was agreed however that the consignee or owner of the cargo would not be exempt from liability for contribution in general average, even if the owner of the ship had exercised due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, or if the said owners were exempt for damage resulting from faults or neglect of the master, pilot or crew in the navigation or management of the ship. The wording of this clause is evidently inspired by the above section 3 of the Harter Act.\nScrutton, on charterparties and bills of lading, 12th edition, says at page 19:\nThe general rule of English law is that a contract is to be construed according to the law by which the parties intend to be bound. If that intention is not expressed in the contract, the court must ascertain what is their implied intention. In the absence of other indications, in ordinary contracts, the implication will be that the parties intended to be bound by the lex loci contractus.\nIn regard to charterparties and bills of lading the general rule as to contracts applies; they will be governed by the law by which the parties intend to be bound, and if that is not expressed, it must be ascertained as a matter of implication. But in the absence of other indications, as regards charterparties and bills of lading, the primary implication will be that the parties intended to be bound by the law of the ship\u2019s flag, and not, as in other contracts, by the lex loci contractus.\nIn this case, it is to be noted that the ss. Burlington is an American ship and that the law of the flag is the same as the lex loci contractus. Lloyd v. Guibert et al[2], laid down the rule that,\nwhere the contract of affreightment does not provide otherwise, as between the parties to the contract, in respect to sea damage and its incidents, the law of the country to which the ship belongs must be taken to be the law to which they have submitted themselves.\nThe Cour de cassation in France, on December 5, 1910, re American Trading Company v. Quebec Steamship Company, held inter alia:\nEntre personnes de nationalit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes, la loi du lieu o\u00f9 le contrat est intervenu est, en principe, celle \u00e0 laquelle il faut s\u2019attacher.\nMais les parties peuvent, par une manifestation de volont\u00e9 expresse ou tacite, adopter une autre loi, \u00e0 laquelle leur contrat sera soumis. These principles, recognized in England and France, are also embodied in article 8 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec:\nDeeds are construed according to the laws of the country where they were passed, unless there is some law to the contrary, or the parties have agreed otherwise, or by the nature of the deed or from other circumstances, it appears that the intention of the parties was to be governed by the law of another place; in any of which cases, effect is given to such law, or such intention expressed or presumed.\nIn this instance, the intention of the parties, unless it is clearly shown that they intended to apply the law of Canada, must, in my opinion, be taken as accepting, to all intents and purposes, the law of the United States, to which they were both subject as American citizens when they contracted for the carriage of an American cargo, in an American ship, from an American port. An important feature is that the loading, transhipment at Buffalo, and most of the navigation was to take place in American territory.\nIf a contract of carriage were to be governed by the law of the country of destination because the last act of the contract, the delivery, is to be performed there, what would happen if goods were shipped together having several destinations to different countries? It is inconceivable that the contract of carriage must be governed by the laws of the several destinations. There must and can be only one law governing the carriage and clothing the contract once and for all with all the privileges, obligations and immunities belonging to that law.\nI accept what was said in the case of The Peninsular & Oriental Company v. Shand[3], by Lord Justice Turner at p. 290:\nThe general rule is, that the law of the country where a contract is made governs as to nature, the obligation, and the interpretation of it. The parties to a contract are either the subjects of the power there ruling, or as temporary residents owe it a temporary allegiance: in either case equally they must be understood to submit to the law there prevailing and to agree to its action upon their contract. It is, of course, immaterial that such agreement is not expressed in terms; it is equally an agreement in fact, presumed de jure, and a foreign court interpretating or enforcing it on any contrary rule defeats the intention of the parties, as well as neglects to observe the recognized comity of nations. I note with interest what His Lordship adds at page 292:\nIt is a satisfaction to their Lordships to find that in the year 1864 the Cour de Cassation in France pronounced a judgment to the same effect in a case under precisely the same circumstances, which arose between the appellants and a French officer who was returning with his baggage from Hong Kong in one of their ships, the Alma, and who lost his baggage in the wreck of that vessel in the Red Sea. The same question arose as here on the effect to be given to the stipulation in the ticket; two inferior courts, those of Marseilles and Aix, decided it in favour of the plaintiff on the provisions of the French law; the Supreme Court reversed these decisions, and held that the contract having been made at Hong Kong, an English possession, and with an English company, was to receive its interpretation and effect according to English law.\nI therefore agree with the learned trial judge that the obligation of the parties are governed by the laws of the United States.\nThere remain then, in this case, two questions of fact:\n1. Have the owners of the Burlington exercised due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied?\n2. Does the damage complained of by plaintiff result from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the vessel?\nThe trial judge dealt with the first question of fact as follows:\nThe defence has established that their vessel was duly classified as a first-class vessel to transport goods on the lakes, and that she had also been duly inspected by the proper inspectors, and it is proved that the owners had made the repairs asked for.\nTo this evidence, which made a prima facie case in favour of the Burlington, the plaintiff objects, that the vessel was not seaworthy, specially because the bulkheads between the machinery and cargo were not water-tight to the spar deck.\nIt is proved and it appears in exhibit D-13, that the bulkheads are required by the laws of the United States only on vessels carrying passengers, and it is also provided by these rules that the rules of the American Bureau of Shipping respecting the construction of hulls, boilers and \u2018machinery, and the certificate of classification referring thereto, shall be accepted as tendered by the inspectors of this service.\nThere has been some controversy as to the rules of the American Bureau of Shipping, and it is doubtful if the old rules of the Great Lakes Register do apply, but even taking those rules, I see that the approval of a ship could be given, though not built in every respect according to the rules and tables of the register, article 4, section 1, p. 19.\nIt is true that section 44 states that all water-tight bulkheads should extend to the upper deck, but it is added, in conformity with rule 4 already quoted, that when the construction is such that special arrangements are desired, plans for same must be submitted to the committee.\nThis shows that the committee can approve of a boat where the bulkhead is not water-tight to the spar-deck.\nIn this case, the bulkhead was water-tight up to the main deck which was seventeen feet six inches (17\u2019 6\u201d) above the keel and inasmuch as the ship\u2019s draught was thirteen feet eleven inches (13\u2019 11\u201d), the Burlington had a freeboard of three feet seven inches (3\u2019 7\u201d) above the water-line.\nIt would then have been necessary to load down the Burlington three feet seven inches (3\u2019 7\u201d) deeper before the water would have reached the top of the main deck, which could not have been done because the canal draught is only fourteen feet (14\u2019).\nThere is no question that the removing of the boards of the spar deck could not, under the circumstances, have any effect on the seaworthiness of the ship.\nThe second objection made by the plaintiff is that the Burlington was not seaworthy because there were no extension control rods of the sluice valves.\nIt is proved that no such extension rod exists on any lake vessel. The only witness who has said the contrary is unable to name a single lake boat which has such extension rods, and even the witness Drake, for the plaintiff, says he never saw the requirement for one.\nThe third complaint was that the Burlington was not seaworthy because the boiler pan or flooring on which the boiler fitting rests was corroded.\nThis is contradicted and the same witness Drake, who pretends that the boiler pan was in a corroded condition, adds: \u201cbut not seriously to effect it,\u201d and in my opinion this disposes of that objection.\nIn short, the defendant has proved diligence, and more than that, it \u0456s proved that the Burlington was fit for the transportation of that cargo to Montreal.\nI do not see any reason to decide, and the appellant\u2019s factum and argument do not show, that the trial judge had erred in reaching these findings of fact. The Burlington was fit to, and did, transport the cargo of grain to Montreal.\nThe learned trial judge states that he felt inclined to have grave doubts on the second question, to wit: does the damage or loss complained of result from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the vessel?\nLord Justice Scrutton, in his book already quoted, said:\nMuch discussion has taken place * * * on the words \u201cnavigation\u201d and \u201cmanagement\u201d in section 3 of the Harter Act. This passage in the Harter Act has since been copied in the New Zealand Act of 1922, the Canadian Act of 1910, and in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924. The authorities are not in a very satisfactory condition, but in view of the vagueness of the words to be construed this is hardly surprising. It seems that the exceptions in the contract of affreightment, unless otherwise worded, limit the shipowner\u2019s liability during the whole time in 20865\u20141 which he is in possession of the goods as carrier (Norman v. Binnington[4], The Carron Park[5]; per Wright J., in De Clermont v. General Steam Navigation Co.[6]). Accordingly an exception of negligence \u201cduring the voyage\u201d was held by Sir J. Hannen to cover negligence during loading, and to apply to the whole time during which the vessel was engaged in performing the contract contained in the charter, and an exception of \u201cdamage in navigating the ship, or otherwise,\u201d was held to cover damage done during loading (Norman v. Binnington4). Cf. The Glenochil[7] in which an exception \u201cfaults in management\u201d was held to cover putting water into the ballast tanks while the cargo was being discharged, without ascertaining that the pipes were in order. See also Blackburn v. Liverpool Co.[8]; and The Rodney[9]. So also in club policies of insurance. In Good v. London Mutual Association[10]. In The W ark-worth[11], leaving a sea-cock and bilge-cock open, whereby the water entered the hold, was held \u201cimproper navigation\u201d within the policy; Willes J., defining the phrase as \u201csomething improperly done with the ship or part of the ship in the course of the voyage.\u201d In Carmichael\u2019s Case (Carmichael v. Liverpool S.S. Association[12]), a cargo of wheat was damaged through improper caulking of a cargo-port by the shipowner\u2019s servants before the voyage commenced: and it was held by the Court of Appeal that this was \u201cimproper navigation\u201d within the policy. In Canada Shipping Co. v. British Shipowners\u2019 Association[13], a cargo of wheat was damaged by being stowed in a dirty hold, and this was held by the Court of Appeal not to be improper navigation. In The Southgate[14], where water entered through a valve improperly left open while the vessel was moored with cargo in her before starting, Barnes J., seems to have thought that the accident was one of \u201cnavigation,\u201d while he decided that it was clearly an \u201caccident of the sea and other waters\u201d; and in The Glenochil7, where the engineer, while the cargo was being discharged, pumped water into the ballast tank to secure stability, without inspecting the pipes, and the water through a broken pipe damaged the cargo, the Divisional Court held that this was in the \u201cmanagement,\u201d even if it was not in the \u201cnavigation\u201d of the vessel. Both in The Rodney9, where the boatswain in trying to get water out of the forecastle by freeing a pipe with a rod broke the pipe so that the water got in the cargo; and in the Rowson v. Atlantic Transport Co.[15], where meat was damaged by the negligent working of refrigerating machinery, the casualty was held to be a \u201cfault in the management.\u201d\nLord Scrutton, since the 12th edition of his work, has rendered in the Court of Appeal, on the 25th November, 1927, a very interesting judgment re Grosse Millerd, Ltd. & Another v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Ltd.[16], in which he sheds more light on the question:\nIt is difficult to reconcile the decisions of the United States courts with themselves or with the English decisions; and the Harter Act itself differs widely from the English Act. This arises partly from the fact that the United States courts treated all negligence clauses in contracts of affreightment as contrary to public policy, and the Harter Act was therefore an allowance of clauses contrary to public policy, and as such to be restricted, while the English courts allowed freedom of contract, and limited provisions which restricted that freedom. From this point of view sects. 1 and 2 of the Harter Act were treated as the fundamental purpose of the Act, and as Holmes J., said in the Germanic[17], remove matters which would otherwise be within the exceptions of sect. 3 from its operation. The English Act on the other hand, expressly makes the obligations of arts. II and III subject to the immunities and exceptions of art. IV. In the Germanic17, a combined operation of loading coal for ship\u2019s use and discharging cargo was conducted so negligently that the ship lost her trim and capsized. This was held not \u201cmanagement of the ship.\u201d I should have thought it clearly was such management, just as provision of ballast would be. The United States courts have held management of the ship not to include: Insufficient covering of the hatches (The Jeanie[18]); failure to open hatches to ventilate cargo (the Jean Bart[19]); failure to close hatches during rough weather, which had been opened to ventilate cargo (Andean Trading Company v. Pacific Steam Navigation Company[20]);. negligent management of refrigerating machinery (the Samland[21]). I, says His Lordship, should have decided all these cases differently. They have held management of the ship to include: failure to pump water out of bilges, causing damages to cargo (the Merida[22] and other cases); mismanagement of seacocks whereby cargo is damaged (American Sugar Refining Company v. Rickinson[23]); failure to cover ventilators or sounding pipes or to close port holes (the Hudson[24]); the Newport News[25]; the Carisbrook[26]; the Silvia[27].\u058a\nThe House of Lords, on November 16,1928[28], reversed this decision on the facts of the case (negligence in dealing with tarpaulins covering cargo hatches during repairs), but Lord Chancellor Hausham said at page 93:\nMy Lord, in my judgment, the principle laid down in the Glenochil[29] and accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases arising under the American Harter Act, and affirmed and applied by the Court of Appeal in the Hourani case under the present English Statute is the correct one to apply.\nThe question might arise whether or not we should, in this case, apply the American decisions in interpreting the word \u201cmanagement,\u201d as used in the Harter Act, in preference to English cases; but I believe, with the trial judge, and from the above synopsis of American judgments, that the jurisprudence applicable to the facts of the present case is well settled in favour of the defendant and that, in the United States, the act of the oiler Montroy, in removing the cover or bonnet of the sea-cock, would be considered as a fault in the \u201cmanagement\u201d of the ship during the voyage, as the cargo had not yet been delivered.\nOn the whole, I think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The facts as summarized in the respondent\u2019s factum are accepted by the appellants. They are in these words:\nA cargo of grain belonging to the appellant was shipped from Chicago in the state of Illinois, U.S.A., under a through bill of lading dated August 1, 1927, destined for Montreal, P.Q., for transhipment at the port of Buffalo, N.Y., where it was loaded on the respondent ship on August 8, 1927, and consigned to the appellant at the port of Montreal, where the said ship arrived safely on the 11th day of August, 1927.\nShortly after the arrival of the said ship the chief engineer, in connection with the management thereof, instructed one of the oilers, named Montroy, to pump up the boilers, close the sea-cock valve off and to take certain covers off the air-pump.\nThe said Montroy by mistake removed the cover or bonnet off the sea-cock instead of the plates on the air-pump thus causing a sudden inrush of water into the engine room which could not be checked. In order to prevent the ship sinking at her berth in deep water, she was beached but with a bad list to port, submerging her hatches and bringing about the resultant damage to the appellant\u2019s cargo.\nThe rule as to the law applicable was laid down in the famous judgment of Mr. Justice Willes, speaking for the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Lloyd v. Guibert[30], in these words:\nWhere the contract of affreightment does not provide otherwise, as between the parties to the contract, in respect of sea damage and its incidents, the law of the country to which the ship belongs must be taken to be the law to which they have submitted themselves.\nThis law, as far as I know, has never been questioned in any relevant sense, and it is to be observed that the Court of Appeal had no power to over-rule a decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber. Furthermore, these observations of Chitty J. are to the purpose, quoted from the Missouri case[31]. He declared that the principle of Lloyd v. Guibert30, that is to say, the principle on which the case proceeded (the law of the flag) \u0456s not confined to the particular facts of that case, but is applicable and ought to.be applied not merely to questions of construction, and the rights incidental to and arising out of the contract of affreightment, but to questions as to the validity of the stipulations in the contract itself * * *. It is just to presume that in reference to all such questions the parties have submitted themselves to the law of one country only, that of the flag; and so to hold is to adopt a simple natural and consistent rule.\nI am not myself, treating the subject as a pure question of fact, able to reach the conclusion that the negligence charged against the Burlington could be held to be a fault in navigation as distinguished from a fault in management. It seems to me that the principle laid down by the House of Lords in the Glenochil[32] and accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is the sound principle. Sir Frances Jeune says:\nIt seems to me clear that management goes beyond navigation and far enough to take in this class of acts which do not affect the sailing or movement of the vessel, but do affect the vessel itself.\nWith this the House of Lords[33], agree.\nI know it is easy to criticise by analysis the distinction between the primary object and the indirect effect of acts done in order to accomplish that object, but though there may be cases in which the distinction is fine and difficult, as a rule there is not much difficulty in applying such a principle. It seems to me what was done in this case was an act directly affecting the ship and the cargo, and only indirectly the sailing of the ship, and was therefore an act of management. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1929] Ex.

The failure of the employer to do so is a fault, and a fault without excuse.\nIn the statutory phrase \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d contained in section 6 of the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the word \u201cinexcusable\u201d is not a juridical term of art or a word to which any special technical significance can attach. It must therefore be applied in its ordinary sense as determined by the common usage, in light, of course, of the context in which it occurs, and of the subject matter of the statute. It is no part of the function of the courts to restrict or fix its meaning by paraphrases derived from text writers or other sources. \u201cEach oase must be judged from its own facts.\u201d Montreal Tramways Co. v. Savignac ([1920] A.C. 408).\nThe general rule as to the employer\u2019s responsibility, laid down by article 1054 C.C., governs the application of section 6: the \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d of a servant or workman, \u201cin the performance of the work in which he is employed,\u201d within the meaning of article 1054, is imputable to the employer. Montreal Tramways Co. v. Savignac ([1920] A.C. 408) foll.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Desaulniers J. and maintaining the incidental demand of the respondent.\nThe facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ. C. H. Dussault K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Pouliot K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014On the 11th of October, 1926, the respondent was engaged by the appellants to work in a compressed air caisson. He was quite without experience in such work; but after undergoing the usual medical examination by the appellants\u2019 doctor, he was set to work with a gang of caisson men and continued to work through the whole of an eight hour shift, from four o\u2019clock in the afternoon till twelve midnight, minus an interval of about half an hour. At the end of this shift, on coming into the open air, he felt ill and made the comparatively short journey to his home with a good deal of difficulty. His illness became progressively more distressing during the night, and in the morning he called in the appellants\u2019 doctor, who placed him in hospital and applied the treatment usual in such cases, but with little or no beneficial effect. The respondent is a man of thirty-four and it has been found by the courts below that his illness produced a permanent total disability.\nThe action was based upon the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, in force at the time, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 274. By that statute, persons suffering injuries in consequence of accident happening by reason of or in the course of their work as workmen or employees engaged in certain specified occupations (which include that in which the plaintiff was employed), are entitled to compensation according to the provisions of the statute. The maximum capital of the grant or annuity, to which a person is entitled under the Act, is, save in one case, $3,000. The exceptional case is provided for in section 6 in these words:\u2014\nThe court may reduce the compensation if the accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the workman, or increase it, if it was due to the inexcusable fault of the employer.\nAt the trial the appellants admitted their liability for the maximum sum of $3,000; but denied their responsibility under section 6, as for \u201cinexcusable fault.\u201d The court of first instance rejected the claim of the respondent under this latter head, and this judgment was reversed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, which maintained the larger claim, and, upon that basis, awarded an additional indemnity of $7,000. The question of substance is whether or not \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d has been established. It is not disputed that the respondent\u2019s disability is the result of \u201ccaisson disease\u201d, a term applied to groups of morbid changes met with among caisson workers, and divers working in diving dress. Compressed air caissons are employed in the construction of bridge foundations, and the foundations of other structures in water bearing strata. A shaft and air lock afford access and exit for men and materials; and the air pressure is varied according to the head of water. In order to exclude water, this pressure, in subaqueous work, is increased by one atmosphere (or 15 lbs. per square inch) for every thirty feet or so (or \u00bd lb. for every foot) of submergence below the surface. Exposure to such pressures may be followed by symptoms of various kinds, including pains in muscles and joints (\u201cbends\u201d), deafness, embarrassed breathing, vomiting, by paralysis and even by death. These symptoms do not appear while the pressure continues, but only after it has been removed; the generally accepted theory being that they are due to the effervescence of gases absorbed in the body fluids during exposure to pressure. When the pressure is suddenly released, gas is liberated in bubbles throughout the body. Set free in the spinal cord, these bubbles may give rise to partial paralysis, or, in the heart, to stoppage of the circulation. But if the pressure is relieved gradually, they are not formed as a rule, because the gas comes out of solution slowly, and is removed by the lungs. The evidence shews that some people are not fit subjects for these experiences, and any condition of body which may seriously impede the activity of the organs in eliminating, during the process of decompression, the gases absorbed, constitutes a disqualification. Where, on decompression, any symptom occurs indicating that elimination has not been completely effected, the subject ought to be immediately recompressed and the pressure withdrawn at a more gradual rate. If applied immediately on the appearance of the symptoms, this treatment is commonly effectual.\nThe respondent charged \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d in two respects. First, he alleged that decompression was effected too rapidly. Secondly, he averred that the appellants had been grossly negligent in failing to instruct him as to the risks attendant upon the work he was employed to do, and as to the necessity, in the event of untoward symptoms supervening, of resorting immediately to medical assistance; and moreover, that provision was not made at the works themselves for prompt medical attention.\nAs to the first of these allegations, the Court of King\u2019s Bench found in favour of the respondent, and undeniably there is much to be adduced, in support of that finding, from the evidence. On the other hand, the learned trial judge did not reach the same conclusion. His opinion is expressed in these words:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas, de toute \u00e9vidence, que le demandeur soit sorti de la chambre d\u2019air comprim\u00e9 en moins de cinq minutes, le soir de l\u2019accident;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la sortie des travailleurs de la chambre \u00e0 d\u00e9compression semble bien s\u2019\u00eatre faite le soir de l\u2019accident, dans les m\u00eames conditions pr\u00e9alablement \u00e9tablies par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse.\nIt is not necessary, as will appear, to pass upon the question whether or not, in view of these findings, the decision on this point of the Court of King\u2019s Bench ought to be disturbed.\nAs to the second charge, the learned trial judge has found as follows:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que bien que la d\u00e9fenderesse ait commis une faute en ne donnant pas au demandeur des instructions compl\u00e8tes sur les moyens de diminuer autant que possible, les risques inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 son genre de travail, cette faute n\u2019est cependant pas inexcusable au sens de la loi et de la jurisprudence.\nThe pertinent consid\u00e9rants in the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench are these:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il appert par la preuve que l\u2019appelant r\u00e9cemment venu de la campagne pour avoir de l\u2019ouvrage, n\u2019avait aucune connaissance du travail qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9; que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est compl\u00e8tement charg\u00e9e de l\u2019appelant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entre ses mains un automate se laissant enti\u00e8rement conduire par elle; que pour se rendre \u00e0 la chambre de travail du caisson o\u00f9 il y avait une pression atmosph\u00e9rique de 19 \u00e0 20 livres, l\u2019appelant passait par une pi\u00e8ce appel\u00e9e chambre d\u2019\u00e9quilibre o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e faisait la compression pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la pression de la chambre de travail et que pour en revenir, il passait dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce o\u00f9 se faisait la d\u00e9compression, avant de rendre l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019air libre;

qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 la nuit dans des souffrances atroces et que ce n\u2019est que le matin vers 7 heures qu\u2019un camarade ayant notifi\u00e9 la compagnie de l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019appelant, le m\u00e9decin est venu \u2018chercher l\u2019appelant pour le mettre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital o\u00f9 il a subi le traitement de la r\u00e9compression mais, sans succ\u00e8s, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tardif;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le travail assign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant se faisait dans des conditions anormales dans un caisson, \u00e0 une profondeur de 40 pieds sous l\u2019eau et sous une pression atmosph\u00e9rique de 19 \u00e0 20 livres; que ce travail, par sa nature, pr\u00e9sentait un danger consid\u00e9rable et continu aussi bien durant le trajet pour parvenir \u00e0 la chambre de travail que pour en revenir par suite de la transition de l\u2019air libre \u00e0 l\u2019air comprim\u00e9 par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la compression et surtout de l\u2019air comprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019air libre par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la d\u00e9compression.\nConsid\u00e9rant que le seul traitement connu pour les maladies engendr\u00e9es par l\u2019air comprim\u00e9 et les l\u00e9sions qui peuvent en r\u00e9sulter est la recompression suivie d\u2019une lente d\u00e9compression, qu\u2019une condition essentielle du succ\u00e8s est le recours imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 ce traitement et qu\u2019\u00e0 cette fin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait sur son chantier un h\u00f4pital sous la surveillance continuelle d\u2019un m\u00e9decin;

By the practice of the appellants, each workman undergoes a medical examination before he is accepted as an employee. Nevertheless, there is evidence, which I regard as satisfactory, that no such examination can be considered an entirely reliable test of the fitness of the subject. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that, at all events, in some quarters, a practice prevails by which a workman is not accepted as qualified, until his suitability has been proved by experience. Sometimes, the workman is subjected to a compression test in a hospital lock; and this it appears was at one time the practice of the appellants, a practice which was abandoned, because, according to the doctor\u2019s evidence, it frightened the men. In other works it is the rule not to permit an inexperienced hand to serve more than half a full shift without a second medical examination. No such precautions were observed by the appellants.\nIt was not disputed that no workman should be subjected to the risks attending caisson workers, in ignorance of the nature of those risks, or of the necessity of seeking medical aid immediately on the appearance of unpromising symptoms. Nor can it be successfully disputed that no instruction in these matters was given to the respondent or that he was ignorant in respect of them; nor again, that, had he been properly instructed, the character of his symptoms must have apprised him of the necessity of seeking medical aid immediately; nor, once more, if he had applied to the appellants\u2019 doctor and the usual procedure had been followed, that his chances of escaping the injuries from which he now suffers, would have been greatly increased; the evidence establishes in my view the probability that he would have escaped.\nDr. Riopelle attempted to account for the absence of instructions and to justify his failure to give any, on the ground that they were unnecessary; because, he said, all the workmen were fully informed as to these matters; knowledge of them was, so to speak, in the air.\nThis unfortunately is an excuse which cannot be accepted. As I have said, the evidence leaves no doubt that there are cases where the weakness or idiosyncrasy of the workman unfitting him for exposure to the ordinary risks of such work, is not revealed upon the preliminary examination. No further test is provided for by the practice of the appellants. The necessity ought therefore to have been apparent of making sure that proper preventive measures would be applied in cases which should prove to be exceptional; and, since the practice of the appellants was to leave it to each workman to take care of himself, it was imperative that he should know what to do and when to do it. There was therefore a rigorous duty to impart instruction. To trust to the chance of this knowledge being gained from some fellow workman was simply to leave the duty unperformed. The evidence, indeed, does not leave us in doubt upon this point; the only fellow workman, who became aware of the respondent\u2019s condition, made light of it.\nUnnecessarily and knowingly to expose the respondent, as the appellants did, to the risks adverted to above, without putting him in possession of the knowledge that would have enabled him to take effectual prophylactic measures, was a fault, and a fault without excuse. It is difficult, short of conduct involving deliberate intention to injure, to think of a plainer case.\nThe answer of the appellants, the answer in point of substance, to the case thus made against them, is twofold.\nFirst, it is said that the respondent and his wife were informed by a fellow workman, at half-past two in the morning of the necessity of having the respondent sent to the appellants\u2019 hospital; but that there was unnecessary delay in calling a taxi, and that, in consequence, he did not reach the hospital until after seven. The evidence makes it clear beyond dispute that the workman in question, Cadorette, did not at all appreciate the gravity of the risk the respondent was running in not having him taken immediately to the hospital. Cadorette says most explicitly that he made light of the respondent\u2019s sufferings, as I have mentioned above. Indeed, the attitude of Cadorette is significant as indicating that the appellants\u2019 workmen did not realize the necessity of resorting promptly to preventive measures on the appearance of suspicious symptoms.\nSecondly, it is said that the phrase \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d connotes, not indeed an intention to commit a wrong, but an element of intention, of voluntary conduct, as well as an appreciation of the danger which such conduct may entrain. Without expressing any opinion upon the point whether, applying such a standard, the appellants have succeeded in this court in acquitting themselves of \u201cinexcusable fault,\u201d it seems necessary to observe that in the statutory phrase the word \u201cinexcusable\u201d is not a juridical term of art or a word to which any special technical significance can attach. It must therefore be applied in its ordinary sense as determined by the common usage, in light, of course, of the context in which it occurs, and of the subject matter of the statute. It is no part of the function of the courts to restrict or fix its meaning by paraphrases derived from text writers or other sources. In Montreal Tramways Co. v. Savignac[1], Lord Cave, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\nIt is unnecessary and probably undesirable to attempt a definition of the expression \u201cinexcusable fault.\u201d Each case must be judged from its own facts.\nIt is perhaps desirable to take notice of an argument addressed to us touching the responsibility of the appellants under section 6 in respect of an \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d of an employee. The decision of the Privy Council above referred to (see especially the observations of Lord Cave at pages 413 to 415), precludes controversy upon this point. The general rule of responsibility laid down by article 1054 C.C. governs the application of section 6:\nMasters and employers are responsible for the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work in which they are employed.\nThe \u201cinexcusable fault\u201d of a servant or workman \u201cin the performance of the work in which he is employed,\u201d within the meaning of article 1054 C.C., is imputable to the employer.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Godin, Dussault & Cadotte.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pouliot & Nadeau.\n[1] [1920] A.C. 408, at 413.\n",

McDermott, [1931] S.C.R. 94\nDate: 1930-10-27\nPEARL WALKER (PETITIONER) APPELLANT;\nAND\nIDA McDERMOTT (DEFENDANT) RESPONDENT.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTestator's Family Maintenance Act\u2014Will\u2014Whole estate bequeathed to widow\u2014Petition by married daughter\u2014Interpretation of Act\u2014R.S.B.C. 1294, c. 256, s. 3.\nUnder the Testator's Family Maintenance Act (R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 256), the provision, which the court is authorized to make in the circumstances stated in section 3, is \" such provision as the court thinks adequate, just and equitable.\" The conditions upon which this authority rests are that the person whose estate is in question has died leaving a will, and has not made; by that will, in the opinion of the judge, adequate provision for the \"proper maintenance and support\" of the wife, husband or children, as the case may be, on whose behalf the application is made. What constitutes \"proper maintenance and support\" is a question to be determined with reference to a variety of circumstances. It cannot be limited to the bare necessities of exist\u00adence. For the purpose of arriving at a conclusion, the court, on whom devolves the responsibility of giving effect to the statute, would naturally proceed from the point of view of the judicious father of a family seeking to discharge both his marital and his parental duty; and would of course (looking at the matter from that point of view) consider the situation of the child, wife or husband, and the standard of living to which, having regard to this and the other circumstances, ref\u00aderence ought to be had. If the court comes to the decision that ade\u00adquate provision has not been made, then the court must consider what provision would be not only adequate, but just and equitable also; and in exercising its judgment upon this, the pecuniary mag\u00adnitude of the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator, must be taken into account. Applying these principles to the circumstances of this case, where the only daughter of the deceased brought an application under the Act for an order directed against his second wife, sole beneficiary under the will, held that the trial judge was right in deciding that the widow should be called upon to forego part of her annual income in order to make some provision for the applicant. Rinfret J. dissenting.\nPer Rinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014Although the Testator's Family Maintenance Act leaves to \"the judge before whom the application is made\" a wide discretion to pronounce both upon the adequacy of the provision for \"proper maintenance and support\" already existing at the time of the application and upon the \"adequate, just and equitable order\" which ought to be made under the circumstances, such discretion, although perhaps elastic, must be exercised judicially and according to legal rules. The \"opinion of the judge before whom the application\n*PRESENT :\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. is made\" is not in every respect to be held final and conclusive. There are cases when a court of appeal may and should intervene. Failure on the part of the judge of first instance to take the proper view of the scope and application of the Act would be one of those cases.\u2014Upon the circumstances of this case, the appellant has failed to make out a case for the application of the Act, the purview or intent of which is that the husband, the wife or the children should not be left without \"proper maintenance and support \", while 'the testator disposes of an estate sufficient 'to provide for it.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (42 B.C. Rep. 184) rev.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial court, Morrison C.J.S.C. and dismissing the appellant's petition for an order for proper maintenance under the Tes\u00adtator's Family Maintenance Act.\nThe facts of the ease and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nA. H. Macdonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The pertinent enactments of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act of British Columbia, c. 256, R.S.B.C., 1924, are these:\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or statute to the con\u00adtrary, if any person (hereinafter called the \" testator \") dies leaving a will and without making therein, in the opinion of the judge before whom the application is made, adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of the testator's wife, husband 'or children, the court may, in its discretion on the application by or on behalf of the wife, or of the hus\u00adband, or of a child or children, order that such provision as the court thinks adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate of the testator for the wife, husband or children.\n4. The court may attach such conditions to the order as it thinks fit, or may refuse 'to make an order in favour of any person whose character or conduct is such as in the opinion of the court to disentitle him or her to the benefit of an order under this Act.\n5. In making an order the court may, if it thinks fit, order that the provision shall consist of a lump sum or a periodical or other payment.\nThe provision which the court is authorized to make in the circumstances stated in the section, is, \" such provision as the court. thinks adequate, just and equitable.\" The conditions upon which this authority rests are that the person whose estate is in question has died leaving a will, and has not made, by that will, in the opinion of the judge, adequate provision for the \"proper maintenance and support \" of the wife, husband or children, as the case may be, on whose behalf the application is made.\nWhat constitutes \" proper maintenance and support \" is a question to be determined with reference to a variety of circumstances. It cannot be limited to the bare' necessities of existence. For the purpose of arriving at a conclusion, the court on whom devolves the responsibility of giving effect to the statute, would naturally proceed from the point of view of the judicious father of a family seeking to discharge both his marital and his parental duty; and would of course (looking at the matter from that point of view), consider the situation of the child, wife or husband, and the standard of living to which, having regard to this and the other circumstances, reference ought to be had. If the court comes to the decision that adequate provision has not been made, then the court must consider what provision would be not only adequate, but just and equitable also; and in exercising its judgment upon this, the pecuni\u00adary magnitude of the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator, must be taken into account.\nThe net value ,of the testator's estate was $25,000. The testator's widow became, on the death of the testator, entitled to $3,000, as insurance, and she was the owner of real estate valued .at $2,000. The testator had one daughter by a former wife, the ;appellant. Before the testator's death, she had married, and since the order made by Mr. Justice Morrison to which I am coming immediately, she has had two children., twins. Her husband is employed in a clerical capacity in Kimberley ,and receives a salary of $150 a month, and of this $25 na month is required for rent. He has some shares of Big Missouri stock for which he is said to have paid $380; but, apart from this and the furniture in their residence, he has no assets.\nBy his will, the whole of the testator's estate was left to his widow. No provision was made for his daughter, who, for some years prior to her marriage, had been earning her own living as a stenographer. Mr. Justice Morrison thought that, in these circumstances, ,an ,allowance of $6,000 should be made, but that from this should be deducted a sum of $1,000 that had been voluntarily paid to the applicant by the widow. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, and held that the applicant was entitled to nothing in addition to the $1,000 she had already received.\nThe view of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal seems to have been that no further allowance would be \" just and equitable\" within the meaning of the statute. This view was very largely based upon considerations touching the claims of the wife on account of her services in the husband's business, in which the greater part of the assets left by him .had been acquired.\nThe widow was married to 'the testator in 1914; she then possessed the sum of $1,500, profits derived from the keep\u00ading of a \" rooming-house \" somewhere in the State of Idaho. The testator was then a bartender; later he bought the Crown Point Hotel in Trail, British Columbia, the first instalment money ($1,000) being paid by his wife. With the exception of this instalment, the whole of the purchase money was paid out of the profits of the business. The evidence makes it pretty clear that the business was far from prosperous until 1923 or 1924, when the testator ob\u00adtained a beer licence under the amendment of the Liquor Act of 1923. It was during the three and one-half years, in which he enjoyed the benefit of this licence, that the means were acquired from which outlays in repairs and improvements to the hotel were provided for, mortgages were paid off, and the unpaid instalments of the purchase price liquidated.\nShortly before his death, he gave an option on the hotel for $30,000, which was exercised after his death. This sum constitutes the only considerable asset of the estate. It is not disputed that the value of the hotel had its principal source in the enhancement of prices of real estate in Trail, consequent upon the expansion of the business of the Con\u00adsolidated Smelters.\nThere is a good deal of evidence that the testator, especi\u00adally in the years before he obtained the beer licence, drank very heavily; and that a considerable share of the burden of carrying on the hotel, both in responsibility and in labour, fell upon the widow. On the other hand, there is little doubt that during the prosperous time following the obtaining of the licence, when the business had become profitable from the selling of beer, the testator managed this part of the business, and the evidence quite fails to establish that the profits accruing therefrom were not due, chiefly at all events, to his exertions.\nThe testator, no doubt, felt himself under great obliga\u00adtions to his wife, and justly so. But I can see nothing in all this to lead to the conclusion that the testator, if prop\u00aderly alive to his responsibilities, as father no less than as husband, ought to have felt himself under an obligation to hand over all his estate to his wife and leave his only child without provision. Twenty-five thousand dollars, the net value of the testator's estate, would purchase a life annuity of $1,875 for the widow, while the $5,000 she possessed in her own right would purchase her an additional annuity of $375. I do not think the learned trial judge was wrong in thinking that the widow should be called upon to forego $450 of this annual sum, in order to make some provision for the applicant, nor do I think that a father in the posi\u00adtion of the testator, and justly appreciating the situation of his daughter, a young married woman, and the possi\u00adbilities attaching to her situation, would, in the circum\u00adstances which I have outlined above, have considered that ,adequate provision existed for her \"proper maintenance and support\"; nor, weighing the competing claims of his wife and daughter, that he would have thought such provision as that made under the order of Morrison J. either unjust or inequitable.\nMrs. McDermott's affidavit contains this paragraph :\nThat out of the sale price of the said property I received $10,000 cash the balance being payable in annual instalments over a period of seven years.\nNo point was made on the argument of the facts stated in this paragraph, and, consequently, I have assumed, that the deferred payments under the sale have either been paid or secured in a manner equivalent to payment.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in the Court of Appeal and in this court, and the judgment of Morrison J. restored. RINFRET J. (dissenting).\u2014Under the Testators' Family Maintenance Act of British Columbia (c. 256 of R.S.B.C.),\nif any person dies leaving a will and without making therein, in the opin\u00adion of the judge before whom the application is made, 'adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of (his) wife, husband or children, the court may * * * order that such provision as the court thinks adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate, etc.\nThe appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia reversing an order of the Supreme Court of that province granting an application under that statute made by the present appellant.\nThe statute leaves to \" the judge before whom the appli\u00adcation is made \" a wide discretion to pronounce both upon the adequacy of the provision for \"proper maintenance and support \" already existing at the time of the applica\u00adtion and upon the \" adequate, just and equitable order \" which ought to be made under the circumstances. It need not be said, however, that such discretion, although perhaps elastic, must be exercised judicially and according to legal rules. The \" opinion of the judge before whom the application is made \" is not in every respect to be held final and conclusive. There are cases when a court of appeal may and should intervene. Failure on the part of the judge of first instance to take the proper view of the scope and application of the Act would be one of those oases.\nWith the greatest deference, I think the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was right in applying these considera\u00adtions to the order under review. Here, the testator made no provision for his child, the petitioner. But I cannot construe the Act to mean that in every case where no provision is made, the section above quoted is mandatory and the courts must make an order. In my judgment, the in\u00adtention of the legislature was that the husband, the wife or the children should not be left without \" proper main\u00adtenance and support,\" while the testator disposed of an estate sufficient to provide for it; and to that extent only, in order to carry .out such intention, is the court permitted to interfere with the liberty of any person to bequeath his property as he pleases.\nThe first inquiry therefore must be whether, at the death of the testator, the petitioner lacked those means of main\u00adtenance and support which would be proper, having regard to her ordinary circumstances in life. For that purpose, the court should consider how she has been maintained in the past and what were, when the testator died, the means of support available to her. So far as the evidence shews, the appellant petitioner was raised in very humble circum\u00adstances. When, in 1914, her father purchased an undivided one-half interest in the Crown Point Hotel, at Trail, he did not own any real or personal property what\u00adsoever, and the first cash instalment paid by him on the purchase price had to come out of money supplied by the respondent. For some years following, business was very dull and there was little to do. It was not until 1923, when the Liquor Control Act was amended to permit the sale of beer by the glass, that the appellant's father having ob\u00adtained a bar licence, the hotel began to reap substantial profits. The appellant was then working as a stenographer in the Bank of Montreal at a salary of $60 a month. She continued as such, until her marriage, save for two months in another situation and a small yearly increase. She had her room free at the hotel, but paying for her meals, took care of her room and provided her own linen and laundry service.\nIn 1927, the petitioner was married to a clerk employed at the office of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Com\u00adpany of Canada, Limited. At the time of the petition, she and her husband were residing at Kimberley. He was in charge of the office part of the general stare of the com\u00adpany, receiving a salary of $150 per month. Upon his marriage, the husband was given by his father a piece of ground in the city of Trail upon which he erected a house. He has since sold it and his equity was $774.81. When the purchaser has completed all payments, there will be a fur\u00adther sum of $500 due them. In Kimberley, they pay a rent of $25 a month for the house in which they live. They own their household furniture, the value of which. is placed by them at $500 (exclusive of wedding presents) and by the respondent at $1,000. The petitioner never has been dependent on her father since she got her employment in the Bank of Montreal, in 1923, and certainly not since her marriage. She has never been since then land is not now in need of maintenance and support out of the estate and is adequately maintained and supported by her husband, who is a, young man with a good income, a permanent em\u00adployment, 'a reasonable opportunity of advancement and fully capable of supporting her in the future. In fact, from all appearances derived from the record, she lives now more comfortably than during the years prior to her mar\u00adriage. She does not state that she is in need of mainten\u00adance, nor that her husband and herself are unable to meet their necessary household and incidental expenses of liv\u00ading. All she says is that they \" are unable to save any money whatsoever.\" Even that is not borne out by the facts, since they own and maintain a Chevrolet motor car; and when the respondent made them a present of $1,000, they invested part of it in the purchase of Big Missouri stock and the appellant took a trip to Seattle, which cost her $100.\nThe appellant complains that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does \" not take into account not only the chances of dismissal of the ordinary kind, but also the necessarily precarious business in which (the husband) is employed.\" These and other contingencies are possibilities in every case whatever. A young husband may die prematurely. A widow or a child now rich may lose everything through adverse circumstances. There would be no limit to con\u00adsiderations of that character, and it would mean that, unless provision such as is suggested by the appellant is made in every will, the latter should be recast and some order must be made in all case's. I would not think that, when considering the applicability of the statute, these possi\u00adbilities should be taken into account. But suffice it to say that, in the present instance, the probabilities lead in a direction contrary `to the contention and the claim of the appellant. It is much more likely than otherwise and much more in accordance with ordinary and reasonable expecta\u00adtion that the appellant's present condition will go on im\u00adproving as years go by and, at all events, that both herself and her husband will be fully capable of maintaining themselves in the future. In my view, the appellant has failed to make out a case\nfor the application of The Testators' Family Maintenance Act. She does not come within .the purview ,or intent of the Act, and I would dismiss her ,appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for 'the appellant: R. J.
