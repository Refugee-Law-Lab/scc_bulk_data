Bros., dealers in scrap iron at Toronto, for some time prior to and after 1897 had sold iron to a Rolling Mills Co. at Sunnyside in Toronto West. The G.T.R. had no station at Sunnyside the nearest being at Swansea, a mile further west, but the Rolling Mills Co. had a siding capable of holding three or four cars. In 1897 F. Bros. instructed the G.T.R. Co. to deliver all cars addressed to their order at Swansea or Sunnyside to the Rolling Mills Co., and in Oct., 1899, they had a contract to sell certain quantities of different kinds of iron to the company and shipped to them at various times up to Jan. 2nd, 1900, five cars, one addressed to the Company and the others to themselves at Sunnyside. On Jan. 10th the company notified F. Bros. that previous shipments had contained iron not suitable for their business and not of the kind contracted for and refused to accept more until a new arrangement was made, and about the middle of January they refused to accept part of the five cars and the remainder before the end of January. On Feb. 4th the cars were placed on a siding to be out of the way and were there frozen in. On Feb. 9th F. Bros. were notified that the cars were there subject to their orders and two days later F., one of the firm, went to Swansea and met the company\u2019s manager. They could not get at the cars where they were and F. arranged with the station agent to have them placed on the company\u2019s siding and he would have what the company would accept taken to the mills in teams. The cars could not be moved until the end of April when the price of the iron had fallen and F. Bros. would not accept them, but after considerable correspondence and negotiation they took them away in the following October and brought an action against the G.T.R. Co. founded on the failure to deliver the cars. It appeared that in previous shipments the cars were usually forwarded to the rolling mills on receipt of an order therefor from the company but sometimes they were sent without instructions, and on Feb. 3rd the station agent had written to F. Bros. that the cars were at Swansea and would be sent down to the rolling mills.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the Rolling Mills Co. were consignees of all the cars and that they had the right to reject them at Swansea if not according to contract. Having exercised such right the railway company were not liable as carriers, the transitus having come to an end at Swansea by refusal of the company to receive them.\nThe Court of Appeal, while relieving the railway company from liability as carriers, held them liable as warehousemen and ordered a reference to ascertain the damages on that head.\nHeld, reversing such decision, Mills J. dissenting, that the action was not brought against the railway company as warehousemen, and as they could only be liable as such for gross negligence and the question of negligence had never been raised nor tried the action must be dismissed in toto, with reservation of the right of F. Bros. to bring a further action should they see fit.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside the judgment at the trial which awarded the plaintiffs damages and costs against the defendant company as common carriers and ordering a reference to ascertain the damages against them as warehousemen.\nThe facts of the case as stated by Armour C.J.O. in the Court of Appeal, will be found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick published herewith. They are sufficiently set out also in the above head-note.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellant. The consignees could accept the iron at Swansea; London & North Western Railway Co. v. Bartlett[1]; and therefore they could reject it there.\nOn the refusal to accept, the transitus was at an end; Hudson v. Baxendale[2]; and the defendants then became involuntary bailees and not liable except for negligence; Heugh v. London & North Western Railway Co.[3]; or rather for gross negligence; Giblin v. McMullen[4].\nShepley K.C. and Baird for the respondents. The defendant company were agents of the plaintiffs to carry the iron to Sunnyside and could not be relieved of their obligation as carriers without the plaintiffs\u2019 consent. See Hutchison on Carriers, 2 ed., sec. 395.\nAs to the delay being caused by the act of God see Hutchison on Carriers, 2 ed., sec. 174.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiffs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) claim is based upon the alleged failure of the defendants (appellants), to carry five car loads of scrap iron to, and deliver it at Sunnyside, where the mills of the McDonell Rolling Mills Company are situate.\nThe trial judge, Lount J., held that there had been a breach of the contract alleged and awarded damages, and he dismissed a counterclaim of the defendants for demurrage or car rental claimed by the defendants because of the delay of the plaintiffs in unloading the scrap iron.\nThe defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, contending that they had performed their contract and that, even if they had not, the damages were assessed upon a wrong basis and that the counterclaim ought to have been allowed.\nIn the Court of Appeal Maclennan J.A. was of opinion that the appellants had performed their contract and that the action ought to be dismissed. Armour C.J.O. was of the same opinion as regards the case made on the pleadings, but he thought the evidence justified a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs, (respondents), upon an entirely different claim which he thought ought to be substituted for that set out in the statement of claim. Moss J.A. agreed with Armour C.J.O. and Maclennan J.A. as to the original cause of action, but he also thought that the plaintiffs should succeed on a claim which they had never set up and which he does not state in exactly the same way as Armour C.J.O.\nThe plaintiffs have never amended, nor asked leave to amend, their pleadings so as to make either the claim suggested by Armour C.J.O. or that suggested by Moss J.A. Osler J.A. agreed with the trial judge that there was a breach of the contract of carriage but he did not agree with his method of assessing damages; on the contrary he joined with Armour C J.O. and Moss J.A. in ordering a reference to ascertain the damages. Lister J.A. who was present when the case was argued in the Court of Appeal, died before judgment was pronounced.\nThe defendants\u2019 appeal from the judgment dismissing the counterclaim was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, no reason being given, and they now appeal to this court.\nThe facts are stated by Armour C.J.O. as follows:\nThe defendants had a station on their line west of Toronto called Swansea, and between Swansea and Toronto, and about a mile east of Swansea, was Sunnyside, where the rolling mills of the McDonell Rolling Mills Company were, but where the defendants had no station, but there was a switch about three hundred feet long running from the main track to the defendants\u2019 railway into the rollings mills, and freight for the rolling mills was handled by the station agent of the defendants at Swansea and could be sent to the rolling mills by this switch.\nThe plaintiffs carried on business in Toronto and were dealers in scrap iron and had been for a considerable time sellers of scrap iron to the Rolling Mills Company, which they had purchased in different places.\nIn April 10th, 1897, the plaintiffs wrote to the station agent of the defendants at Swansea: \u201cWe authorise you to deliver all cars which may arrive at Swansea addressed to us to McDonell Rolling Mills Co. and oblige.\u201d And on December 1st, 1897: \u201cKindly deliver all cars addressed to our order Swansea or Sunnyside to McDonell Rolling Mills Co., and oblige.\u201d And again, on May 11th, 1899, \u201cWe have your advice regarding car No. 35,810 ex Belleville. Kindly forward same as usual to McDonell Rolling Mills Co. You are holding a general order to forward such cars to McDonell Rolling Mills Co., and this order is good until cancelled by us.\u201d\nIn October, 1899, a contract was made for the sale of scrap iron by the plaintiffs to the Rolling Mill Company, evidenced by the following document: \u201cOctober 28th, 1899. McDonell Rolling Mills Co., Sunnyside, Ont.,\u2014Dear Sirs,\u2014We herewith beg to inform you that our tender on scrap iron was accepted and we herewith confirm having sold to you about 400 tons of scrap, consisting of the following: About 100 to 150 tons of ship iron; about 50 to 100 tons of boiler plate which may be soft steel, and about 200 tons of No. 1 collection and piling scrap. Price $23.50 per net ton F.O.B. your works. Terms as usual. Kindly confirm this. Yours truly, Frankel Bros.\u201d\nIn fulfilment of this contract the plaintiffs caused to be shipped the five cars in question in this suit, which were numbered, sent to, and arrived at Swansea as follows:\nFREIGHT NOT PAID\nCar No. Sent.\nArrived.\n19496...................................... Nov. 30, 1899.\nDec. 11, 1899.\n28610...................................... Dec. 23, 1899.\nJan. 1, 1900.\nFREIGHT PAID.\n29090...................................... Dec. 27, 1899.\nJan. 15, 1900.\n62780...................................... Jan. 4, 1900.\nJan. 15, 1900.\n60071...................................... Jan. 2, 1900.\nJan. 17, 1900.\nCar No. 62,780 was shipped from Toronto, and by the shipping receipt was addressed \u201cMcDonell Rolling Mills, Sunnyside;\u201d all the other cars were addressed \u201cFrankel Bros., Sunnyside, Toronto,\u201d except one which was addressed \u201cFrankel Bros., Sunnyside Mills, Toronto.\u201d\nNotice of the arrival of each of these cars was sent to the plaintiffs and to the Rolling Mills Company.\nAfter two of these cars, numbered 19496 and 28610 had arrived and on the 10th January, 1900, the Rolling Mill Company wrote to the plaintiffs as follows: \u201cWe beg to notify you that we will not accept delivery of any more scrap iron in cars until further arrangements are made; our agreement with you was for a special lot of about 400 tons composed of strictly No. 1 wrot and a quantity of soft steel boiler plate at the high price of $23.50 per net ton at our works, but the scrap you have been delivering to us in cars is composed of all kinds of mixtures invoiced to us as No. 1 wrot iron; therefore, we cannot accept delivery of mixed cars until arrangements are made as to price to be paid for different kinds The Grand Trunk agent at Swansea, informed Mr. McDonell this morning that there were nine cars there loaded with scrap iron under demurrage and subject to your orders and his orders are not to deliver any of those cars until demurrage is paid. We find, on examining the cars at Swansea, they are all loaded with mixed material, which is not included in our agreement with you. Hoping to hear from you in the matter, we remain.\u201d\nImmediately after the receipt of this letter, according to McDonell, and about the 20th of January, according to Lee Frankel, the latter and McDonell went to see the officials of the defendants respecting the demurrage therein referred to, and the latter represented that, as the cars had not gone to their destination, the rolling mills, demurrage should not be charged, and the claim for demurrage was abandoned.\nThe station agent swore that McDonell, the manager of the Rolling Mills Company, refused to receive either two or three of the five cars about the middle of January, and that he refused to receive the residue of them before the end of January, and it is plain, from the evidence of McDonell, that before the end of January he had refused to receive the whole of the five cars, and he said that, so far as the agent was concerned, it would have been idle to send them to Sunnyside, and that he would not have taken them if they had been sent without he had made arrangements with the plaintiffs, or without further instructions to the agent, and he never gave such instructions and never countermanded such refusal.\nWhen cars containing scrap iron sent by the plaintiffs to the Rolling Mills Company arrived at Swansea, the station agent generally awaited McDonell\u2019s instructions before sending them down to the rolling mills, but sometimes they were sent without his instructions, but, if they contained material not according to contract or not suitable for the purposes of the rolling mills he would refuse to receive at Swansea, if there, or at the rolling mills, if sent down there without his orders, and would notify the plaintiffs of his refusal, and they would sometimes arrange with him to receive the cars and take from them what material suited them and to send the balance back on the cars. And with respect to such dealing the station agent of the 3rd of February, 1900, wrote to the plaintiffs the following letter: \u201cMr. H.E. Whittenberger, our train master, London, was here last week, and informed me that cars that are only partly unloaded at McDonell\u2019s and sent back here to finish unloading must be charged haulage for same. I presume the usual charge of $2.50. He told me I should have done so in every case.\u201d\nIn answer to a telephone message from the plaintiffs the station agent at Swansea on the 3rd of February, 1900, sent to them a list of the cars sent by them and then at Swansea, eight in all, including the five in question, with the weights, accompanied by the following letter indorsed thereon: \u201cThese cars are all here at Swansea and will be sent down to McDonell\u2019s siding in order marked on weighing.\u201d\nThe station agent explained in his evidence that when he said the cars would be sent down to McDonell\u2019s siding he said so in anticipation that some arrangement would be come to between the plaintiffs and McDonell by which McDonell would agree to receive them.\nOn the 4th of February, 1900, the station agent, the cars of which he sent the plaintiffs a list being in the way of the traffic of the defendants\u2019 railway, had them run up the belt line to be out of the way of such traffic, and while on the belt line, in a cutting, a thaw set in, and clay from the embankment ran down and covered their wheels up to the axles and then frost setting in froze them fast.\nThe station agent swore that when McDonell refused to receive the two or three of the five cars about the middle of January, he telephoned the plaintiffs to that effect, and that when McDonell refused to receive the residue of them before the end of January, he again telephoned the plaintiffs to that effect, but it was denied that the plaintiffs ever received such telephones and McDonell said that he did not notify the plaintiffs of his refusal until the 9th of February, when he wrote the following letter to the plaintiffs: \u201cWe are in receipt of your invoices for three cars of wrought scrap iron, but we find on examining the cars which are now at Swansea they contain uncut burnt steel boiler plate and steel rails, material we do not use; therefore we must refuse delivery of them, and they remain there subject to your order. The numbers are 19496, 60071 flat cars and 28610 box car; the box car contains the steel rails.\u201d\nOn the 12th or 13th of February, one of the plaintiffs and McDonell went to Swansea, and McDonell\u2019s account of what took place did not differ substantially from that of the plaintiff who went with him. He said: \u201cMr. Frankel and I went and looked at the cars, tried to see them, but we could not get very well into where they were on account of the banks sliding, and we came back to the station and Mr. Frankel made arrangements with Mr. Girard (the station agent) to have the cars placed on the siding brought out of the belt line and placed on the Swansea siding. Of course I refused to accept the cars; and Mr. Frankel came to the conclusion that he would team the contents of them down\u2014at least what we would take of the contents\u2014down to our mill; and Mr. Girard and himself and I went over across the tracks and Mr. Frankel pointed out the place where he thought it would be suitable too unload them and Mr. Girard said he would have them placed there.\nThe cars were not, however, got out until the end of April, 1900, when the plaintiffs were notified that they were got out. A good deal of correspondence and negotiation took place between the parties and it was not until the 22nd of October that the plaintiffs took away the scrap iron and on the 3rd of November, 1900, they brought this action.\nThere can be no doubt that as to that one of the five cars of scrap iron in question in this suit addressed to McDonell Rolling Mill, Sunnyside, the McDonell Rolling Mills Company were the consignees of the scrap iron contained in it. And I think that, notwithstanding the fact that the other four cars of scrap iron were addressed to Frankel Bros., Sunnyside, the effect of the instructions given to the station agent of the defendants at Swansea from time to time by the plaintiffs by their letters dated respectively the 10th April, 1897, the 1st December, 1897, and the 11th of May, 1899, coupled with the fact that the McDonell Rolling Mills Company were the purchasers of the scrap iron contained in them, was to constitute the McDonell Rolling Milling Company the consignees of such iron as fully to all intents and purposes as if the bills of lading had been indorsed by the plaintiffs to them.\nThe learned Chief Justice then proceeds to discuss the legal questions involved. He says\nit was contended that as to these cars the McDonell Rolling Mills Company were merely the agents of the plaintiffs, but this they were in no sense, but the purchasers of the scrap iron contained in them with the right of inspection and rejection of it.\nBeing such consignees of the scrap iron, the McDonell Rolling Mills Company had the right to put an end to its transitus by receiving it at Swansea. L. & N.W. Railway Co. v. Bartlett[5]; Foster v. Frampton[6]; Scothorn v. South Staffordshire Railway Co.[7]; Cork Distilleries Co. v. G.S. & W. Railway Co.[8]; Southern Express Co. v. Dickson[9]. It follows, I think, that being such consignees, they had the right to put an end to its transitus at Swansea by refusing to receive it.\nIn an action by the plaintiffs against the McDonell Rolling Mills Company for not accepting the scrap iron, the plaintiffs could not have been prejudiced by the defendants, after the refusal of the McDonell Rolling Mills Company, at Swansea, to receive it, not sending it down to the rolling mills, because such a refusal would have been a waiver by the McDonell Rolling Mills Company of their right to have the scrap iron delivered at the rolling mills; Cort v. Ambergate &c. Railway Co.[10]\nThe refusal by the McDonell Rolling Mills Company to accept the scrap iron was an absolute one, and it is plain from the course of dealing between the plaintiffs and them and from what took place when one of the plaintiffs and McDonell went to Swansea on the 12th or 13th of February, that the plaintiffs acquiesced in the right of the McDonell Rolling Mills Company to refuse the scrap iron at Swansea.\nThis conclusion disposes of the case so far as the cause of action set forth in the statement of claim is concerned.\nWith all this I most entirely agree. The authorities cited shew conclusively that the transitus had come to an end, that the scrap iron was thereafter held by the defendants not as carriers, (and therefore insurers,) but as involuntary bailees or warehousemen, (and therefore only liable for gross negligence). That opinion was, therefore, against the judgment of the trial judge, and the result of it, in ordinary cases, would have been the dismissal of the action. But here the majority of the judges below, in examining the evidence, considered that there was sufficient material upon which still to base a judgment for the plaintiffs, the learned Chief Justice stating that\nthe defendants became involuntary bailees of the scrap iron and were bound to take reasonable care of it, and were under an implied contract to deliver it to the plaintiffs when they came for it, placing the cars containing it in such a position that the plaintiffs could receive, unload and remove it * * * *\nThis, in my view is too broad a statement of the law. There is the obligation of reasonable care, as well as the obligation to deliver, but all this is subject to the qualification that there has been no negligence If without their fault, the defendants were unable to make delivery\u2014if, for example, the goods were accidentally destroyed or were stolen, or were overwhelmed by a landslide or avalanche\u2014there would be no liability. This must be so, even in the case of common carriers. Though generally bound to deliver they are bound to deliver only within a time that is reasonable looking at all the circumstances of the case and they are not responsible for the consequences of delay arising from causes beyond their control. Taylor v. Great Northern Railway Co.[11]\nA common carrier, if the road is obstructed by snow, is not bound to use extraordinary diligence or means involving additional expense for accelerating the conveyance of cattle or goods, though the delay may be prejudicial to the goods or their owner, and though, by extra exertions, they might have been forwarded, and this would apply to other obstructions caused by the act of God. Briddon v. Great Northern Railway Co.[12]\nAll this applies with greater force to the case of a warehouseman, who is only bound to act with reasonable care and caution with respect to the custody of the goods. See Heugh v. London and Northwestern Railway Company[13] and the old case of Garside v. Trent and Mersey Navigation[14].\nIt, therefore, is fundamentally necessary in an action for damages of this nature to prove negligence. If there has been due care on the part of the bailee that is sufficient defence.\nNow this question, negligence or no negligence, was not tried. It was not set up in the pleadings. It was not raised\u2014it was in express and emphatic terms repudiated by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the trial. The learned trial judge did not consider or make a finding regarding it. No reference to it appears in the plaintiffs\u2019 reasons against appeal, nor is there any evidence that at the argument below the point was taken. Notwithstanding this the court below makes a finding upon this crucial point, amends the pleadings, substitutes a new case\u2014a case repudiated by the plaintiffs\u2014and upon that case fixes liability on the defendants without hearing and without evidence adduced for that purpose. One could have understood the allowing of the amendment had a new trial been ordered so that it might be determined by further testimony whether there was care or want of care. I do not know whether there was or was not. I do not even know what is the particular act or fault complained of. It is true the cars were frozen in\u2014that the plaintiffs could not get their goods as soon as they wanted them\u2014but cars are often snowed up without fault anywhere. It is a question of evidence, and all that is wanting here.\nI need not elaborate further because Maclennan J. in his able dissenting judgment in the court below has dealt most satisfactorily with the case as presented before that court.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed and the action dismissed, the appellants having their costs in all the courts. But inasmuch as the appellants\u2019 liability as warehousemen remains now undetermined, the right is reserved and given to the respondents to take such further action as they may be advised upon the alleged liability of the appellants to them as bailees or warehousemen of the goods in question.\nGIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. were also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick. MILLS J. (dissenting.) In this case the respondents brought an action to recover from the appellants, as carriers for hire, damages for not carrying and delivering to them at Sunnyside in Toronto, a place near the defendants\u2019 line of railway, five car loads of scrap iron, which the appellants had received from the respondents, and agreed to carry upon terms set out in five separate contracts, dated on the 30th November, 23rd of December and 27th of December, in the year 1899, and on the 2nd of January and the 4th of January, in the year 1900. Two of these cars were forwarded from Levis, in the Province of Quebec, two from the City of Kingston, in Ontario, and the fifth car from another part of the City of Toronto. In the first four contracts the respondents are the consignees, and the iron is consigned to them as follows:\u2014Frankel Bros., Sunnyside, Toronto. By the fifth contract the consignees are the McDonell Rolling Mills Co., Sunnyside. These cars were all sent by the Grand Trunk Railway Company to Swansea, and when they arrived with the scrap iron at that station the company did not at once shunt the cars upon the side track, or spur, which leads to the rolling mills, and which was put there solely for the purpose of enabling the McDonell Rolling Mills Co. to receive the raw material which they required to enable them to carry on their business, and to send away from their mills the finished product. The railway company sent from Swansea to Sunnyside from time to time, as they were required by the Rolling Mills Company, the cars laden with scrap iron, which Frankel Bros. furnished. This track, which extended from the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway to the rolling mills, was about three hundred feet in length, and it seems that nothing was sent over it to the mills to which the manager of the mills, Mr. McDonell, objected. Mr. McDonell in two communications to Frankel Bros. pointed out to them the character of the scrap iron upon these five cars, which Frankel Bros. intended to deliver at the rolling mills, and he informed them that the quality of the scrap iron was not such as his contract called for, and on the 9th of January, he wrote to Frankel Bros. a letter in which he said:\u2014\nWe are in receipt of your invoices for three cars of No. 1 wrot iron scraps, but we find on examining the cars which are now at Swansea that they contain uncut burnt steel boiler plate and steel rails, material we do not use; therefore, we must refuse delivery of them, and they remain subject to your orders.\nAnd on the following day he wrote:\nWe beg to notify you that we will not accept delivery of any more scrap iron in cars, until further arrangements are made. Our arrangement with you was for a special lot of about 400 tons, composed of strictly No. 1 wrot, and a quantity of soft steel boiler plate at the high price of $23.50 per net ton at our works, but the scrap you have been delivering to us is composed of all kinds of mixtures, invoiced to us as No. 1 wrot iron; therefore, we cannot accept of these cars until arrangements are made as to the price to be paid for the different kinds.\nI am of opinion that the company were not, under these circumstances, required in fulfilment of their contract to send these cars, without further instructions, from Swansea up to the rolling mills.\nA contract had been made by Frankel Bros. with the Rolling Mills Company, for the delivery of four hundred tons of a certain kind of scrap at the price per ton of $23.50 at their works. In October\u2019 1899, Frankel Bros. made a tender for the supply of scrap iron under which they proposed to ship this quantity to the mills of the company, 150 tons of which they said were of ship iron, from 50 to 100 tons of boiler plate, which might be of soft steel, and about 200 tons of No. 1 collection and piling scrap, which was to be delivered at Sunnyside, the terms to be as usual in the fulfilment of the contract. The cars upon which the scrap iron was shipped, arrived at Swansea with moderate promptness, 11th of December, 1899, and on 1st, 15th and 17th of January, 1900, two of the cars arrived at Swansea on the 15th of January, and on the 9th and 10th of January McDonell had notified Frankel Bros. that he would not accept until arrangements were made as to the price to be paid for the different kinds of material which they contained. These communications were written before three of the cars had reached Swansea, and it is clear that he did not regard the material as of the kind he had contracted for, but of an inferior quality which he was not willing should be sent up to the rolling mills until the price had been agreed upon. It seems to me preposterous to contend that the company were bound to make delivery of this scrap iron at the McDonell rolling mill, in the face of his objection, until an understanding between the parties had been reached, and I think that the subsequent action of Mr. Frankel with reference to the delivery of the scrap iron, shows that he did not expect the railway company, in the face of McDonell\u2019s objections, to send the cars from Swansea to Sunnyside, at all events, not until matters were satisfactorily arranged between Frankel and McDonell, and McDonell gave the usual notice to have the cars forwarded.\nThe railway officials were dissatisfied with the delay which had taken place, and gave notice that the railway company would claim demurrage, which, I think was not unreasonable under the circumstances, but, after discussing the matter with Frankel and McDonell, they ceased to press this claim, and both Frankel and McDonell were under the impression that the claim for demurrage was abandoned. Mr. Girard, the station agent, went with Frankel and McDonell on the 10th of February, and saw the cars containing the scrap iron upon the belt line siding. And then it was that Frankel pointed out a suitable place for unloading, and Mr. Girard agreed, says Frankel, that the cars should be placed at that point immediately, so that they might be unloaded and their freight assorted, in order that it might be sent up to the rolling mills upon waggons. The cars were not brought out from the belt siding to the place which Mr. Frankel had selected. Indeed, at that time, the siding where the cars were placed was covered to a considerable depth with mud which had become frozen, and the cars could not have been removed from where they were standing without some delay, and a considerable expenditure of money, a larger sum than the railway company were willing to make.\nWhen McDonell refused to receive the cars at his siding the company were not, I think, under a legal necessity of sending them away from Swansea station. The carriage must there have ended unless Frankel and McDonell came to a speedy understanding, which they did not, and it is contended that the railway company were, thereafter, but involuntary bailees. Of this, I do not at all feel that the contention is clear beyond question. No doubt they might have become so, but cars, where there is a freight house, are not usually regarded as such, and as long as the freight remains in them it is usually regarded as freight in transit, even though the cars in which it is have reached their ultimate destination. In the case of Norway Plains Company v. Boston and Main Railroad Co.[15], Shaw C.J. says, after quoting the decisions of Rowe v. Pickford[16], and In re Webb[17]:\nThis view of the law as applicable to railroad companies, as common carriers of merchandise, affords a plain, precise and practical rule of duty, of easy application, well adapted to the security of all persons interested. It determines that they are responsible as common carriers until the goods are removed from the cars and placed on the platform; that if, on account of their arrival in the night, or at any other time, when by the usage and course of business the doors of the merchandise depot or warehouse are closed, or from any other cause, they cannot then be delivered; or if, for any reason, the consignees are not ready to receive them; it is the duty of the company to store them and to preserve them safely, under the charge of competent and careful servants ready to be delivered, and actually deliver them when duly called for by the parties authorized and entitled to receive them; and for the performance of these duties, after the goods are delivered from the cars, the company are liable as warehousemen, or keepers of goods for hire.\nIt was argued in the present case that the railroad company are responsible as common carriers of goods until they have given notice to the consignees of the arrival of the goods. The Court are strongly inclined to the opinion that, in regard to the transportation of goods by railroad, as the business is generally conducted in this country, this rule does not apply. The immediate and safe storage of the goods on arrival, in warehouses provided by the railway company and without additional expense, seems to be a substitute better adapted to the convenience of both parties. Mr. Justice Story, in his work on bailments, says (sec. 445):\u2014\nThe termination of the carrier\u2019s risk. As soon as the goods have arrived at their proper place of destination, and are deposited there, and no further duty remains to be done by the carrier, his responsibility as such ceases. His character as carrier is superseded by that of warehouseman, not when the car arrives at the station, but when the crane of the warehouse is applied to raise the goods into the ware house. Thomas v. Day[18] and Randleson v. Murray[19]\nHere the scrap iron was allowed to remain in the cars, and the cars were run off the main track into a cutting which was so imperfectly made that the clay from the cut-banks ran down and covered the tracks upon which the cars were standing. There can be no doubt that when the cars arrive at their destination the responsibility of the railway company as carriers does not at once terminate. Cockburn C.J., in Chapman v. The Great Western Railway Co.[20] held that when an interval of time had been allowed to elapse after the arrival of the goods the character of carrier ceased and they had become simply warehousemen. He says that the contract of the carrier being not only to carry but also to deliver, it follows that, to a certain extent, the custody of the goods as carrier must extend beyond as well as precede the period of their transit from the place of consignment to that of destination. First, there is in most instances an interval between the receipt of the goods and their departure\u2014sometimes one of considerable duration. Next there is the time which, in most instances, must necessarily intervene between their arrival at the place of destination and the delivery to the consignee, unless the latter\u2014which, however, is seldom the case\u2014is on the spot to receive them on their arrival. Where this is not the case some delay, often a delay of some hours\u2014as for instance when goods arrive at night, or late on Saturday, or when the train consists of a number of trucks which take some time to unload,\u2014unavoidably occurs. In these cases, while on the one hand the delay, being unavoidable, cannot be imputed to the carrier as unreasonable, or give a cause of action to the consignor or consignee, on the other hand, the obligation of the carrier not having been fulfilled by the delivery of the goods, the goods remain in his hands as carrier, and subject him to all the liabilities which attach to the contract of carriage.\nIf there had been no disagreement between McDonnell Rolling Mills Company and Frankel Bros., the transitus of these cars would have terminated only when they reached the rolling mills, but, as the spur of the mill is spoken of by one of the witnesses as the property of McDonell, and not of the railway company, when it was found that McDonell refused to receive the scrap iron in the cars, I think, looking at the facts and the previous practice of these parties, that the compulsory carriage by the company ended at Swansea, and that the further carriage, which they retained the scrap iron on the cars to perform, was a part of the process of unloading, as Mr. Justice Moss says. The notification before the cars were sent up to the mills came from McDonell, and I think the observations of Lord Ellenborough in Dixon v. Baldwen[21] are fairly applicable to the present case:\nThat the goods had so far gotten to the end of their journey, that they awaited for new orders from the purchaser to put them again in motion.\nAnd in the case of Ex parte Miles; in re Isaacs,[22] in respect to goods that were sent to a specified shipping agent at Southampton to be thence shipped to Kingston, Jamaica, the cost of the carriage to Southampton was paid. The commission agent at Southampton was to send them to parties whose agent he was. The court held that, as between the commission agent and the manufacturers, the transit was at an end when the goods arrived at Southampton.\nI am of opinion that here, under the circumstances, the transit had ended when the goods reached Swansea. I am of opinion that when the railway company claimed they were bailees of the scrap iron and that these cars in which it was were warehouses and denied any responsibility beyond that of bailees for hire, it was their duty to be in a position to deliver those goods to Frankel Bros. whenever called for, and when this scrap iron was left in the cars instead of being put into a warehouse from which it could be delivered when called for, they made themselves responsible to the proprietors in damages for the delay which occurred prior to the time when they could make delivery. It is not correct to say that the cars were confined on this side track by the act of God. They were confined in consequence of a defective cutting. If a vessel was so badly constructed that it could not survive an ordinary storm its loss could not be called a loss due to the act of God. If a cutting is not made so as to render the track free from the flow of mud down its sides, the accident is due not to the act of God but to improper construction, and when the railway company ran these cars upon the belt line into this cutting they did this at their peril, and are justly held in damages for all the loss that Frankel Bros. sustained in consequence. I therefore concur in the conclusion reached by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: James Baird.\n[1] 7 H. & N. 400.\n[2] 2 H. & N. 575.\n[3] L.R. 5 Ex. 51.\n[4] L.R. 2 P.C. 317.\n[5] 7 H. & N. 400.\n[6] 6 B. & C. 107.\n[7] 8 Ex. 341.\n[8] L.R. 7 H.L. 269.\n[9] 94 U.S.R. 549.\n[10] 17 Q.B. 127.\n[11] L.R. 1 C.P. 385.\n[12] 28 L.J.

S. C., c. 135 c. 29.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in a case where the matter in controversy has become an issue relating merely to the removal of executors though by the action, an account for over \u00ab82 000 had been demanded and refused by the judgment at the trial against which the plaintiff had not appealed. Noel v. Chevrefils (30 Can. S. C. R. 327) followed; Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society (24 Can. S. C R. 59) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, King' s Bench, appeal side, reversing the order made by the Superior Court, District of Montreal at the trial (Lavergne J.) which ordered the removal of the defendants as executors of the estate of the late Eleanor Ann Donohue (Mrs. Daoust) deceased, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe case is stated in the judgment now reported.\nMotion to quash the appeal on the ground that the matter in controversy on the present appeal is merely an issue regarding the removal of executors, in respect of which the Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals.\nBelcourt K.C. for the motion cited Noel v. Chevrefils ([1]). Falconer, contra, relied upon Lebarge v. The Equituble Life \u00c1ssurance Society ([2]) and Levi v. Reed ([3]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff, now appellant, alleged in her declaration that the late Mrs. Daoust had by her will named the respondents her executors, who, upon her death, had accordingly entered into \"possession of her estate and had since been administering the same. She concluded, first, that the respondents be ordered to render an account of their administration and, in default of so doing, that they be condemned to pay her the sum of $2,000. Secondly, that the said respondents be, for the future, dismissed from their said office as executors for certain acts detailed at length which she alleges to have been illegal and contrary to their duties.\nThe Superior Court rendered judgment maintaining the appellant's action in part and ordering the removal of the respondents as executors of the said estate but not granting her conclusions for an account, reserving her right to enforce the other conclusions of her declaration by another action.\nUpon appeal to the Court of King's Bench by the executors from that judgment ordering their removal as such, the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed and the appellant's action dismissed altogether. The plaintiff, present appellant, had not appealed from that part of the Superior Court judgment which refused her demand for an account. That amounted to an acquiescence by her in the judgment of the Superior Court which had refused her demand for such an account. The plaintiff now appeals from that judgment so rendered by the Court of Appeal, exclusively upon her conclusions asking the removal of the respondents, I am opinion that we have no jurisdiction. It is con ceded by the appellant that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that they had no jurisdiction, in respect to that part of her conclusions asking for an account which the Superior Court had refused her as she had not appealed therefrom to that court. Now we could not here, were we of opinion that the judgment \u00e2 quo is wrong, give any other judgment than that which the Court of Appeal should have rendered. And that would be simply to restore the judgment of the Superior Court, ordering the respondents' removal as executors. And it is settled in this court that an action simply to remove a tutor or an executor is not appealable. No\u00ebl v. Chevrefils ([4]).\nThe appellants relied upon Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society ([5]) in support of their right to appeal. But that case has no application. The right to appeal here does not, as it did there, depend upon the amount in controversy and this is not a case where the amount demanded and the amount recovered are different provided for by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 3, sub-sec. 4. There is no amount in controversy here at all. The only contestation on this part of the case is on the appellant's demand for an account. And by not appealing to the Court of King's Bench the plaintiff virtually withdrew from the court that part of her demand.\nThe motion is granted and the appeal quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fleet, Falconer &c Cook.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Demers & deLormier.\n[1] 30 Can.

On 31st May Mr. Justice Loranger ordered that the trial of the petition be adjourned to the thirtieth juridical day after the judgment of the Supreme Court was given, and the same was given dismissing the appeal on Oct. 10th, making Nov. 17th the day fixed for the trial under the order of 31st May On Nov 14th a motion was made before Loranger J. on behalf of the member elect to have the petition declared lapsed for non-commencement of the trial within six months from \u00a1the time it was filed This was refused on 17th Nov., but the judge held that the trial could not proceed on that day as the order for adjournment had not fixed a certain time and place, and on motion [by the petitioner he ordered that it be commenced on Dec 4th The trial was begun on that day and resulted in the member elect being unseated and disqualified. On appeal from such judgment the objection to the jurisdiction of the trial judges was renewed.\nHeld, that the effect of the order of May 31st was to fix Nov 17th as the date of commencement of the trial l that the time between May 31st and Oct. 10th when the judgment of the Supreme Court on the preliminary objections was given, should not be counted. as part of the six, months within which the trial was to be begun, and that Dec. 4th on which it was begun was therefore within the said six months.\nHeld also that if the order of 31st May could not be considered as fixing a day for the trial it operated as a stay of proceedings and the order of Mr. Justice Lavergne on Nov. 17th was proper.\nAs to the disqualification of the member elect by the judgment appealed from the members of the court were equally divided and the judgment stood affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Sir Melbourne Tait A.C.J. and. Loranger J. sitting for the trial of a petition against the return of the appellant as a member of the House of Commons for St. James Division Montreal, at a bye-election on 15th January, 1902, by which judgment the appellant was unseated and disqualified for personal corruption.\nThe appeal was directed only against the disqualification, the voiding of the election being accepted subject, however, to an objection taken to the jurisdiction of the judges who tried the petition, namely, that the trial had not been commenced within six months from the date on which the petition was filed, which if successful would set aside the whole judgment.\nThe dates of proceedings on the petition and orders made on which the objection to the jurisdiction was founded are given in the above head-note and in the judgment overruling it.\nThe court ordered the question of jurisdiction to be first argued and the hearing on the merits, if necessary, to take place at a later date.\nBelcourt K.C. and Roy K.C. for the appellant.\nBisaillon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.- The appeal in this case is from a judgment of the Election Court at Montreal rendered on the 22nd of December last by which the election of the appellant, as member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of St. James was annulled and he was disqualified by reason of corrupt practices committed by and with his knowledge and consent.\nThe appellant's contentions are lo. That because the trial had not been proceeded with within six months after the filing of the petition as enacted by sect. 32 of the Controverted Elections Act the Election Court had no jurisdiction in the case on the 4th of December, when the trial began.\n20. That there is error in the judgment in finding him guilty of bribery, assuming that the Court had jurisdiction, and that the said judgment should be reversed so far as the finding on the personal charge is concerned.\n30. That the evidence did not even authorize the Election Court, assuming it had jurisdiction, to find against him on the charge of bribery by agents and that it should not have voided the election.\nThe first point is the only one upon which we have so far heard the parties, with the understanding that should it be determined against the appellant, the case will be heard later upon his other contentions.\nThe following are the material dates upon the question now to be determined as aforesaid.\nThe petition was filed on the 22nd of February 1902\nOn the 27th of February the appellant filed preliminary objections which were dismissed by Mr Justice Loranger on the 24th of April.\nAppeal was taken from that judgment to the Supreme Court on the 2nd of May.\nOn the 22nd of May the respondent moved before Mr. Justice Robidoux that a day be fixed for the tria of the petition at the city of Montreal. The appellant opposed that motion on the ground that the record was before the Supreme Court at Ottawa. On the 28th of May Mr. Justice Robidoux refused to grant the respondent's said motion, and ordered that, considering that an appeal had been taken to the Supreme Court and that the record was then before that court, the trial be suspended until judgment on the said appeal. This order \"would seem not to have been authorized by the statute. As the court or judge who had rendered the judgment dismissing the preliminary objections had not then ordered, as provided for by sec. 50 of the Act, that the proceedings be stayed or the trial be delayed by the appeal from the judgment upon the preliminary objections, the learned judge should perhaps have granted the respondent's motion. It must be noticed, hewever, that it was upon the appellant's objection that the respondent's said motion was refused.\nA few days afterwards. on the 81st of May, the respondent, seeing that Mr. Justice Robidoux had so refused his application for fixing a day for the trial, and aware of the fact that the learned judge's order postponing the trial until after the Supreme Court's judgment, was open to the objection that such an order could have been legally given but by the judge who had rendered the judgment upon the preliminary objections, presented a petition to Mr. Justice Loranger, who had, as aforesaid, rendered the judgment on the preliminary objections, asking him to order that the commencement of the trial be adjourned to the thirtieth of the juridical days to follow the judgment of the Supreme Court on the appellant's appeal.\nThis petition was granted on the same day.\nOn the 10th of October, 1902, the Supreme Court gave judgment dismissing the appeal. The 17th of November, it is admitted by both parties was the thirtieth juridical day after that judgment upon which the trial should have taken place according to the above order of Mr. Justice Loranger of the 31st of May.\nOn the 14th of November the appellant moved before Mr. Justice Lavergne to set aside that judgment of Mr. Justice Loranger. so fixing the trial for the 17th of November and to have the petition declared lapsed because the respondent had not proceeded with the trial within the six months of the filing of the said petition.\nOn the 17th of November Mr. Justice Lavergne dismissed the appellant's motion to have the petition declared lapsed but held that the trial could not take place on that day because Mr. Justice Loranger had adjourned the trial without fixing a day for it and without ordering the place at which such trial should take place.\nOn the same day, upon the respondent's motion, Mr. Justice Lavergne ordered that the trial of the petition be fixed for the 4th of December then next in the Court House at the city of Montreal, and on the said last mentioned day the trial was accordingly begun, the court dismissing the appellant's renewed contention that the petition had lapsed, and on the 22nd of December judgment was given unseating the appellant and declaring him personally guilty of corrupt practices. As I have mentioned before, the only point we have to determine upon the present appeal is whether or not the Election Court had jurisdiction to try the merits of the petition on the 4th of December last.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. The case is a simple one. Reading out of the record Mr. Justice Robidoux's order of the 28th of May, as immaterial and. of no possible bearing on the case, the petition having been filed on the 22nd of February only three months and. nine days had elapsed thereafter when, on the 31st of May Mr. Justice Loranger adjourned the trial till the thirtieth juridical day after the judgment of the Supreme Court. Now, that order clearly fixed that thirtieth juridical day as the day upon which the trial was to take place. The appellant's contention that to adjourn a trial to a certain date was, under the circumstances, not to appoint a day for the trial, cannot be taken seriously. I would say the same of his contention that the order did not operate as a stay of the proceedings or did not delay the trial under sec. 50 of the Act. or that the order was illegal because it did not fix a place for the trial. The appellant had, under sec. 13 of the Act himself the right to apply for an Order to that effect. Now it follows that on the 10th of October, when the Supreme Court rendered its judgment on the appeal from the judgment upon the preliminary objections, only three months and nine days could be counted out of the six months from the date of the filing of the petition, leaving two months and twenty-one days to complete the six months. And the trial began on the 4th of December, less than two months after the judgment of the Supreme Court.\nIf as the appellant would contend, the order of Mr. Justice Loranger cannot be considered as fixing a day for the trial it certainly operated as a stay of the proceedings until the 17th of November, or at least until the 10th of October, and Mr. Justice Lavergne could then as he did on the 17th of November, fix the date and place of trial for the 4th of December. Not counting the delay between Mr. Justice Loranger's order of the 31st of May, and the judgment of the Supreme Court on the 10th of October Mr. Justice Lavergne's order and the date fixed by him. for the trial were clearly within six months from the filing of the petition.\nThe appellant's contentions are therefore clearly unfounded.\nThe only appeal before us, I may remark, is from the final judgment. That is the only one allowed by the statute.\nThe appellant principally relied upon the Glengarry Election Case ([1]). The law of that case can certainly not now be questioned. Their Lordships in the Privy Council, upon an application for leave to appeal ([2]), said, in refusing the application:\nThere can be no other case till fresh elections take place; and if the decisions now given have really misinterpreted the mind of the legislature, and are calculated to establish rules of procedure less convenient than those intended, the legislature can at once set the matter right.\nNow the fact that Parliament has not during the fifteen years since our decision in that case was rendered, legislated on the points there in controversy, is equivalent to a declaration that we had not thereby misinterpreted the mind of the legislature\u00bb But that case has no application whatever where, as here, there is a stay of proceedings ordered upon an appeal to the Supreme Court, which was not the case there None of the parties have it then in their power to have a day fixed for the trial l and the rule contra non valentem agere non currit prescriptio must be given full application. The case may be ten, twelve or more months before the Supreme Court, and it is impossible then to give to sec 32 of the Act the strict construction that the appellant contends for. It was he who now would have the petition dismissed because the respondent did not proceed to trial within six months after the filing of the petition who objected to the respondent's first application to fix a day and actually succeeded in having the trial postponed. And he now asks that the petition against him be dismissed because the respondent did not proceed diligently enough for him. This does not affect directly the merit of this appeal, but I cannot help saying that, under these circumstances I am not sorry to have to dismiss it.\nOn this branch of the case the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nOn a subsequent day the appeal was heard on the merits.\nAylesworth K.C. and Belcourt K.C for the appellant.\nBisaillon, K.C. and Bastien K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Upon the appeal as to the personal charges the court is equally divided so that the appeal is dismissed with costs. The registrar will make the report required to the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Commons. Under the circumstances no opinion is possible as the opinion of the court and individual opinions are inexpedient, especially in a case where there is no possibility of any further appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Roy, Roy & S\u00e9n\u00e9cal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bisaillon & Brossard.\n[1] 14 Can.

The trial was on an interpleader issue settled under an order of McDonald C.J. as follows:\n\"Whereas the plaintiffs affirm and the defendant denies:\n\"1. That on or about the 13th day of October, A.D. 1900, during the lifetime of the late Michael McDonald, deceased, the said Michael A. McDonald gave, transferred and assigned to the plaintiffs a certain deposit receipt number 2793 for the sum of $6,000 deposited in the Union Bank of Halifax, and the amount due upon and secured by said receipt, and thereupon gave to the plaintiffs three orders in writing requiring said bank to pay to the plaintiffs the amount due upon and secured by said receipt.\n\"2. That the said deposit receipt and the amount due upon and secured by said deposit were so given, transferred and assigned to the plaintiffs and said orders were so drawn and given to the plaintiffs by the said Michael A. McDonald in expectation of death, and in his last illness as donatio caus\u00e2 mortis and that the said Michael A. McDonald died on or about the 21st day of October, A.D. 1900, without having repossessed himself of said deposit receipt or of the amount due upon and secured by said deposit (or of the said orders), and that the said deposit receipt and the amount due upon and secured by said deposit receipt became and are the property of the plaintiffs, and it has been ordered by His Lordship the Chief Justice that the said question shall be tried at Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton, or at Halifax, in the County of Halifax, as the judge may direct; therefore let the same be tried accordingly.\"\nMr. Justice Ritchie, who tried the issue at Sydney, held that there was not a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 and that the money belonged to the estate. This judgment was reversed by the full court and the executor appealed. W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. We rely upon the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ritchie at the trial and in which the Chief Justice concurred on the appeal. There is a marked contrast between this case and Walker v. Foster[2]. In Bryson v. Brownrigg[3] the language of the Master of the Rolls is very much in point. We refer also to Reddel v. Dobree[4] at page 251; Ward v. Turner[5] at page 437; Hawkins v. Blewitt[6]; and 14 Am. & Eng. Ency of Law (2 ed.) p. 1056.\nAs to corroboration and the evidence generally we refer to In re Mead; Austin v. Mead[7]; Cosnahan v. Grice[8]; notes to Ward v. Turner (4); McGonnell v. Blurray[9]; Finch v. Finch[10]; Hall v. Hall[11]; Hill v. Wilson[12]; Whittaker v. Whittaker[13].\nThe delivery of the cheques did not constitute a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2; Hewitt v. Kaye[14]; Ward v Turner (4); Byles on Bills (16 ed.) p. 206; Tate v. Hilbert[15]; In re Beaumont; Beaumont v. Ewbank[16]. The evidence negatives any intention to make a gift mortis caus\u00e2. See also Edwards v. Jones[17] at page 234: Bunn v. Markham[18]; Duckworth v. Lee[19]; McGrath v. Reynolds[20].\nRussell K.C. and Harris K.C. for the respondents. It is certain that if the deposit receipt alone had been dealt with in the way it was, and these so-called cheques had not been drawn, there would have been a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2 of the deposit receipt to the three donees. Amis v. Witt[21]; Moore v. Moore[22]; Cassidy v. Belfast Banking Co.[23]; In re Dillon, Duffin v. Duffin[24]; Westerlo v. DeWitt[25]. It cannot make any difference that these orders were drawn up by way of dividing the amount named in the deposit receipt. Reference may usefully be made to Rolls v. Pearce[26], at pages 733 and 734; Lawson v. Lawson[27]; Gardner v. Parker[28]; Byles on Bills, p. 201, note; Story Eq. Jur., p. 396, note; Walker v. Foster[29]; Boutts v. Ellis[30]; Lawson v. Lawson (7); Bromley v. Brunton[31]; Corle v. Monkhouse[32].\nThe so-called cheques are not really cheques but only orders; Bills of Exch. Act, sec. 72; sec. 3, subsection 3; McLaren on Bills, pp. 46, 380. An order to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional within the meaning of this section; Ockerman v. Blacklock[33]. These orders would be equitable assignments of the fund; Bank of British North America v. Gibson[34], at page 614 per Falconbridge J., and at page 617 per McMahon J.; Chalmers on Bills, 12, 13; Munger v. Shannon[35]. They were irrevocable in equity as soon as delivered to holder, and at law as soon as assented to by defendant; Story's Eq. Jur. sec. 1044.\nThe Act, R. S. N. S. (1900) ch. 163, is similar to R. S. O. (1897), ch. 73, and it has been held by the Court of Appeal in Ontario that the \"material evidence\" in corroboration required under the Ontario Act may be direct or may consist of inferences or probabilities arising from other facts and circumstances tending to support the truth of the witness's statement. Green v. McLeod[36]. See also Cole v. Manning[37]; Willcox v. Gotfrey[38]; Grant v. Grant[39]; all decided under similar statutes in England. The evidence of Daniel McDonald is amply corroborated within the rule laid down in these cases.\nThe delivery was sufficient. The fact that Mrs. McDonald, after receiving the deposit receipt, put it back in the trunk from which it was taken, is immaterial. It kept company with her own cheque. The donor was helpless and bedridden, expecting to die, having disposed finally of every earthly concern and exercising no control over his trunk or anything else that belonged to him. At Cape Breton, after the funeral, the deposit receipt was with Mrs. McDonald's cheque and a deed of the house in which she lived which her solicitor had drawn up for her. See Westerlo v. DeWitt[40]. The replacing of the receipt in the trunk of the deceased was the act of Mrs. McDonald, not the act of the deceased. See In re Taylor[41]; 14 Am. & Eng. Enc., 1058, 1059; Ellis v. Secor[42].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies that this appeal should be dismissed, and I fully concur with the reasoning upon which he reached that conclusion.\nIn France and the Province of Quebec, the donationes caus\u00e2 mortis of the Roman law are illegal and no other dispositions of property by gratuitous titles are allowed than by will or irrevocable gifts inter vivos. A gift, under that law, as a general rule, is presumed to have been made in contemplation of death and, therefore, void, when made during the mortal illness of the donor.\nHere, however, under the law that rules this case, the gift to the respondents propter suspicionem mortis, of the deposit receipt in question, was, in my opinion, a valid one, and they, at Dr. McDonald's death, became the sole owners of it. It cannot be doubted that the deceased handed it over to Daniel McDonald with the intention and for the sole purpose of giving it to him and his co-donees. It is not the cheques or orders that he gave. Those were merely given, upon Daniel's suggestion, to ensure the execution of the gift of the deposit receipt and as evidence of the way in which the donor intended the division of the proceeds thereof to take place amongst the three donees. The gift of the receipt and the delivery of it to Daniel, and his acceptance, were complete before these cheques or orders were made out. Had the doctor died immediately after handing it to Daniel, before signing the cheques or orders, the gift would have been just as valid. Now, the cheques cannot have operated as a revocation of that gift, nor have been intended by the deceased as a substitution for it as the appellant would contend. He never intended to give anything else but the receipt.\nIt is upon the alleged want of the required traditio, however, that the appellant seemed to rely principally at bar. But, upon that point also, his contentions are unfounded It being conceded, as I think it must be, that the deceased intended to give this deposit receipt to the respondents, caus\u00e2 mortis, everything that he did on the occasion must be presumed to have been done by him in furtherance of his intention to give the receipt, and everything that the donees did must, likewise, be presumed to have been done by them in furtherance of their intention to accept that gift. When the deceased handed the receipt to Daniel, he did all he could then to divest himself of the control and dominion over it and to vest the donees with that control and dominion. And, by receiving it from the hands of the deceased and taking possession of it, Daniel did all that he could do then and there to accept the gift for himself and his co-donees and take it under his control.\nNow, it cannot be assumed that, by subsequently handing this receipt to Eunice McDonald, he intended to repudiate the gift. Common sense would not countenance such a proposition. And, when Eunice McDonald put it back in the trunk, she, likewise, never intended thereby to refuse the gift and return it to the deceased. She put it there because she knew that, under the circumstances, it was as much under her control as if it had been put in her pocket or in her own trunk. It would have been in her power next day to take it out of that trunk and to put it anywhere else without, in the least, exposing herself to any accusation of dishonesty. There is no evidence that the deceased ever knew that Daniel had handed it over to her and that she had put it back into the same trunk. And I cannot see any room for doubting that, if he had seen Daniel put it into his pocket, or had seen Eunice put it into her own trunk, he would not have objected to it.\nHad he intended to retain the possession of it and desired that it should be returned to his trunk, as still his own, it is to his wife who was in charge of that trunk and had taken it out of it at his request, and not to Daniel, that he would have handed it back.\nOn the point of corroboration I have had more doubts. The Nova Scotia statute (ch. 163 R. S. N. S., 1900, sec. 35), (corresponding to the Ontario statute, ch. 73, sec. 10, R. S. O., 1897), enacts that\nprovided that in any action or proceeding in any court by or against the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party to the action shall not obtain a verdict, judgment, award or decision therein on his testimony, or that of his wife, or of both of them, in respect to any dealing, transaction or agreement with the deceased, or in respect to any act, statement, acknowledgement or admission of the deceased, unless such testimony is corroborated by other material evidence.\nHowever, I do not feel justified in holding that the court appealed from was clearly wrong in determining that Daniel McDonald's evidence was sufficiently corroborated. The statute does not necessarily require another witness who swears to the same thing. Circumstantial evidence and fair inferences of fact arising from other facts proved, that render it improbable that the fact sworn to be not true and reasonably tend to give certainty to the contention which it supports and are consistent with the truth of the fact deposed to, are, in law, corroborative evidence.\nI refer on the question to the following cases in England under the statute providing that in actions for breach of promise of marriage the plaintiff cannot recover upon his own testimony unless it is corroborated by some other material evidence. Bessela v. Stern[43]; Weidmann v. Walpole[44]; Hickey v. Campion[45].\nI agree with the court below on this point as on the others.\nSEDGEWICK J., dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court but delivered no written reasons.\nDAVIES J.\u2014There is really very little dispute between the parties as to the law governing a donatio mortis caus\u00e2. The difficulty lies in its application to the facts of this case. The trial judge, though as he says with some doubt, thought the evidence insufficient to prove an actual delivery of the deposit receipt itself and that the intention of the sick man was merely to give the three parties, objects of his bounty, his wife, his brother and his sister, $2,000 each out of the amount he held on special deposit and that this appeared from the orders he had signed.\nThe total amount of the deposit receipt was $6,000 and the orders signed by the sick man amounted to just that amount. But it was contended that, as there was an amount of $17, by way of interest, due upon this $6,000, and as the signed orders made no reference to interest, the case came within In re Mead[46] as a gift of only a portion of the moneys for which a deposit note had been given by the bank and that there was not a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nThe learned judge further held that there was not such corroborative evidence of the plaintiff's statement with regard to the gift as satisfied the statute.\nI am unable to accept either of these conclusions. I agree with the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and generally with the reasons for that judgment given by Mr. Justice Graham.\nThere is no doubt that the evidence to establish a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 should be clear and satisfactory and the statute is explicit that, if the plaintiff relies upon his own testimony or that of his wife or both of them, to obtain a verdict, such testimony must be corroborated by some other material evidence The argument at bar turned almost entirely upon the question whether or not there had been a gift of the special deposit receipt itself, or only of the amount of that receipt minus the interest, represented by the orders signed by the deceased. If there was a gift of the deposit receipt itself, and not of only a portion of it, then I think it is hardly doubted that, under the later and best authorities; re Dillon[47]; In re Beaumont[48]; it was under the circumstances a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nI have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it was the deposit receipt itself and all it represented or stood for that the dying man intended to dispose of and did give, and that the orders or cheques related simply to the division of the moneys he had given and were signed by him at Daniel McDonald's request and as indicating the proportions in which he desired the division to be made. The facts are simple. Dr. McDonald being ill had gone from his residence in Sydney, Cape Breton, to Halifax for medical treatment. He was suffering from heart disease accompanied by dropsy and, on the fifth of October, wrote to his wife telling her he was going to the infirmary and instructing her to close up the house and join him in Halifax and, amongst other things, to \"bring his bank-book and that cheque for $6,000.\" She did so and was with him at the infirmary during his last illness. On the 13th of October, she and her husband's brother, Daniel, being in the room together with the doctor, the alleged gift took place. The only witnesses present were the wife and the brother of the sick man, two of the beneficiaries. It is alleged that there are material differences between the evidence of these witnesses, but, while the evidence of one is somewhat fuller than that of the other, I do not find any contradiction between them. They both concur in the statement that the sick man asked his wife to get him the deposit receipt out of the trunk, that she did so and that, having obtained it, he handed it to his brother Daniel. According to the latter's evidence, the deceased told him when he handed it to him\nto divide it equally between his wife, his sister Jane and the witness as he didn't wish the deposit receipt to have anything to do with his will.\nThe wife says that, after she gave her husband the deposit receipt\nhe handed it to his brother and asked him to make out three orders or cheques, one for his sister, one for Daniel and one for the witness and that he told his brother to get the money as he did not wish it to have anything to do with his will.\nThe orders for $2,000 each, payable on their face, \"out of deposit receipt No. 2793, Sydney\" were then signed and the deposit receipt handed to the wife by Daniel who says she \"took charge of it\" and replaced it in the trunk. According to Daniel's testimony the orders were signed at his suggestion after delivery of the deposit receipt to him so \"as to show how much each was to get\".\nThere is really no material conflict between the witnesses, but such differences in repeating the history of the transaction as might naturally be expected. Reading them both together I think they show the presence of every essential necessary to effect a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2. The gift was made in view of the donor's death and, from the circumstances under which it was made, and what was said about his desire not to put it in his will, it may fairly be implied that it was only to take effect on the donor's then expected death. It was a conditional gift to take effect only upon the death of the donor who, in the meantime, had the power of revocation and might at any time resume the property and annul the gift. The main dispute, as I have said, was as to delivery. I think that was complete. The deposit receipt was brought from its place of safe-keeping by the wife, at her husband's request, placed in his hands and, by him, handed over to his brother with the concurrent request to \"divide it equally\" between the wife, sister and brother as the latter says, or \"to draw three orders or cheques, one for the sister, one for the wife and one for the brother as expressed in the wife's evidence. The receipt was then handed by Daniel to the wife who \"took charge of it\" and placed it in the trunk again. There was no attempt or intention to resume possession and dominion by the donor, Dr. McDonald, and no attempt or intention to revoke the gift. As to the place in which the wife placed the receipt, after she took charge of it, there was no evidence to show that her husband knew what became of it after he had handed it to his brother Daniel. It was the most natural place, under the circumstances, for her to have deposited it for safekeeping. She was living with her husband at the infirmary and I gather in the same room, acting as his nurse. The trunk in which she placed it was open to her and, practically, looking at the then enfeebled condition of her husband, under her control.\nOn this special point the case of In re Taylor[49] is instructive. There the donee had by the directions of her father, the donor, placed the gift, a deposit receipt or note, for safe-keeping in his cash box, of which she had the key for the purpose of obtaining money for household purposes from time to time, and deposited the cash box in a drawer in the bed-room in which they both slept, she being, at the time, his nurse. Sterling J., in delivering judgment, says;\nIt was a valuable piece of property and her father simply directed her to keep it where the other valuables were kept but I do not think that that amounted to a resumption of possession by the father.\nHere, the deposit receipt was not, in my opinion, in the actual or constructive possession of Dr. McDonald after he had parted with it to his brother Daniel, though, doubtless, he could, at any time before his death, have revoked the gift and resumed possession of and dominion over the document. That right is necessarily incident to gifts of this nature. But he died a few days afterwards without having done so and, on his death, the gift became complete. In my opinion the gift was of the special deposit receipt and carried with it the $17 of accrued interest. The omission of Daniel to insert the word \"interest\" in the orders he drew when making the division, does not and cannot in any way affect the question. The interest passed along with the gift of the deposit receipt as much as the principal. Harcourt v. Morgan[50].\nOf course, if the conclusion can be reached that it was only the cheques or orders for $2,000 each that the sick man was disposing of, there could be no question of any interest. But I have reached a different conclusion. I agree with the court below that it was the deposit receipt and all that it represented that he was making a gift of and that Daniel was as much a trustee to divide the interest as he was to divide the principal. If his attempted division was incomplete, that neither defeated the gift nor released him from his duty of making it complete. If the use of the name of the executors of the will is necessary to enable him to obtain the money from the bank, I think he is entitled to have that use.\nAs to the corroborative evidence, I think once a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 of the deposit receipt is found, there is ample \"corroboration by material evidence\" of the testimony of the plaintiffs in the three orders signed by Dr. McDonald just after he made the gift.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. MILLS J.\u2014McDonald, the deceased, was a physician who resided in the town of Sydney, Nova Scotia, and there practised his profession. He became ill of enlargement of the heart and dropsy and went to the infirmary at Halifax for treatment. He had made a will dealing with his property, but he desired that $6,000 which he had in the Union Bank at Halifax should be disposed of by himself in contemplation of death, and should not be a part of his estate which passed into the hands of his executors.\nShortly before his death he wrote to his wife at Sydney, requesting her to come to Halifax, directing her to make certain arrangements before leaving and to bring with her certain articles and papers, which she did. After his wife reached Halifax Dr. McDonald's brother came to the infirmary, where both he and his wife were to see him, and the doctor asked his wife to take from his trunk the deposit receipt for $6,000, which he said he wished to divide equally between his wife, his brother Daniel and his sister Jane, as he did not expect to recover, and did not wish that the money for Which this deposit receipt was held should appear in his will as part of his estate. To carry out this purpose, he directed his brother Daniel to make out three orders for the division of the sum for which the deposit receipt was held between the three parties named, and these orders were signed by him, and were handed with the deposit receipt to his brother, who placed it in the hands of Dr. McDonald's wife, as custodian for the donees, for I think it is clear that the doctor intended, at that time, to part with the custody of the deposit receipt and did in fact do so and had no intention of regaining possession of it thereafter. The orders for the division of the sum represented by the deposit receipt are, to my mind, very strong corroborative evidence of the gift, and were made for the purpose of showing the amount that each of the donees was to receive. They testify to this intention under his own hand. It is admitted that if he gave the deposit receipt to the three persons mentioned and so as to divide the sum which it represented between them upon his death, that a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2 was made, and this, I think, he did. But it was argued for the appellants that the deposit receipt was taken from the trunk of the deceased, by his direction, that it was returned to the trunk again, and, having been by that act restored to his possession, no matter what may have been his intention, the gift, if one was made, was thereby cancelled, and the possession of the deposit receipt remained in Dr. McDonald. In re Beak's Estate[51]; Hewitt v. Kaye[52]; and In re Beaument[53]. I do not agree with this view. I do not regard it as consistent with the facts. I think that it was his declared intention to give the money represented by the deposit receipt to the beneficiaries named and to that end he gave the deposit receipt; that it went out of his possession into the possession of his brother who handed it to Dr. McDonald's wife, as one of the donees, to hold it for herself and the other two beneficiaries. Dr. McDonald intended this deposit receipt to be, and it was after the orders were given, in their possession and not in his, and to become their property absolutely upon his death.\nLet us for a moment consider the facts. There can be no dispute of this, that he signed three orders for $2,000 each, to be paid to the parties out of the deposit receipt. Does this not disclose clearly an intention to divide the sum for which the deposit receipt was held equally between the three donees? Why should he then retain the deposit receipt? Was it not what one might expect would be done? Is it not a disclosure of an intention to give the money for which the receipt was held and to give the orders to shew how that money was to be divided? He had, under the strictest construction of what he said and did, given orders to the total amount of the principal sum. Can it be supposed that the interest, which amounted to less than $18, was withheld by the donor, when it is so clear that he intended that each of the donees should receive one-third of the amount of the deposit receipt? It would require but little evidence to shew that he handed over the receipt itself to the beneficiaries. Looking at what he did over his own signature, I think it is more reasonable to hold that he gave to the parties named the whole sum for which the deposit was held, and that the orders which were given were intended to shew simply how the sum was to be divided. It is true that the anxiety which he expressed\u2014that the money should be drawn and divided without delay\u2014might seem to point to a gift inter vivos, but, after considering all that was said and done at the time, I have no doubt that a gift mortis caus\u00e2 was intended, and I think that such a gift was effectually made. Gardner v. Parker[54].\nIt is important to look at the surrounding circumstances and to note what passed between the donor, his brother and his wife, and to see whether after the receipt of the deposit was handed to the deceased's brother with the orders, shewing the disposition he had made of it, in the event of his death, he did anything to show that he regarded it as still in his possession, and I think that what was done shows that it was handed by the brother to the sick man's wife, not to return it to the custody of the donor, and so defeat the object which he had expressed, but for safe-keeping for herself and the other donees, and if she put it in his trunk, it was not for the purpose of restoring it to his possession again, but because she thought it was the safest and most convenient place which she had under her control.\nThe cases which hold that the dying man had not completed his gift but retained possession of his property were cases in which the property was put into some trunk or box by his direction the key of which was brought to him and of which he retained in his possession while he lived. Here the receipt of deposit was in the possession of the wife for herself and the two other beneficiaries and this is confirmed by the orders given upon it.\nIt is well to consider the nature of the gifts of this class; how they are created, and by what acts they may be destroyed.\nA donatio mortis caus\u00e2 is (says Story,) a sort of amphibious gift, between a gift inter vivos and a legacy; it is not properly cognizable by the ecclesiastical courts; neither does it fall regularly within an administration; nor does it require any act of the executor to constitute a title in the donee. It is properly a gift of personal property by a party who is in peril of death upon condition that it shall presently belong to the donee, in case the donor shall die, but not otherwise.\nThis, I think, is a good description of this kind of a gift. To be a valid donation the gift must be made with a view to the donor's death; it must be conditioned to take effect only on his death from the existing disorder; and there must be a delivery of the subject of the donation by the donor, or by his direction, to the donee, or to some one for his use; so that the possession of the thing will have passed from the donor to the donee to vest, upon the death of the donor, absolutely in the donee. In my opinion, these conditions were complied with here. In the case of Lawson v. Lawson[55] it was held that where a husband on his death bed delivered to his wife a hundred guineas and bade her apply it to her own use, that was a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2, and should not go to the executors or administrators of the husband if there was sufficient without it to pay his debts.\nThe Master of the Rolls was of opinion that the purse of gold was a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2. It was also said, in that case, that if the husband, being ill, draws a bill on his goldsmith to pay his wife a hundred pounds for a mourning outfit, it was but an authority and it was determined by the death of the husband. But the counsel for his wife replied that it was an authority coupled with an interest and, being given for mourning, it could not take effect but upon the testator's death, and, therefore, his death could not be a revocation. The Master of the Rolls doubted whether there could be a donatio caus\u00e2 mortis without an actual delivery to such donee; at least it was a point not settled, and he reserved it for further consideration. Subsequently he delivered his opinion on both these points. He held a delivery of a purse could and must operate as a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 ut res magis valeat quam pereat; because otherwise, one could not give to his own wife, and there being a delivery by a testator in his last illness and when he was so near his end and bidding his wife apply it to no other use than her own, made this part of the case plain; and he cited Swinburne, 18, where it appears there are three sorts of gifts caus\u00e2 mortis, and said this was in the nature of a legacy to the wife.\n2dly. As to the bill of one hundred pounds drawn upon his goldsmith, payable to his wife, to buy her mourning, and to maintain her until her life rent (viz. jointure), should come in, this the Master of the Rolls held good, and to operate as an appointment; that, if the wife had received the bill in the husband's lifetime it would have been liable to some dispute, but that he apprehended this amounted to a direction to his executors that the one hundred pounds should be appropriated to his wife's use. It might operate like a direction given by a testator touching his funeral, which ought to be observed though not in his will; though the court ought to go as far as it could to assist the meaning of the party in this case. This case illustrates the doctrine as it prevails at present.\nIn the case of Miller v. Miller et al.[56], Miller had a wife and a son, an only child. Two days before his death, he made a will giving his wife one hundred and fifty pounds per annum during her widowhood, in long exchequer annuities. Later, during the same day, he made a codicil by which he gave his wife a further exchequer annuity, and five hundred pounds in money to be paid to her immediately after his death. Subsequently to this, and about an hour before his death, the testator having called his servant to reach his pocket-book, took thereout two bank notes for three hundred pounds each and another note for one hundred pounds (not being a cash note or payable to bearer), all of which notes he ordered his servant to deliver to his wife, who was present, adding that he had not done enough for her. The wife for some time declined to take these, having, as she said, enough already, and that it would injure her son, who was the residuary legatee of the will. Nevertheless, she was at length prevailed upon by her husband to accept of the three bank notes and also the other note, after which the testator, by word of mouth, gave her his coach and a pair of coach horses, bidding three witnesses who were present to take notice of it, and that he was in his senses, who accordingly made a memorandum thereof in writing. A bill was brought in the name of the infant son, by his prochien amy against the widow and the executors for an account of the testator's personal estate. The Master of the Rolls held that the gift of the six hundred pounds contained in the bank notes was a donatio caus\u00e2 mortis, which operates as such though made to a wife, for it is in the nature of a legacy, but need not be proved in the spiritual court as a part of the testator's will. Neither are gifts of this kind good unless made by the party in his last sickness. And though in the principal case the sum be the same with the six hundred pounds given by the codicil, yet the manner of giving these notes, together with the expression then made use of by the husband, declaring that he had not sufficiently provided for his wife, manifestly showed them to be designed as additional. On the other hand the wife, declining at first to accept them, appears to have been no craving woman, but then, as to the note for one hundred pounds which was merely a chose in action, and must still be sued in the name of the executors, that cannot take effect as a donatio mortis caus\u00e2, inasmuch as no property therein could pass by delivery, much less can the widow be entitled to the coach and horses of which there was no delivery in the testator's lifetime. But the doctrine is now well established that not only negotiable notes and bills of exchange, but bills payable to bearer, or indorsed in blank, exchequer notes, and bank bills may be the subject of a donatio mortis caus\u00e2, because they may and do, in the ordinary course of business, pass by delivery.\nIn Bouts v. Ellis[57], a testator, upon his death bed, gave a cheque of one thousand pounds to his wife, and at his request, she changed it for a cheque of another person for the same amount. The testator's cheque was paid in his lifetime, and after his decease the widow obtained the one thousand pounds upon another cheque given to her in exchange for that which she had received from her husband. It was held by the Master of the Bolls, and affirmed by the Lords Justices on the appeal, that the gift to the wife was complete and that the one thousand pounds did not form part of the husband's estate. The Master of the Rolls said:\nMy opinion is that this was a trust executed by the testator [in his lifetime for the benefit of his wife.\nIn the case of Moore v. Barton[58], Miss Darton lent Moore five hundred pounds for which he gave a signed memorandum, saying it was to bear interest at four per cent, but not to be withdrawn at less than six months notice. In October, 1843, this acknowledgement was given. On the same day a second receipt was given:\nReceived by Miss Darton, for the use of Ann Dye, one hundred pounds, to be paid to her at Miss Darton's decease, but the interest at four per cent to be paid to Miss Darton. (Signed) William Moore.\nUnderneath these receipts was written, \"I approve of the above. Betty Darton.\" In June, 1845, Miss Darton fell into a declining state of health, and on the 18th of June she was confined to her bed. She had a conversation at the time with Ann Dye as to the money she had lent to Mr. Moore. The evidence given by Ann Dye was:\nI assisted Miss Darton from her bed, and she took from a drawer the two receipts, and placed them in my hand?, and at the same time requested me to take care of them, and be sure and not let Mr. Thomas Harley Darton (who was her nephew and the executor named in her will), see them, and not let either of them go out of my possession until after her death, and she then directed me that immediately upon her death I was to give the two receipts or memorandums to William Moore. Her object or purpose in giving me such directions as [aforesaid, as she told me, and as I believe, was that she wished that, at her death, the debt or sum of six hundred pounds, so due to her from' the said William Moore, should be cancelled.\nThis case came before Knight Bruce V.C. He said the consequence is that Mr. Moore, having received this money (to the extent of one hundred pounds) became trustee of it for the use of Miss Darton for life, and subject to a life interest for the use of Ann Dye, whom he thought entitled accordingly.\nThe document now before me, the delivery of which is said to have operated as a donatio caus\u00e2 mortis, delivered with the intention with which it is said to I have been delivered, was placed in the hands, not of Mr. Moore, but of Ann Dye. I think, however, upon the evidence, that it was placed in the hands of Ann Dye sufficiently in the character of agent for Mr. Moore, to make it equivalent to a delivery to Mr. Moore; and I think that the intention was that which was sufficient to create a gift mortis caus\u00e2; and if, therefore, by law, an interest of this description is capable of being made the subject of a donatio mortis caus\u00e2, this was so.\nThe authorities have not gone so far as to recognise the donor's unpaid cheque as a valid gift mortis caus\u00e2, in the hands of his banker; Hewitt v. Kaye[59]; nor the gift of a bank book as a gift caus\u00e2 mortis. In Beak's Estate[60].\nIn Duffield v. Elwes[61], it was held that the court of equity, when it carries into effect the interest that the donee has, assumes that the interest is completely vested by the gift, and that the donee has the right to ask for the aid of the court to compel the executor or administrator to carry into effect the donor's intention.\nIn Ward v. Turner[62] the court held that delivery is necessary to make a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2; that the delivery of certain receipts for stock did not effectuate the gift of the stock; that they might be of some avail to identify the person coming to receive the stock, but after that is over, they are nothing but waste paper.\nIn July, 1859, the question of how far an unindorsed promissory note, payable to the donor or order, may be the subject of a gift caus\u00e2 mortis came before Sir John Romilly, M.R. in the case of Veal v. Veal[63] and he held that, according to the latest determination of English courts, such a gift is valid.\nIn Reddell v. Dobre,[64] the deceased being in declining health delivered to Charlotte Redell a locked cash box and told her to go at his death to his son for the key; that the box contained money for herself, and was entirely at her disposal after he was gone, but that he should want it every three months while he lived. The box was twice delivered to the deceased by his desire and he delivered it again to Charlotte Redell and it was in her possession at his death; the box was afterwards broken open and contained a cheque for five hundred pounds drawn by a third party in favour of the deceased and enclosed in a cover indorsed with the name of Charlotte Redell and the key which the son of the deceased had refused to deliver to her had a piece of bone attached to it with her name witten on it. Shadwell V. C. held that there was no donatio mortis caus\u00e2, for that there was nothing more than that to a certain extent the deceased had put Charlotte Redell in possession of the box but had retained to himself the absolute power over its contents.\nAll these cases make it clear that the possession of the property must pass to the donee or to some one who holds it for him. The possession cannot continue in the donor and here in the case before us, in my opinion, it did not. Hawkins v. Blewitt[65]; Bunn v. Markham,[66]; Hassell v. Tynte[67]; Duffield v. Elwes,[68]; Ward v. Turner,[69].\nIn re Mead; Austin v. Mead,[70] a testator who held a banker's deposit note for two thousand seven hundred pounds, two days before his death, proposed to give five hundred pounds of this amount to his wife. At his request a friend filled up a seven day's notice to the bank to withdraw the deposit which the testator signed. The friend took the notice to the bank. The testator afterwards signed a form of cheque, which was on the back of the note, \"Pay self or bearer \u00a3500\"; the note was then handed to his wife, The testator died before the expiration of the seven days' notice. The practice of the bank was, when the customer withdrew a part of the sum which he had placed on deposit, to give him a fresh note for the balance. Upon these facts Lord Justice Fry said:\nA gift of a banker's deposit note with a view of giving to the donee the whole of the sum secured by it has been held to be a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2. A gift of a cheque upon a banker, the cheque not being payable during the donor's life, has been held to be not a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nAnd this gift was held to be a cheque, for the deposit note was for a very much larger sum than the donation.\nWith regard to the bills of exchange which were given at the same time, that had not been indorsed, but which were payable to the donor or order, they were held to have been a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2. In this respect, Veal v. Veal[71] was followed.\nIn Clement v. Cheesman[72] a cheque payable to the donor or order and without having been indorsed by the donor was given during his last illness to his son, and was held to stand upon the same footing as a promissory note or bill of exchange. Chitty J. followed Veal v. Veal[73], and held it passed to the son by way of donatio mortis caus\u00e2. Here Mr. Justice Chitty pointed out that a cheque drawn by a donor upon his own banker cannot be the subject of a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 because the death of the donor is a revocation of the banker's authority to pay. But, when the donor is dealing with the cheque of another man, it stands upon entirely the same footing as a bill of exchange or promissory note, and so it was held that the son held these cheques of third parties as a donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nIn Re Dillon; Duffin v. Duffin[74], a testator held a banker's depository note for five hundred and eighty pounds. Shortly before his death he filled out upon a stamp a form of cheque indorsed on the note, \"Pay self or bearer \u00a3580.\" He handed the document to a relation who was attending him in his last illness, telling her that she was to give it back to him if he recovered, and, if not, she would be all right. It was held that there was a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2, and that the gift was not defeated by the giving of the cheque along with the note. No more do I think did the giving of the orders against the deposit receipt in any way invalidate the gift. They merely show how the sum mentioned in the deposit receipt was to be divided between the parties. I therefore hold that a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2 was made of this deposit receipt for $6,000 with the accumulated interest.\nI think that the testimony of Daniel McDonald and that of Eunice McDonald are in substantial accord; that the deposit receipt was given to them; that Daniel McDonald testifies truly when he says:\nI told him he had better give orders to show how much each of us was to get. He then told me to write such orders and he would sign them. I wrote the orders on Union Bank cheques and he signed them. I kept two of them, my own and my sister's, and handed the other to his wife with the deposit receipt.\nThe deposit receipt remained from that time until his death in the possession of Mrs. McDonald, his wife.\nEunice McDonald testified that the doctor asked her to take a deposit receipt out of his trunk, which she did and handed it to him. He handed it to his brother Daniel and asked him to make out three orders or cheques, one for his sister, one for himself and one for her. She thinks he told his brother to get the money as he did not wish it to have anything to do with his will. Daniel then gave the deposit receipt to her. She took charge of it and put it back in her trunk. She took charge of it, which means that it was, thereafter, in her custody. On cross-examination, she said that she did not understand that the money was to be got at once, but she understood that it was to be got and divided by means of cheques.\nI hold that the deposit receipt was given to the respondents by the late Dr. McDonald and was a good donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nARMOUR J. (dissenting.)\u2014All the authorities are rightly to the effect that the donor's own cheque given and not acted upon by payment either actually or constructively made, will not constitute a valid donatio mortis caus\u00e2. Per Buckley J. In re Beaumont[75]; citing Hewitt v. Kaye.[76], and In re Beak's Estate[77], to which may be added In re Mead[78].\nAnd the reason of this is that\nspeaking broadly the subjects of donationes mortis caus\u00e2 must be things the title to which or the evidence of title to which passes by delivery. Be Hughes[79]. The authorities also shew that a cheque is not an equitable assignment of money in the hands of a banker. Hopkinson v. Forster[80]; Schroeder v. Central Bank of London[81]; Shand v. Du Buisson[82]; Re Beaumont[83].\nThe cheques or orders, therefore, claimed in this suit are invalid either as donationes mortis caus\u00e2 or as equitable assignments and the respondents must fail in their claim so far as they are concerned.\nThe authorities shew, however, that a deposit receipt such as that claimed by the respondents is the subject of a donatio mortis caus\u00e2.\nThe onus of proving such a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 is upon the donee and \"cases of this kind demand the strictest scrutiny,\" and\nno case of this description ought to prevail unless it is supported by evidence of the clearest and most unequivocal character. Cosnahan v. Grice[84]\nand\nsound policy requires that the laws regulating gifts caus\u00e2 mortis should not be extended and that the range of such gifts should not be enlarged. Ridden v. Thrall[85]; Duckworth v. Lee[86].\nThere were only two witnesses who gave evidence in support of the donatio of the deposit receipt; Daniel McDonald, the brother of the deceased, and Eunice McDonald, the widow of the deceased, and their evidence, so far as material, was as follows:\nDaniel McDonald said:\nOn the 13th October he asked his wife to take from his trunk, which was in the room at the time, a deposit receipt. She did so and handed it to him. It was a deposit receipt from the Union Bank. He then handed it to me and told me to divide it equally between his wife, his sister Jane and myself, as he did not wish this deposit receipt to have anything to do with his will. * * * * I told him he had better give orders to shew how much each of us was to get. He told me to write such orders and he would sign them. I wrote the orders on Union Bank cheques and he signed them. I kept two of them, my own and my sister's, and handed the other to his wife with the deposit receipt. * * * * I do not know where Mrs. McDonald put the deposit receipt when I gave it to her. I thought she put it back into the trunk.\nEunice McDonald said:\nThe doctor (her husband) asked me to take a deposit receipt out of his trunk, which I did and handed it to him. He handed it to big brother Daniel, and asked him to make out three checks or orders, one for his sister, one for himself and one for me. I think he told his brother to get the money as he did not wish it to have anything to do with his will. Daniel then gave the deposit receipt to me. I took charge of it and put it back into the trunk. * * A couple of days after my husband told his brother again to get the money out of the bank and divide it as he did not wish it to have anything to do with his will. I took the deposit receipt in the doctor's trunk to Sydney\u2014(This was after the doctor's death.) * * I had another trunk * * I did not understand that the money was to got at once, but I understood it was to be got and divided by means of the cheques * * I brought two trunks with me from Sydney, mine and the doctor's.\nThese witnesses differ materially in their accounts of the transaction, Daniel McDonald saying that his brother handed him the deposit receipt telling him to divide it equally between his wife, his sister Jane and himself, and Mrs. McDonald making no mention of this important fact; and Daniel McDonald saying, it was at his suggestion that the cheques were made out, and Mrs. McDonald saying that it was by her husband's direction.\nThe learned trial judge, who saw these witnesses and heard their evidence given, was of the opinion that the evidence of Mrs. McDonald was the correct version of what took place, and his opinion, in this respect, is of great weight.\nI am unable to see anything in the evidence of Mrs McDonald which would warrant the finding of a donatio of the deposit receipt; her husband used no words of gift with regard to it; he handed it to Daniel McDonald obviously for the purpose of enabling him to make out the orders or cheques, and asked him to make out three orders or cheques, one for his sister, one for himself and one for her, and she understood the money was to be got and divided by means of the cheques; all of which evidence points to the gift of the cheques or orders, but not to the gift of the deposit receipt.\nTurning then to the evidence of Daniel McDonald, and assuming that when the deceased handed him the deposit receipt and told him to divide it equally between his wife, his sister Jane, and himself he intended to make a gift of the deposit receipt, that intention was abandoned by his accepting the suggestion of Daniel McDonald and giving the cheques or orders in substitution for it, and that they were given in substitution for it is manifest from the fact that, upon their being given, the deposit receipt was returned; and that they were accepted in substitution of the intended gift of the deposit receipt is also manifest from the fact that Daniel McDonald, to whom the gift was intended to be made, instead of keeping it, as he did his own and his sister's cheques, returned it.\nThis evidence also points to a gift of the cheques or orders but not to a gift of the deposit receipt.\nI asked the respondents' counsel, in the course of the argument, to whom they contended the gift had been made and they answered, to Daniel McDonald, and the question therefore is: Was there a gift made by the deceased to Daniel McDonald of the deposit receipt? It is essential to such a gift that there should be an acceptance by the donee of the thing given, that there should be an actual delivery and a change of possession of the thing given from the donor to the donee, and that such change of possession should continue until the death of the donor.\nThe proposition is not\u2014that the one party has agreed or promised to give, and that the other party has agreed or promised to accept. In that case, it is not doubted that the ownership is not changed until a subsequent actual delivery. The proposition before the court on a question of gift or not is\u2014that the one gave and the other accepted. The transaction described in the proposition is a transaction begun and completed at once. It is a transaction consisting of two contemporaneous acts, which, at once, complete the transaction, so that there is nothing more to be done by either party. The act done by the one is that he gives; the act done by the other is that he accepts. These contemporaneous acts being done, neither party has anything more to do. The one cannot give, according to the ordinary meaning of the word, without giving; the other cannot accept, then and there, such a giving without then and there receiving the thing given. Per Lord Esher M.R., in Cochrane v. Moore[87].\nThe delivery in a donatio mortis caus\u00e2 must be such a delivery as to pass the thing out of the dominion of the dying person and put it into the dominion of the person to whom it was given. Cant v. Gregory[88].\nAnd there must be a continuing 'possession of the donee after the delivery to the time of the donor's death. Bunn v. Markham[89].\nBut it (the common law) does require clear and unmistakable proof not only of an intention to give but of an actual gift, perfected by as complete a delivery as the nature of the property will admit of. It not only requires the delivery to be actual and complete, such as deprives the donor of all further control and dominion, but it requires the donee to take and retain possession till the donor's death. Although the delivery may have been at the one time complete, yet this will not be sufficient, unless the possession be constantly maintained by the donee. If the donor again has possession the gift becomes nugatory. Hatch v. Atkinson[90]; Dunbar v. Dunbar[91]; Basket v. Hassell[92].\nThe alleged gift to Daniel McDonald was deficient in all these essentials. There was no acceptance by Daniel McDonald of a gift of the deposit receipt, for when the cheques were drawn and signed by the deceased he returned it. If he had accepted it he would have taken it and kept it as he did his own and his sister's cheques and would not have returned it as he did.\nThere was no actual delivery and change of possession of the deposit receipt from the deceased to Daniel McDonald. There is no ground in the evidence for any contention that Daniel McDonald when, after the cheques were drawn, and signed, he handed the deposit receipt to Mrs. McDonald, he handed it to her in order that she might keep it for him, for nothing was said by him when he handed it to her. She, by her husband's directions, and as his agent, took the deposit receipt out of his trunk, and handed it to him and he handed it to Daniel McDonald and, after the cheques were drawn and signed, Daniel McDonald handed the deposit receipt to Mrs. McDonald who replaced it in her husband's trunk. The proper inference from this is, nothing having been said, that Daniel McDonald handed the deposit receipt to her and she received it in the same capacity in which she had taken it out of her husband's trunk, that is to say, as his agent, and her replacing it in her husband's trunk is consistent with this view and with no other What was done was precisely the same, in effect, and if the deceased had himself taken the deposit receipt out of the trunk and handed it to Daniel McDonald and the latter had, after the cheques were drawn and signed, handed it to the deceased who replaced it in his trunk. The possession of the deposit receipt by Daniel McDonald did not continue until the death of the deceased, for the deposit receipt was replaced by Mrs. McDonald in the deceased's trunk, and remained there until his death.\nIt was said in the court appealed from that the donor was not shewn to have been aware that it was put back in his trunk, if that would make any difference, which I do not think. But it was shewn that he was present during the whole transaction, and the fair inference is that he was aware of all that took place and nothing to the contrary was shewn. There was, therefore, no gift made by the deceased to Daniel McDonald of the deposit receipt as contended for by the respondents' counsel.\nRe Taylor[93] does not help the respondent. In that case the donee kept the key of the box in which the subject of the gift was placed and Sterling J. said:\nShe kept the key and had access to the box and from that it appears that there was a delivery of the note to her in one sense at all events.\nBut it was contended, in that case, that as the box was the donor's and where he kept his valuables, that his direction to the donee to place the subject of the gift in the box was a resumption of possession of such subject by the donor, although the donee kept the key, but it was held that it was not. If, however, the donor had obtained the key of the box from the donee after such subject was placed in the box, his doing so would doubtless have been held to have been a resumption by him of the possession of the subject of the gift. And that case belongs to a class of cases in which it has been held that the delivery and possession of the key of the depository in which the subject matter of the gift has been placed is an actual delivery and possession of the subject matter. I refer to Jones v. Selby[94], and to the comments thereon by Lord Hardwicke, as reported in Ward v. Turner[95], at page 443, and as reported in 1 Dickens, 170, at page 172. In Be Mustapha[96]; Walker v. Foster[97]; Pollock on Possession, 62. Two American cases were relied upon by the counsel for the respondents; Corle v. Monkhouse[98]; and Westerle v. Dewitt[99]. But the former was the case of a gift inter vivos, and is not pertinent to this case, and the latter was a decision of the Supreme Court reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, in neither of which courts was there unanimity. And the decision is not in accord with the English authority nor with the weight of American authority, and the case was not, in its circumstances, like this case, and we should have to go much further than was gone in that case to find a gift of the deposit receipt in this.\nI am unable in this case to find any evidence of a gift of the deposit receipt made by the deceased and, if there be any such evidence, having regard to the different accounts of the transaction given by the two witnesses and the finding by the learned trial judge that the account given by Mrs. McDonald was the correct one, I do not see how it can be held to be of the clearest and most unequivocal character.\nThe two witnesses Daniel McDonald and Eunice McDonald are, however, opposite and interested parties to this action within the meaning of the proviso in section 35 of chapter 163 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, to be read in accordance with sections 22 and 23 and subsection 33 of section 23 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, and cannot obtain judgment herein on their own testimony unless such testimony is corroborated by other material evidence. Taylor v. Regis[100].\nNow, the claim, in this case, is of a gift made by the deceased of the deposit receipt, and it is the testimony, if any, of these two witnesses that such gift was made that must be corroborated by other material evidence, and such other material evidence must be evidence tending, to prove that such gift was made by the deceased.\nIn Re Finch[101], Sir George Jessel said:\nAs I understand, corroboration is some testimony proving a material point in the testimony which is to be corroborated. It must not be testimony corroborating something else\u2014something not material.\nAnd Lindley J. said:\nEvidence which is consistent with two views does not seem to me to be corroborative of either. Re Laws[102]; Re Ross[103]; Tucker v McMahon[104].\nIt is said in the court appealed from that\nthe letter sending for the deposit receipt, the illness and absence of hope of recovery on the part of the donor and the orders signed by the donor during this period constitute material evidence\nEvidence of the fact that the deceased wrote from Halifax to his wife at Sydney on the fifth of October telling her, among other things, to come to Halifax, and saying \"bring bank-book and that cheque for $6,000,\" does not tend to prove that on the fifteenth of October he made a gift either of the bank-book or of the cheque.\nEvidence of the fact of the illness and of the absence of hope of recovery on the part of the donor does not tend to prove that during that period he made a gift of the deposit receipt, nor does his signing the orders during that period tend to prove it.\nNor do the orders, nor anything contained in them, tend to prove it. The orders were made payable \"out of deposit receipt No. 2193, Sydney,\" and these words tend rather to negative a gift of the deposit receipt than to prove it, indicating as they do a retention of the deposit receipt and not a donation of it and the deposit receipt shows that these orders did not exhaust the amount payable under it. Re Mead[105]. If the claim had been that the deceased owed the payees named in the cheques or orders or intended to give them the amounts mentioned therein, the cheques or orders would have been corroborative evidence of such a claim, but they are not in any way corroborative of a gift of the deposit receipt.\nThe evidence referred to as corroborative of the testimony of these witnesses is the only suggested evidence as being corroborative of it, and it is clearly not so in the sense of the law, and after carefully examining all the evidence, I am unable to find in it any other material evidence such as the law requires, corroborating the testimony, if any, of these witnesses that a gift of the deposit receipt was made by the deceased.\nThere is nothing said in Green v. McLeod[106] which would at all justify a finding that such testimony was corroborated.\nIn my opinion, the respondents have failed to establish their claim of a gift by the deceased of the deposit receipt, and the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court appealed from and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

N. S. (1900) c. 71, ss. 263, 264\u2014Construction of statute.\nBy the Nova Scotia statute, 63 Vict. ch. 176, the L. & M. Ry. Co. was granted powers as to the use and crossing of certain streets in the town, subject to such regulations as the town council might from time to time see fit to make to secure the safety of persons and property.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Davies J. dissenting, that such regulations could only be made by by-law and that the by-law making such regulations would be subject to the provisions of section 264 of \"The Towns Incorporation Act.\" (R. S. N. S. (1900) ch. 71.)\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (per Weatherbe and Graham JJ., Ritchie J. dissenting) reversing the decision of Meagher J. at the trial and declaring that the town council of the Town of Liverpool had full power and authority, without the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to make a regulation, by resolution to the effect and in the form following, viz.:\n\"That the Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited, shall forthwith erect and maintain two gates, to be of the latest improved pattern of railway crossing gates, [on and across Market Street, in this town, one north and the other south of the point where said company's track crosses said Market Street, and both said gates to be not more than twenty feet from said point or crossing. Said gates shall be closed within one minute before the passage of any of said company's engines, cars or trains across said Market Street, and shall be opened again immediately after the passage across said Market Street of such engines, cars or trains, and at all other times shall be kept open; and said company shall make due provision for such opening and closing of such gates.\" And further that the defendant was not entitled to operate its railways or tramway across Market Street, in the Town of Liverpool, without complying with the said regulation.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Armour.\nNew combe K.C. for the appellants. The regulation in question, not having been approved by the Governor-in-Council, is of no force or effect. The term \"regulations\" in sec. 1, ch. 176 of the Act of 1900, is synonymous with, and included in the term \"by-laws and ordinances.\" Angel and Ames on Corporations, secs. 325 and 326; Dillon, Municipal Corporations, secs. 307, 308, 314; Kepner v. The Commonwealth[1]; Wharton's Law Lexicon, p. 108; The Commonwealth v. Turner[2]; London Association of Shipowners and Brokers v. London & India Docks Joint Committee[3].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C for the respondent. The regulation in question is not of a character which the court can declare ultra vires on the ground of unreasonableness. It is a reasonable and proper one. The subsection added to section 6 of the Company's Act of Incorporation, by the amending Act of 1900, expressly confers authority upon the town council to make such regulation. Before the passing of this subsection the company could not cross Market Street without the consent of the town. Now, with the consent of the town the company may use the streets, involving the necessary crossings, \"subject, nevertheless, in all such cases, to such regulations, if any, as the said town council may, from time to time, if it sees fit, make, to secure the safety either of person or of property.\" See Dillon, Municipal Corporations (4 ed.) sec. 319, note; Biggar's Municipal Manual, p. 45; Bailey v. Williamson[4] per Cockburn C.J.; Slattery v. Naylor[5]; Kruse v. Johnson[6], at page 99; Walker v. Stretton[7]; Colborne v. Town of Niagara Falls[8].\nThe statute by giving a right to the company and declaring such right to be subject to such regulations as the town council may make is sufficient authority for the making of such regulations without the necessity of approval by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, and to make such regulations by resolution merely.\nThe Towns Incorporation Act does not require all regulations to be made by by-law, and the general language of secs. 263, 264 does not take away the specific powers given by the Act of 1900. See remarks of Robinson C.J. in Reg. v. Grand Trunk Railway Company[9].\nThe town council having power to give consent, subject to conditions, the conditions so given, when acted upon by the company, became a binding contract, and the company cannot act upon the conditional consent and ignore the conditions. The company is \"estopped\" from repudiating a regulation made under power expressly reserved in the contract under which they constructed the crossing. St. Louis, & Meramec River R. R. Co. v.

Vestry of St. George[17] at page 795.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK J concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and dismissing the action for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Armour.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Graham in his able and elaborate judgment, to which I do not feel that I can usefully add anything, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. I understand that all my brethren agree that none of the objections taken by the railway company to the plaintiffs' action are good, excepting the one that the \"regulation\" is invalid unless and until it is approved of as a by-law by the Lieut. Governor in Council. And on this point also I am in accord with the judgment appealed from. I do not think the word \"regulations\" was used in the statute amending the railway company's power to build the road through the Town of Liverpool in the sense of or as equivalent to the word \"by-law.\" I agree with Mr. Justice Graham that it was used in its ordinary and proper sense as an act of regulating. The statute meant, in my opinion, that the town might give its consent to the railroad running along or crossing any of its streets subject to such \"conditions\" or \"rules\" or \"provisions\" as the town council might from time to time make or provide. If any of these words, which are in my view the equivalent of the word actually used, had been inserted in the section then it could hardly be contended that, to render them effective, a by-law to be approved by the Lieut. Governor in Council should be passed. The town council could withhold its consent altogether or couple with it a condition subject to which its consent alone could be operative. It adopted the latter course and when the company acted upon the conditional consent there was formed a statutory contract between the town and the railway company, which the former had a right to have enforced quite irrespective of the formalities required for the passing of a by-law.\nMILLS J.\u2014In my opinion the railway company were authorized by their act of incorporation to construct, maintain and operate a line of railway with all the necessary side tracks for the passage of their cars along the streets of Liverpool. The act of incorporation was subsequently amended, making it necessary to obtain the consent of the council of the Town of Liverpool to the crossing of the streets by any extension of the line of the Liverpool and Milton Railway. The railway company desired to remove their track from the Main Street to the water front, and the solicitor of the company asked the town council of Liverpool to pass a resolution at their first meeting so as to expedite the removal of the track of the company from the Main Street to the one upon which they desired to locate it. The council complied with this request upon condition; 1, That the company should within six months remove its rails and sleepers from certain parts of Main Street and School Street, and should put these streets from which the track is removed in good repair.\n2. That the company should only avail themselves of the liberty conceded upon the condition and understanding that they exercised their powers subject to such regulations as the council of the town should from time to time make, in respect to the crossing of the streets mentioned.\n3. That the building and maintaining of the line across any of the said streets should be subject to the approval of the street committee of the council.\n4. That suitable provision subject to the approval and direction of the committee, should be made by the railway company for the flagging of its trains at the street crossings.\n5. That the traffic of the streets should not be interfered with by the trains of the railway company.\nOn the last day of May, 1901, the town council passed a resolution to maintain gates of the most approved pattern at places named by the council, and the council further resolved that if these resolutions were not complied with within forty days, the council would take proceedings to stop the railway company's engines or cars from running across Main Street.\nThe company have not obeyed these resolutions, and the council are seeking to enjoin them. It is not defined that the council may make the necessary bylaws, rules and regulations for the proper municipal government of the town; but could it control the appellant company by resolution in the way attempted? I do not think so. By the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, c. 71, s. 263, the municipal council are authorized to make by-laws for the safety of persons and property, and this they are not authorized to do by resolution. The council must follow the statute in the exercise of the enabling power conferred. What they are authorized to do by by-law they cannot do by resolution This has not been done, they have not exercised their power as the statute provides, and they have not sought and obtained the approval of the Lieut Governor in Council, as the statute requires. This approval is required to protect the company against the possibility of unreasonable or repressive demands being made upon them. My brother Armour has gone so fully into the discussion of the subject in which I so entirely concur, that I deem it unnecessary to discuss the subject further. I agree that the appeal must be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs.\nARMOUR J. The appellant company was incorporated by the Act of the Province of Nova Scotia, 59 Vic. ch. 88, by section 6 of which it was provided that\nthe said company shall have the right of constructing, maintaining and operating a line or lines of single track railway or tramway with all the necessary side tracks, switches and turnouts, and other appliances for the passage of cars, carriages and other vehicles, upon and along the streets of the towns of Liverpool and Milton, and the highway extending from Liverpool to Milton, and thence by the west side of the Mersey River to the premises of the Milton Pulp Company, Limited, and thence across the river to the pulp mill, and through such other streets of the towns aforesaid as may hereafter be decided upon by the company, the consent of the municipal council having first been obtained. By the Act of the Province of Nova Scotia, 63 Vic. ch. 176, section 6 of chapter 88 of 59 Vic. was amended by adding as a subsection thereto the following:\nThe said company may construct, operate and maintain a line of railway or tramway, from any point or points on its line across any of the streets of said town of Liverpool, and across and along the heads of docks, wharves and on the lands on the south side of the Liverpool river to a point on the western side of Liverpool harbour below Fort Point, and in addition to all rights by section 6 of said chapter 88 given to said company or now possessed by said company, but without restricting or affecting the generality or force of the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the said Liverpool & Milton Tramway Company Limited, (hereafter to be known as the Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited), shall have the right of constructing, maintaining and operating a line or lines of single track railway or tramway, with all the necessary side-tracks, switches and turnouts, and other appliances for the passage of cars, carriages and other vehicles, upon and along the line or route recently surveyed, and upon several sections of which a track or stone roadway or filling for track is now or has within the last eight months previous to the passage hereof been in course of construction, to connect the present track of said company at or near Stephen West's shop near the parade in the town of Liverpool with the track of the said company on Water street in said town along or near the waterfront, and upon and along such other line or route within said town, and in, upon, across or through such lands, land covered with water, wharves, docks or bodies of water within said town, as the town council of said town may by resolution approve; subject nevertheless, in all such cases, to such regulations, if any, as the said town council may, from time to time, if it sees fit, makes to secure the safety either of persons or of property; provided, however, that where either public or private rights or property shall be taken or interfered with, or shall be proposed to be taken or interfered with under this section and no agreement can be arrived at with said town council in case of public rights or property, or with the owner or owners in case of private rights or property, as to compensation or damages, the company shall proceed as in section 25 (by this Act added to said chapter 88) provided, and the provisions of said section 25 shall apply; provided, however, that before any such line shall be built across, along or upon any other streets or thoroughfares of said town the consent of the town council shall have first been obtained. After the passing of the said last mentioned Act the appellant's solicitor wrote to the mayor and town council of the respondents as follows:\nBy section 1 of chapter 176 of the Acts of the Local Legislature passed in the year 1900 the Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited, were given additional powers as follows\u2014(setting out in its very words the subsection added by the said last mentioned Act to section 6 of 59 Vic. ch. 88, and proceeding thus): You will see by the last part of this section that the consent of the town council is necessary as to crossing streets. The only streets I believe the new line will touch are Bridge or Market street. Union street and street leading to Shipyard Point. The company are desirous of removing their track at as early a date as possible off the main street and placing same along Water front. Before the plans can be approved it is necessary to have a resolution from the town council as set out above. As solicitor of the company, I would respectfully request you to pass such resolution at your first meeting so as to expedite the removal of the track of the company from off the main street.\nThereupon, and on the 8th day of December 1900 the council of the respondents passed the following resolution:\nWhereas, the Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited, has requested the town council of the town of Liverpool to grant their consent, as required or provided by section 1 of Chapter 176 of the Acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, passed in the year 1900, amending section 6 of chapter 88 of the Acts of 1896: Therefore resolved, That the consent of this council be, and it is hereby given to said company, to build a line of single track railway across the streets known as Market street, Bridge street McPherson's lane, street leading from Inness' corner to the river, being continuation of Union street, and street leading to Shipyard Point; provided that said company shall only avail itself of the provisions of this resolution if, and this resolution is upon the condition that the company shall within six months from the passage of this resolution remove its track, rails and sleepers from Main street between the point where its new or proposed line leaves said streets near Stephen West's shop and John D. McClearn's corner, and from School [street between McClearn's corner and the foot of said School Street, and put or provide for putting the said streets, where the company shall so take up or remove such track, in good and proper order to the satisfaction of the street committee of this council; and provided further, that the company shall only avail itself of this resolution upon the condition and understanding that the rights or powers of the company under said section 1 of said chapter 176 shall be exercised subject to such regulations as this council may from time to time make, to secure the safety either of person or of property, and subject also to such regulations as this council may from time to time make as to crossing said mentioned streets;\nProvided further, and this resolution is upon the further condition, and this council makes hereby this regulation: that the building and maintaining of said line across said, or any of said streets, shall be subject, as to the manner of building and maintaining such line or track, to the direction and approval of the street committee of this council, and that due and proper provision, subject to the direction and approval of such committee, shall be made by said company for the flagging of its trains at said or any of said crossings, and that traffic on any of said streets shall not be interfered with by the track or trains of the company, and when the company shall at any time place its track above the street level at any such crossing, the company shall raise the street level to correspond subject to the direction and approval of said street committee (and the expression\" street\" in this resolution shall include sidewalk.)\nThe appellants, thereupon, constructed their railway as authorized by the said resolution and afterwards on the 31st day of May, 1901, the council of the respondents passed the following resolution:\nResolved, and this council hereby makes the following regulation: That the Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited, shall forthwith erect and hereafter maintain two gates, to be of the latest approved pattern of railway crossing gates, on and across Market Street in this town, one north and the other south of the point where said company's track crosses said Market Street, and both said gates to be not more than twenty feet from said point or crossing. Said gates shall be closed within one minute before the passage of any of said company's engines, cars or trains, across said Market Street, and shall be opened again immediately after the passage across said Market Street of such engines, cars or trains, and at all other times shall be kept open; and said company shall make due provision for such opening and closing of such gates;\nResolved further, that in the event of said Liverpool and Milton Railway Company, Limited, not complying with the foregoing regulations as to such gates, within forty days of its being notified of the making of said regulation, proceedings shall be taken by this council to stop the running of said company's engines, cars or trains, across said Market Street until compliance therewith.\nThe appellants having neglected to comply with this last resolution this action was brought for a declaration that the council of the respondents had fall power and authority to make the said regulation and that the appellants were not entitled to operate their railway or tramway across Market Street without complying with said regulations, and for an injunction restraining them from operating their line of railway or tramway across Market Street without complying with said regulation.\nAt the time of the passing of the Act 63 Vict. ch. 176, the Towns Incorporation Act of 1895 was in force, section 296 of which provided that\nThe town council in each incorporated town, in addition to all powers to make by-laws and ordinances, rules and regulations vested in them by the terms of this Act, shall have the sole power and authority, subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council, to make by-laws for the good rule and government of the town, and for the better carrying out of the provisions in this Act contained, and from time to time revise, repeal, alter or amend any by-laws, ordinances, rules or regulations whatsoever by them made under the authority of this Act; and for the more particularly defining the power of the said town council, and the said town council shall have power to make by-laws for the several purposes following, * * * that is to say:\n(61). The providing for any other purpose, matter or thing, specially subjected to the control of the town council by law.\nAnd at the time of the passing of the resolution by the council of the respondents of the 31st of May, 1901, chapter 71 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, was in force, by section 263 of which it was provided that:\nThe town council in addition to any powers by this chapter conferred upon the council to make by-laws and ordinances, shall have power to make by-laws in respect to all matters coming within the following classes of subjects and may from time to time amend or repeal such by-laws, that is to say for * * * (74) providing for any other purpose, matter or thing specially within the powers, duties or control of the town council.\nAnd by section 264 it was provided that\nthe by-laws for the foregoing purposes or any of them shall not be inconsistent with any statute in force in this Province and when approved by the Governor in Council shall have the force of law.\nThe Legislature, as has been shown, in granting to the appellants by 63 Vict. ch 176, the right of constructing, operating and maintaining their line of railway or tramway across the streets of the respondents, made such grant subject to such regulations, if any, as the town council of the respondents might from time to time, if it saw fit, make to secure the safety either of persons or of property.\nThe contention of the appellants is that such regulations cannot be made by resolution, but must be made by by-law and if so made must, before having the force of law, be approved by the Governor in Council, and I am of the opinion that this contention is well founded.\nThe Act 63 Vic., ch. 176 does not prescribe the mode by which such regulations shall be made, but on turning to \"The Towns Incorporation Act of 1895,\" as it stood when the Act 63 Vic, ch. 176 was passed and as it was revised when the resolution of the council of the respondents of the 31st May 1901 was passed, we find that power was given to the council of the respondents to pass by-laws for\nthe providing for any other purpose, matter or thing specially subjected to the control of the town council by law.\nOr as revised for\nproviding for any other purpose, matter or thing specially within the powers, duties or control of the town council.\nIt is plain that The Towns Incorporation Act of 1895 conferred upon the council of the respondents the power to pass by-laws for making such regulations as are referred to in 63 Vic. ch. 176, and such power so conferred impliedly excluded the power to make such regulations otherwise than by by-law, and this is the mode of making such regulations that should have been adopted by the council of the respondents.\nIt was essential, therefore, to the validity of the regulations set forth in the resolution of the council of the respondents of the 31st May, 1901, that they should have been made by by-law and that such by-law should have been approved by the Governor in Council.\nThe resolution, therefore, of the council of the respondents of the 31st May, 1901, had no legal validity and even if it could be treated as a by-law, as was suggested, had not the force of law, not having been approved by the Governor in Council and the appellants were not bound to conform to it.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nI refer to London Association of Shipowners and Brokers v. London and India Docks Joint Committee,[18].\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. Q. Lovett.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Jason M. Mack.\n[1] 40 Pa. St. 124.\n[2] 1 Cush.

S. Miller of our local agency, As you and your husband have evidently taken a kindly interest in Mr. Miller, I might say to you without entering, into details as to the causes which compelled me to take this action, an explanation of which would hardly be appropriate here, that we have tried for a considerable time past to get Mr. Miller to attend properly to our business, and that it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made. In order to give Mr. Miller an opportunity to get the benefit of commissions on as much outstanding business as I could, I left the attention of certain matters in Mr. Miller's hands on the understanding that he would attend to them and remit to me as our representative. I now find that he has collected money which up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report, and I am told that he is doing and saying all he can against myself and the Company. The receipt for your premium fell due May 30th, days of grace June 30th. If you have made settlement of the premium with Mr. Miller your policy will, of course, be maintained in force, and we shall look to him for the returns in due course; but I have thought that it would be part of the plan Mr. Miller at one time declared he would follow in order to cease as much of our business as possible, that he would allow your policy to lapse through inattention. As I have thought that you would not like to have it so I am prompted to write you this letter and shall be glad if you will advise us whether or not you have made settlement with Mr. Miller. If not, what is your wish in regard to continuing the policy?\" In an action for libel it was shown that he had not been dismissed from the agency but wanted larger commissions in continuing which were refused, and that he was not a defaulter but was dilatory in making his returns, On the trial Mrs. Freeman gave evidence, subject to objection, of her understanding of the letter as imputing to M. a wrongful retention of money.\nHeld, that such evidence was improperly received and there was a miscarriage of justice by its admission.\nThe judge at the trial charged the jury that \"if the meaning of the first part of the letter is that he dismissed the plaintiff, and you decide that he did not dismiss the plaintiff, and it was not a correct statement, that is malice beyond all doubt. The protection which he gets from the privileged occasion is all gone. He loses it entirely. The same way with the second part. If it is not true it is malicious and his protection is taken away.\"\nHeld, that this was misdirection; that the question for the jury was not the truth or falsity of the statements but whether or not, if false, the defendant honesty believed them to be true, so that it was misdirection on a vital point.\nThe majority of the Court were of opinion, Girouard and Davies JJ. contra, that as defendant had asked for a new trial only in the Court below this Court could not order judgment to be entered for him and a new trial was granted.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (35 N. S. Rep. 117) reversed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis case had already been tried three times when the present appeal was taken. A former appeal to this court from an order for the third new trial was dismissed[2], and such trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff which was sustained by the full court.\nThe grounds upon which the present appeal are founded are sufficiently stated in the above head note and fully elaborated in the several opinions published herewith. W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. There is no doubt that the defendant's letter was privileged, Jenoure v. Delmage[3]; Nevill v. Fine Arts and General Ins. Co.[4]; and therefore the plaintiff must prove actual malice; Spill v. Maule[5].; English v. Lamb[6]; Dewe v. Waterbury[7].\nThe meaning of the letter is clear and unambiguous and the evidence of Mrs. Freeman as to her understanding of it should not have been received. Daines v. Hartley[8]; Simmons v. Mitchell[9].\nThe counsel then argued the several grounds of misdirection and contended that the damages were excessive.\nRoscoe K.C., for the respondent. The misdirection complained of is in isolated portions of the change but the whole should be read together. Wells v. Lindop[10]; Clark v. Molyneux[11]; Caldwell v. New Jersey Steamboat Co[12].\nIt is not sufficient to show that the jury may have been confused. Strickland v. Strickland[13].\nIt is not ground for a new trial that the judge has expressed an opinion on matters for the jury to decide. Taylor v. Ashton[14]; Darby v. Ouseley[15]; Hawkins v. Snow[16].\nThe statement in the letter that plaintiff was dismissed was false to defendant's knowledge as was also the charge that he did not return moneys. This was evidence of malice. Smith v. Crocker[17]; Gallagher v. Murton[18]; Royal Aquarium etc. Soc. v. Parkinson[19]. The evidence of Mrs. Freeman was admissible. Capital & Counties Bank v. Henry & Sons[20].\nThe damages were not excessive. Plaintiff was injured as a solicitor by the libel. Jones v. Littler[21].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Armour.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014We have decided on a former occasion that the letter of the appellant complained of by the respondent is capable of a libellous construction, and that, although written on a privileged occasion, the appellant should be responsible in damages if, upon the evidence, it is found that it was malicious, and finally, as there was misdirection to the jury by the trial judge, we affirmed the judgment ordering a new trial[22].\nThis court, however, never held that every part of the letter was libellous and that every part must be true. At the very beginning it contains a statement that the respondent had been relieved of the local agency and it cannot be contended that that statement in itself and independently of the words following is libellous; it was in fact conceded by the respondent's counsel that it was not, Now it seems to me that what follows the above statement alone is capable of libellous construction, namely, that he did not attend properly to the business of the company, and that he had collected money which they had been unable to get him to report.\nThe libel consisted in these charges. The evidence in this case clearly shows that these charges were substantially true, and in this essential particular this case is very different from the former one. The plaintiff had not made the admission to be found in this case, and the court in banco had found that the charges as to his default to remit or account regularly had not been proved[23].\nWithout referring to what Mr. Green says, the evidence of the respondent himself is precise enough. He says:\nThere was then clue the company $151.03. I said I had not the money here but would give him a cheque the next morning. He found fault because it was not there. * * * I was irregular in sending in monthly reports. I received directions to send in the reports on the fifth of each month but I did not attend to them.\nAnd in answer to the interrogatories:\n6. Did you receive any and what directions of instructions from the said association or its manager or other officer as to the dates or times at which you were required to make reports or returns or to send in accounts or to make remittances to the said association, or to its said manager at Halifax, or otherwise, and what were the dates or times at which you were so required to make reports or returns, or to send in accounts, and to whom and when were you to make such reports or returns or to send in such accounts?\nAnswer. I received directions from the defendant as manager of the said association requiring me to make my report and send in my remittance to the defendant, as such manager, as aforesaid, at Halifax, on or before the fifth day of each and every month.\nInterrogatory 11. Did you between the said 9th day of March, 1897, and the 27th day of April, 1897, collect or receive any and what money or premiums of the said association, as agent of the said association or otherwise, for said association? Answer fully and particularly.\nAnswer. I collected between the said ninth day of March, 1897, and the twenty-seventh day of April, 1897, as agent thereof for the said association, money or premiums of the said association, but I have no record thereof, and I do not remember the particulars thereof, and am unable to say what moneys I so collected.\nInterrogatory 12. Did you pay over or remit to the said association or its manager previous to the 28th day of April, 1897, any of the said moneys so collected by you subsequently to the said ninth day of March, 1897; if so, state when and in what manner and to whom you so paid over or remitted in each instance? Answer fully and particularly.\nAnswer. I did not pay over or remit to the said association or to its manager, previously to the 28th day of April, 1897, any of the said moneys so collected by me subsequently to the 9th day of March, 1897.\nNotwithstanding this confession the jury found for the respondent. The respondent contends that there was no misdirection on the part of the judge; but whether there was or was not, it cannot seriously be denied that the charges complained of were substantially true. In the face of the evidence, and especially of the admissions of the respondent, it is useless to send again the case to trial. Already three trials have taken place and no evidence can possibly be adduced to establish the falsity and malice of the above charges. I think it is in the interest of justice that the action should be dismissed and not sent back for a new trial. Although the appellant did not urge this before the court in banc, I believe that the court could have done so ex proprio mot\u00fb, and this court can likewise order, under rule 38, order 38, of the Nova Scotia Judicature rules:\nUpon a motion for judgment, or upon an application for a new trial, the court may draw all inferences of fact, not inconsistent with the findings of the jury, and if satisfied that it has before it all the material necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute, or any of them, or for awarding any relief sought give judgment accordingly * * *\nIt is urged that this is a mere point of practice. Whether it is or is not, it is evident that it will operate to the injury of both parties by incurring the costs of a useless trial.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the action dismissed, but without costs. As the majority of the court is, however, of opinion that a new trial should be granted, as a matter of practice, I will not dissent. DAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from a majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refusing to grant a new trial to the defendant in an action for libel. The application for the new trial was based mainly upon the grounds of misdirection by the trial judge and improper reception of evidence.\nThe plaintiff was a barrister-at-law, apple speculator and insurance agent residing at Bridgetown, N.S., and the defendant was the general manager of the Confederation Life Association for the Maritime Provinces, residing at Halifax, N.S.\nThe action has been three times tried before a jury, the plaintiff obtaining a verdict twice and the defendant once. This is the second time it has come before this court by way of appeal. The alleged libel is contained in the following letter, written by the defendant to Mrs. Freeman, wife of I)r. Freeman, of Bridgetown:\nCONFEDERATION LIFE ASSOCIATION.\nMaritime Provinces Branch; F. W. Green, Manager;\nAugustus Allison, Secretary.\nHalifax, July 7th, 1897.\nDear Mrs. Freeman,\u2014I think you know that at the time of my recent visit to Bridgetown I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller of our local agency. As you and your husband have evidently taken a kindly interest in Mr. Miller, I might say to you, without entering into details as to the causes which compelled me to take this action, an explanation of which would hardly be appropriate here, that we have tried for a considerable time past to get Mr. Miller to attend properly to our business and that it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made. In order to give Mr. Miller an opportunity to get the benefit of commissions on as much outstanding business as I could, I left the attention of certain matters in Mr. Miller's hands on the understanding that he would attend to them and remit to me as our representative. I now find that he has collected money which, up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report, and I am told that he is doing and saying all that he can against myself and the company. The receipt for your premium fell due May 30th, days of grace June 30th. If you have made settlement for th\u00e9 premium with Mr. Miller your policy will, of course, be maintained in force and we shall look to him for the returns in due course; but \u00ce have thought that it would be part of the plan Mr. Miller at one time declared he would follow in order to cease as much of our business as possible, that he would allow your policy to lapse through inattention. As I have thought that you would not like to have it so, I am prompted to write you this letter and shall be glad if you will advise us whether or not you have made settlement with Mr. Miller. If not, what is your wish in regard to continuing the policy?\nYours truly,\nF. W. GREEN,\nManager.\nThe substantial defences to the action were:\n1. That the statements contained in the letter were true; and\n2. That the letter was a privileged communication.\nThe plaintiff was formerly agent of the Confederation Life Association at Bridgetown and Mrs Freeman was a person insured by the association. The letter which constitutes the alleged libel was written to her by the defendant as and being manager of the said association, to ascertain whether or not the premium on her policy had been paid in time to keep it in force, and if not, to endeavour to secure its renewal.\nThe defendant had the oversight and management of about sixty local agents of the Confederation Life Association and the plaintiff had been such local agent at Bridgetown since prior to the appointment of the defendant as manager of the association at Halifax in 1888. Early in 1895, the Confederation Life Associa\u00bb tion established new rates for the remuneration of its local agents and, by formal notice in June, 1895, determined the plaintiff's agency under his original agreement with them. He, however, continued to act as agent for the company until July, 1897, when he was, as defendant expressed it, \"relieved\" of his agency. No new agreement had been entered into between the plaintiff and the company as to the terms of his employment after 1895. Miller insisted that he should receive a higher rate of commission than the company was willing to allow and as a consequence of that, and of his inattention to the business of the company, the manager made a change of agents. It is not disputed by the plaintiff that he failed while agent to properly perform his duties as such. He had had written notice to send in to the general manager on the fifth of each month his reports. He himself, in giving his evidence at the trial says:\nI was irregular in sending the monthly reports. I received directions to send in the reports on the fifth of each month, but I did not attend to them.\nAnd, in answer to interrogatories administered to him and which were put in evidence at the trial, he said:\nI received directions from the defendant as manager of the said association, requiring me to make my report and send in my remittance to the defendant, as such manager as aforesaid, at Halifax, on or before the fifth day of each and every month.\nI collected between the said ninth day of March, 1897, and the 27th day of April, 1897, money or premiums of the said association as agent thereof for the said association, but I have no record thereof and I do not remember the particulars thereof, and am unable to say what moneys I so collected.\nI did not pay over or remit to the said association, or to its manager previously to the 28th day of April, 1897, any of the said moneys so collected by me subsequently to the 9th day of March, 1897.\nOn the 27th of April the defendant, having failed, after repeated written applications, to obtain the plaintiff's report or any remittance of premiums collected which should have been forwarded on the fifth of the month, went to Bridgetown, saw the plaintiff and assisted him in making up his report. The plaintiff had not the money balance in his hands at the time, a fact which he admitted the defendant then complained of, but procured the same the next morning and paid. it over to the defendant as general manager. There is some discrepancy between the evidence given by the parties as to what took place on this occasion of the defendant's visit to Bridgetown. The plaintiff says:\nThere was then due the company $151.03. I said I had not the money here, hut would give him a cheque the next morning. He found fault because it was not there. I got the money and paid him the next morning. After we got the report made up he asked me if I would continue to act as agent. I said no, not at the remuneration they offered. He said the new agreement was better than the old. I said it would not pay me. He said he would have to try and get some one else. I suggested Harry Crowe and others whom I thought would accept the agency.\nThe defendant's version of what took place is as follows:\nHe said our company did not pay an agent enough to make it worth his while to look after the business well. He asked me to sit down and said he was glad I had come, that he was just about sick of the business anyway and would be glad to get rid of it. I said that would please us just as well, that it was quite clear he had not time and inclination to look after our business and we did not want him. We then talked about the reduction of the commissions.\" He said he had not understood it so, and that if I liked to leave the agency with him he would retain it. I said no, that it would be better for both of us that we should be separated for a while, that we had not understood each other, and that if after a time we had not got a good local agent we might give the agency back. He assented to it, and it was understood that he would give up the agency. Two days after I got a message that he wanted to see me. I went. He said that if I had not yet arranged about a new agent he would like to have it. I said I had already arranged with Mr. Weare to take the agency. We had no other interview about his continuing as our agent.\nWhen recalled and re-examined the plaintiff, while categorically denying some of the statements made by the defendant, Green, as to the conversation on the first day the latter went to Bridgetown, made no denial whatever of the statement that two days afterwards he had sent for Green and expressed a wish to have the agency and that Green had told him \"he had already arranged with Mr. Weare to take it.\" But there is no doubt that on this appeal we are bound to accept the plaintiff's statement as the correct one and to prefer it to that of Green in so far as it differs from or contradicts the latter. I have already pointed out, however, that there is no contradiction of plaintiff having expressed a desire on the second day to retain the agency and of the defendant having told him that arrangements had then been made with another agent.\nThe motion made by the defendant in the court below was for a new trial only on the grounds of misdirection and improper reception of evidence. The learned counsel for the plaintiff, respondent, while admitting on this appeal that the language of the learned trial judge, in the passages cited by the appellant, could not be defended, contended that they must be read in connection with the charge generally and that, if the general scope of the charge was correct, and presented a correct view of the law to the jury, the court would not seize upon isolated passages which, in themselves, were not accurate statements of the law unless satisfied clearly that the jury were or might have been misled by them.\nThis is no doubt true, but looking at the clear and specific character of the language used by the learned judge, I think it is impossible to say that the jury might not have been influenced and misled by it. At the close of his charge to the jury the learned judge addressed the observations more especially complained of to them with respect to the defendant's evidence and defendant's explanation of his meaning was treated as being a crucial matter in the case. The learned judge, after telling the jury that he \"did not think he could assist them any more,\" went on to say:\nYou have the letter and you have Mr. Green's explanation of it which you may take. He says \"I meant by this sentence, 'I think that you know that at the time of my recent visit to Bridgetown. I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller of our local agency, etc.', that I thought she understood that I changed the agency from Mr. Miller's hands, and, if she did not, I wanted to tell her.\" I don't see the connection myself exactly, but, if you can see it, there is the explanation of it. Do you think that he meant only to tell her what he says he meant, or do you think he meant to insinuate something else? That is that he dismissed Miller because he could not get him to attend to the business? If you come to that conclusion the privilege is taken away and you must find for the plaintiff.\nIt is possible and I think most probable, in view of previous parts of the same charge, that the language which the learned judge used did not correctly express the idea which he was endeavouring to convey to the jury. But whatever he had in mind, he clearly told the jury that if the letter bore a meaning which was plainly expressed on its face and was entirely consistent with the absence of malice they must, nevertheless, find for the plaintiff. In effect, the concluding portion of the quotation I have above made from the charge, practically amounted to this, that the jury were not to take into consideration the privileged occasion on which the letter was written.\nThe learned judge further directed the jury as follows on the law applicable to the letter of the defendant which was the subject matter of the alleged libel.\nIf he (defendant) makes a statement which he knows to be false, then it is malicious. If the meaning of the first part of the letter is that he dismissed the plaintiff and you decide that he did not dismiss the plaintiff and it was not a correct statement, that is malice beyond all doubt. The protection which he gets from the privileged occasion is all gone. He loses it entirely. The same way with the second part. If it is not true it is malicious and its protection is taken away.\nNow, with great respect, I do not think that is a correct statement of the law governing privileged communications such as the defendant's letter and I think it was calculated to mislead the jury. The learned judge overlooked the important fact that the defendant might honestly have believed that the plaintiff had been \"relieved\" of his agency, while the jury might come to the conclusion that he had resigned and had not been dismissed. But, if the defendant honestly believed that the effect of what took place between himself and the plaintiff amounted to a relieving or dismissal of the latter from the agency, the defendant's privilege would not be taken away even though the jury should come to a different conclusion on the facts.\nThe real question for the jury to determine was whether or not the defendant honestly believed what he stated in respect to the plaintiff's dismissal to be true, or, on the other hand, whether, knowing it to be untrue, he took advantage of the privileged occasion to malign and injure the plaintiff by misrepresenting the facts.\nApart from all questions of misdirection, I think the evidence of Mrs. Freeman, as to what she understood from the letter, was clearly inadmissible. She stated:\nI understood from the letter he had collected money and had not paid it over and had been dismissed by the company.\nThe test of the admissibility of such evidence is whether the words used and complained of were of plain and obvious meaning or were ambiguous or equivocal. If they were of plain and obvious meaning, evidence was not admissible as to how a witness understood them until it was first shown that they were used in some other sense than their ordinary sense and had some meaning different from their ordinary meaning. Daines v. Hartley[24].\nNo such showing was attempted or made here and, in its absence, I do not think the evidence of Mrs. Freeman, as to what was her understanding of the letter, was admissible.\nThe learned judge's reference to this evidence in his charge to the jury invested it with an importance which, in my judgment, precludes the possibility of successful argument that it might not necessarily have affected the verdict.\nWhile, however, I am of opinion that in any event there must be a new trial, I am also of opinion that the defendant is entitled to have the judgment entered for him on the evidence and notwithstanding the verdict. I think that the alleged libellous letter having been written on a privileged occasion, the onus lay upon the plaintiff of showing actual malice on the writer's part, which onus has not been satisfied by him.\nIt was strongly contended by Mr. Roscoe that this court has not the power to order judgment to be entered for the defendant, or having the power should not exercise it, because the defendant made no motion for a nonsuit at the trial, and his application to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was for a new trial only. But the appellant distinctly took the point in his factum on this appeal and supported it with an able and voluminous argument.\nThe respondent is, therefore, in no way prejudiced if, having the power to direct such judgment to be entered, we think this a proper appeal to exercise it in on proper terms.\nSection 60 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act provides as follows:\nThe Supreme Court may dismiss an appeal or give the judgment and award the process or other proceedings which the court, whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded.\nNow, what is the judgment which the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia should have given if no actual malice was proved, or evidence given from which it could be properly inferred? Clearly a judgment for the defendant.\nThe Nova Scotia Judicature Rules, order 38, rule 10, which is nearly the same as order 40, rule 10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, of England, reads as follows:\nUpon a motion for judgment or upon an application for a new trial, the court may draw all inferences of fact not inconsistent with the finding of the jury and, if satisfied that it has before it all the materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute, or any of them or for awarding any relief sought, give judgment accordingly.\nThe difference between the two rules lies in the limitation imposed by the Nova Scotia rule preventing the court drawing inferences of fact inconsistent with the jury's finding. But, in my judgment, no such inferences are necessary to be drawn here.\nIt seems to me plain that under this rule in all cases where there is no question of fact to leave to the jury, where the evidence to sustain the onus lying upon the plaintiff is insufficient and it, therefore, becomes the duty of the trial judge to nonsuit, in all such cases the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has the power, provided it has before it all the materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute, and has not to draw any inferences of fact inconsistent with the jury's findings, to give judgment accordingly. Of course, judgment will not and cannot be given under this rule where there is evidence to go to the jury; Brewster v. Durrand,[25]; and so doubts might be raised as to the power of the court to enter judgment under the rule notwithstanding the verdict, if it was simply a question, not of there being any evidence, but of the weight of testimony. See remarks of Lord Esher, M. R. in Millar v. Toulmin.[26] The cases are all collected in the notes to order 40, rule 10, of the rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, of England in the annual practice, 1903, p. 546.\nI am of the opinion that in this case there was no evidence to go to the jury at all and no questions of fact proper for their consideration. If it was a question of the credibility of the witnesses or the finding of any fact in support of which there was some evidence, then the case could not be taken away from the jury, nor a fortiori, could judgment be entered contrary to the finding. But, in the absence of this necessary evidence to make out a case to go to the jury, we have, under the rules, the fullest power to determine the question in dispute.\nIn Clark v. Molyneux,[27] which was an action for libel, the Court of Appeal, while granting a new trial, did not think it proper under the rule to enter judgment for the defendant because they thought that in a new trial further evidence of malice might be adduced. But, in the case before us, no suggestion is made that any further evidence is procurable and the case has already been tried three times.\nIn the later case of The Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty & Sons,[28] the House of Lords in sustaining the judgment of the Court of Appeal, after the case had been tried before a jury which failed to agree on a verdict, granted a motion to enter judgment for the defendant on the grounds that in their natural meaning the words complained of were not libellous; that the evidence consisting of the publication and of the circumstances attending the publication failed to show that the circular complained of had a libellous tendency and that there was no case to go to the jury.\nI am of the same opinion with respect to the libel here complained of and the mere fact that the judge left the case to the jury, who improperly found for the plaintiff, can make no difference in respect to our power to direct judgment to be entered for the defendant or to the exercise of our discretion under that power.\nIn the still later case of Nevill v. The Fine Art and General Insurance Co.[29], which was also an action for libel, the jury had found a verdict for the plaintiff, that the statement was a libel, that it was untrue and that the defendants had exceeded the privilege, but did not find actual malice, and the House of Lords on appeal directed a verdict to be entered, notwithstanding the verdict for the plaintiff\nThe only question is whether this is such a case as calls for such an exercise of our discretion. As I have already said, the case has already been tried three times with varying results, and has been already before this court on appeal[30], and it is not suggested that any new evidence can be obtained. In that appeal the late Mr. Justice King, in delivering the judgment of the court remitting the case back for a new trial, determined that the letter in question was \"clearly capable of a libellous construction,\" and that \"it could not be denied that the occasion was privileged.\" Accepting these two statements as correct law, what was the onus which lay upon the plaintiff when he went to trial? Clearly, the letter being a privileged communication, he was bound to prove actual malice. The contention here is that he has satisfied that onus by proving that the statements in the letter were not true. But I do not think that the evidence shows anything of the kind. The statements on which he relies as libellous are: first, that which says he was \"relieved\" of the agency, and secondly, that\nwe have tried for a considerable time past to get Mr. Miller to attend properly to our business and it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made.\nAnd the subsequent sentence:\nI find that he has collected money which, up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report.\nNow, no evidence of any kind was, as far as I can ascertain, offered to show the existence of any actual malice, spite or ill-feeling on the defendant's part in writing the above statements, The plaintiff relied upon his contention that they were not strictly and literally true. But I cannot agree with that contention. I think that the statements were substantially correct. The uncontradicted portion of the defendant's evidence as to what took place on the twenty-ninth of April, on his visit to Bridgetown, when the plaintiff requested him to let him have the agency again together with the correspondence put in evidence, establish, I think, quite clearly that the plaintiff was relieved of the agency for the reasons given by the defendant. The plaintiffs own evidence is conclusive as to neglect and disobedience of his orders, and it does appear to me impossible to argue successfully that between the date of his being relieved of his agency and the writing of the letter in question he had duly reported or remitted the small premiums which had been left with him for collection.\nBut suppose the language of the letter did not strictly and literally describe the facts, would that have been sufficient evidence of malice?\nNot certainly, unless to use Chief Justice Cockburn's language in Spill v. Maule[31], at page 236, 237, it was \"utterly beyond and disproportionate to the facts.\"\nHere, I think, it was not an unfair, statement of the facts as the defendant understood or had means of knowing them. The language of a privileged communication is not to be scrutinized too strictly, as was observed in Laughton v. The Bishop of Sodor and Man[32]. Once the letter is shown to have been privileged, the burden of proof is shifted. It is not then for the defendant to prove that he was acting from a sense of duty but for the plaintiff to show that the defendant was acting from some other and improper motive. \"The proper meaning of a privileged communication,\" observes Parke B. in Wright v. Woodgate[33], adopted by Lord Blackburn in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Jenoure v. Delmege[34], at page 78,\nis only this, that the occasion on which the communication was made rebuts the inference prim\u00e2 facie arising from a statement prejudicial to the character of the plaintiff and puts it upon him to prove that there was malice in fact\u2014that the defendant was actuated by motives of personal spite or ill-will independent of the occasion on which the communication was made.\nNo such evidence, nor in fact any evidence, of malice or personal spite or ill-will outside of the alleged inaccuracy of the letter was given here.\nNow I think the language of the Lord Chancellor on this point of the truth or untruth of the statements complained of, in Nevill v. The Fine Art and General Ins. Co.[35], very appropriate to this case. He says:\nBut suppose it was not true; suppose it was not accurate in the sense in which people would have understood it; I am obliged to suppose a person of a very extraordinary mind looking at this document, such as it is, for him to have misunderstood it; but, suppose he did. Suppose the persons who wrote that document intended to tell the truth and believed in the truth of what they were writing, even though, in the mind of some other person it should be inaccurate in form, it seems to me that it would be impossible to contend that that would be evidence of malice which, under the circumstances, it would be obviously necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to recover. I say obviously, for this reason: I do not think any one has contended before your lordships that the occasion was not privileged. What has been contended is that the occasion was abused. If what I have stated is true, there is no ground for saying that there was any attempt to do anything else than to make a business communication to persons who had a right to receive these communications, the secretary, on the one side, and the insurers on the other, having a common interest in respect of which it was right that these communications should be made.\nI am, therefore, strongly of the opinion that the plaintiff has not satisfied the onus which the law cast upon him of proving actual malice by the defendant, and that, having so failed, it became the duty of the judge at the trial either to nonsuit the plaintiff or to enter a judgment for the defendant. This not having been done, this court may, under the rules I have already cited, give the judgment which the court whose judgment is appealed from should have given, which, in my opinion, would be to order judgment to be entered for the defendant. Dewe v. Waterbury[36].\nAs however, several of my learned brethren entertain doubts of our power under the rule above cited to enter judgment for the defendant after verdict found for the plaintiff and no motion for nonsuit or judgment made at the trial by defendant's counsel, I will not dissent from but, in deference to their opinion, concur in the judgment allowing the appeal and granting a new trial.\nMILLS J.\u2014In this case I do not think the respondent succeeded in showing that the letter complained of was libellous. I do not think that it was an unreasonable or improper communication to write under the circumstances. In my opinion, the facts established show that the respondent failed in his duty as an agent under the appellant, and that what was charged as a libel was substantially true. I think the prosecution for libel was a vexatious proceeding and one which ought to have been dismissed, but as the matter now stands, I do not see that it is open to us to do otherwise than to send the case back for a new trial, if the respondent is so ill-advised as to venture upon trying it again.\nARMOUR J. The plaintiff, in his statement of claim, alleged (1) that he was, at the time of the publication of the letter hereinafter set out, a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, an insurance broker and agent, and also carried on business of a real estate conveyance and a lender of money entrusted to him for that purpose by a large number of people and had an extensive practice and business in the County of Annapolis and elsewhere in the Province of Nova Scotia, and was also a buyer and shipper of apples in large quantities for the English market and was (2) previously to the publication of the said letter, engaged by the defendant, who was general manager of the Confederation Life Association for the Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland, to solicit life insurances for the said association, and to collect premiums due to the said association from various policy holders in the said association and (3) that the defendant, well knowing the premises, but contriving to injure the plaintiff in his said businesses and professions, and to cause it to be believed and suspected that the plaintiff had acted improperly and dishonestly in said businesses and professions and to cause it to be suspected and to be believed that the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and ability to carry on and conduct his said businesses and professions in a proper manner, on or about the seventh day of July, A.D. 1897, in the form of a letter addressed to Mrs. Freeman, c\/o Dr. Freeman, Bridgetown, N.S., (meaning thereby, Anna Freeman, wife of Ingram B. Freeman, M.D., of Bridgetown, N.S.), falsely and maliciously wrote and published of and concerning the plaintiff in relation to his businesses and professions and the carrying on and conducting thereof by the plaintiff, the words following that is to say:\nDear Mrs. Freeman, (meaning thereby the said Anna Freeman).\u2014I think you know that at the time of my recent visit to Bridgetown. I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller (meaning thereby the plaintiff), of our local agency. As you and your husband have evidently taken a kindly interest in Mr. Miller, I might say to you, without entering into details as to the causes which compelled me to take this action, an explanation of which would hardly be appropriate here, that we have tried for a considerable time past to get Mr. Miller to attend properly to our business, and that it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made. In order to give Mr. Miller an opportunity to get the benefit of commissions on as much outstanding business as I could, I left the attention on certain matters in Mr. Miller's (meaning thereby the plaintiff) hands, on the understanding that he (meaning the plaintiff), would attend to them and remit to me as our representative. I, (meaning the defendant), now find that he (meaning the plaintiff)' has collected money which, up to the present time, we (meaning the defendant and the said association), have been unable to get him (meaning the plaintiff), to report, and I am told that he (meaning the plaintiff), is doing and saying all that he can against myself and the company. The receipt for your premium fell due May 30th, days of grace, June 30th. If you have made settlement of the premium with Mr. Miller, your policy will, of course, be maintained in force, and we shall look to him for the returns in due course, but I have thought that it would be part of the plan Mr. Miller at one time declared to me he would follow, in order to cease as much of our business as possible, that he would allow your policy to lapse through inattention. As I have thought that you would not like to have it so I am prompted to write you this letter and shall be glad if you will advise us whether or not you have made settlement with Mr. Miller. If not, what is your wish in regard to continuing the policy?\nYours truly,\nF. W. GREEN,\nManager.\nMeaning thereby that the plaintiff had collected money due the said association and had refused to report to the defendant the amounts so collected, and had converted the said sums of money to his, the plaintiff's own use, and meaning thereby that the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and in ability to carry on and conduct his said businesses and professions, and meaning thereby that the plaintiff would allow the life insurance policy of the said Anna Freeman to lapse through inattention on the part of the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was trying to injure as much as possible the business of the said association and the business reputation of the defendant.\nAnd, by a second paragraph of his statement of claim, after repeating the first and second clauses thereof, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, well knowing the premises, falsely and maliciously wrote and published of and concerning the plaintiff in his said business of a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and insurance broker and agent on or about the seventh day of July, 1897, in the form of a letter addressed to Mrs. Freeman, c\/o Dr. Freeman, Bridgetown, N.S., (meaning thereby Anna Freeman, wife of Ingram B. Freeman of Bridgetown, N.S., physician), the words following, that is to say (setting out the said letter as above), meaning thereby that the plaintiff had received money as and for premiums due the said association on terms requiring him to account for and pay the same to the defendant and had fraudulently omitted to account for or pay the same to the defendant.\nAnd, by a third paragraph in his statement of claim, after repeating the first and second clauses thereof, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, well knowing the premises, falsely and maliciously wrote and published of and concerning the plaintiff in his said business as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and insurance broker and agent, on or about the seventh day of July, 1897, in the form of a letter addressed to Mrs Freeman c\/o Dr. Freeman, Bridgetown, N.S., (meaning thereby Anna Freeman, wife of Ingram B. Freeman, of Bridgetown, N.S., Physician,) the words following that is say, (setting out the letter as above,) meaning thereby that the plaintiff had received premiums collected by him as such solicitor of the Supreme Court, and as such solicitor of life insurance for the said association, and had improperly and in violation of his duties as such solicitor of the Supreme Court and and as such solicitor for life insurance for the said association, improperly neglected and refused to inform the defendant as such general manager of such collection of premiums of insurance, and improperly neglected and refused to advise the defendant as such general manager that moneys had been paid to him for and on account of the said association, and that the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and in honour in the conduct of his said business as solicitor of the Supreme Court and that the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and honour in the conduct of the said business of an insurance broker and agent.\nThe defendant, by his statement of defence, denied all the allegations of the plaintiff and the meanings ascribed by him to the said letter, and that it contained any libel, and alleged that it was written upon a privileged occasion and was true in substance and in fact.\nThe cause was tried in October, 1901, before Mr. Justice Ritchie with a jury who found a verdict for the plaintiff and $400 damages.\nThis verdict was moved against in the court appealed from on the grounds of the reception of improper evidence and of misdirection of the learned judge who tried the cause, and the motion was dismissed by the majority of the judges who heard it and the defendant has appealed to this court. I do not see how it is possible to avoid allowing the appeal on both grounds.\nThe evidence of Mrs. Freeman as to what she understood by the letter was inadmissible, for the language of the letter was plain and unambiguous and there was no evidence that the words used in it were used otherwise than in their natural and primary sense. Dairies v. Hartley,[37] Simmons v. Mitchell.[38] And it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned in the trial by reason of the improper reception of this evidence when we find the trial judge telling the jury:\u2014\nYou have got the sense in which Mrs. Freeman understood it. She says she understood from the libel that Miller had collected money and did not pay it over and had been dismissed from the company. Do you think that is such a meaning that a reasonable person would put on that letter, reading it or hearing it? That is one question for you to decide;\nand twice subsequently in his charge referring to what Mrs. Freeman said she understood by the letter.\nThe letter was undoubtedly written on a privileged occasion, and the onus was, therefore, upon the plaintiff of proving express malice, and it was plainly, in the circumstances of this case, misdirection of the learned judge to tell the jury\nif the meaning of the first part of the letter is that he dismissed the plaintiff and you decide that he did not dismiss the plaintiff, and it was not a correct statement, that is malice beyond all doubt. The protection which he gets from the privileged occasion is all gone. He loses it entirely. The same way with the second part. If it is not true it is malicious, and his protection is taken away.\nBut the question for the jury in determining whether or not there was express malice was not whether the statements in the letter were true or false, but whether, if false, the defendant honestly believed them to be true. And it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned in the trial by reason of the misdirection on so vital a point of the case. There was no evidence whatever of any extrinsic malice; the evidence of malice, if any, was intrinsic, derivable solely from the language of the letter.\nThe letter was plain and unambiguous and meant exactly what it said, neither more nor less, and could not reasonably be taken to mean anything but what the words in their ordinary and natural meaning and according to their primary signification expressed. It did not impute any dishonesty or want of integrity or ability to the plaintiff, and was incapable of the meanings ascribed to it in the innuendoes, namely, that\nthe plaintiff had collected money due to the said association and had converted the said sums of money to his the plaintiff's own use; * * (that) the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and in ability to carry on and conduct the said businesses and professions; * * (that) the plaintiff had received money as and for premiums due the said association on terms requiring him to account for and pay the same to the defendant and had fraudulently omitted to account for or pay the same to the defendant; (and that) the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and honour in the conduct of his said business as solicitor of the Supreme Court, and that the plaintiff was lacking in integrity and honour in the conduct of the said business of an insurance broker and agent.\nWhat the letter did impute to the plaintiff was inattention and neglect of duty as agent of the association.\nTwo statements contained in the letter were relied on at the trial as being untrue and thus affording evidence of express malice, the statement \"I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller of our local agency,\" and \"I now find that he has collected money which, up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report.\"\nThe plaintiff became the local agent of the association under an agreement bearing date the 12th of September, 1890, which provided for his duties and remuneration and that it might be terminated at any time by mutual consent or by either party giving to the other one month's notice in writing.\nOn the 29th of April, 1895, the association gave notice in writing terminating the agreement from the 31st of May following and requiring their agents thereafter to come under an agreement for a different rate of remuneration which the plaintiff contended was too low, but for which he continued to act as agent continually complaining of the remuneration, saying in different communications to the defendant from time to time \"I do not think I can act as your agent under those terms\". \"I do not think you properly remunerate your local agents\". \"It has been my custom in the collections of premium notes to help parties out, but I cannot do this now with only 2\u00bd\". \"Other companies are offering as much again\". \"Other companies pay their local agents to my certain knowledge, three times as much as the C.L.A. does\". \"I regret very much that the O. L. A. cannot pay. I have become quite attached to it, I have talked the merits so long that it seems like an old friend. I realize, however, that the time has come when I have got to do one thing or the other. I will defer my resignation until I have got your statement and the business of the company with me is fairly closed up.\" \"The Confederation Life wants cheap men that have no business of their own.\" \"Properly paid I know I can do some work for a company, but when a man feels that he will not be paid for his work, he can have little heart for his business.\" \"I regret the result of our communications, and I believe it would be in the interests of C. L. A, to pay better, as it is they, the agents, of course that will do work that pays; but I have promised to help our applicants through with the payment of premiums and, consequently, cannot, in justice to them, refuse to act as local agent unless you discharge me.\" \"I do wish your company would pay better for services rendered. I would delight to spend more time in this work, but it does not pay. I am going to let things go a little longer in hopes they will see the error in their ways.\"\nThis last communication was on the 29th of March, 1897. The plaintiff had been guilty of inattention and neglect of duty as local agent of the association to such an extent as would have justified his being relieved of his agency and, on the 13th of April, 1897, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant:\nI have been away from home and have a new clerk in my office and I find that he has mislaid your report. I missed it some little time ago, but thought sure it would turn up all right, but I find now that it is lost. I am very sorry to trouble you, but accidents will happen in the best regulated families. I hope, however, that it will not put you to any serious inconvenience.\nOn the 14th of April, 1897, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff:\nYours of the 13th to hand, in response to which we enclose herewith a new copy of agents report which we shall be glad to have returned to us at your earliest convenience.\nNot having received this report the defendant went to see the plaintiff and the following is the plaintiff's account of what took place:\nIn April, 1897. Green came to my office. He introduced himself. We got the report, discussed it and fixed it up. I had lost the first form of report I received and got another. This we then filled up. I claimed $60. bonus. Green disputed it, and said it was not so much under the new agreement. It was finally settled at $26 for that time and I said I would look into it afterwards. There was then due the company $151.03. I said I had not the money here, but would give him a cheque the next morning. He found fault because it was not there. I got the money and paid him the next morning. After we got the report made up he asked me if I would continue to act as agent. I said no, not at the remuneration they offered. He said the new agreement was better than the old. I said it would not pay me. He said he would have to try and get some one else. I suggested Harry Crowe and others who I thought would accept the agency. He suggested going to Mrs. Freeman to adjust her policy and we went and stayed there some time. He called attention to a policy of Rice, and I told him that Rice had decided not to continue the policy and I had paid the premiums out of money of Rice that came into my hands from apples and could not give the date. I don't remember any conversation the next morning when I paid him the money. A day or two after wards I sent for Green and asked if he had got an agent, and he said he had got Mr. Weare. At none of these interviews was I dismissed, nor was there anything said indicating that he did not want my services.\nUnder these circumstances, it cannot be properly said that the statement 'I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller of our local agency\" was false to the knowledge of the defendant; the most that can be said of it is that it was an incorrect deduction from what took place between the plaintiff and him on the occasion of his visit to the plaintiff. If an incorrect statement, it was an incorrect statement of a matter not of the gist of the libel according to the meaning ascribed by the inuendoes to the libel, and I do not think that such an incorrect statement afforded any evidence of express malice.\nIn Nevill v. The Fine Arts and General Insurance Co[39], the action was brought for an alleged libel in a circular issued by the defendant to their policy holders stating that\nthe agency of Lord William Nevill, at 27 Charles street, St. James' Square, has been closed by the directors.\nAlternatively, the statement of claim complained of that statement as meaning that the plaintiff had been dismissed by the defendants from his employment as their agent for some reason discreditable to him. The trial judge ruled that the alleged libel was published on a privileged occasion and left to the jury the following questions; (1.) Whether the circular was a libel?\n(2.) Whether it was published falsely and maliciously?\n(3.) Whether the words meant that the plaintiff was dismissed from the defendants' employment for some reason discreditable to himself?\nThe jury answered the first question in the affirmative and assessed the damages at one hundred pounds, but they were unable to agree as to the second and third questions and, therefore, did not answer them. The learned judge, thereupon, put to the jury the further questions;\n(1.) Whether the statement in the circular that the plaintiff's agency was closed by the directors was true?\n(2.) Whether the defendants in making that statement had exceeded the privileged occasion which entitled the defendants to give a notice that the agency was at an end?\nThe jury answered the first of those questions in the negative, and the second in the affirmative. The learned trial judge entered judgment for the plaintiff, but the Court of Appeal directed judgment to be entered for the defendants on the ground that there was no evidence of malice which could reasonably be left to the jury and the House of Lords affirmed their judgment.\nThe jury had found that the statement in the circular that the plaintiff's agency was closed by the directors, which was the very gist of the libel, was not true. \"But,\" said Lord Halsbury,\nsuppose it was not true, suppose it was not accurate in the sense in which people would have understood it. I am obliged to suppose a person of very extraordinary mind looking at this document such as it is, for him to have misunderstood it. But suppose he did; suppose the persons who wrote that document intended to tell the truth and believed in the truth of what they were writing, even though, in the mind of some other person, it should be inaccurate in form, it seems to me impossible to contend that that would be evidence of malice which, under the circumstance, it would be obviously necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to recover.\nI am of opinion, however, that the deduction was correct. Looking at the correspondence which preceded the visit of the defendant to the plaintiff, and at what took place upon the occasion of that visit, I do not think it can well be said that the plaintiff terminated the agency. He was throughout the correspondence complaining of the remuneration and asking for an increase of it, and he does not, on the occasion of the defendant's visit to him, say definitely that he will not continue to act as agent, but only that he will not continue to act \"at the remuneration they offered,\" leaving it to be inferred that he would continue to act as agent if they offered an increased remuneration. The following day the defendant appointed another agent, thereby relieving the plaintiff of and terminating the agency. The fact that a day or two after the plaintiff sent for the defendant and asked him if he had got an agent leads to the inference that he did so to ascertain if he had been relieved of the agency. I think, therefore, that the statement was substantially true and, in any view of it, was quite consistent with an honest belief on the defendant's part that it was true and, therefore, afforded no evidence of malice. Spill v. Maule[40].\nLord Tenderden said that, if the evidence was such that the jury could conjecture only, but not judge, it ought to go to the jury; that the onus was on the party offering the evidence, and that he, if he offered evidence only consistent with either supposition of fact, was not entitled to have it put to the jury. Avery v. Bowdon[41].\nWhat I have said with respect to this statement is equally applicable to the statement which followed it, that he was compelled to take this action and that it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made, the fact being that the plaintiff had been guilty of inattention and of neglect of duty as an agent of the association, and that they had been unable to get him to attend promptly to their business.\nThen as to the statement:\nI now find that he has collected money which up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report.\nThe defendant on the occasion of his visit to the plaintiff left with the plaintiff certain renewal receipts and took from the plaintiff the following letter signed by the plaintiff:\nYou have left in my hands for collection and report in due course the following renewal receipts:\n36,723, Mackenzie, May 1st\n$ 21 50\n37,578, Longley (R.S.) April 25th\n17 80\n36,732, Weare, April 30th\n47 80\nPaid, 37,730, Elderkin, April 30th\n46 70\nNote for first premium, 38,194, Morse, May 15th.\n23 00\n$156 80\nAfterwards the defendant sent to the plaintiff a renewal receipt for Mrs. Freeman.\nOn the 25th of each month the association supplied, through the defendant, to the plaintiff (as well as to other agents), a blank form of report which it was the plaintiff's duty to fill up and return on the fifth of the following month with remittances. The important part of this report was a statement of the payments received and of the dates when they were so received, and it is obvious that the making of such reports and punctuality in making them were essential to the proper carrying on of the business of the association.\nUp to the time of the writing of the letter complained of, the plaintiff never made any report to the defendant as he had undertaken by his letter to do, although he had been supplied with blank forms for that purpose and although a reminder in the following form, your monthly report which should have been returned by you on the fifth instant has not yet come to hand. Will you kindly give the matter immediate attention? Report should be returned punctually whether collections have been completed or not,\nwas sent to him on the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 15th, June, 1897.\nIt is true that on the 30th May, 1897, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant a letter which contained the following:\nI received your returns and will forward soon as I have received my $17.80 on account and am holding same for your corrected statements between us.\nIn a letter of the fourth of June, 1897, from the defendant to the plaintiff', the following appears:\nAs this explains fully the point you have raised, we trust you will send in your returns for the current month as promptly as we have given attention to this.\nIn a letter of the 19th of June, 1897, from the defendant to the plaintiff the following appears, after a proposition to submit the matter in dispute between them to arbitration:\nOn this understanding, I trust you will see your way to send us in immediately all remittances of whatever collections you have made up to the present time and full report on other items.\nOn the 25th of June, 1897, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant:\nI cannot accept your proposal for an arbitration in this matter.\nAnd, on the 2nd of July, 1897, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff:\nYours of the 25th to hand in which you say that you cannot accept our proposal for an arbitration. In view of this, I think the least you can do is to send us remittances for the premiums you have collected. I think you will remember that it was upon this understanding that I left these different premium matters with you for attention.\nOn the 13th of July, 1897, the plaintiff made a report and settled with the defendant, according to the defendant's contention, as follows: To total premiums, first year, as per column\n$17.80\nCr.\nBy commission on first year premiums\n$ 1.78\nPostage\n1.60\nDraft marked cheque P. O. Order to balance\n14.42\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$17.80\nThe Longley premium of $17.80 was paid about the 25th of May, 1897, and the defendant supposed that the $17.80 mentioned in the plaintiff's letter of 30th May, 1897, was the Longley premium, although the letter did not say so. But this letter could not be treated as a report and the plaintiff did not consider that it was, for, in the same letter, he says \"I received your returns and will forward soon,\" and he had not remitted the $17.80 when the letter complained of was written.\nThe statement that\nI now find that he has collected money which, up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report,\nwas, therefore, substantially true and afforded no evidence of malice.\nOn considering the evidence in this case we cannot see that the jury would have been justified in finding that the defendant acted maliciously. It is true that the facts proved are consistent with the presence of malice as well as with its absence. But this is not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the question of malice left to the jury; for the existence of malice is consistent with the evidence in all cases except those in which something inconsistent with malice in shown in evidence; so that to say that in all cases where the evidence was consistent with malice it ought to be left to the jury, would be, in effect, to say that the jury might find malice in any case in which it was not disproved, which would be inconsistent with the admitted rule that in cases of privileged communications malice must be proved and, therefore, its absence must be presumed until such proof is given. It is certainly not necessary in order to enable a plaintiff to have the question of malice submitted to the jury, that the evidence should be such as necessarily leads to the conclusion that malice existed or that it should be inconsistent with the non-existence of malice, but it is necessary that the evidence should raise a probability of malice and be more consistent with its existence than with its non-existence. Sommerville v. Hawkins[42]; Taylor v. Hawkins[43].\nThe malice that will deprive a communication of this sort of excuse arising out of the occasion of the speaking of the words must he such as to induce the court or any reasonable person to conclude that the occasion has been taken advantage of to give utterance to an ungrounded charge. Manby v. Witt[44].\nThe occasion here was privileged and then the words, however hasty or untrue, if spoken bon\u00e2 fide in an honest belief of their truth are within the protection of the law. The rule as to this privilege would be altogether illusory if the judge were to leave to the jury every slight circumstance which could be suggested by the ingenuity of counsel as establishing an actual active spite. It is the duty of the judge when the communication is prim\u00e2 facie privileged, to be satisfied that some substantial circumstance is proved to show that the defendant has spoken maliciously. Caulfield v. Whitworth[45].\nCarefully considering the whole case and that the letter complained of was written on a privileged occasion, I am of the opinion that there was no evidence which could reasonably be left to the jury, and that the only course open to us is to allow the appeal, for we cannot, as I had hoped, make a final disposition of the case, for order 57, rule 5, of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, applies only to cases tried by a judge without a jury, and order 38, rule 10, to cases tried with a jury.\nSee order 37, rule 1, and order 57, rule 1.\nThe appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs here and in the court appealed from and a new trial had between the parties.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

R. 11 K, B1. 477) affirmed, the Chief Justice and Mills J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side ([1]), on a criminal case reserved affirming the conviction of the appellant for perjury, and the sentence pronounced against him upon such conviction in the Court of King's Bench, Crown side, for the District of Beauharnois.\nThe offence of perjury of which the appellant was convicted was committed upon the hearing of and information for trespass under article 5551 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, upon lands situate in the County of Huntingdon in the District of Beauharnois. The information was laid and the case heard and decided before the Recorder of Valleyfield, who was ex officio a Justice of the Peace in and for the whole of the District of Beauharnois, but did not reside in the County of Huntingdon where the offence was charged to have been committed and was therefore without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint in consequence of the provisions of article 5561 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec limiting the jurisdiction in such matters to one or more Justices of the Peace residing in the county in which the offence has been committed.\nThe questions raised on this appeal are stated in the judgment, now reported.\nWilson for the appellant.\nDuncan McCormick K.C. for the Crown.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).-This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench at Montreal reported in volume 11, at page 477 of the Rapports Judiciaires de Qu\u00e9bec. I would allow it and quash the conviction in question for the reasons given by W\u00fcrt\u00e9le and Blanchet JJ., loc. cit. which to my mind are irrefutable.\nIt could not but be conceded as it has been unanimously by the judges in the court \u00e2 quo, and by the respondent (private prosecutor) at bar, that the Recorder had no jurisdiction over the case wherein the appellant is alleged to have committed perjury. Secs. 24 and 26 of the Quebec Interpretation Act, declaratory of the common law enact that :\nWhen anything is ordered to be done by or before a judge, magistrate, functionary or public officer, one is understood whose powers or jurisdiction extend to the place where such thing is to be done; and\nWhenever an oath is ordered to be taken or received such oath is received by any judge or magistrate authorized to that effect having jurisdiction in the place where the oath is taken.\nThen art 5561 of the Revised Statutes expressly deprives the recorder of any jurisdiction in the case in question. The proceedings before him were not judicial proceedings, because he was not a judge or magistrate, quoad the case. He was not, it is admitted, a magistrate de jure. Neither could he have been at Valleyfield, not being a resident of the County of Huntingdon, a magistrate de facto, any more than if he had been sitting at Toronto or at Vancouver. A de facto officer's jurisdiction cannot be territorially more extensive than the de jure one whose functions he assumes. Where the statute expressly enacts that only the magistrates residing in the County of Huntington have jurisdiction over the case there cannot have been outside of that county whether in the same district or a thousand miles from it, a de facto magistrate having any reasonable pretence to jurisdiction. The respondent's contention that a magistrate de facto can exercise jurisdiction in any case at a place where the statute expressly decrees that there can be no magistrate de jure in that case is untenable. A magistrate de facto cannot have more powers than a magistrate de jure. The proceedings before the Recorder at Valleyfield were not only voidable but were void of a nullity of non esse. As is said in the civil law, defectus potestatis, nullitas nullitatum. No plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict could be based on his decision. No appeal was necessary to set it aside; Attorney General v. Hotham ([2]); and a writ of certiorari to have it quashed could have been granted though taken away by the statute (sec. 5579) if he had had jurisdiction. Had he committed any one for contempt for not answering his summons as a witness or for refusing to answer his questions, his warrant would not have been worth the paper it would have been written upon, besides rendering him liable in damages. Nay under sec. 153 of the Code, he was perhaps guilty of an indictable offence for having illegally received the appellant's oath. There was, in law, no oath taken before him, for he had not the power in that case to receive any. And if there was no oath, no judicial oath, how can there have been perjury? The respondent's contention that section 145 of the .Act bears the construction that there may be perjury where there is no judicial oath is irrational and untenable. Such an incongruity cannot have been intended by Parliament. In fact that section, as I read it, plainly says that it is only when the false oath is received by a competent tribunal, or in other words by a person duly authorized to hold the judicial proceeding in which it is taken, that it is indictable for perjury. The words upon which the court below rely to hold the contrary are those of the last part of that sec. 145 which read as follows :\nOr before any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal, having power to hold such judicial proceeding, whether duly constituted or not, and whether the proceeding was duly instituted or not before such court or person so as to authorize it or him to hold the proceeding, and although such proceeding was held in a wrong place, or was otherwise invalid.\nNow, if the words \" having power to hold such judicial proceeding \" are read immediately after the word \"person,\" as by the punctuation they must be, they qualify the rest of the section and the oath must have been received, in any case, by one having the power to hold the judicial proceeding. And that they must be so read is rendered free from doubt by referring to the French version, which is the law just as much as the English version, though not brought to the attention of the court below nor of this court.\nThat reads as follows:\nOu devant une personne agissant comme cour, juge ou tribunal, autoris\u00e9e a faire cette proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, qu'il soit l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9 ou non, et que la proc\u00e9dure ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement institu\u00e9e ou non devant cette cour ou personne de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 l'autoriser \u00e0 faire la proc\u00e9dure, et lors m\u00eame que la proc\u00e9dure aurait eu lieu dans une localit\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle n'aurait pas d\u00fb avoir lieu, ou qu'elle f\u00fbt invalide sous d'autres rapports.\nThere is no ambiguity in these words. It is undoubtedly to an oath taken before any person having power to hold the judicial proceeding wherein that oath was taken that the rest of the section exclusively applies, and of two possible constructions in one of the versions that one which reconciles the two must be followed. So that the words \"having power to hold such judicial proceeding\" in the English version must be read as applied to the word person therein, as the corresponding words in the French version unquestionably must be. Here, it is conceded, the Recorder had no more power to hold the judicial proceeding in question than a citizen of the United States or of China would have had, or than he, himself, would have had if he had held his court in New York or Pekin.\nIt is, therefore, still the law that\nno oath whatsoever taken before persons * * * who are legally authorized to administer some kind of oaths, but not those which happen to be taken before them * * * can ever amount to perjury in the eye of the law, because they are of no manner of force, but are altogether idle. 1 Hawk. P. C. Bk. 1, c. 69, s. 4.\nSection 145 of the Code must be restricted to voidable, not to void, proceedings, to judicial, not to extra judicial oaths as this one was. And an oath administered at a place without his territorial jurisdiction by an officer authorized to administer oaths is absolutely void.\nThe court a quo in its formal judgment seems to rely upon the fact that the appellant's oath in question was taken before a tribunal of his own selection. I fail to see how that can affect the question of the Recorder's jurisdiction, and why the appellant could be convicted of perjury if any other witness in the case could not have been. For the appellant could not either impliedly or expressly confer upon that magistrate a jurisdiction which the statute exclusively vests in the magistrates of the County of Huntingdon When it is the jurisdiction of the person that is deficient a party who invokes the jurisdiction of a court is not thereafter as a general rule allowed to question it but that is not so when the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, or has no lawful power to act by reason of the fact that, as in this case, such power is expressly withheld by the statute, which expressly decrees (sec. 5561 E. S. Q.) that no other magistrates than those residing in the county where the trespass was committed, have jurisdiction over it, thereby in unambiguous terms taking away from this recorder any jurisdiction that he might perhaps otherwise have had over the case.\nSEDGEWICK, GIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by his Lordship Mr. Justice Armour.\nMILLS J (dissenting).\u2014My conclusions in this case are so entirely in accord with those of Mr. Justice W\u00fbrt\u00e8le in the court below that I might have contented myself with concurring in his opinions, and in the reasoning by which he has supported them. I accept his views of the law applicable to this case, as he has expressed them; but, as I find that some of my brethren in this court concur in the judgment of the majority of the court below, I feel it my duty to state with some degree of fulness the opinions which I entertain upon the subject.\nThe principles of the common law in respect to perjury have long been well settled; but some of the decisions in relation to this offence lie very close to the border line which separates those cases which have been held to be wilful and corrupt perjury from another class which may be punished as contempts of court or as misdemeanors, but which cannot be reached under the law relating to perjury.\nSome of the cases in which the parties accused have been convicted of false swearing have been sometimes questioned, because it was doubted whether the principles of the law of perjury were strictly applicable, because when analysed, some of the elements which go to make up the crime of perjury seemed to be wanting There were nevertheless cases in which the parties had sworn falsely, and for which the presiding judge felt very strongly that the offender, in the interest of society, deserved punishment; and so a construction was given to the law in order that the offender might be reached, which seemed to go beyond the principles which had been before accepted and acted upon, and its applicability to these cases was sometimes thought open to question. So, when it was proposed here to codify the Criminal Law, a section was inserted to embody the law of these cases, and to remove any doubt, if doubt previously existed, that they lay within the borders of the crime of perjury, and the law was made clear, where before it might have been regarded, by a thoughtful student of its principles as doubtful, by including them within the definition it only requires an examination of these cases, and the provisions of section 145 of the Code, to see that the framers of the section aimed at making the definition of perjury cover the whole ground embraced within the decisions of the courts upon the subject.\nI think it is only necessary to consider the system of jurisprudence as the common law made it, and as those cases extended it in order to obtain a clear view, and to form a right appreciation of the interpretation of section 145 of the Code. We have to consider, in this case, a question of perjury committed before a tribunal that had no right whatever to try the cause then before it; that had no more power to adjudicate upon the question of trespass where it was laid, than a judge of Quebec would have to try a cause in the Province of Ontario; and it would require a very clear declaration in the statute to satisfy me that it was the intention of Parliament to clothe a self-constituted tribunal that had no existence in law, with the dignity, and surround it with the protection, which attaches to the proceedings of one properly created under the authority of the State, for the purpose of discharging important public duties. We have here a magistrate acting as such in one county, clothed by the law with the necessary power to act in such matters only in another county and we have a witness before him in this illegal and void proceeding, which he had no right to institute, charged with perjury, and put upon his trial for that offence, and convicted, for testimony given before one who was wholly without judicial authority, sitting as a court which, in law, had no legal existence. All the importance, and all the protection which it is the policy of the law to bestow on the proceedings of a judicial tribunal, clothed with legal authority, has, by the proceeding in this case, been extended to one that has neither in fact nor in law, any jurisdiction.\nWhere a limited tribunal whether that limitation is due to the fact that the power has been generally withheld or whether it is due to the fact that it is sitting outside of the territorial limits of its jurisdiction, takes upon itself to exercise judicial functions which do not belong to it its decision amounts to nothing, its proceedings are void, there can be no appeal from its judgment, and the false testimony given before it does not constitute the offence of perjury. ([3]) Yet in this case, it has been held that a false oath taken before one who has assumed judicial functions which he did not possess, instead of being regarded as an absolutely void proceeding is nevertheless valid so far as to subject the witness to punishment for perjury. Such a recognition is altogether at variance with the settled principles of the criminal law for it gives to the proceedings of an illegal body the same degree of protection and dignity that it bestows upon a legal tribunal engaged in the discharge of its public duties.\nNo appellate court could, in a civil action, recognize such a tribunal by entertaining an appeal from its judgment, and no more should any appellate tribunal recognise the proceedings had before a magistrate sitting as a judge outside of his territorial jurisdiction, and having no authority in law to investigate and decide the question in respect to which he has ignorantly usurped judicial authority. ([4])\nThere are some cases of false swearing which the common law regards as perjury; there are some cases of false swearing which cannot be tried and punished as such. The distinction rests upon well settled principles of jurisprudence which, in this regard, embody the underlying principles of the system. What is, and what is not, perjury at common law can be easily traced and clearly ascertained by its students. But at every step we observe the line of distinction between law and ethics. Law as Lord Stowell has well observed has embodied and adopted the principles of ethics to a limited, extent ! it travels with them only a certain distance, and stops there. You are not at liberty to go further and say the general speculation would support you in a further progress. It is upon this rule that the law has defined and limited the crime of perjury; and if we were to extend it, so as to go beyond the requirements of the State, we might convert a salutary provision, into a means of vexatious persecution. Care must be taken not to sacrifice restrictions, justified by experience, to what may be regarded as a commendable desire to restrain falsehood outside of those matters that are being judicially investigated. Neither the courts of law nor the bar desire to break down the distinction recognized, between falsehood sworn to in the course of justice in a case which is being legally investigated and tried, and falsehood in every other circumstance The distinction is one made by the law and founded upon reason and experience, and which has given to the common law, to some extent, its symmetrical features, and makes it capable of being expounded on principles of right reason, which were said by its votaries to be the perfection of the law, and I am not prepared to so interpret an Act of Parliament as to mar those features, without any adequate reason.\nThe criminal law never undertook to embrace within its boundaries the whole field of human conduct and to punish every wrong which one person might do to another as a crime. A large number of offences have been left with each individual, within the limits of the law, to redress for himself. He may decline to deal with a cheat, or to have any intercourse with a man who has wronged him. The law does not undertake to regulate these matters, because each person has adequate means of punishing the wrongdoer without recourse to the law at all. And so there may be many moral offences which the law does not punish because the best interests of society would not be advanced by meddling with them as public offences.\nThe courts have undertaken, by their decisions, to draw the line in respect of false swearing and to determine what false oaths should be punished as perjury, and what kind of false swearing should not fall within the limits of that offence.\nPerjury (as defined by Hawkins), is a wilful false oath, by one who being lawfully required. to depose to the truth in any proceeding in the course of justice swears absolutely, in a matter of some consequence, to the point in question, whether he be believed or not ([5]).\nMr. Bishop in his work on Criminal Law defines perjury to be\nthe wilful giving under oath, in a judicial proceeding, or course of justice, of false testimony material to the issue, or point of inquiry ([6]).\nWe have to consider the tribunal before which an oath is taken; the question of materiality of the evidence to the issue * the testimony as being false; the intent of the witness and other matters. The common law required that the oath should be administered in some judicial proceeding, or course of justice, which must be taken in the way directed by the law, and before an officer who is legally authorised to administer it. I do not think that section 145 of our Code has made any alteration in the law of perjury in this particular. It is generally admitted that where a statute sets out a form of oath required that the statute is directory, and will be sufficiently complied with when followed in substance ; so that if what is sworn to is not true, it will not exempt the person taking it from being convicted for perjury. But if the words of the statute are wholly disregarded no perjury can be assigned, though the oath should be false. The first thing to be noted is that the oath must be one required in the course of justice, or in some judicial proceeding, and must be taken substantially as directed by the law, before an officer authorised to administer it If a party in a cause becomes a witness for himself under circumstances in which his testimony is not by the law receivable, it has been held that he may nevertheless, commit perjury, and this seems to be an extension of his responsibility beyond the limits which a strict adherence to the principle upon which perjury rests would warrant; and so, where one is not a legal and competent witness in a case, hut is nevertheless admitted as a witness by the court and testifies wilfully and corruptly to what is false, he commits perjury ([7]). In the United States courts, where the principles of the common law in respect to crime have been followed it has been held that where one swears falsely as to his residence, in an application for naturalisation it is not perjury because the Act of Congress expressly provides that the oath of the applicant shall, in no case, be allowed to prove his residence and so his own testimony cannot, under the authority of the law, be a legal part of the proceeding ([8]).\nThe same principle prevails in the English decisions. In the case of the Reg. v. Stone ([9]) it was held that where a Master in Chancery had no authority to administer oaths to witnesses before the Court of Admiralty, the conviction for perjury in an affidavit used in the Court of Admiralty, but sworn to before a Master in Chancery, could not be supported.\nPollock C. B. said :\nThe conviction must be quashed. The affidavit upon which perjury is assigned is sworn before a Master Extraordinary in Chancery who has no authority by virtue of his commission to administer an oath before the Court of Admiralty, nor does the practice of the Court of Admiralty, in an action upon an affidavit so sworn, convey any authority\nAnd Parke B. said:\nThe authority of a Master in Chancery has relation entirely to matters before the Court of Chancery. Although the Court of Chancery may have a certain jurisdiction over the Court of Admiralty, yet the latter court, acting as a Court of Admiralty, is independent of the Court of Chancery, and a Master. Extraordinary is not a person having authority to administer oaths in the Admiralty Court. If a man knowing the practice of the court uses an affidavit sworn in this manner, knowing it to be false, he is guilty of contempt of court, but it is not perjury.\nIn the case of The Queen v. Tyson ([10]) the question of the materiality of the evidence came before the Court for Crown Cases Reserved. One Sullivan was tried for robbery. Tyson swore that \u00a1Sullivan had lived in a certain house for the last two years and that he had never been absent from it more than two nights during that time. The Warden at the House of Correction at Wandsworth was called as a witness in the case and testified that the \"prisoner Sullivan was in the prison at Wandsworth during twelve months of the time that Tyson had sworn that he was elsewhere. Kelly C. B. said :\nThe real question is whether these statements were material. We all agree that they were, as they tended to render more probable the truth of the first allegation,\nBramwell B. said :\nThe witness was asked his reason for remembering, and thereupon he proceeded to state those circumstances which made him competent to swear to the cardinal matter. One of these circumstances is untrue : why is that not perjury?\nLush J. said :\nI was embarrassed at first; but now I am quite satisfied that the allegations on which the prisoner was convicted were calculated to make the jury give a readier credit to the substantial part of his evidence and therefore became material. In this case the materiality of what is sworn to does not depend on its intrinsic importance in respect to the facts of the case, but upon the purpose for which it was sworn to. ([11])\nIn the case of the Queen v. Smith, ([12]) reported in the same volume as Tue Queen v. Tyson ([13]) the prisoner was convicted for perjury alleged to have been committed on the hearing of an information before two Justices of the Peace, on an application for an order of affiliation. The prisoner was tried before Cockburn C. J. at the Leicester Assizes for perjury which was alleged to have been committed upon the hearing of an application for an order as stated The information laid by the mother was duly proved; and it was shown that the putative father appeared before the Justices, and evidence was given on both sides. The court held that the father having appeared, and not having made any objections to the summons, it was not necessary to refer to it, or give any evidence of its existence on the trial for perjury. It was proved that Mee appeared before the Justices, and that upon the hearing of the information, the evidence, which was the subject matter of the indictment, was given by Smith who was called as a witness by Mee; but the summons was not produced on the trial of \u00a1Smith nor was secondary evidence given of its contents, nor was it proved that such summons had been served on Mee. Kelly C. B. delivered the judgment of the court. He said :\nIn this case though there was no summons produced, the information was put in and proved, and it was shown that, upon the hearing of the information before the justices evidence on both sides was given, and that the prisoner gave the evidence which was the subject matter of the indictment for perjury. Was there any necessity to produce the summons? The original object of the summons was to bring Mee into court. He did appear and no objection was then made to the summons. There was no necessity at the trial for perjury to refer to it and, therefore, it was unnecessary to give any evidence of it.\nIn the same volume the case of the Queen v. Fletcher ([14]) is reported. Here Jane Beswick made a deposition upon oath, and the question was whether, in order to give the magistrate jurisdiction in the case, there should be a deposition in writing upon oath. The case had been tried at the Assizes in the county of Derby, before Cleasby B. In the judgment of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, Boville C. J. said :\nThe objection now taken is that the summons was irregularly issued, because there was no sufficient deposition on oath before it was issued. It has been suggested that under the section in question (7 & 8 Vict. c. 101 s. 3) there must be a written statement on oath\u2014in fact an affidavit\u2014by the woman but I think at any rate an oral statement, taken down in writing in the usual way in which depositions are taken, must be sufficient\u00bb Jervis' Act being later in time, can not apply here, but certainly more than that Act prescribes cannot be required. The second Act referred to (8 Vict c 10, s. 1), does not affect the case. That Act only says that proceedings according to the forms in the schedule or to the like tenor and effect shall be valid and sufficient; it does not say that these forms must be used. Then, if all that the Act requires be that the magistrates shall make a record of the evidence orally given, the summons itself seems to me very like a writing to the same tenor and effect with a form of deposition in the schedule of the second Act.\nThe Chief Justice after referring to the case of the Queen v. Berry, ([15]) goes on to say :\nThe case was therefore precisely the same as the present; and all the judges composing the court, except my brother Martin, after taking time to consider, held that the conviction ought to be affirmed? on the ground that the defendant by appearing and not objecting had waived any irregularity in the issue of the summons.\nAnd Blackburn J. said, after discussing certain features of the case *\nIf either of these things be omitted, it is an irregularity for which the magistrate or his clerk is blameable, but it does not oust the jurisdiction I think if these things were left out altogether the proceeding on the summons would none the less be good. But however this may be, the irregularity may be and was waived by the d\u00e9pendant\u2019s appearing and not objecting.\nIn the case of the Queen v. Johnson ([16]), the perjnry alleged was committed by false oaths taken before one Thomas Deane, who held an inquest as deputy coroner touching* the death of one Owen O'Hanlon. By 6 & 7 Vict. c. 83, s. 1, it is made lawful for any coroner of any county, city, riding, liberty or division, and he is thereby directed, by writing under his hand and seal to nominate and appoint, from time to time, a fit and proper person, such appointment being subject to the approval of the Lord High Chancellor, Lord keeper, or Lord Commissioners of the Great Seal, to act for him as his deputy in the holding of inquests; and all inquests taken and other acts performed by any such deputy coroner, under or by virtue of any such appointment, shall be deemed, and taken to all intents and purposes whatsoever to be, the acts and deeds of the coroner by whom such appointment was made. Provided also that no such deputy shall act for any such coroner as aforesaid except it were through the illness of the said coroner, or during his absence from any lawful and reasonable cause. In this case it was contended, on behalf of the prisoner, that the proceeding before the said Thomas Deane was coram, non judice, because it was incumbent on the prosecution, in order to show jurisdiction in a deputy coroner, to administer an oath, to prove affirmatively that there was lawful and reasonable cause for the absence of the coroner and that the facts here did not amount to any evidence of such cause. He also contended that the question was one for the jury, and not for the judge. The counsel for the Crown argued that even if the facts proved were insufficient to show that there was lawful or reasonable cause \u00a1still inasmuch as by section 2 of the same Act it is provided that the inquisitions are not to be quashed by reason of their having been taken by deputy, the oath on which perjury was assigned being an oath on which a good inquisition might have been founded could not be said to be coram non judice, but was one legally administered in a judicial proceeding, and, therefore, one on which perjury could be legally assigned. The first question of law reserved for the opinion of the court was, whether it was incumbent upon the prosecution to make out that there was lawful or reasonable cause for the absence of the coroner from the inquest in question. If not the conviction would stand.\nThe second question reserved was whether it was for the judge or jury to decide the question of reasonable cause. If for the jury the conviction must be quashed, unless the first question was decided in the negative. If for the judge, then the third question reserved was whether there was evidence upon which the learned judge might properly decide as he did. If so the conviction would stand. If not it must be quashed, unless the first question was decided in the negative. The court were of opinion that the conviction should be affirmed. They held that it was clearly for the judge to determine the question of the existence of reasonable and lawful cause for the coroner's absence.\nIn Caudle v Seymour ([17]) a warrant issued by justices was held bad which did not show any information upon oath upon which it had been issued. Coleridge J. said, during the argument :\nA man has no right, because he is a magistrate to order another to be taken for an offence over which he has jurisdiction without a charge regularly made. In the Case of Turner v. The Postmaster General ([18]), parties were apprehended, and. brought before a magistrate charged with setting fire to the letters in the pillar box. On their appearance at the Petty Sessions to answer the charges after witnesses had been examined, and cross-examined, they were, at the application of a prosecutor, remanded on bail for a week. At the adjourned sessions the attorney for the prosecution stated that he should proceed against the appellants under the statute 24 & 25 Vict. ch. 97 s. 52 and asked their attorneys whether they would plead guilty to such a charge, or whether further evidence should be offered and supported; they answered that he must go on and prove his case. He called witnesses, and when the case for the prosecution was closed the appellants' counsel objected that no information on oath had been taken, as the statute required, and the appellants were not found committing the offence, and were not legally in custody, and therefore the justices had no jurisdiction to convict them for the offence then charged. The offence with which the appellants were first charged was a felony; the offence of which they were convicted was punishable on summary conviction. The court held that the want of information and summons was cured by the appearance of the appellants before the justices, and that they had waived the objection that they were not legally in custody on the charge under section 52, and, therefore, the justices had jurisdiction to convict them. But on both occasions of their appearance before the justices the facts alleged against them were the same, . and though they were brought up to discharge their bail, other circumstances show that they appeared voluntarily on this charge; the magistrates were, there fore, justified in convicting them on the charge which had been so made and heard. Cockburn C. J. said :\nAll that they could have asked for was, that in point of strict form the evidence should have been taken again on the first charge, and that evidence in support of that charge only should be received. Practically, that was done. They were irregularly brought before the magistrate. In strictness, they were entitled to insist that there should be information and summons, but they waived that, and crossexamined the witnesses and exercised all their rights as defendants on the first charge; after that, they can not object that the justice had no jurisdiction to convict them summarily.\nIn the cases where there has been a waiver of some irregularity in the mode of summoning which was used, (it is perhaps hardly correct to use the expression waiver), a justice can only proceed lawfully where he has jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction may be given by the appearance of the party, before the judge, to answer the charge. The jurisdiction may not depend upon the warrant; this may be improperly issued, but if the accused party appears before the magistrate without objection, he can hardly after a regular inquiry, and after an order for his commitment, take objection to the fact by complaining that he has not been brought regularly before the justices. In the case of the Queen v. Hughes ([19]), the charge was made orally that Hughes had sworn falsely and corruptly. The warrant is not the charge, it is a means of procuring the attendance of Hughes to answer it. And the want of an information on summons might be cured by the appearance of Hughes. It is the duty of the magistrate to take all charges, of whatsoever nature, kind or connection they may be, in writing, and this, Lord Mansfield says, is an indispensable duty.\nIn the case of the Queen v. Hughes (1), Lopes J. thought the warrant was a mere process for bringing the party complained of before the justices, and had nothing to do with the question of their jurisdiction. Hawkins J. said :\nI have assumed as a fact, from the case taken, that Stanley was arrested and brought before the justices upon as illegal a warrant as ever was issued. A warrant signed by a magistrate, not only without any information or oath to justify it, but without any information at all. It follows that the magistrate who issued the warrant, and the defendant who with knowledge of its illegality executed it, were liable for an action for false imprisonment. He was brought into the presence of a magistrate to answer a charge which, up to that moment, had never been legally preferred against him. Before those magistrates, and in his presence, the charge was made, over which, if duly made, they had jurisdiction. Upon that charge and in support of it it was that the defendant was sworn and in giving his evidence swore corruptly and falsely * * * They convicted him of an offence with which he had never legally been charged. In this, I am of opinion they were wrong; and upon this ground I am strongly inclined to think the conviction may be quashed,\nIt would be contrary to the settled rule, recognised in the interpretation of statutes, to make any alteration in the Common Law further or otherwise than the Act under consideration expressly declares (1) and I do not think that section 145 of the Criminal Code has made so radical a departure in the common law rule, as to make a false oath in a judicial proceeding, before one having no authority, wilful and corrupt perjury. This section begins with a definition of perjury, and it then states the circumstances under which it may be committed.\nBy section 145, perjury is defined to be\nan assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial proceeding, as a part of his evidence, upon oath or affirmation, whether such evidence is given in open court, or by affidavit, or otherwise, and whether such evidence is material or not such assertion being known to such witness to be false, and being intended by him to mislead the court, jury, or person holding the proceeding.\n(1) Hardcastle's Construction trict v. Hill, 6 App. Cas. 193 at p. and Effect of Statutory Law pp. 203; R. v. Morris L.R.l, C.C.R. 90. 138,139; Metropolitan Asylum, Dis- Evidence in this section includes evidence given on the voir dire, and evidence given before a Grand Jury. This is the first part of the section. It is necessary that the witness be a witness in a judicial proceeding. There are two departures from the common law rule; the first is that one may be convicted of perjury on immaterial evidence and the second relates to the voir dire * the old rule was that an untrue statement which was not material could not subject the one who gave it to conviction of perjury and one who is examined on the voir dire could not be contradicted, as the question of competence was a collateral question. Subsection 2 of section 145 reads :\nThat every person is a witness within the meaning of this section who actually gives his evidence, whether he is competent to be a witness or not and. whether his evidence was admissible or not\nThis subsection does not enlarge the boundaries of the common law jurisdiction but is in strict accordance with the precedents which embrace the principle here laid down.\nSubsection 3 is as follows :\nEvery proceeding is judicial within the meaning of this section which is held in or under the authority of any Court of Justice, or before a Grand Jury or before either the Senate or House of Commons in Canada or any Committee of either the Senate or House of Commons, or before any Legislative Council, Legislative Assembly, or House of Assembly, or any Committee thereof empowered by law to administer an oath or before any Justice of the Peace or any Arbitrator or Umpire or any person or body of persons, authorised by law or by any statute in force for the time being, to make an inquiry, and take evidence therein on oath or before any legal tribunal by which any legal right or liability can be established, or before any person acting as a Court, Justice, or Tribunal, having power to hold such judicial proceeding, whether duly competent or not, or whether the proceeding is duly instituted or not, before such Courts or person, so as to authorise it or him to hold a proceeding, and although such proceeding was held in a wrong place, or was otherwise invalid.\nI omit from consideration the provisions of this subsection relating to perjury committed before any of the legislative bodies or committees thereof, empowered to take evidence upon oath, and look solely at those provisions relating to perjury committed in respect to evidence taken before the other parties described in this subsection. Now it will be seen that, leaving out legislative bodies with their committees, the section deals only with evidence taken in judicial proceedings, before persons legally competent to hold them, for the purpose for which the proceeding is had. A definition is given of what a judicial proceeding is within the meaning of this section * it is a Justice of the Peace Arbitrator, Umpire, or any person or body of persons, authorised by law or by any statute in force for the time being, to make inquiry and to take evidence therein upon oath. In other words, any of the parties mentioned must be authorised by law to exercise jurisdiction over the subject matter of the inquiry, and to take the evidence of witnesses upon oath. The proceeding must be a legal proceeding, having the sanction of the law behind it * but beside these the proceeding may be before any legal tribunal by which any legal right or liability can be established, or before any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal, having power to hold such judicial proceeding. if he has such power, then any irregularity in the constitution of the court, or any irregularity in the proceedings of the court, as in the common law cases to which I have referred, will not exempt one who has been duly sworn and has given false testimony from being convicted of perjury, but there is nothing in any part of this section which would surround with like protection the proceedings of one who is not a Justice of the Peace, or one who is not clothed with judicial authority and who is not authorised to make an inquiry with the sanctions which attach to the proceedings of a legally constituted court. I, therefore, hold that the decision of the court below should be reversed and that Drew should he discharged, as not legally guilty of the crime of perjury for which he stands convicted.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nARMOUR J.\u2014The defendant charged one Benjamin J. Rowe before L. J. Papineau, the recorder of the Town of Salaberry, of Valleyfield, with having entered upon his land without his permission contrary to the provision of article 5551 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nThis charge was, by article 5561 of the said statutes, made cognizable before one or more justices of the peace, but such justices should only have jurisdiction when they resided in the county in which the offence had been committed.\nThe offence charged was committed in the County of Huntingdon, and the recorder, although ex justice of the peace in and for the district of Beauharnois, in which district the County of Huntingdon was situate, did not reside in the County of Huntingdon, but in the County of Beauharnois.\nThe defendant was convicted of perjury committed by him upon the hearing of the said charge and the question is whether or not he was rightly convicted, the recorder not having jurisdiction over the offence charged.\nAnd this question is determinable by determining whether or no the hearing of this charge by the recorder was a judicial proceeding within the meaning of that phrase as used in section 145 of the Criminal Code, which provides that every proceeding is judicial within the meaning of that section which is held before any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal having power to hold such judicial proceeding whether duly constituted or not, and whether the proceeding was duly instituted or not before such court or person so as to authorise it or him to hold the proceeding and although such proceeding was held in a wrong place or was otherwise invalid\nThe recorder was a justice, hut in hearing the said charge he was not a justice having power to hold such judicial proceeding, but he was acting as a justice having power to hold such judicial proceeding and his hearing the said charge was, therefore, a judicial proceeding within the meaning of that phrase as used in section 145 of the Criminal Code and the defendant was rightly convicted.\nThe provision above quoted was taken from section 119 of the draft code prepared by the Royal Commissioners appointed to consider the law relating to indictable offences and with respect to such section the commissioners said in their report that\nin framing section 119 we have proceeded on the principle that the guilt and danger of perjury consist in attempting by falsehood to mislead a tribunal de facto exercising judicial functions. It seems to us not desirable that a person who has done this should escape from punishment if he can show some defect in the constitution of the tribunal which he sought to mislead or some error in the proceedings themselves\nAnd the recorder was, in hearing the said charge, a tribunal de facto exercising judicial functions.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.

Mills J. dissenting.\nEvidence by the wife of the person accused of acts performed by her under directions of counsel sent to her by the accused to give the directions, is not a communication from the husband to his wife in respect of which the Canada Evidence Act forbids her to testify. Mills J. dissenting,\nPer Girouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The communications between husband and wife contemplated by the Canada Evidence Act, 1893, may be de verbo, de facto or de corpore. Sexual intercourse is such a communication and in the case under anneal neither the evidence by the accused that blood-stains upon his clothing were caused by having such intercourse at a time when his wife was unwell, nor the testimony of his wife in contradiction of such statement as to her condition, ought to have been received.\nPer Mills J.

C. PELLETIER \"\nJ. C. S.\nThe questions raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nGibsone and E. Roy for the appellant.\nCannon K. C., Assistant-Attorney-Greneral for Quebec, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice. I entirely concur in my brother Davies' reasoning and conclusions upon the merit of the question involved on this appeal, and I have nothing further to add to his opinion which I have had an opportunity to peruse. I deem it expe- dient, however, to say a few words upon the question raised during the argument of the reference by counsel to the debates in Parliament for the purpose of construing any statute. Such a reference has always been refused by my predecessors in this court and, when counsel in this case began to read from the Canadian Hansard the remarks made in Parliament when the Canada Evidence Act in question was under discussion, I did not feel justified in departing from the rule so laid down, though, personally, I would not be unwilling, in cases of ambiguity in statutes to concede that such a reference might sometimes be useful. The same rule is observed in England Alderson B. says, In re Gorham ([1]):\nWe do not construe Acts of Parliament by reference to history.\nAnd, in Barbat v. Allen ([2]), Pollock C. B. says :\nI must at the same time state that the history of a clause in a statute is certainly no ground for its interpretation in a court of law and I would guard myself against being considered as resorting to any such means.\nSee also Philips v. Rees ([3]) ; Reg v. Bishop of London ([4]), per Lord Esher, at page 224; and Robinson v. The canadian Pacific Railway Company ([5]).\nIn the case of The Queen v. The Bishop of Oxford ([6]), it is true a reference to a speech of the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords, relating to a certain statute, was allowed by the Court of Appeal but the remarks of the learned judges upon that point, if I read them correctly, are far from justifying the contention raised in some quarters that they intended to alter the general rule on that point.\nBramwell L.J. said:\nBoth my learned brothers have discussed our admission of the opinion given by the Lord Chancellor to the House of Lords, on the occasion of the Public Worship Regulation Act, 1874. I really do not know that there is any definite rule as to what may or may not he cited and acted on as authority. No doubt, we must act on general principles, and I suppose they would exclude what is said in debate in either House of Parliament. But to reject the opinion of the head of the law as to what is the law, given to advise the highest court of judicature in the country, sitting indeed in its legislative capacity, and at the same time admit the obiter dictum of a judge at nisi prius either in our own or an American court, seems somewhat strange, more especially as it is certain that, if it ought to be excluded, any judge knowing of it and excluding it, would as soon as he left the court consult the Hansard he had before rejected. I cannot think it was wrong to admit it.\nBaggallay L.J. said:\nBefore leaving the subject of judicial authority as bearing upon the question of the construction of that section I desire to refer to the circumstances of our having allowed the counsel for the appellants to quote to us a passage from the speech of the- Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords, when moving the third reading of the Public Worship Regulation Act in 1874 ; the counsel for the appellants whilst admitting that he could not refer to the passage in question or any other passage in that or any other speech for the purpose of construing the Public Worship Regulation Act, insisted that it was perfectly open to him to refer to it as representing the opinion of the Lord Chancellor as to the then state of the law relating to proceedings in respect of offences against the laws ecclesiastical, which laws it was proposed to some extent to affect by the bill before the House. After hearing the objections of the counsel for the respondent we allowed the passage to be read and though I have since entertained some doubts whether we were right in our decision, which doubts have not been wholly removed, I am, upon the whole, of opinion that there was no objection to the course that we allowed the appellants' counsel to take. The question with reference to which we allowed it to be cited was whether at the time of the passing of the Public Worship Regulation Act, there was a general concurrence of judicial opinion as to the true effect of a provision in an Act of Parliament passed thirty-four years previously. The courts have been in the habit of allowing reference to be made to text books the authors of which are living Judges, and I am unable to distinguish, in principle, an expression of opinion by the Lord Chancellor as to the state of the law upon a particular subject, with which he is inviting the House of Lords to deal, from an expression of opinion upon the same subject by another judge in a treatise published by him. The weight to be attached to the opinion, whether expressed in the one form or the other, must, of course, depend upon the surrounding circumstances.\nThe doubts I have entertained a3 to the propriety of our allowing reference to be made to the speech of the Lord Chancellor, have arisen from a consideration of the difficulties which in some cases, may arise, though they do not exist in the present, in the way of strictly limiting the purposes for which reference may be made to such expressions of judicial opinion.\nThesiger L J. said :\nI would only say, that among the authorities upon which I rely I do not count the speech of the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords. I was a party to the decision under which it was allowed to be quoted to us, and the ground upon which I thought it admissible was that it had in the occasion upon which it was spoken and the position of the speaker at least as great a sanction as the text-books of living Judges which have upon many occasions been admitted as authorities\u00bb\nBut upon further consideration of the matter, I have been led to doubt very much whether the principle upon which such text-books have been treated as authorities is a sound one ; and, even if it were a sound one I cannot but think the extension of it to speeches in a House of Parliament, sitting in its legislative capacity, however eminent may be the speakers, however solemn the occasion on which they speak, inexpedient in a very high degree. it is true that m many instances, and perhaps this particular one is a conspicuous example, the speech, looking to the circumstances under which it was made the previous consideration which the speaker has given to the subject and the character in which he speaks, may be entitled to far more weight than the hasty utterances of a judge at nisi prius or even the obiter dicta of a judge in banco ; but the judge, in the latter cases has the safeguard of a judicial proceeding cast around him ; his mind is not likely to be influenced by any considerations beyond those which the law enforces upon him ; while, when the scene is removed to the area of Parliament, political considerations may enter as they have before now entered, into the opinions of lawyers upon legal subjects, and may insensibly affect the judgments of even the greatest and wisest of our judges. The sanction and safeguard of judicial procedure are removed, and even the conditions which give the text-book its weight the exclusive devotion to the legal subject of which it treats, and the calmness with which it is necessarily prepared may, in many instances, not exist. That case is, however, no authority upon the question, for when in the House of Lords sub nomine Julius v. (oxford ([7]),\nIn the course of the arguments strong disapprobation was expressed by the Lord. Chancellor (Earl Cairns) and Lord Selborne of the course taken by the Court of Appeal in allowing to be cited a speech made by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords\nIn South-Eastern Railway Company v. The Railway Commissioners and the Mayor, etc., of Hastings ([8]), Cock-burn C J had also referred to a speech in the House of Lords, but in that same case ([9]), upon counsel saying \"The Act cannot be construed by reference to a debate in Parliament, \" Selborne, Lord Chancellor, said :\nThat is so. It has been regretted in. the House of Lords that the Court of Anneal had allowed such a reference to be made in The Queen v. The Bishop of Oxford. (Ubi supra.)\nIn the United States the rule seems to be the same.\nBut in truth, little reliance can or ought to be placed upon such sources of interpretation of a statute,\nsays Story J. in 2 Story's Reports, 654 ?\nPeckam. J., in the United States Supreme Court, said :\nThere is a general acquiescence in the doctrine that debates in Congress are not appropriate sources of information from which to discover the meaning of the language of a statute passed by that body. The reason is that it is impossible to determine with certainty what construction was put upon an Act by the members of a legislative body that passed it by resorting to the speeches of individual members thereof. Those who did not speak may not have agreed with those who did, and those who spoke might differ from each other ; the result being that the only proper way to construe a legislative Act is from the language used in the Act and, upon occasion, by a resort to the history of the times when it was passed. United States v. Freight Association (4); see also United States v. Oregon &c. Railroad Co. ([10]) \u00b0 though the public history of the times in which a statute was passed may be referred to, according to what Taney C. J. says in Aidridge v. Williams ([11]) or what Davis J. .says in United States v. The Union Pacific Railroad Co., ([12]) and Peckam J., Ubi supra.\nIn Lefroy's valuable book, (The Law of Legislative Power in Canada,) pages I and 21, are collected the judicial opinions wherein the general rule has been more or less disregarded in the construction of the British North America Act. The reports of the codifiers of the Civil Code of Lower Canada are also often referred to in Quebec and in this court, as also in the Privy Council (see for instance, Symes v. Cuviller, ([13]) but these cannot be put upon the same footing in regard to this rule as are the debates in Parliament upon a bill.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting.) \u2014 I dissent from the majority of the court only as to the meaning of the word c communication\" in section four of \" The Canada Evidence Act 1893 \"\nAt the trial of the appellant for murder, the wife of the accused was examined and the following incident transpired, as stated by the trial.judge in the reserved case.\nHis counsel then asked him (the accused) the following question :\nQ. How can you explain the blood that was found on the fork of these drawers. How can you explain this 1\nA. I will explain it if I am allowed to do so.\nQ. (By the court.) Explain this? A. Monday I had intercourse with my wife and she was unwell.\nQ. (By the court.) Is that the only explanation you wish to give ?\nA. * * * *\nTo contradict this evidence by the prisoner, the Crown brought up Celestine Labont\u00e9, his wife, in rebuttal, and asked her the following question :\nQ. Now your husband also declared, yesterday, in the witness-box, that on the twenty-sixth of May in the course of the morning, i.e., the day after he had gone to Vitaline Marquis's house, he had sexual intercourse with you ?\nThis question was objected to on behalf of the accused as tending to contradict evidence which was illegal and allowing evidence of privileged communications between husband and wife. Upon this objection the court decided that, the prisoner having declared that he explained the presence of blood upon his drawers by the fact that he had sexual intercourse with his wife in the course of the Monday morning, and this fact being an important one which had gone to the jury the Crown should be allowed to contradict it in rebuttal but the court did not decide that such a fact was a privileged communication between husband and wife mentioned in the Canada Evidence Act of 1893. The counsel for the accused then took exception to this judgment and asked for a reserved case upon this point\nThis evidence being allowed the wife answered that she did not remember exactly but, nevertheless, believed that she had had sexual intercourse with her husband upon this Monday morning, but that she had no blood upon her at that time\nI told the jury that they should weigh the evidence given by the wife as well as the evidence given by the husband as to the blood stains.\nThe Chief Justice Lacoste and Mr. Justice Ouimet formed the dissenting minority of the Court of Appeal and held that the witness was not competent to be examined in any manner or form on behalf and at the request of the Crown.\nI am not prepared to go to that extent, but I have no hesitation in saying that she was not competent to give the above evidence As I read the fourth section of the \" Canada Evidence Act 1893 \" a wife or husband is a competent witness in any criminal case and may possibly be compelled to give evidence, but no husband shall be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage and no wife shall be competent to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage.\nWhat is the meaning of the word \"communication \" ?\nWebster defines it\nthe act or fact of communicating intercourse by words, letters or messages. connection, intercourse.\nWhy depart from this definition in the interpretation of clause four of the Evidence Act ? For what reason limit it to words of mouth, messages, conversations, letters or gestures ? Thus limited, the statute would not protect the whole situation contemplated. I do not believe that the legislature ever intended such a result. It does not say so and I am not inclined to add to or take from the ordinary meaning of the expression used. I think the word \"communication\" is large enough to comprehend all kinds of relations between husband and wife whether de verbo, de facto or de corpore Are the sexual relations between husband and wife to be less sacred than a mere conversation or message ? It was more than a matter of privllege, which may be waived, it was illegal to admit the evidence of the wife. The prisoner objected to it, but even the formal consent of all parties could not cover such an illegality, which is of public order. The wife was not competent to contradict the evidence of her husband as to his explanation of the blood stains upon his clothes. For the same reason, the learned judge should have ruled out the answer given by the prisoner, whether offered by him or not. He was not, therefore, legally tried and should have a new trial, not in consequence of his own evidence, which caused him no possible injury but by reason of the evidence of the wife which was the occasion of a substantial wrong to him. See section 746 of the Criminal Code. Not only was the trial illegal, it was not even fair. The wife whose assistance the prisoner was entitled to was kept under close surveillance in the private house of the Chief of Provincial Police, at the request of the Crown and when his counsel endeavoured to see her on his behalf he was refused. The trial judge sanctioned this course.\nThe Crown Attorney can take all necessary measures to secure the attendance of witnesses, but his refusal to allow the accused or his counsel to see her and obtain her lawful assistance, if any was available, was unwarrantable. He was not an outlaw and might even be acquitted, and, if he had been, what would be the life of the unfortunate couple ?\nIt is in a case like this that the language of Taylor, quoted by my brother Davies, should receive its application. Indeed the peace of families is at stake It is no doubt of great moment to the community that criminals should be convicted and punished but it is more important that criminal justice should be properly and legally administered.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and grant a new trial.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The questions raised on this appeal depend for their solution upon the construction to be given to the fourth and fifth sections of the Canada Evidence Act, 1893.\nThe appellant was tried on an indictment for murder and the questions arose out of his wife being tendered and giving her evidence as a witness for the Crown. The trial judge, while being of the opinion that she was under the statute a competent witness, also thought that it was a matter of privilege or volition on her part whether she should testify or not, and during the progress of her examination he so instructed her. It was contended for the prisoner that the statute did not permit the wife to give evidence for the Crown at all; and that, at any rate, before she gave any evidence she should be instructed by the court as to her rights and given to understand that if she declined to-give evidence she would not incur any penalty. The-learned judge, however, left the question of giving or declining to give evidence to the determination of the wife herself but reserved the point raised.\nQuestions were also raised by the prisoner's counsel as to the admissibility of certain evidence given by the-wife in contradiction of a statement made in his evidence by the prisoner when, in explanation of certain blood spots found upon his drawers after the murder, he stated that on the Monday he had had carnal connection with his wife who at the time was unwell ; and also another statement made by the wife as to instructions or advice given to her by the prisoner's counsel as to the washing out of these blood stains. The learned judge in both cases admitted the evidence and reserved the point.\nOn the reserved case being argued before the Court of King's Bench for the Province of Quebec the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Ouimet delivered dissenting judgments to the effect that, under a true construction of the statute the wife of the accused was not a competent witness for the prosecution, but for the defence only,\nThey based their conclusion partly upon the proposition that to admit the wife of the accused as a witness for the prosecution was opposed to public policy and order and was inconsistent with the subsection of section four, which, while preventing comments being made by the judge or counsel for the prosecution for the failure of the accused or of the wife or the husband of the accused to give evidence, was silent as to- such, comments being made by the counsel for the prisoner.\nI am quite unable to concur either in these conclusions or to follow the reasoning which led the learned judges to adopt them. Our duty is simply to construe the language of the statute as we find it. Where that language is plain and unambiguous we are not to speculate as to what was or might, have been the intention of Parliament or as to the consequences which we may think impolitic or undesirable which follow from adherence to the plain language of the statute.\nThe section under consideration does not say that the wife or the husband of the accused shall be a competent witness for the defence. Such a limitation is found in the Imperial statute passed subsequently to that of Canada, but it is conspicuously absent from the latter. The section under review makes these parties the accused and the husband or wife of the accused competent witnesses, but with a definite and specified exception relating to communications made to each other during marriage. With regard to these latter the incompetency of the witnesses remains. In all other respects it has been removed, and they stand on the same plane as other competent witnesses and liable to answer, when called, all legal questions asked them. To interpolate the words \"for the defence\" is in my judgment, to do violence to the language of the section. \"With reference to the argument derived from the omission of any reference to the counsel for the accused in this section, forbidding comment in case of failure of the accused or of the husband or wife of the accused to give evidence, I am unable to appreciate the supposed inconsistency of the omission. It certainly would be an extreme case which would call for comment on the part of counsel for the accused that the Crown had failed to call him or her, or his or her wife or husband, as the case might be, to give evidence\u00bb What Parliament was evidently providing for was the protection of the prisoner from damaging comments either by the court or prosecuting counsel if, not having been called by the Crown, the prisoner or his wife or her husband, as the case might be, did not tender himself nor call his consort for the defence. But in any event, such an omission should not avail to alter the plain construction of a statute or justify us in imputing to Parliament an intention which its language in the main section does not bear.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench which was delivered by Mr. Justice Hall follows that of the trial judge, and limits the competency of the accused or of the wife or husband of the accused, as the case may be, to give evidence, to those cases in which they may voluntarily elect to do so. As appears from what I have already said, I take a wider view of the sections under consideration than is taken in the judgment appealed from. Apart altogether from communications made by husband and wife to each other during their marriage, I hold that their competency as witnesses is by the statute made unrestricted. If Parliament intended to vest in the accused or in the husband or wife of the accused, the privilege simply of giving evidence and not the duty, surely it would have said so and provided as was done in the Imperial statute of 1898, that the accused\nshould not be called as a witnesses except upon his own application, (and that) the wife or husband of the person charged (should not be so called) except upon the application of the person so charged.\nBefore the passing of the Canada Evidence Act 1893 some few special exceptions had been made to the common law prohibiting an accused party and the wife or husband, as the case might be, of the accused party from giving evidence, either for or against each other. Secs. 216 and 217 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, permitted the accused and his or her wife or husband to give evidence for the prosecution or in his or her own behalf in actions for common assault or assault and battery. These sections were repealed by the Criminal Code on the same day as the Canada Evidence Act came into force. Being made by the latter Act c competent witnesses s on the trial of one or the other for any offence, their incompetency, which existed under the common law, was removed. No distinction was attempted to be drawn between their competency for the prosecution or for the defence No limitation upon this competency was inserted beyond that of prohibiting the disclosure of marital communications. These were not left to the whim, election or caprice of the parties. Their incompetency on these matters was retained. On all others it was removed. Henceforth, except with respect to martial communications, they stood in the same position as other witnesses and could not refuse to answer any legal question put to them. Questions of privilege at no time existed. It was and is solely a question of competency. By the fifth section of the statute it is declared that :\nNo person shall be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him etc\nand this applies equally to the accused and to his or her wife or husband when giving evidence, as to any other witnesses.\nI fully agree with the Court of King's Bench in failing to appreciate any grave distinction between calling the accused or his wife or husband to give evidence for the prosecution or for the defence. In either case the witness is bound to tell the truth. The whole object of the trial is or should be to reach the truth, and it doubtless was because Parliament believed this object could best be achieved by removing the incompetency to give evidence under which the parties had theretofore laboured that the section was passed. The proviso retaining the sacredness of all marital communications was properly inserted as a matter of public policy and to preserve, as Mr. Taylor in his book on Evidence says :\nthat unlimited confidence between husband and wife upon which the happiness of the married state and the peace of families depends.\nSome argument was advanced at bar on the inference to be derived from the absence in the statute of the word compellable ; and it was said that being made a competent witness only and not expressly a compellable one left in the witness a complete election to testify or not as he or she pleased and as to such matters as he or she should elect. I cannot yield to such an argument.\nIt is true that the word compellable was coupled with the word competent in Lord Denman's Civil Evidence Act, when introduced in England. But, as was pointed out by Lord Chancellor Herschell, in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Kops v. The Queen, ([14]) compellable \" there means c compellable by process of law. \"\nIn several of the later statutes amending the law of criminal evidence in England, the wife and husband of the accused are admitted under prescribed conditions to give evidence. It had been held, under one of these statutes by Mr. Justice Wills, (see Phipson on Evidence, 3 ed. p. 415) that a wife where declared competent is also compellable not only against her husband but also against her own wish. The authority cited ([15]) is, of course, not an authorised report, and, on referring to it I find the learned judge while so holding would, if the prisoner had been convicted, have reserved a case upon that point,\nThese conclusions which I have stated determine most of the questions raised on this appeal. With regard to the others I agree with the majority judgment of the Court of King's Bench, that the rulings of the learned trial judg\u00e9 were correct. The wife being a competent witness it was not open to her, in my opinion, to refuse to give evidence or to select the points upon which she should testify ; only as to the disclosure of marital communications was she incompetent to testify.\nThe communication between the prisoner's wife and the prisoner's counsel was not a privileged communication in the sense of being a communication from her husband. No evidence was offered that he knew of or authorised. The only point reserved, as I understand the case is with respect to what the solicitor told her. This statement was certainly not within his duty and being calculated to further or conceal a criminal act does not come within the solicitor's privilege. That privilege cannot be invoked to protect communications which are in themselves parts of a criminal or unlawful proceeding ; Bullivant v. The Attorney-General for Victoria ([16]); The Queen v. Cox ([17]).\nNor do I think that the evidence given by the prisoner's wife came in any way within the statute which retains her incompetency to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during marriage. The facts to which she testified were independent facts gained by her own observation and knowledge and not from any communication from her husband. She saw the blood on the clothes after her husband had. left the house to deliver himself up. She washed them after that in order to obliterate the blood stains as the solicitor told her to do and she contradicted her husband as to her being unwell at the time he swore he had carnal connection with her.\nI fully agree with the trial judge and with the Court of King's Bench that none of this evidence comes within the rule invoked.\nAs a majority of my colleagues concur in this judgment, the appeal is dismissed.\nMILLS J. (dissenting.) \u2014 In this case Gosselin is charged with having murdered a woman, and when he was put upon his trial his wife was called by the Crown as a witness to testify against him. She had been induced by those who were obtaining evidence on behalf of the Crown to leave her home, to go to the city of Quebec, and to take up her residence there with the Chief of Police. All this may have been a most legitimate proceeding, for the purpose of being able to produce her so far as she. might be legally called upon to give testimony when her husband was put upon his trial. The counsel who was retained on behalf of her husband was not permitted to see her, and so was not able to discuss the charges which were made against her husband with her, and to ascertain from her the facts which he desired to know in respect to the crime for which her husband was about to be tried.\nIt was contended by the counsel for the prisoner before us that under the Canada Evidence Act, when the husband or wife is accused of crime, unless in the case of a crime committed by one against the other, neither is permitted to testify against the other in respect to any matter which springs out of the marital relations. The law in respect to the husband and wife giving evidence in a criminal trial other than the case of an offence committed by one against the other depends upon the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act 1893, secs. 3, 4 and 5. He maintained that the wife of accused was not a competent witness for the prosecution, that she was not a compellable though a competent witness for the prisoner, and that the extent to which she might testify, was limited by the Act because of her marital relations to the accused\u00bb He maintained that she was not before the court as a voluntary witness and that, being very ignorant as to her rights in this regard and being generally ill-informed, she was under the impression that she was liable to be committed to prison unless she appeared as a witness in the case. The Chief of the Provincial Police at Quebec came to her father's house where she was residing after her husband had been committed to prison, and while there she was kept under constant surveillance, and was especially warned not to speak to her husband's counsel.\nThe prisoner's counsel endeavoured to see her but was not allowed to do so. He then applied to the court for an order but this was refused him. Before the witness was heard Mr. Roy, her husbands counsel, asked the court to instruct her as to her privileges, but she was ordered out of court before the application was heard, and so kept in ignorance of her right. I think it is much to be regretted that such \u00e1 course was adopted, for I cannot think that it was not a most proper proceeding on the part of the counsel for the prisoner that he should endeavour to consult with the prisoner's wife, and I think what she said, notwithstanding the instructions given by the judge in the witness box, did not make her a voluntary witness against her husband on the trial, and that while the law made her competent to a limited extent, it also made her a voluntary witness if a witness at all. I infer from what she said that she did not rightly apprehend her privilege, and that she was in ignorance of it notwithstanding what the trial judge said to her.\nUnder the common law the husband and wife are incompetent to give evidence for or against each other By ch. 174, secs. 216, 217 of the Revised Statutes of Canada on a summary trial for common assault, or assault and battery, the defendant is made a competent witness for the prosecution, or for himself, and on such a trial the wife or husband of the defendant shall be a competent witness for the defendant. if another crime is charged, and in the opinion of the court, it does not amount to more than common assault or assault and battery, the defendant shall be a competent witness for the prosecution or on his own behalf, or if the defendant is a woman she shall be a competent witness in respect to the charge of common assault or assault and battery. By the following section, no person charged with an indictable offence shall be a competent or compellable .witness to give evidence for himself, or tending to criminate himself nor, except as stated above did the Act render a husband competent or compellable to give evidence for or against his wife, or a wife competent or compellable to give evidence for or against her husband. These sections were repealed at the same time that the Canada Evidence Act came into force. This Act extended the competency of the husband and wife as witnesses with regard to each other and, in so far as this was done the common law rule was restricted but was not wholly superseded. It is well from this point of view to consider sections 3 4 and 5 of the Evidence Act 1898 as amended by 61 Vict. ch. 53 and 1 Edw. VII ch. 36. Section 3 provides that a person shall not be incompetent to give evidence by reason of interest or crime. 4. Every person charged with an offence and the wife or husband as the case may be, of the person so charged shall be a competent witness, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person. Provided, however, that no husband shall be competent ' to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any com munication made to her by her husband during their marriage\n2. The failure of the person charged or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution in addressing the jury.\n5. No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person ; provided, however that if with respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person and if but for this section the witness would there fore have been excused from answering such question, then, although the witness shall be compelled to answer, yet the answer so given shall not be used nor received in evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.\n2. The proviso to s.-s. 1 of this section shall in like manner apply to the answer of a witness to any question which, pursuant to any action of the legislature of the province, such witness is compelled to answer, after having objected so to do upon any ground mentioned in the said subsection, and which but for that enactment, he would upon such ground have been excused from answering.\nThese are the provisions of the law which are thought doubtful in their meaning, the Crown holding that when the husband or wife is made competent he or she is also made compellable. The court below proceeded upon the assumption that though the husband or wife is competent, they are not compellable, to testify, while the counsel for the prisoner contended before us that they are only competent to testify for but not against each other. Mr. Justice Hall in his judgment upon this case in the Court of King's Bench of Quebec, says :\nThe text of the statute makes no distinction between the accused and the husband or wife of the accused! if offered as a witness for the prosecution, and the strongest argument against the evidence of the wife as a witness for the prosecution in such a case is that whatever rule be adopted as to her must be applied to the husband, and that it cannot be contended that Parliament intended by its Act of 1893 to violate all precedent statutory law, and universal practice, and authorise the procedure by which the accused could appear as a witness against himself. Our prejudice such an interpr\u00e9tation arises from the designation which we improperly make of a witness, as being for the prosecution or for the defence. A witness, by whichever side produced, is not sworn to render evidence for the prosecution or for the defence but only to tell the truth and he is called or tendered as a witness by one side or the other in expectation that his evidence will support the contentions of that side\nBut whatever may be the duty of the witness when he is called he is called for the purpose of supporting the one side or the other and in this case the statute itself assumes that he is not called by the prosecution or for the purpose of supporting the prosecution, and so the failure to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by the counsel for the prosecution. The statute puts the husband and the wife upon exactly the same footing. If either appears in the witness box it can only be as a witness not for the Crown, but for the one which maybe accused, and the failure of either to avail himself or herself of the privilege which the law gives by making them competent witnesses shall not be made subject of comment either by the judge or by the counsel for the prosecution. It makes it very clear that the law of evidence in this regard was being extended in favour of the prisoner only. Both husband and wife are by section 4 put upon the same footing ; both are made competent witnesses for the defence. The law was intended to make either an available witness for the other ; it is a provision in the interest of the accused party and was not intended to break down that public policy which has long protected the marital relations. When we look at the proviso of section 4 we find that the pri- vacy of that relation is protected ; the barrier which has preserved the confidence which exists by reason of it is still allowed to stand ; the confidence which is still essential to the peace of the family and to the unrestrained confidence which the well-being of society calls for, is protected ; it is declared that no husband shall be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage. In England, no husband is compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband. This does not simply mean that she may not tell anything which he has told her but she is not at liberty to disclose anything which she has learned from him as the result of their marital relations. It is not simply what she has learned by words spoken to her. This is the view in Doker v. Hasler ([18]). In this case a widow was not permitted to disclose conversations between herself and her late husband in a case in which it was said that an execution was fraudulently taken out to protect the goods of the debtor against his assignees, but the Chief Justice, Best, who was presiding would not permit her to testify as to conversations between herself and her late husband and he said :\nI remember that in that case (Munroe v. Twisleton ([19]) in which I was counsel, Lord Alvanley refused to allow a woman after her divorce to\u00bb speak to conversations which had passed between herself and her husband during the existence of the marriage. I am satisfied with the propriety of that decision, and I think that the happiness of the marriage state requires that the confidence between man and wife should be kept forever inviolate\nIn Aveson v. Kinaird ([20]) in an action by the husband upon a policy of insurance on the life of his wife made by her when lying in bed, apparently ill, stating the bad state of* her health at a period of her going to Manchester (whither she went a few days before in order to be examined by a surgeon, and to get a certificate from him of good health, preparatory to making an insurance) down to that time, and her apprehension that she could not live ten days longer, by which time the policy was to be returned, are admitted in evidence to show her opini\u00f3n who best knew the fact of the ill state of her health, at the time of making the policy, which was on a day intervening between the time of her going to Manchester and the day on which such declarations were made ; and particularly after the plaintiff had called the surgeon as a witness, to prove that she was in good state of health when examined by him at Manchester ; his judgment being formed in part from the satisfactory answers being given by her to his inquiries. d Lord Ellenborough, in referring to the evidence, said :\nThe admission of the evidence is free from any imputations of breaking in upon the confidence existing between man and wife. The declaration was upon the subject of her own health at the time which is a fact of which her own declaration is evidence \u00b0 and that too made unawares before she could provide any answer for her own advantage and that of her husband ; and therefore falling within the principle of the case in Skinner, which I have alluded to.\nGrose J. said:\nThe first question put to the witness was : In what situation she found Mrs. Aveson when she called ? The answer was in bed. To that there could be no objection. The next question was : Why was she in bed 1 Now who could possiblv give so good an account of that as the party herself ? It is not only good evidence but the best evidence which the nature of the case afforded.\nAnd similar views were expressed by Lawrence J. In this case testimony was given, not of what passed between the husband and wife, but of what passed between the wife and several other parties who dis Cussed With her the state of her health at the time that she went to Manchester to obtain the doctor's Certificate.\nIn The Queen v. Pamenter ([21]), Kelly C.B. rejected a letter from the prisoner to his wife entrusted to a constable, but which had been opened by him. And in Scott v. The Commonwealth ([22]), a similar letter voluntarily surrendered by a wife from a husband was excluded on the ground that its disclosure was a violation of those confidential relations between husband and wife which the law protected.\nIn The king v. Smithies ([23]). it was held that observations made by a wife to her husband on a subject which afterwards was a matter of criminal charge against him, may be opened to the jury by the counsel for the prosecution. Here, the prisoner was indicted for the murder of Ellen Twamley by setting fire to his own house. Mr. Adolphus, in opening for the prosecution was about to state some observations made to the prisoner by his wife, on the subject of the fire, to whom he made an evasive reply. Clarkson, who appeared for the prisoner, stated that he was informed that if the wife, who was in court, could be examined she would contradict the proposed statement, and he submitted under these circumstances, it was doubtful whether the evidence would be received, and the statement ought not therefore to be made. But Mr. Justice Gaselee and Mr. Justice Parke were both of opinion that the statement might be made to a jury ; and that the circumstance of the observations being stated to be made by the wife who could not be called as a witness, did not vary the general rule, that whatever was said to a prisoner on the subject matter of the charge, to which he made no direct answer, was receivable as evidence of an implied admission on his part. But this was not any disclosure by the testimony of the wife but only of what she had. said to her husband in the hearing of another party.\nIn the case of The King v. Simions ([24]) A. was a witness for the prosecution of B. on a charge of arson, but was first examined by a magistate before any specific charge was made against any person, and his deposition had been reduced to writing. A. was next accused of the offence and his statement as a prisoner was also taken down by the magistrate. After this, B. was charged with the offence, and A. was examined as a witness when A's statement at that time was taken down. B. being then in custody, the court held that all these statements of A. ought to have been returned to the judge and not merely the statement made when A. was committed. What a prisoner is overheard to say to his wife, or what a prisoner is overheard to say to himself, is receivable in evidence against him on a charge of felony. In this case, two witnesses who overheard the prisoner did not understand him alike, and Alderson B. who was presiding said one of these expressions was widely different from the other. It shows how little reliance ought to placed on such evidence.\nIn the case of The King v. Bartlett ([25]), which was tried before Baron Bolland, the prisoner was indicted for the murder of Mary Lewis. While he was in custody his wife came into the room. Greaves, who was acting for the prosecution, was about to ask what she said in his presence, when Alexander, acting for the prisoner, submitted that it was not receivable, as the wife could not be examined on oath against the prisoner and so what she said cannot be used in evidence against him. Mr. Greaves however, main- tained that what the wife said to the prisoner was receivable in evidence although the prisoner might not reply to it, but here the prisoner did. Bolland B. said the evidence was admissible, and it was proved that the wife said to her husband \" Oh, Bartlett, how could you do it?\" He looked steadfastly at her and said, \" Ah, what, you accuse me of the murder, too ?\" She replied \" I do, Bartlett you are the man who shot my mother.\" The prisoner did not make any reply. She then turned to the witness and said \"This was done for money.\" The judge said, \" The examination must be read.\" It was then put in and read. The witness here heard what his wife said to the prisoner and so was permitted to testify. The confidential relation existing between the husband and wife does not prevent a stranger from testifying to what he heard one of them say to the other.\nA witness cannot be compelled to answer a question or produce a document, the tendency of which is to expose him or his wife, or if the witness should be the wife, to expose her or her husband, to any criminal charge or prosecution. The privilege is based upon the confidential relations which exist between husband and wife, and which the well-being of society requires should be carefully guarded. In the case of The Queen v. Thompson, Danzey and Hide ([26]), Who were indicted and tried together it was held that the wife of one of them was not a competent witness for either of the others. In this case Thompson and Danzey were defended by the same counsel, Hyde was defended by another. They were indicted and tried for stealing 56 pounds of onions. The counsel for the two tendered as a witness for his clients the wife of the third. This was objected to by the counsel for the prosecution on the ground that her evidence in their case must affect the case of her husband. It was said that the general policy of the law which rejected the evidence of the wife, for or against her husband in criminal cases made it necessary for the court to refuse the evidence of the wife on behalf of the other accused. Boville O.J. said :\nWe are all of opinion that the wife of any one of the three prisoners stands in the same \"position with respect to the admissibility of her evidence as her husband. The prisoners were charged together, they were tried together, and one of them could not be called as a witness for the others and the wife stands in the same position as her husband..\nIn the case of The Queen v. Payne and others ([27]), it was held that when two prisoners are indicted and tried together, the one of them is not competent to be a witness for the other. It was pointed out that 6 and 7 Vict., ch. 85, s. 1, abolished in general terms-incapacity from crime or interest, and that would have admitted the testimony of the parties to any proceeding civil or criminal, including a prisoner under* such circumstances as the present had it not been for the proviso which reads\nthat this Act shall not render competent any party to any suit, action or proceeding individually named in the record.\nThat then 14 & 15 Vict., c. 99, s. i which repealed. this proviso in the earlier Act and sec. 2 makes the party to any proceeding competent witnesses, except those that are hereinafter excepted. Sec. 3 provides that a person charged in any criminal proceeding* shall not be a witness for or against himself, and that the husband or wife of a party charged shall not be admissible for or against the wife or husband. The old incapacity on the ground of interest having been swept away by the earlier Act, and the excluding proviso in that Act repealed by sec. 1 of the later Act, and parties expressly made competent by sec. 2, the- only witnesses whose testimony is excluded are those excepted in sec. 3, the prisoner called on his own behalf and the husband or wife of a prisoner called for or against the wife or husband. Cockburn C.J. said :\nWe are all of opinion that the evidence rejected was properly rejected. We are all agreed that the exception in 14 & 15 Vict. c. 99, s. 3, was introduced to prevent any possibility of its being thought that the law as it had existed from the earliest times had been altered by this Act. By that law it was a distinguishing characteristic of our criminal system that a prisoner on his trial could neither be examined nor cross-examined. We think it is impossible to suppose that it could have been intended to change this rule by a mere side wind by means of this exception.\nAll the witnesses competent to give evidence are generally compellable, but this does not under our statute apply to the accused, or to the wife in case the husband is accused, or to the husband in case the wife is the accused party. It was held that where a prisoner is competent but not compellable to give evidence on his own behalf, and did not do so it was not necessarily wrong for the court to comment upon the fact, as was done in the case of Kops v. The Queen. ([28]) But under our statute both the judge and the counsel for the prosecution are expressly inhibited from doing so. and I take it to be clear from the words of the statute that neither husband nor wife where one of them is charged with a crime and put upon trial, can be called as a witness by the Crown. The words are :\nThat their failure to testify shall not be made a subject of comment by the judge or by the counsel for the prosecution in addressing the jury.\nOur legislation has gone a long way in many things, but it has not yet gone so far as to compel the prisoner to testify against himself, nor to compel his wife to be a witness for the prosecution, although in this trial the manner in which the wife was brought into court, approaches very closely to such a proceeding. She was kept for some time in the custody of the Crown, and the counsel for her husband was denied an opportunity of discussing her husband's case with her, and she appeared in the court as a witness, not giving her testimony from a sense of duty, but reluctantly as one in duress, giving her testimony because she believed that she was under legal compulsion to do so. This is abundantly shown.by the answers she gave to the questions put by the Court, before her examination in the case began.\nAfter she was sworn she was asked by the Court : \"Do you consent to give evidence ? \" Her answer was : \" I would prefer not to give evidence.\"\nQ. Do you consent to give evidence ?\nA. If I must.\nQ. What do you mean by \"if I must\" ; you have already been heard as a witness, Madam, and you have declared that you consented to give evidence, and you have given evidence in this cause?\nA Yes.\nQ. Now, do you consent to give evidence ?\nA. If I must\nIs it possible to doubt that this woman was a witness against her will, and that she believed herself under legal compulsion ? In my opinion when she replied to his Lordship's question, and said she would prefer not to give evidence, she ought to have been discharged From that time she was a witness under compulsion who had not been sufficiently informed as to her privileges. She was also a witness testifying to matters which she was not competent to disclose, and which was in violation of the marital relations which it is the policy of the law to guard against invasion.\nIn the Queen v. Gibson ([29]) decided by the Court for Crown Oases Reserved, it was held that if in a criminal trial evidence not legally admissible against the prisoner is left to the jury, and they find him guilty, the conviction is bad. Lord Coleridge C.J. said that when such evidence goes to a jury a new trial must be granted as a matter of right ; and in this opinion all the judges concurred. It is said here, that the judge not only ordered the wife out of the court, that she might not hear what her husband's counsel was about to say against her being called as a witness, but until after she was sworn no information was given to her as to her right in the matter. And the information given her by the court, and which I have quoted, shows that she still was under the impression that she was obliged to testify in the case. In my opinion her husband's counsel was entitled to see her and to discuss her husband's case with her if he so desired and she were willing to see him, and no one had any right to intervene and prevent this being done.\nWhen her husband's counsel saw her before she was taken to Quebec he did so as her husband's agent, and in his name, and on his behalf, and under the protection of the law as to those confidential relations which exist between husband and wife for the protection of what he said to her, as much so as if the husband had spoken in person. It is no doubt most desirable that crime should be punished and that the zeal of public officers in bringing criminals to justice should not be unduly restricted, but it is of no less consequence, in the pursuit of this object, to see that every accused party who is arrested and put upon his trial has a fair trial that justice is so administered that the public confidence in the fairness of its administration may be maintained unimpaired. There should be a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Roy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L, J. Cannon.\n[1] 5 Ex. 667.\n[2] 7 Ex. 616.\n[3] 24 Q. B. D. 17.\n[4] 24 Q. B.

Tourville[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario by which a judgment of the Chancellor, who had dismissed the respondents\u2019 action, was reversed and the conclusions of the action granted. None but questions of fact are involved in the case. The respondents by their action claimed the price of a monument or gravestone sold and delivered to the appellants by the firm of McIntyre & Gardiner, whose assignees they, the respondents, are. The appellants admit that they did order a monument from that firm for which they agreed to pay $1,500, but further say that the monument delivered is not of the design agreed upon. The respondents delivered one which is in accordance with what is known as \u201cThe E.M. Lewis Reporter Design,\u201d and they produced at the trial a document purporting to be an order in writing signed by the appellants (or the party they repre- sent) for a monument of that special design, but the appellants assert that the words \u201cThe E.M. Lewis Reporter Design\u201d in that writing were fraudulently inserted therein without their knowledge after the order had been signed. The judgment appealed from, however, finds as a fact that these words were in it when it was signed, and that finding is entirely supported by the evidence. The Chancellor at the trial, it is true, appears to have indirectly found the contrary in dismissing the action upon the ground that the monument delivered to the appellants, though it be in fact in accordance with the \u201cE.M. Lewis design\u201d, is not of the design contracted for. Such a finding clearly imports that the respondents\u2019 witnesses were guilty of wilful perjury, added to a forgery by their agent who received the order. Now, there is nothing in the case to justify such a grave charge against them, and full credit must be given to their testimony. Their sworn statements must be reconciled with those of the appellants\u2019 witnesses, if possible, and there is not the least difficulty in doing so. It is not at all contended that the credibility of any of these witnesses depended upon their demeanour in the box at the trial, or anything of that kind. So that the Court of Appeal was, and we are here, in just as good a position to pass upon the evidence as the Chancellor was. As I view the case, full credit can be given to all the witnesses examined either on one side or the other. The appellants\u2019 witnesses, I have no doubt, swore to what they honestly and fairly believed to be the truth. They firmly believe that the monument as erected is not of the design selected by the appellants. But they are mistaken. The engraving from which they selected what they wanted failed to convey to their minds what it represented. It left them under a false impression and led them to expect an article different from that which it really could not but be. But that is not the respondents\u2019 fault. They did nothing to mislead the appellants. A photograph, or plan or engraving as was exhibited to them to obtain their order is, we all know, very deceptive, and not many, outside of experts, are capable of grasping correctly from them what the executed article will be. That is what has happened with these people. They did order an \u201cE.M. Lewis\u201d monument. They did get an \u201cE.M. Lewis\u201d monument, but it does not come up to their expectations, and they are disappointed in not getting a monument according to the false impressions they had conceived from the engraving. That is the sole cause of the apparent contradictions in the evidence of the witnesses.\nThe appellants however, in their endeavours to impugn the judgment a quo, seemed to mainly rely at bar upon the ground that the Court of Appeal has thereby overruled the findings of the trial judge. A similar contention, in analogous cases, has so often been repeated before us lately that it is not inexpedient to specially notice it, though I will do so but briefly as there is not the least room for controversy upon the point. No one would contend that where a statute gives a right of appeal upon questions of fact to an intermediate court or to this court, it imposes upon the court appealed to the obligation to confirm the judgment appealed from, or that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction in such cases only upon the condition that it shall not reverse. Yet that is virtually what the appellants\u2019 contentions amount to. In the case of Grasett v. Carter[7] relied upon by them, this court as subsequently remarked by Mr. Justice Patterson in the North Perth Election Case[8], did not hold that if an intermediate court reverses the decision of the primary court on a question depending on conflicting evidence, its judgment is, for that reason alone, liable to be in its turn reversed by a second court of appeal. In cases where we sit as a first court of appeal, in election cases or in Exchequer appeals, we have not ourselves hesitated to reverse the findings of fact of the court appealed from when convinced that they were wrong. Wheler v. Gibbs[9]; Cimon v. Perrault[10]; The King v. Likely[11].\nAnd in Bell v. Macklin[12] the trial judge had found the facts in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, and though a divisional Court had concurred in these findings yet the Court of Appeal had reversed the judgment in favour of the plaintiff. Upon an appeal to this Court, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was affirmed, because we were of opinion with that Court that the trial judge\u2019s conclusions were wrong and that the Divisional Court\u2019s concurrence with him had not had the effect of making them right.\nIn the The Queen v. Chesley[13] we reversed, upon the weight of evidence, the decision of the Court in banco, which had affirmed the findings of the trial judge, because we were convinced that the evidence did not justify those findings.\nIn Demers v. The Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[14] we dismissed the appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal which had reversed the primary court upon questions of fact, because the appellant failed to convince us that the primary court was right.\nVillage of Granby v. M\u00e9nard[15] cited by the appellants lays down no new rule. In that case we allowed the appeal, and restored the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact, because we thought that they were right, and that the Court of Appeal should have held that the Court of Review had been wrong in interfering with them.\nIn England, two or three recent cases upon the same point re-assert what is the unquestionable duty of a Court of Appeal when called upon to review questions of fact.\nThe Master of the Rolls, in Read v. Anderson[16] remarked (repeating what has been so often said):\nThe learned judge has found many of the questions in dispute as questions of fact and it seems to have been thought that the Court of Appeal cannot dispute his findings, but the Court of Appeal is not bound by the findings of fact by a judge who tries the case without a jury.\nEven in cases tried by a jury, the Privy Council and the House of Lords have not hesitated to interfere with the findings of fact when the ends of justice required it.\nIn Aitken v. McMeckan[17] for instance, where in a suit to set aside a will the jury had found that the testator was of unsound mind at the date of its execution, the Privy Council, on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, reversed an order of the full court of Victoria, which had dismissed a motion for a new trial.\nAnd in Jones v. Spencer[18] the House of Lords set aside the verdict of a jury as not justified by the evidence, though the court of Appeal had refused to interfere with it. I refer also to Coghlan v. Cumberland[19].\nEven where an appeal is taken from the concurrent findings of facts by two Courts, whilst the general rule laid down in such cases as for instance, Allen v. The Quebec Warehouse Co.[20]; Hay v. Gordon[21]; McIntyre Bros. v. McGavin[22] cannot be disregarded, yet, it unquestionably is, I will not say our right, but our duty, since the law gives an appeal from such findings, to review the evidence and allow the appeal if we are convinced that the first judgment was wrong and that the court appealed from should have reversed it. In Bell v. The Corporation of Quebec[23] their lordships of the Privy Council said:\nThis tribunal usually accepts the concurrent findings of two courts upon questions of fact, and their lordships cannot say that sufficient reasons appear in the present case to warrant a departure from their rule;\u2014\nclearly intimating that obviously there may be cases where their lordships would not feel warranted in adopting the findings of fact appealed from, even if concurred in by two courts.\nThis court likewise, has always fully recognised the wisdom of the general rule and seldom refused to give effect to it. Yet, in such cases as The North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[24] and the City of Montreal v. Cadieux[25] we felt bound to depart from it.\nThe attempt in Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois[26] to introduce the doctrine of the inflexibility of the rule did not prevail and the Privy Council refused leave to appeal from the judgment of the court.\nIn the present case, we think that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that the court of first instance was wrong, so that we are bound to dismiss the appeal. That is our plain duty. We have no discretion in the matter. Mr. Justice Patterson\u2019s remarks in the North Perth Election Case[27] have here their full application: \u201cFor my own part\u201d (said the learned judge.)\nI am not disposed to lay down or to acknowledge the authority or the value of rules or formulas for the decision of questions of fact. The Lord Chancellor said more recently in the same sense:\nI myself rather protest when one is dealing with questions of fact against laying down any rules that are not applicable to the particular case as it comes before us. Smith & Co. v. Bedouin Steam Navigation Co.[28]\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies on this appeal.\nGIROUARTD J. (dissenting)\u2014I think that this case falls within the rule laid down in The Village of Granby v. M\u00e9nard.[29] The trial judge in disposing of it prefaces his judgment dismissing the action by remarking:\nThere is a great deal of contradictory evidence in this case; but after consideration, I have continued to think as I thought at the close of the case, that credit is to be given to the evidence of the defendant.\nThere is not only some evidence in support of this view, but the preponderance of it is decidedly for the appellant. Five witnesses swore that the monument was not made according to the design selected, while the agent of the maker, who took the order, said quite the reverse. He is flatly contradicted by his own sister, having no interest in the matter, with whom he was staying on a visit, and on the best of terms. What design was selected was the point of contention between the parties, everything else being mere detail. All the witnesses for the appellant are unanimous upon it.\nI am not prepared to ignore their story and accept instead that of the agent, because in immaterial or minor details they do not always agree. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs. DAVIES J.\u2014The questions to be determined in this appeal are altogether of fact and depend upon the appreciation given to the evidence taken on the trial. The Chancellor before whom the case was tried, after vainly recommending the parties to settle, found for the defendants upon the ground that, while there was much contradictory evidence, credit should, in his opinion, be given to that for the defendant. The Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously reversed this judgment, largely upon the ground that the Chancellor had not made any express finding upon the important and crucial question whether the order for the monument, for the price of which the action was brought, contained at the time it was signed and given by the defendant the words now found in it as to the design, viz. \u2018E.M. Lewis reporter design\u2019. The Court of Appeal having found the facts on this crucial point for the plaintiffs, reversed the Chancellor\u2019s judgement dismissing the action, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\nI am of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct and for the reasons given by Chief Justice Moss for the court.\nThe facts may be given in a short compass. The firm of McIntyre & Gardiner, marble workers of Orangeville, had as their foreman one Ramsay, who being out of health was staying with his sister Mrs. Shingler in Toronto. She was friendly with the Dempster family having been for years one of their customers, and informed her brother of Mr. Dempster\u2019s desire to procure a handsome monument to mark his lately deceased wife\u2019s resting place and to serve as a family monument for himself and others of his family when they died. Ramsay at once wrote to his employers and having obtained from them all the designs of monuments which they had and which he thought suitable for submission to Mr. Dempster, saw that gentleman in presence of several members of his family, submitted his designs, and obtained a written order for a monument to cost $1,500. This was on the 8th March 1900. The order was on a printed form but the date, the description of the material, the design, the place of delivery and the price were all written in Ramsay\u2019s handwriting in blanks contained in the printed form. No question arises as to Dempster\u2019s signature and although many collateral questions were raised at the trial and also in the Court of Appeal the only question argued before us was whether the monument set up in Prospect Cemetery was of the design ordered. If it was no other question as to defendant\u2019s liability was raised.\nIt was of course conceded that if the words describing the design, \u201cE.M. Lewis reporter design\u201d had been written in by Dempster himself no evidence showing that another and different design had been agreed upon at the time could have availed defendant or in fact could have been received to contradict the written contract. And this is equally true apart from questions of fraud, if the words had been written in by Ramsay and were there at the time of the signing. And so, in the presence of much conflicting evidence as to the specific design ordered between the members of the Dempster family supported by Mrs. Shingler on the one hand, and Ramsay, the foreman, supported indirectly at least and strongly, by his employer McIntyre, and the exhibits, on the other, the crucial question remained for determination: Was the character of the design in the order when Dempster signed it? There is no doubt it was there within at least three hours after it was signed, for it was handed then by Ramsay to McIntyre, his master, and by the latter forwarded a short time afterwards to Scotland to have the order filled.\nNow, is there any internal evidence as to the time the words in dispute were written in? I think there is, and that such evidence is strong. All of the written part of the order outside of Dempster\u2019s signature is admittedly in Ramsay\u2019s writing. The colour of the ink and the character and style of the writing were exactly similar to those of the words \u201cProspect\u201d and \u201cFifteen hundred\u201d which were, it is conceded, written in the order by Ramsay just before Dempster signed it. If the disputed words had been afterwards inserted by Ramsay, either fraudulently or in furtherance of what he thought had been agreed to, the probabilities are that there would have been some difference shown unless indeed by some coincidence the pen and the ink used had been the same. The pen and ink were Dempster\u2019s, and the defendant\u2019s case was that the words were not in when Ramsay carried away the order.\nIt is conceded on both sides that all the cheaper designs were at once brushed aside by Dempster, and a $1,500 one agreed upon with little, if any, objection to the price. Ramsay swears he had no other $1,500 design with him than the one selected and delivered, and that the firm he represented had no other $1,500 design. The one next below it in cost was, he said, $1,100. McIntyre, his master, confirms him in this, and indirectly in other important points. The latter was in Toronto himself that day, had gone carefully with Ramsay over the designs just before Ramsay went up to see Dempster, and had marked on the picture or engraving of the E.M. Lewis Reporter Design the figure 15 which he swears now appears there to indicate its price. There is no doubt that the general character of the design sworn to as having been ordered by Dempster by himself and his family and also by Mrs. Shingler is materially different from the one supplied. But comparing the engraving of the E.M. Lewis design from which the order was given with the photograph of the monument as erected, I am not surprised that witnesses of the apparent education and training of the defendant and his witnesses should have honestly convinced themselves that the article supplied was of a different design. The deep rich colour of the engraved design is entirely absent in the photograph of the monument supplied, and it must be remembered that it was from the photograph Dempster reached his conclusions. He only saw the monument in the cemetery for a single moment on a rainy day and he expressly says he formed his conclusion that the monument supplied was not the one he ordered from its appearance in the photograph. It is true he in common with the other witnesses indicates a material difference in the place where the pillars are placed, but he relies strongly upon the great difference in the colour which evidently made a deep impression upon him.\nI entirely adopt the strong and convincing language used by the Chief Justice in the following paragraph of his judgment:\nThe defendant has deliberately charged Ramsay with forgery. The latter denies in the most emphatic way that he touched the paper with a pen or made any alteration after it was signed, and the circumstances as well as the probabilities are in his favour. That a design was selected and a price agreed upon; that the paper was handed to McIntyre in its present condition within a short time after it was signed; that the monument was ordered according to the design produced by Ramsay; that a monument of that design was worth $1,500; that the actual outlay was $1,311; that the defendant has been unable, notwithstanding search and inquiry of monument dealers, to produce any design of the kind alleged to have been shown him by Ramsay; and that there is an entire absence of motive impelling Ramsay to commit forgery and support it by perjury, go to fortify his sworn testimony.\nFor these reasons, and notwithstanding the strong contradictory character of the evidence given for the defence, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nMILLS J.\u2014I am inclined to agree with the chancellor that the evidence did not show the monument furnished to be in accordance with the design chosen by the purchaser, but I am not so strongly convinced of it as to dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Thomas Hislop.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Walsh & Fish.\n[1] 31 Can.

The will also contained this provision: \u201cIn case both my wife and myself should, by accident or otherwise, be deprived of life at the same time I request the following disposition to be made of my property\u201d * * * H. died sixteen days after his wife but made no change in his will.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal (4 Ont. L.R. 666) which affirmed the judgment of the Divisional Court (2 Ont. L.R. 169) that H. and his wife were not deprived of life at the same time and he therefore died intestate.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the respondent.\nThe sole question for decision was whether or not Thomas Henning, the testator, and his wife were deprived of life at the same time so that the provision in his will set out in the above head-note attached. If not there was an intestacy as the will made no provision for the event of the testator surviving. He and his wife had gone to Europe and the latter died at Florence on 11th December, 1888. The testator was ill at the time of her death but lived until 27th December, 1888. The respondents claimed that he died intestate and the courts below have so held.\nAylesworth K.C. for the appellant, referred to Marklew v. Turner[3]; Davies v. Davies[4].\nH.J. Scott K.C. and O\u2019Brien K.C. for the respondents (plaintiffs) cited Wing v. Angrave[5]; Van Grutten v. Foxwell[6].\nO\u2019Donoghue appeared for Clara Henning one of the respondents (defendant).\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The sole question involved in this appeal is as to the meaning of a will in which the testator says:\nIn case both my wife and myself should by accident or otherwise be deprived of life at the same time, I request the following disposition to be made of my property.\nThe testator died sixteen days after his wife. The appellants contend that as, on the testator\u2019s death, both he and his wife were then dead, they were deprived of life at the same time, within the meaning of the will. The Court of Appeal could not see its way to countenance such a contention and held that a testator who dies sixteen days after his wife, whether of accident or otherwise, has not been deprived of life at the same time as his wife. That is, in my opinion, a plain interpretation of plain words, and the only one that can reasonably be put upon the will.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs, respondents against the appellants, but with no costs upon this appeal to the respondent Clara Henning. SEDGEWICK and GIROUAKD JJ. were also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I have no doubt as to the true construction of the will in controversy in this case. To support the appellants\u2019 interpretation it would be necessary, as said by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, to interpolate after the words \u201cat the same time,\u201d the words \u201cor in case I shall survive her,\u201d which of course we have neither the right nor the power to do.\nMuch has been said as to the \u201cintention\u201d of the testator. It is our duty, however, to gather that intention from the language he has used. Speculation as to what he must have intended has been indulged in based upon the alleged vagueness of the language of the will, the relations of the testator towards his wife who predeceased him, the character of the contingent dispositions he made, and the circumstances surrounding his death. Able and ingenious as many of them are, however, they must not be permitted to alter the plain meaning of the language used. A counter suggestion made by Mr. Scott, as to testator\u2019s failure expressly to provide for the contingency of his survivorship, suggests itself as most reasonable. The deceased intended to give to himself or his wife, whoever survived the other a \u201cfree hand\u201d in disposing of property they had jointly accumulated. Accordingly he expressly, in the first paragraph of his will, gave to his wife, if she survived him, everything he possessed at time of his death and made her his sole executrix. No attempt was made to control her in the absolute disposition of the property in case she became possessed of it by survivorship.\nThen he provided as in the will in case both my wife and myself should by accident or otherwise be deprived of life at the same time,\nthe disposition of the property should follow as there specified and no doubt as they had mutually determined.\nThe other contingency, that which actually happened, his surviving his wife, left him with the property and a free hand to do with it as he pleased, and as circumstances might then determine, just as his wife was left had she survived him. The will carried out their mutual intention, and the omission on Mr. Henning\u2019s part during the fortnight intervening between his wife\u2019s death and his own to make another will or other disposition of the property than the law, unaided, did, does not to my mind weaken the force of Mr. Scott\u2019s contention that the language of the will fully and completely expressed the intention of the testator when it was written.\nMILLS J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Alfred S.

L.R. 682) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiffs.\nWilliam Thorne, then residing in England and having considerable property at Holland Landing, Ont., made the following bequest by his will;\u2014\n\u201cI give, devise and bequeath my mill, tannery, houses, lands and all real estate and property whatsoever and of what nature or kind soever at Holland Landing, in the Province of Canada West aforesaid to my nephew William H. Thorne, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns absolutely, but charged and chargeable nevertheless with and I hereby charge the said Holland Landing property with the payment of the annuities next hereinafter mentioned, namely, one annuity or yearly sum of eight hundred dollars to be paid by my nephew William Henry Thorne, out of such property to my wife Patience Margaret Ann Thorne by equal yearly payments for her life.\u201d\nAt the time of testator\u2019s death a firm of which the devisee, W.H. Thorne, was a member owed him nearly $18,000, and both he and the executors considered that such debt did not pass by the devise and he paid a portion of it to the estate. They agreed also that the devisee and not the estate should pay the annuities. The defendants, who are annuitants, now claim that the debt did pass and that the executors should refund the amount paid on account of it.\nThis contention was raised in an action by the surviving executors against the estate of the deceased executor for delivery up of the books and securities, and for an injunction which, on the hearing, was turned into a motion for judgment and the other parties added.\nThe only question to be decided is whether or not the said indebtedness passed by the devise.\nD.O.

This respondent was mulcted in costs by the Divisional Court, but did not appeal to the Court of Appeal. I now ask to be allowed to contend that the costs were improperly imposed and to file a factum.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case involves the construction of the will of one William Thorne who died at Toronto in 1868. The appellants have undertaken the arduous task of convincing us that the testator did not mean what he said, and what he was taken by all the interested parties to have said during the thirty years following his death. The material words in that will upon this controversy are as follows:\nI give, devise and bequeath my mill, tannery, houses, lands and all my real estate and property whatsoever, and of what nature or kind soever, at Holland Landing, in the Province of Canada West aforesaid, to my nephew, William Henry Thorne, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, absolutely.\nAt the time of the testator\u2019s death a large sum, nearly $18,000, was due him by a firm doing business as lessees of the said mills at Holland Landing, of which the said devisee, William Henry Thorne, was a partner. And the only question is whether or not the gift to him includes the debt so due by the said firm to the testator. The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal held that it did not. And that conclusion seems to me unassailable. The judgments are reported at page 682, vol. 4 Ont. L.R., sub nomine, Thorne v. Parsons, and I do not see that I could add anything to the opinions delivered by the learned judges who passed upon the different questions raised by the parties. No new points were taken before us. I read the will as if it said simply: \u201cI give all my real property situate at Holland Landing to my nephew William Thorne.\u201d Indeed, taking the will altogether and the residuary devise and bequest it provides for, the construction contended for by the appellants would perhaps be as untenable even if the will had merely said: \u201cI give all my lands and property situate at Holland Landing to W.H. Thorne.\u201d If that testator at his death had left a debtor in Toronto, but no real or other personal property of any kind, and had intended to bequeath the sum due to him by that debtor, to his nephew, he would not merely have said: \u201cI bequeath my property in Toronto to my nephew.\u201d In ordinary parlance a chose in action is not called property.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nA motion was made on the part of W.H. Thorne for leave to file a factum as appellant on the question of costs to which he contends that, as trustee, he should not have been condemned by the Divisional Court. That motion must be dismissed with costs. He has no standing as an appellant in this court. He was served as respondent by the appellants with a notice of this appeal. But that does not make him an appellant, or entitle him ipso facto to the benefit of an appeal.\nSEDGEWICK, GIROUARD and MILLS JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal and the motion. DAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Street, in the Divisional Court, and Mr. Justice Moss, in the Court of Appeal, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant Horace Thorne: D.O.

In 1900 he applied for and obtained a renewal grant for the same area, W.'s claim having lapsed in the meantime, and was continuously in undisputed possession of that area, with his stakes standing from the time of his original location until March, 1901, when S. and T. staked bench claims for the lands embraced in W.'s expired location which had been overlapped by M.'s claim, as being unoccupied Crown land.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, Davies and Armour JJ. dissenting, that the application for the renewal grant by M., after W.'s claim had lapsed, for the identical ground he had originally staked and continuously occupied, gave him a valid right to the location without the necessity of a formal re-staking and new application and that, following the rule in Osborne v. Morgan (13 App. Cas. 227), the possession of M. under his renewal grant should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory, sitting as a Court of Appeal constituted by the Ordinance of the 18th of March, 1901, respecting the hearing and decision of disputes in relation to the mining lands in the Yukon Territory, which affirmed the decision of the Gold Commissioner maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The principal facts of this case are shortly as follows:\u2014\nCreek claim No. 245, below Lower Discovery, Dominion Creek, in the Yukon Territory, was recorded by one Waite, on the 29th January, 1898, renewed by him in January, 1899, but reverted to the Crown in January 1900. The plaintiff recorded a hillside claim opposite the upper half limit of No. 245, below Lower Discovery, on August 15th, 1899, and applied for and obtained a renewal grant of the same in August, 1900. The defendant, Trinque, staked bench-claim, No. 245, on the first tier, on the 7th March, 1901, and recorded on the 18th March, and the defendant St. Laurent staked bench claim No. 245, on the second tier, on the 10th March, 1901, and obtained a grant for the same on the 19th March, 1901. The other circumstances material to the issues are set out in the judgments now reported.\nAll these claims were subject to the regulations governing placer mining of the 18th of January, 1898, and section 13 of the regulations of the 13th of March, 1901.\nJ. Lorne McDougall for the appellants. Under all the regulations staking and location constitute the root of title: See 1894-1899 Regulations, sec. 4; 18th January, 1898, Regulations, sec. 15; 13th March, 1901, Regulations, sec. 14; Atkins v. Coy ([1]). A sine qu\u00e2 non of valid location, staking or grant, under all the regulations, is that the ground staked should be vacant unrecorded Dominion lands at the time of staking. 1894-1899 Regulations. See Form H, 18th January, 1898, Regulations, sec. 8 and Form H, 13th March, 1901, Regulations, sec. 8; Belk v. Meagher ([2]); Cranston et al. v. English Canadian Co. ([3]); Victor v. Butler ([4]); Lindley on Mines, p. 363; Barringer & Adams on Mines, p. 306; Coplen v. Callahan ([5]). If by reason of a prior valid location the staking is ineffectual as to the whole or a part of the ground staked, the subsequent abandonment or forfeiture of the proper location cannot inure to the benefit of the person claiming under the ineffectual location. Free miners have no right to enter upon nor to locate any ground lawfully occupied for mining purposes. A lawful location cannot be made on ground comprising part of a subsisting placer claim, nor will a subsequent abandonment or forfeiture of such subsisting claim make valid such location. Ground once lawfully occupied by a free miner must revert to the Crown before a valid re-location can be made on it.\nThe appellants do not seek to set aside nor curtail the grant issued to the respondent, but to have it declared that such grant did not include the ground which was, at the time of his staking, lawfully occupied as a placer mining claim, and that the extent of the respondent's grant was not added to nor otherwise altered by the renewal grant.\nJ.A. Ritchie for the respondent. When the plaintiff located in 1899, the ground was open for location. There is no evidence to the contrary. Even if the ground was not open for location, the defendants had no right to come and locate on ground lawfully occupied by the plaintiff.\nReference is made to Osborne v. Morgan ([6]); Williams v. Morgan ([7]); Scott v. Henderson ([8]); and to Williams on Real Property, (18th ed.) p. 540.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE, and SEDGEWICK J. were of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DAVIES J. (dissenting.)\u2014This was a boundary action brought before the Gold Commissioner to determine the boundaries of the respective adjoining placer mining locations of the litigants. The Commissioner found as facts; (1). That the location of the respondent, Mercier, was staked in August, 1899, partially over a then legally existing creek claim and that such staking included the locus in dispute which was not then unoccupied Crown land; (2). That when Mercier obtained his renewal license in 1900 the said creek claim had lapsed and the lands in dispute were then unoccupied Crown lands but that Mercier did not re-stake or make any new application for a license, relying upon his former staking and application; (3). That, after Mercier's renewal license had issued, viz. on March 7th, 1901, St. Laurent staked his bench claim covering the lands in dispute and applied for and obtained a grant or license for the same.\nUnder these facts I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed. I agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig that the staking of a claim on unoccupied Crown lands is essential to the obtaining of a legal grant or license. It is the root of title, as has been so frequently determined under the law of British Columbia.\nThe staking by Mercier of the locus in August, 1899, was invalid because, at that time, the lands in question formed part of the creek claim, No. 245, below Lower Dominion. After this creek claim lapsed these lands became unoccupied Crown lands and were never again staked or located until staked by St. Laurent, the appellant. His was the only staking or locating on which a legal grant or license could issue and the renewal to Mercier of his original, but so far as the locus is concerned invalid, license or grant could not operate to give him any legal rights in the lands in dispute. MILLS J.\u2014The matter in dispute here between the parties related to a mining location in the Yukon Territory. One Waite had acquired a certain location in 1898. Subsequently, Mercier acquired a location which overlapped that of Waite by six hundred feet. Waite's location being first in point of time Mercier acquired nothing of that portion of the land embraced within it. Waite's claim lapsed and Mercier, subsequently, applied for a renewal, embracing precisely the same area which he had at first staked out and which he had applied for on the first occasion and he obtained entry for the same. St. Laurent made application for the location that had been previously held by Waite and he did this some time after Mercier's second entry.\nIt has been argued before us that, if Mercier desired to renew his application when there was no longer any impediment in his way, he ought to have re-staked his claim, although the stakes which he had previously placed were still standing, and the limits which he had on the first occasion marked out, while Waite's claim stood in the way of his obtaining a valid entry of a part of what he claimed. I do not think this is so. I think the limits of the grounds which he required being well known from what he had done, that his making application for a renewal of what he had then staked out was sufficient, as there was, at the time this entry was made, no legal impediment in the way of his getting that part of the area which he had marked out and of which he desired to obtain a valid entrance. I do not think it was necessary that he should have gone upon the ground a second time, pulled up the stakes which he had previously planted and put them again in the same places in order to obtain a proper entry for his claim in the Gold Commissioner's office. I think this would have been, under the circumstances, an altogether unnecessary proceeding and I think that the Gold Commissioner was right in recognizing the claim which Mercier had made as a valid one. He had been in possession; he had done work on the ground; he had obtained a renewal of his original claim, and there was no power in any one to make a second valid entry. At all events, if there was any irregularity in what he had done that irregularity was not one that St. Laurent could question.\nIn Osborne v. Morgan ([9]) I think the law is settled, that the party who had received here an entry after that obtained by Mercier had no right to try the validity of Mercier's claim, that this could only be questioned by the Crown. The statute, it was there said, gave no right whatever as against the land held by the Crown, and no title to try the validity of Crown leases relating thereto.\nHere, Mercier had possession, and was recognized by the Gold Commissioner as having a valid claim to carry on mining operations within the area which he had marked out. When he obtained the second entry no one stood between the Crown and himself with any prior claim. The claim subsequently made was by a party who had knowledge of the claim which Mercier held under the authority of the Gold Commissioner and the recognition of such a proceeding would furnish facilities for illegal practices in those distant regions.\nThe acts of the Gold Commissioner are administrative acts and his decisions should, as far as possible, be supported. It would be a misfortune to have parties, many of whom are uneducated men, deprived of their claims on some technical ground and in this way pass into the possession of others. Such a course would lead to dishonest practices and sometimes to violence, and in a country so distant from the settled parts of the Dominion, it is desirable, as far as possible, to enable men who have honestly undertaken to mark out claims for themselves and to obtain entry to succeed.\nHere, there is no doubt that Mercier's stakes were standing; that the limits of the ground claimed by him could be easily ascertained or seen. This ought to have been sufficient to have warned the party who was seeking to oust him from a claim which had already been recognized by the Gold Commissioner, that he could not acquire a title to any portion of the claim.\nARMOUR J. dissented from the judgment dismissing the appeal for the reasons stated by Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant; Pattullo and Ridley.\nSolicitors for the respondents; Noel, McKinnon and Noel.\n[1] 5 B.

It is impossible in the evidence before us to uphold the judgment of the trial judge affirmed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, being, as it is, manifestly against the evidence. The admissions made by the defendant to the plaintiffs of his indebtedness to Calder in the $50,000 balance of the $100,000 note and in one-half of the clean-up of 1899, amounting to $26,222, none of which admissions did he go into the witness-box and deny ; his assignment to the plaintiffs of Calder's one undivided half of the claim, 27 Eldorado ; his assignment of the dumps to the plaintiffs ; and his offering security to the plaintiffs for the amount of his indebtedness to Calder in respect of the $50,000 and the $26,222 ; were wholly inconsistent with the more than doubtful story which he afterwards set up that the $100,000 note was given by him to Calder \"in lieu of property and whatever I owed him at the time.\"\nThe erroneous rulings of the trial judge suffice also to set aside his judgment among which were his refusing to amend allowing the plaintiffs to allege an account stated, his refusing to allow the referee to consider the $50,000 and refusing to allow evidence to be given of the deposits made by the defendant in 1898 in banks and elsewhere.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and a new trial had, and the defendant should pay the costs of this court and of the court appealed from and the costs of the last trial, with leave to the parties to amend their pleadings as they may be advised.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C.

The Supreme Court of Canada was of opinion that no good result could be obtained by sending the case back for a new trial and, therefore, allowed the appeal and dismissed the action, thus reversing the concurrent findings of both courts below. Armour J., however, was of opinion that the proper course was to order a new trial.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory.\nThe case is stated in the judgments now reported.\nAylesworth K.C. for the appellant.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed. The evidence is unsatisfactory and somewhat conflicting. No evidence was given by the plaintiff from which damages could be estimated ; as the record now stands the only damages which could be given would be nominal. This is well shown by the fact that the trial judge in giving his judgment stated that he had been obliged to guess at the amount he assessed the damages at. I do not see that any good result would follow from sending back the case for another trial. We have before us the evidence of all of the parties who know anything about the facts, in dispute. On the main question, as to the agreement, the trial judge found on the facts for the plaintiff. I doubt very much whether I would have so found had I been trying the case, but accepting that finding as correct, the result would be that the plaintiff would get defendant's two-thirds of the property as a present. Accepting plaintiff's own statement as correct, there was no purchase of any specific goods, and no change of property or possession. The sale complained of was made by the defendant's agent, Campbell, day by day, and for the best prices obtainable. The amount realized, $11,103, fell short of the amount due to the defendant personally, and which had to be paid before the partnership became entitled to anything. This is perfectly clear from the evidence of the accountant Graff. Then again, I am of opinion that the agreement for the sale of the business to the plaintiff, if made, was rescinded, and that the plaintiff acquiesced in the sale of the goods by the defendant, having first taken away for himself about $1,300 worth. The evidence given by defendant of the plaintiff's acquiescence in the sale was uncontradicted and must, I think, be accepted. On that ground the action fails and should be dismissed.\nARMOUR J.\u2014The plaintiff and defendant were carrying on the hotel business in Dawson City under the following agreement: This agreement, made this 1st day of July, 1899, between J. A. Williams, party of the first part, and J. W. Stephenson, party of the second part, both of the town of Dawson, Yukon Territory, Canada.\nWitnesseth, That for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar ($1.00) lawful money of Canada, in hand paid said party of the first part by said party of the second part, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and certain services as manager of \" The Hoffman Hotel \" in said Dawson, to be performed by said second party, the said first party hereby agrees to convey unto said second party an one-third interest in said hotel business and the leases thereof and including everything used in the conduct thereof and belonging thereto, clear and free from incumbrance, when the profits of said business shall equal the capital invested therein, and said capital shall have been repaid to said Williams, it being understood and agreed between the parties hereto that said second party shall act as manager of said business without hinderance or reservation, and that the one-third interest to be conveyed as above mentioned shall be for the purpose of compensating said second party for services rendered as manager of said business.\nIn witness whereof the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and seals at Dawson, aforesaid, this the 10th day of August, 1899.\nJ. A. WILLIAMS.\nJ. W. STEPHENSON.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\nLEROY TOZIER.\nAnd on the 1st December, 1899, the following agreement was made between them according to the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses, which was accepted by the learned trial judge as true. That the defendant should retire from the business, and that the plaintiff should carry it on ; that the plaintiff should pay the defendant daily the net proceeds of the business until the debt due to the defendant in respect of the business should be paid off ; and that the stock in trade should continue to be under the control of the defendant and if the plaintiff wanted to use any of it for the daily running of the business, he was to take it, but at no time was he to take an amount of it greater than the amount of payments he had already made, for example, if to-day's receipts were $500 he was not to take over $500 worth, so that the security would be ample to protect the defendant.\nThere was no provision made for replacing the stock in trade if exhausted before the defendant was paid off.\nThe business was carried on by the plaintiff under the foregoing agreement from the 1st to the 10th of December when the defendant closed up the business and sold the goods, and for this breach by him of this agreement this action was brought.\nThe only evidence of damage was the following :\nQ. What do you estimate the damage you have sustained by reason of this breach of contract ?\u2014A. Well, he put me out of business. I was doing a good business and making money and I would have made between $5,000 and $10,000 in the house.\nThe learned trial judge said in giving judgment as to damages :\nWhat exactly should be given under the circumstances is only a guess which this court has to make. I think $10,000 which is claimed is too much. I reduce the same to $5,000 as a fair compensation to plaintiff.\nWith all due deference, I am of the opinion that it was not competent for the learned trial judge to guess the amount of damages in an action such as this which was an action to recover damages for the breach by the defendant of the agreement above set out.\nThe plaintiff should have given such evidence as would have enabled the learned trial judge to have ascertained the damages with reasonable certainty and not to have contented himself with also guessing as to his damages as he apparently did.\nEvidence should have been given showing the amount due to the defendant on the day he closed the business, the value of the goods on that day, deducting therefrom the value of the goods removed by the plaintiff and variously stated to be from $500 to $1,300, the length of time the carrying on of the business would have taken till the defendant's debt was paid off by the use of the said goods, the value of the goods which would have remained after such debt was paid off, and the value of the services of the plaintiff from the day the business was closed until such debt was paid off.\nThese things having been shown the value of the goods remaining alter the defendant's debt was paid off, less the value of the plaintiff's services, would have established with reasonable certainty the damages which the plaintiff sustained by reason of the breach by the defendant of the agreement.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial had between the parties and the plaintiff should pay the costs of this court and of the court appealed from and the costs of the trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: White, McCaul & Davey.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clarke, Wilson & Stakpole.\n"

(DEFENDANTS)\nRespondents.\n1903: Mar 6; 1903: Mar 10; 1903: May 5\nPRESENT:\u2014Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies, Mills and Armour JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nConstruction of will \u2014Opening of substitution \u2014 Legacy to substitutes\u2014 Legatees taking per stirpes or per capita,\nBy his will, which, created a substitution, the testator bequeathed the usufruct of all his property to his widow, during her lifetime and, after her death, to his surviving children and, by the sixth clause, provided as follows:\nQuant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes dits biens meubles et immeubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques que je d\u00e9laisserai au jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, je la donne et l\u00e8gue aux enfants l\u00e9gitimes de mes enfants, qui seront mes petits enfants; pour, par, mes dits petits-enfants, jouir, faire et disposer de mes dits biens en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et par \u00e9gales parts et portions entre eux, \u00e0 compter du jour que la dite jouissance et usufruit donn\u00e9s \u00e0 mes enfants cesseront, les instituant mes l\u00e9gataires universels en propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that all the grandchildren participated in the legacy and that the property representing the fifth of the revenue given to each of the testator's children. on the opening of the substitution created by the will. for such portion of his estate, should be divided among all the grandchildren then living in equal shares, the grandchildren taking per capita and not per stirpes.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs. The action was taken by one of the grandchildren of the deceased testator for a declaration that the will created a substitution which opened at the death of each of the institutes (his children), for the portion of the estate representing? the one-fifth of the revenues bequeathed to such institutes and that the partition should be made under the clauses of the will recited in the judgments now reported, among all the grandchildren per capita and not per stirpes. The defence was that the division among the grandchildren should be made per stirpes the children of each institute being called into the substitution for the share of which the revenue had been bequeathed to their respective parents to be equally divided between them and not among the whole of the grandchildren per capita. In the Superior Court, Cimon J. decided that the will created a substitution and that the children of the five institutes were entitled to receive per cavila the share of each of the institutes. The present appeal is from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench which reversed the decision of the trial judge Boss\u00e9 and W\u00fcrt\u00e9le JJ. dissenting, and decided; 1. That the will created a substitution; and 2. That the children of each institute were alone entitled to receive per stirpes the portion of their parent.\nStuart K.C. and Dorion for the appellants.\nBelleau K.C. and Malouin K.C. for the respondents\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the motions to quash and to add parties as appellants and also dismissing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court with costs in all the courts for the reasons stated by my brother Girouard\nGIIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une substitution et du partage d'une succession testamentaire valant une cinquantaine de mille piastres. L'intim\u00e9 fait d'abord motion pour renvoi de l'appel all\u00e9guant que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'appelant n'allait pas jusqu'\u00e0 $2,000. Ce que voyant un autre h\u00e9ritier et mis en cause, qui jusqu'ici n'avait pris a ucune part au litige, demande \u00e0 \u00eatre re\u00e7u partie appelante, et grossir ainsi l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des appelants, qui des lors d\u00e9passerait de beaucoup le montant fix\u00e9 pour la juridiction de cette cour. S'il nous paraissait n\u00e9cessaire de permettre \u00e0 cet h\u00e9ritier de se joindre aux appelants, ce serait notre devoir d'accorder sa motion. Tons les h\u00e9ritiers ont en effet int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 avoir une interpr\u00e9tation finale du testament de leur anc\u00eatre. Les appelants ont cependant \"produit des affidavits qui \u00e9tablissent que leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la cause exc\u00e8dent $2,000 et partant la motion de cet autre h\u00e9ritier mis en cause est inutile et elle est renvoy\u00e9e sans frais, ainsi que la motion pour le renvoi de l'appel faute de juridiction.\nIl ne nous reste plus qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9cider la cause au m\u00e9rite.\nIl s'agit du testament de Fran\u00e7ois Evanturel devant Mtre. Petitclerc et son confr\u00e8re, notaires, en date du 15 mai 1852 oui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 attire l'attention de tous les tribu neaux du pays, compris le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre cause de Evanturel v. Evanturel ([1]). La question soulev\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance se rapporte \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article Ge du testament qui dispose finalement des biens du testateur en faveur de ses petits-enfants. Toutes les parties admettent qu'il v a substitution et qu'elle s'ouvre pour autant an d\u00e9c\u00e8s de chaque gr\u00e8ve. Mais le partage doit-il se faire par souches on par t\u00eates? C'est l\u00e0 et l\u00e0 seulement qu'il y a divergence d'opinion.\nL'article Ge du testament d\u00e9clare;\u2014\nQuant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de mes dits biens meubles et immeubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques que je d\u00e9laisserai an jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, je la donne et l\u00e8gue aux enfants l\u00e9gitimes de mes enfants, qui seront mes petits-enfants; pour par mes petits enfants, jouir, faire et disposer de mes dits biens en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et par \u00e9gales parts et portions entre eux, \u00e0 compter du jour que la dite jouissance et usufruit donn\u00e9s \u00e0 mes enfants cesseront, les instituent mes l\u00e9gataires universels em propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance, (Cimon J.) d\u00e9cida que les petits-enfants \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s par t\u00eates et non pas par souches. La cour d'appel, (Boss\u00e9 et W\u00fcrt\u00e9le JJ., diff\u00e9rant) jugea tout le contraire. La Cour d'Appel proc\u00e8de comme si le testateur avait charg\u00e9 les enfants de rendre \u00e0 leurs propres enfants. Je ne lis pas le testament de cette fa\u00e7on.\nIl me semble crue les enfants sont charg\u00e9s de rendre \u00e0 tous les petits enfants du testateur collectivement, sans distinguer s'ils sont leurs propres enfants ou simplement leurs neveux et ni\u00e8ces. Nous sommes unanimement d'opinion que telle fut l'intention du testateur telle qu'il l'a manifest\u00e9e en son testament. L'opinion du juge Cimon et celle du juge W\u00fcrt\u00e9le expriment si parfaitement les motifs qui conduisent \u00e0 cette conclusion, qu'il nous suffit d'y renvoyer les parties. Nous nous contenterons d'une courte citation de l'opinion de M. le juge W\u00fcrt\u00e9le:\nIn the first place, the words used in clause six, by which the testator gives the ownership of his property to dis grandchildren, instituting them, collectively, his universal legatees in ownership, are plain distinct and capable of having a legal sense and effect and they should be construed according to their literal import and plain meaning. The words are that he bequeathes his property, in ownership, to his grandchildren from the death of his children, to be owned and enjoyed by them, and to be divided among them in equal shares from the day that the usufruct given to his children should cease to exist. The plain meaning of this disposition, it seems to me, is that all the grandchildren participate in the legacy and that the property representing the fifth of the revenue given to each of the testator's children on the opening of the substitution for that portion of his estate, is to be divided among all the grand-children then living, in equal shares, by heads and not by roots. The words being plain and not ambiguous, the literal import should be followed, for the function of the court is to construe or interpret the testator's words and to give effect to them and not to make a will for him by a supposition as to what his intention was, or by adding or implying any words which, may be thought to have been omitted * and it must be borne in mind that legal effect can be given to the words and expressions contained in this clause. There is nothing in the context which can indicate that that cannot be the meaning of words used, nor that it was the intention of the that the words should not be taken in their ordinary sense.\nL'appel est accord\u00e9 et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli, avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the judgment of the court for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr Justice Girouard.\nMILLS J. In this case I concur in the judgment of my brother Girouard.\nI hold that the children took from the testator a life interest and that, upon the death of the children, the property went to the grand-children, so that the grandchildren took directly under the will from the testator and so took per capita and not per stirpes\nARMOUR J.\u2014The question for our determination arises upon the will of Fran\u00e7ois Evanturel, senior, who died on the seventeenth of May, 1852, and the following provisions of the will are those necessary to be considered in arriving at such determination.\nFourthly: I give to Marie Anne B\u00e9dard, my wife, the enjoyment and usufruct of all the rest of my property, moveable and immoveable, for my said wife to have the enjoyment and usufruct of all my said property during her life time, from the day of my death, instituting my said wife my usufructuary legatee, without her being obliged to have an inventory made of my said property; my said wife being obliged to pay an annual life rent of sixty pounds to each of my children born of my present marriage with her who shall not be married on the day of my death, from the day of their respective marriage and during the lifetime of my said wife, which life rent shall be payable to the husband of each of my daughters who would be married and would die before my said wife \u00ab Fifthly: I order that after the death of the said Marie Anne B\u00e9dard, my wife, if I die before her, all my furniture, animals, carriages and other moveables, which I shall die possessed of, be sold by public or private sale by my testamentary executor hereinafter named,, and that the price thereof be deposited by my said testamentary executor in one of the savings banks of this city and that the price of my said moveables be used solely for the keeping of and repairs of the houses and dependencies which I shall die possessed of; and I order further that, after the death of my said wife, the enjoyment and usufruct of the rest of my property moveable and immoveable whatsoever, which I shall die possessed of, pass and go to the children born and to be born of my present marriage with my said wife; to which, my said children, I give and bequeath the enjoyment and usufruct of my said property, for my said children to have the said enjoyment and usufruct during their lifetime, from the day of the death of Marie Anne B\u00e9dard, their mother, until the death of each of my said children respectively, my said children to divide by equal shares between them the income of my said property; and, if any one of my said children should die without leaving any legitimate issue of his marriage, or if he should die before having been married, then and in such case, I order that the share of my said child who should so die without leaving any legitimate issue, or before having been married, in the income of my said property, pass and go to my other children then living, who shall enjoy the said share by equal parts between them during their lifetime as aforesaid; this present legacy is so made to my said children on the express condition that the share coming to each of them in the income of my said property shall not be seizable in any manner whatsoever by any of the creditors of my said children, respectively, for such is my will;\nSixthly: As to the ownership of my said property, moveable and immoveable whatsoever, which I shall die possessed of I give and bequeath it to the legitimate children of my children, who shall be my grand-children, for my said grand-children to enjoy possess and dispose of my said property in full ownership and in equal shares between them, from the day on which the said enjoyment and usufruct given to my children shall cease, instituting them my universal legatees in ownership.\n.And the question is. Was it the intention of the testator that his grand-children should take per capita or per stirpes?\nIn my opinion, the grand-children take per capita and not per stirpes. The language of the will is plain and unambiguous and I do not see how the testator could have more clearly expressed his intention that his grand-children should take per capita than he has done.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C. E. Dorion.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Malouin, B\u00e8dard et Chalout.\n[1] 5 B. L. 606; 1 Q. L. B. 74, 144; L. B. 6 P. C, 1.\n"

J. and Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies and Armour JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPublic work\u2014Negligence of Grown officials\u2014Right of action\u2014Liability of the Crown\u201450 & 51 V., c. 16, ss. 16 23, 58\u2014Jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court\u2014Prescription\u2014Art. 2261 C. C.\nLands in the vicinity of the Lachine Canal were injuriously affected through flooding caused by the negligence of the Crown officials in failing to keep a siphon-tunnel clear and in proper order to carry off the waters of a stream which had been diverted and carried under the canal and also by part of the lands being spoiled by dumping excavations upon it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (7 Ex. C. R. 1), Davies J. dissenting, that the owner had a right of action and was entitled to recover damages for the injuries sustained and that the Exchequer Court of Canada had exclusive original jurisdiction in the matter under the provisions of the 16th, 23rd and 58th sections of the Exchequer Court Act. The Queen v. Filion (24 Can, s. C. r. 482) approved; The City of Quebec v. The Queen (24 Can. S. C. R. 430) referred to.\nThe prescription established by art. 2261 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada applies to the damages claimed by appellant in his Petition of Right.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing \"the suppliant's Petition of Right with costs.\nBy his Petition of Right the Suppliant complained, among other things, that his lands had been injuriously affected on account of the Government of Canada assuming control and diverting the course of the River St. Pierre for public uses for the benefit of and in connection with the Lachine Canal and constructing drains in the vicinity; that a portion of his property had been taken and spoiled by throwing back upon it a quantity of earth from the excavations made, and that it had been rendered useless through flooding caused by the neglect of the officers of the Crown to clear and maintain in good order a siphon-tunnel intended to carry off the subsidiary drainage and the waters of the River St. Pierre which had been diverted from their natural channel and made to pass, by this tunnel, underneath the Lachine Canal.\nThe judgment of the Court dismissed the Petition of Right with costs and the suppliant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMar\u00e9chal K. C and Belcourt K. C. for the appellant, cited Davidson v. The Queen[2]; The City of Quebec v. The Queen[3]; The Queen v. Filion[4]; The Queen v. McLeod[5]; 17 Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law (1892) ed.) p. 183, and arts. 501, 1057 C. C.\nNewcombe K. C. and Hutchinson K. C. for the respondent. Under art. 2261 C. C., damages such as claimed are prescribed by two years. Consequently, appellant's claim must, in any event, be restricted to damages suffered for the two years immediately preceding the date of his Petition of Eight. Prescription is not pleaded, but it was not necessary that it should be pleaded; art. 2188 C. C.; Dorions. Crowley,[6]; Kerr v. The Atlantic and Northwest Railway Co.[7]; No damages are proved to have been suffered during this period. The appellant acquired this property in 1891 and 1892. There has been no construction of any public works in the vicinity since those dates, except the completion of the collecting drains, and the deepening and straightening of the river, which have much improved the appellant's property.\nUnder sec. 16, of 50 & 51 Vict., ch. 16, the appellant cannot possibly have any right of action; The City of Quebec v. The Queen[8].\nAs to the claim of $544. as the value of land taken for works done on the River St. Pierre, the respondent quotes the reasons of the learned Judge of the Exchequer Court, at page 8 of the Exchequer Court Reports, vol. vii., and the cases there cited.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The statute of 1867[9] by sec. 31 provides for the appointment of official arbitrators\nwho shall arbitrate on, appraise, determine and award the sums which shall be paid to any person for land or property taken for any public work, or for loss or damage caused by such taking[10].\nUnder secs. 34, 35, 37, claims for property taken, or for damage to property arising from the construction may be referred to official arbitrators[11].\nThe statute 33 Vict. c. 23 [sec. 1] (1870) \"An Act to extend the powers of the official arbitrators,\" authorises the reference to official arbitrators, (besides claims for damages to property, or for property taken,) of claims\narising out of any death, or any injury to person or property on any public work\u2014provided [sec. 2] that nothing herein contained shall be construed as making it imperative on the Government to entertain any claim under this Act, but that Head of the Department shall refer to arbitrators such claims only as he may be instructed so to refer by the Governor-in-Council.\nThe statute 44 Vict. c. 25, sec. 27 (1881), (Railway Act) extends the previous right of reference to official arbitrators to claims as to damages to property, etc., by any Dominion railway[12]; and, by subsec. 3 of sec 27, to claims for any death or injury to person or property on any such railway,\nbut the arbitrators' duty in such case shall be confined to reporting bis or their findings upon the questions of fact, and upon the amount of damages, if any, sustained, and the principles upon which such amount has been computed[13].\nNow come in chronological order the cases of The Queen v. McFarlane[14]; and of McLeod v. The Queen[15], 1882-1883, which determine that no statute up to 1883 altered the rule that the Crown was not liable in tort or damages for negligence of its officers.\nNext comes in 1886, the Revised Statute, ch. 40, which embodies the above statutory provisions as to official arbitrators.\nThen comes in 1887 The Exchequer Court Act, 50 51 Vict., ch. 16, s. 58, which repeals ch. 40 of the Revised Statutes, and enacts that for the purposes of any reference as authorised by the said Act for claims against the Crown, the Exchequer Court shall replace the official arbitrators. By sec. 23, it is enacted that \"any\" claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by Petition of Right, and secs, 15 and 16 give exclusive original jurisdiction thereon to the Exchequer Court. So that this action lies in law. Such is the jurisprudence of this court as finally settled by The Queen v. Filion[16].\nWe are of opinion in this case, however, that the only damages that the appellant can in law recover against the Crown under subsec. 3 of sec. 16 of the Exchequer Court Act, are those that he suffered within the two years preceding his action by the negligence of the officers of the Crown in not keeping the siphon-culvert clear and in proper order.\nWe do not see anything in The City of Quebec v The Queen[17], that militates against his right to recover these damages. There is no question of jurisdiction in the case. If the appellant had a right of action, the Exchequer Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over it. And upon the authority of The Queen v. Filion,[18] under secs. 16, 23 and 58 of the Exchequer Court Act this right of action cannot be controverted. He should also get compensation for that part of his land that was taken, for which he claims $544. He may not be entitled to more than half that sum, perhaps, but we have nothing to do with assessing the damages either upon this head or upon the first one.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs and the case referred to the Exchequer Court to assess, 1st the damages that the appellant has suffered during the two years preceding his action by the negligence of the officers of the Crown in not keeping the siphon-culvert clear and in proper order; 2nd the damages suffered by the appellant by throwing back upon his land part of the bank dug up in widening the River St. Pierre, unless the appellant agrees, within three months from this date, to accept in full compensation the sum of seven hundred dollars with interest from the date of the Petition of Right, in which case, upon his filing his consent to that effect, judgment will then be entered against the respondent for that amount with interest as aforesaid and costs in the Exchequer Court, less the costs of the trial incurred in respect of the claims of the appellant which are not hereby allowed.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014On the authority of The City of Quebec v The Queen (1), and The Queen v Filion(2) I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed for the reasons given by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court. I do not, however, wish to commit myself to the proposition laid down by him that if there had been jurisdiction to try the action, actionable negligence had been proved. The damming of the siphon drain appears to have been caused by an extraordinary flood which the authorities had no reason to anticipate, and for the results of which they would not be responsible.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: L.

In an action brought after his death by his universal legatee to recover damages for loss of the use of the ice-house during the unexpired term of the lease :\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that the reservation in the first action did not preserve any further right of action in consequence of the expropriation and, therefore, the plaintiff s action was properly dismissed by the courts below, a?, in such cases, all damages capable of being foreseen must be assessed once for all and a defendant cannot be twice sued for the same cause The City of Montreal v.

R.11) followed\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, dismissing the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe \"plaintiff's deceased husband leased an ice-house for nine years from the 30th April, 1899, by deed of lease dated 7th January, 1899. On 4th January, 1901, the City of Quebec took possession of a portion of the leased premises for public purposes under expropriation proceedings previously taken in virtue of powers conferred by the city charter and the lessee brought action against the city for $5,000 damages as indemnity for injures suffered by him as tenant of the leased property on account of such expropriation, with special reservation of his recourse for other damages. On 29th June, 1901 he was awarded $350 damages and this judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Court of King's Bench. The appellant, after her husband's death, brought the present action, as his universal legatee and testamentary executrix, claiming $7,000 damages for loss of the use of the leased property during the unexpired term of the lease. The respondent pleaded res judicata. The trial judge maintained that plea and dismissed the action with costs. The Court of Review affirmed this judgment and the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBelcourt K.C. and Beaubien KG. for the appellant. Sir Alphonse Pelletier K. C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral) are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. In view of the express reservation in his first action of the claim for the damages upon which his present action is grounded, the appellant may be night m his contention that the judgment a quo is wrong in holding that there is resjudicata as to such damages by the judgment in that action. He cannot, however, succeed upon this his second action and it was rightly dismissed by the Court of King's Bench, affirming the Superior Court ; and this we hold upon the ground that his damages had to be assessed once for all and that the law gave him only one action therefor. if he did not include them all in his first action, he must suffer the consequences of his failure to do so. They then were all known to him and were not unforeseen, if that were material. His reservation of the right to a second action was illegal and can be of no avail to him, though prescription cannot be invoked against him. The law protects the defendant from being twice sued for the same cause. The city of Montreal v. McGee ([1]); The Chaudi\u00e8re Machine and Foundry Co v. The Canada Atlantic Railway Co.

This direction was carried out after his death, and the Attorney General claimed succession duty on the whole estate.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed against (35 N. S.

Lovitt, late of Yarmouth, in the Province of Nova Scotia, ship owner, departed this life at Yarmouth, on the fourteenth day of November, A.D. 1900, having first made his last will and testament, whereby he appointed the defendants, Irvine A. Lovitt, John Lovitt and Erastus H. Lovitt his executors and trustees of his estate.\nProbate of the said will was duly granted by the Judge of the Court of Probate in the County or Yarmouth, on the nineteenth day of November, A.D., 1900, and a true copy of the said will is hereunto annexed.\nThe inventory filed in the Court of Probate by the said executors contains, among other property, the following:\nProvince of Nova Scotia Debentures, issued under Chapter 3, Acts of N. S. for 1889\n$15,000 00\nAccrued interest on do\n491 70\nThe whole estate was appraised at the sum of $440,442.13, and debts and executor's commissions, amounted to $22,868.10.\nSection 5 of chapter 3 of the Acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia for the year 1889 enacts as follows:\n\"The debentures issued under authority of this Act shall not be liable to taxation for provincial, local, or municipal purposes in Nova Scotia.\"\nThe Attorney General for the Province of Nova Scotia claims, and the defendants deny, that the said sum of $15,491.70 so invested and held by testator in provincial debentures, should be included in the estate, for the purpose of fixing the amount of succession duty payable, and that duty should be paid in respect thereto.\nThe questions for the decision of the court are:\n1. Should the sum so invested in provincial debentures be included in the valuation of the estate for the purpose of fixing the amount of succession duty payable?\n2. If not, should the said sum be deducted from the residue or should a proportionate part be deducted from each legacy and duty be calculated on the basis of the amounts so reduced?\nThe first question having been answered in the affirmative the executors appealed to this court.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The duty is a tax upon the estate, not on the legatee or devisee. Re Estate of Swift[2] per Gray J.; Bittinger's Estate[3]; Attorney General v. Newman[4].\nThe cases of Lambe v. Manuel[5], and Thomson v. The Advocate General[6] were also referred to.\nMackay for the respondent. The duty is not a tax on property but on the privilege of taking property by will or intestacy. Mager v. Grima[7]; Minot v. Winthrop[8]. And see Wallace v. Myers[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I fully concur in Mr. Justice Grraham's reasoning in the court below. The wording of the statute is perhaps not strictly accurate, but these succession duties cannot generally be considered otherwise than duties not on the property itself, but on the transmission of that property, and the appellant has failed to convince me that the legislature of Nova Scotia intended to deviate from the principle upon which legislation of this nature is generally assumed to be based.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. DAVIES J.\u2014Part of the estate of George H. Lovitt, appellant's testator, consisted of debentures of the Province of Nova Scotia. These debentures were issued under chapter 3 of the Acts of 1889, (N.S.), which contains this provision;\nThe debentures issued under the authority of this Act shall not be liable to taxation for provincial, local or municipal purposes in Nova Scotia.\nTestator, by his will, after having made certain specific bequests and devises, directed that the residue of his estate should be converted into money and that the same should be invested by his executors and held by them upon the trusts in his will mentioned. The respondent claims succession duty under chapter 8 of the Acts or 1895[10], from the legatees in respect to the whole estate including the Provincial debentures, while appellants claim that the amount realized from the sale of the debentures should be exempt under the above provision of chapter 3 of the Acts of 1889.\nThe 4th section of the Succession Duty Act, 1895, exempted from its operation all estates the value of which, after payment of the debts and expenses of administration, did not exceed $5,000; and (2) property passing under a will, intestacy or otherwise to or for the father, mother, husband, wife, child, grandchild, daughter-in-law or son-in-law of deceased where the value of the property so passing did not exceed $25,000. The 5th section is as follows:\n5. Save as aforesaid all property situate or being within the Province of Nova Scotia, and any interest therein or income therefrom, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto last dwelt within said province or not, passing either by will or intestacy, or which shall be voluntarily transferred by deed, grant or gift made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or bargainor, or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after such death, to any person in trust or otherwise, or by reason whereof any person shall become beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to any property or the income thereof, and all property wherever situate or being over which the trustee, executor or administrator shall or may exercise control, and which shall or may come into his possession, shall be subject to a succession duty, to be paid for the use of the province, over and above the fees provided by chapter 128 of the Revised Statutes, fifth series.\nThe subsections following regulated the rates of duty to be charged which varied and depended upon the amount of the estate and upon the degree of relationship to the deceased, of the person to whom the property passed.\nSubsequent sections of the Act provided that the duty payable in respect to an annuity should be paid in four equal annual payments with a proviso that if the annuitant died before payments were completed no further duty should be payable. There were also special provisions regulating the time and manner of payment of the duty where any property was devised, bequeathed or descended to or for the benefit of different persons in succession. The 18th section declared that in addition to the person receiving the property, executors, trustees, &c., through whose hands it passed should be accountable for the duty.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that succession duties were payable upon the whole estate which came into the hands of the executors for distribution to the legatees under the testator's will and that the amount of the estate represented by these debentures was not exempted from the duty, on the broad ground that the succession duty was not a tax upon the debentures themselves or the money they represented, but a duty or burden imposed by the province upon the passing or devolution, or privilege of taking or receiving property under wills and intestate laws. The debentures in the hands of the executors were not liable to any tax or duty, nor when they were sold by the executors as provided for by the will would they be liable in the hands of any purchaser, but the passing or transfer of the proceeds when it came into the hands of the executor and was transferred by him to the beneficiaries under the will operated to bring into effect the succession duty. If these proceeds of the sale of the debentures, when they became part of the estate and were so transferred to and divided amongst the beneficiaries, were exempted from the succession duties and the debentures passed to the purchaser free of duty or tax, the anomalous condition would have existed of the estate profiting by the sale at an enhanced price of the debentures because of their exemption from duty and holding and dividing the proceeds under the will among the legatees also without paying duty. But it is fair to say that even if the testator had specifically devised the debentures to a legatee the transfer to the legatee by virtue of the provincial law would be subject to the payment of the duty or burthen placed upon it by the act. It comes back again to the principle underlying and governing the judgment appealed from that the duty is not a tax upon the property as such at all but a burthen, bonus, excise duty or assessment as variously defined, imposed by the Government upon the passing or devolution of the property by will or intestacy to the beneficiaries, such duty or burthen being regulated and determined in its amount or extent by the relationship of the beneficiary to the testator.\nThe statute in question is one modeled upon and closely following similar statutes of the States of New York and Pennsylvania, (ch.713 Laws of 1887, N.Y.; No. 37 Laws of 1887, Pa.,) and does not follow the Imperial legislation by which legacy succession and estate duties were imposed. In the sections imposing the duty the phraseology of the Nova Scotia Act now under consideration and the New York and Pennsylvania Acts are almost identical. Mr. Justice Graham who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has cited and reviewed most of the cases determined in the New York and Pennsylvania Courts of Appeal and in the Supreme Court of the United States, where questions substantially the same as that now before us were determined. There is a concensus of opinion in all these courts and in many courts of appeal of other States of the Union on statutes of a similar kind, to the effect that these statutes must be construed as imposing a burden upon the passing, transmission or devolution of the property as distinguished from taxes imposed upon property real or personal as such because of its ownership or possession. I fully agree with the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Graham. I would merely add to the authorities cited by him that of Knowlton v. Moore[11]. The judgment of the Court was pronounced by Mr. Justice White, who said, p. 47:\nIt is conceded on all sides that the levy and collection of some form of death duty is provided by the sections of the law in question. Taxes of this general character are universally deemed to relate not to property eo nomine, but to its passage by will or by descent in cases of intestacy as distinguished from taxes imposed on property real or personal as 6uch, because of its ownership or possession. In other words the public contribution which death duties exact is predicated on the passing of the property as the result of death as distinct from a tax on property disassociated from its transmission or receipt by will or as the result of intestacy.\nSee also Dos Passos on Inheritance Tax Law, par. 8. I am of the opinion that the succession duty imposed by the Succession Duty Act 1895 is not a tax upon property as such but rather an impost upon the privilege of taking or transmitting property by will or intestacy, and that while the value of the property is the measure of the amount of the duty it is upon the privilege that the duty is imposed. In the case of limited interests such as life estates it is the estimated value of the limited interest and not the property which fixes the amount of the duty payable, but the nature of the tax remains the same. The duty upon a life interest is not payable out of the corpus, but out of the income. The duty varies according to the degree of relationship of the person succeeding to the property to the person from whom or from whose estate the property comes, and it is only paid once, that is when the beneficiary takes or receives the amount of his gift, legacy or devise as the case may be.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nMILLS J:\u2014One George H. Lovitt, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia made a will in which he disposed of, among other things, certain bonds which had been issued by the Government of Nova Scotia under a statute passed by the Legislature in 1889, and which expressly provided that the debentures issued under the authority of that Act should not be liable to taxation, for provincial, local or municipal purposes in Nova Scotia.\nThere was enacted by the Legislature in the previous year a statute to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to municipal assessments, by section 6 of which, funds invested in provincial or municipal debentures were exempt from taxation. Section 5 of that statute enacts\nThat no income shall be taxed which is derived from provincial or municipal debentures, exempted from taxation by Acts of this Province. By the statute of 1895, known as the Succession Duty Act, it was provided by section 5, that save as aforesaid, all property situate or being within the Province of Nova Scotia, and any interest therein, or any income therefrom, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto last dwelt within said Province or not, passing either by will or intestacy, or which shall be voluntarily transferred by deed, grant or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, or bargainor or made or intended to take effect in possession or in enjoyment after such death, to any person in trust or otherwise, or by reason whereof any person shall become beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to any property, or the income thereof, and all property wherever situate or being over which the trustee, executor, or administrator shall or may exercise control, and which shall or may come into his possession, shall be subject to a succession duty, to be paid for the use of the Province, over and above the fees provided by chapter 128, of the Revised Statutes fifth series.\n1. When the value of the property of the deceased after payment of all debts and expenses as aforesaid, exceeds $25.000 and passes to the persons named in this subsection; or\n2 Where the value of the property after such payments exceeds $100,000 a duty of $5.00 per every hundred.\n3. Where the value of a property after payment as aforesaid exceeds $5,00 so much as passes to the benefit of a lineal ancestor other than father or mother, or to any brother or sister of the deceased, a duty of $5.00 per every hundred dollars.\nIn this case among the assets were $15,000 in provincial bonds issued under the provincial Act in question, not being liable to taxation under that provision of the statute which I have quoted, and the inquiry was for the purpose of determining whether these bonds should be considered in fixing the amount of property subject to the succession duty. The first question to be considered is whether the imposition of such a duty is taxation upon property, or whether it is a sum paid for the transmission from the last owner to the person entitled to receive it. I attach no importance to the contention that a succession duty is not a tax imposed upon the property, but is a mere charge for the privilege of transmission. If it did not so frequently fall within the domain of experience, I would scarcely consider it credible that any one could persuade himself by an argument of this kind. Let me suppose for a moment, that this property had been devised to some one who at the time had no property; instead of receiving the full amount bequeathed, he would find in its transmission that five per cent of its value had been taken out by the executor or administrator, as the case might be, to pay the Government for the privilege of receiving it, and that instead of receiving the whole of what had been bequeathed to him, he would find that $50.00 was retained out of every thousand to pay the succession duty. Could he be persuaded that the property which had been bequeathed to him was not subject to taxation, that this was not a charge upon the property at all, but a toll taken for permitting it to pass from his dead ancestor to himself?\nIt matters not whether the tax is direct or indirect, whether it is a charge upon the property, or upon leave to receive it, it is still a tax imposed for a public purpose, upon the property bequeathed, and the sum total is diminished by the amount of succession duty so charged. Here, the tax is imposed for a specific purpose,\u2014it is to raise a revenue for the support of a particular institution. It is money levied upon the estates of deceased persons for this purpose, and being so levied, it is as much a tax as any other which it is possible for a legislature to impose. Webster defines a tax as a rate or sum of money assessed on the person or property of a citizen, by government for the use of the state. Taxes in free Governments are usually made upon the property of citizens according to their income, or according to the value of their estates. Tax is a term of general import, including almost every species of imposition on persons or property for supplying the public treasury, as tolls, tributes, subsidies, excise, imposts, or customs. But more generally, tax is limited to the sum laid upon polls, lands, houses, horses, cattle, professions, and occupations. Tax is defined in the encyclopedic dictionary as a contribution imposed by authority upon the people to meet the expenses of government, or other public services. A government imposition is a charge made by the state on the income or property of individuals, or on the products consumed by them. A tax is said to be direct when it is demanded from the very person whom it is intended, or desired should pay it, as a poll tax, an income tax, property tax, taxes for keeping servants, etc. An indirect tax is one demanded from one person who is expected and intended to recoup or indemnify himself at the expense of another, as in customs or excise duties.\nIt is a matter of no consequence whether the tax is meant to be a charge upon the property, or upon the transmission of the property; it is in either case a burden imposed for a public purpose, to be met by the person, in the case of succession duties, to whom the property may go. Some taxes are paid periodically; some are paid upon the happening of a particular event; but no matter in which way, they are alike taxes\u2014burdens, imposed by the state for public purposes. A charge imposed, as a stamp duty upon a bill of exchange, or note, though imposed but once for all, is not less a tax, than a charge imposed periodically upon lands, or upon income\u2014such charges are monies taken from some one by the state, to meet some public requirement. Taxes may be made on legacies, and on inheritances, when the money or capital held by one party is, by reason of his death, in the course of transmission to another. If the property is still retained in the family, it may well be that they are worse off than before, and the tax upon the succession may diminish the amount of capital by the amount of the tax at a time when the income is lessened by the death of the one chiefly relied upon for support, and when the disbursements may be largely increased. Succession duties are usually levied on testamentary gifts. Sometimes they are confined to collateral successions only. It may well be, that a government and legislature exempt certain public securities from taxation, in order that those securities may so command a higher market value. It would be a gross breach of faith, after having received a larger sum from the sale of public securities by reason of their being exempt from taxation, to impose a further charge upon them. This would be, in fact, receiving a double taxation, first, in the form of an advanced price, and secondly by the imposition of a further burden upon them.\nIt is a fair question to consider whether the words of the statute, properly interpreted, imply an absolute or qualified exemption from taxation. It has been held that a general declaration of exemption from taxation of every kind will not exempt from an assessment for street improvements specially beneficial to the exempted property. Sheehan v. The Good Samaritan Hospital[12]. An exemption from all taxes and assessments has been held to exempt from assessments for benefits as well as exemptions from general taxes. The State v. City of Newark[13]. In a New York case, where a public cemetery was, by law, exempt from \"all public taxes, rates and assessments,\" it was nevertheless held by the court not to be exempt from the paving assessment. Folger J. said in that case:\nWe think that the current of authorities in this and some of the sister states runs to this result: that public taxes, rates, and assessments are those that are levied and taken out of the property of the person assessed for some public or general use or purpose, in which he has no direct, immediate and peculiar interest; being exactions from him towards the expense of carrying on the government, either directly, and in general that of the whole Commonwealth, or more immediately and particularly, through the intervention of municipal corporations, and that those charges and impositions which are laid directly upon the property in a certain circumscribed locality, to affect some work of local convenience which in its results is of peculiar advantage and importance to the property especially assessed for the expense of it, are not public but are local and private so far as this statute is concerned. Buffalo City Cemetery v. City of Buffalo[14].\nIn another case, City of Patterson v. Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures[15] the exemption was from \"taxes charges, and impositions\" but it was held not to extend so far as to exempt from assessment for grading and paving a street. In another New Jersey case The State v. City of Newark[16] the exemption was \"from charges and impositions,\" and the same ruling was had. These cases shew that the exemption is from taxation imposed for ordinary revenue, and that it does not exempt from special charges from which special advantages are derived. But where the language is explicit, exempting from all taxes and assessments, it has been held to exempt from assessments by which the property is to benefit as well as from the burden of general taxation.\nSuccession to an inheritance, it is true, may be taxed as a privilege and notwithstanding the property is already taxed, but it ought to be clear and explicit that the legislature intended the burden. The question we have here to consider is whether under the statute of Nova Scotia the property is exempt from the burden of a succession duty. It is expressly provided by the statute that, \"the debentures issued under the authority of this Act shall not be liable to taxation for provincial, local, or municipal purposes, in Nova Scotia.\" This is as far as the legislature could go; it could not protect him if domiciled elsewhere, as then the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam would apply; but here the legislature went to the full extent of its authority in declaring that neither the provincial legislature, nor any body acting under its authority, should tax these bonds. But it is said that this tax is not a tax upon the bonds, but a tax upon their transmission. The statute declares otherwise. The distinction may have served the purpose of enabling the courts in the United States to surmount a constitutional difficulty, but it has no applicability here. There is a burden, as the law has been construed, imposed on the holders of these bonds, from which the Legislature of Nova Scotia expressly promised they should be exempt. By the statute of 1889, ch. 3, sec. 5, it is provided that the debentures issued under the authority of that Act, shall not be liable to taxation for provincial, local, or municipal purposes in Nova Scotia. This succession duty is a tax imposed for provincial purpose\u2014to provide a fund for defraying in part the care of the insane, by a succession duty on certain estates. It is not a charge for the privilege of transmission, but a charge upon the estate, and declared to be so in express words. The law is not less violated were it true that the charge is not upon the property, but upon its transmission; but this contention is without foundation, as it is negatived by the words of the statute. Sec. 5 provides that all properties situate or being within the province of Nova Scotia, and any interests therein, or income therefrom, passing either by will or intestacy, and all property wherever situate or being, over which the trustee, executor, or administrator shall or may exercise control, and which shall or may come into his possession, shall be subject to a succession duty. This duty is a first charge upon the property, and it is made the duty of the executor or administrator (sec. 18) to retain out of the properly the amount of the duty, and he is not to deliver the property subject to the duty, until he has deducted his duty therefrom, and by section 19, the executor or administrator is authorised to sell so much of the property as may be necessary for the payment of the duly. It is a burden upon the estate, the same as any other indebtedness, which must be met out of the estate. The Act imposes not simply a charge upon the person who may receive the estate, but a tax upon the property itself, and it is to be diminished in the hands of the executor or administrator, by the payment of this claim made on the part of the provincial government. It is the property which passes that is subject to the duty. It is not a burden imposed for the privilege of transmission but a burden imposed for the purpose mentioned, and it is impossible to successfully contend in the face of the provisions of the statute, that the burden is not a tax upon the property, but a tax on the act of transmission. The words of the statute are all property situate, or being within the Province of Nova Scotia, or any interest therein, ox income therefrom, shall be subject to a succession duty to be paid for the use of the province; it is upon the property, and not on the right of succession that the statute imposes the burden, and therefore, the rule which the courts in the United States have found it necessary to adopt, in order to escape from a constitutional difficulty, has no applicability here; the words of the statute are plain, the burden is imposed not simply upon the transmission but upon the property which is the subject of transmission. In the case of Pullen v. The Commissioners of Wake County[17] Rodman J. says,\nWe do not regard the tax in question as a tax on property, but rather as a tax imposed upon the succession, on the right of the legatee to take under the will.\nIn Strode v. The Commonwealth[18], Chapman P. T. said;\nNow this is not to be viewed as a tax assessed upon the estate of the decedent, or of any one, but a restriction upon the right of acquisition by those who, under the law regulating the transmission of property, are entitled to take as beneficiaries without consideration. The state is still made one of the beneficiaries. It lays its hands upon the estates under such circumstances, and claims a share, and whether the share exempted is exacted as a tax, or duty, or whatever else, is of no consequence.\nAnd the learned judge considered that the tax was therefore an exercise of the same power as a change in the law of descent.\nI need not analyse this doctrine, and show how far a constitutional difficulty has carried the courts of the neighboring republic away from the doctrine of the common law in respect to property. This rule does not apply to the case before us. The words of the statute are against it. We would be ignoring them were we to say that this succession duty is not a tax upon the property.\nNo doubt if a state chose to do so it could provide that no one should have any right of property preaching beyond a life estate; that upon the death of the owner the property should vest in the state, and be made to retest in certain individuals, upon the payment of a certain percentage of its ascertained value, but it would require a very clear statement that this was the intention of the legislature, before it would be accepted. It is declared here, that the property in question is to be exempt from all taxes, (an expression which includes succession charges as well as any other,) provincial, local, and municipal, which embraces every form of tax that can be imposed by the provincial legislature, or by any municipal body under its authority. This exemption was no doubt adopted to appreciate the value of the bonds, and to obtain for them a higher price than if no such exemption existed, and it is not consistent, in my opinion, with the honour of the legislature to suppose that they endeavoured to mislead the purchaser, and to secure from him a higher price for their securities than they would otherwise have commended In the case of Thompson v. The Advocate General[19] in which after deciding that the property in question was not liable to the legacy duty by reason of the domicile of the deceased not being a British domicile, Lord Campbell observed:\nI think this caution should be introduced, that this exemption applies only to legacy duty, and not to probate duty. But with respect to the probate duty, if it is necessary to take out probate (the property being in Great Britain) for the purpose of administering the property, it would still be considered as situate in Great Britain, and the probate duty would attach.\nAnd their Lordships were all agreed that where the deceased leaves a will, all the personal property, situate in Great Britain, passing under that will, is liable to probate duty, but not to legacy duty\nIn Wallace v. the Attorney General[20], it was held that a succession duty was not payable upon legacies given by the will of a person domiciled in a foreign country. The Lord Chancellor said\u2014\"That no claim could be sustained for a legacy duty, was not disputed. The law on that subject was finally settled in the House of Lords, in Thompson v. The Advocate General[21]\". And the converse proposition was settled by the Attorney General v. Napier[22]. It was held in England in the case of The Lord Advocate v. Fleming[23], that where a policy for life insurance on the life of a father was voluntarily assigned by him to his daughter, several years before his death, during which time she paid the premium, she was held not liable to the payment of succession duty, as she had become entitled to the property prior to the death of her father.\nTo say that a tax may be imposed upon property in passing from one person to another, is a proposition perfectly consistent with the settled law of property, but to maintain that such an imposition is not a tax, but a charge imposed upon the beneficiary for the privilege of being allowed to succeed, is a proposition inconsistent with the words of the statute by which the duty is created, and in my opinion will be very difficult to bring within the taxing power of the Province in the face of The Attorney General for Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Co.[24] decided by the Judicial Committee, and also with The Attorney General for Quebec v. Reed[25].\nIn my opinion the debentures in question are exempt from taxation, and ought not to be included in the value of the estate for the purpose of fixing the amount of succession duty payable, as such charge is inconsistent with the terms of the statute by which the issue of these debentures was authorized.\nARMOUR J.\u2014I agree in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Lewis Chipman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. A. Mackay. On a subsequent day a motion was made to vary the judgment as settled by the Registrar by striking out the portion giving costs to the respondent.\nBorden, K.C, in support of the motion, contended that except where it was altered by statute the common law rule that the Crown never paid nor received costs was in force in Canada, and there is no such statute in Nova Scotia. He cited 3 Blackstone, p. 533 sec. 400; The King v. Archbishop of Canterbury[26]; Reg. v. Beadle[27]; Maxwell on Statutes 3 ed. p. 186.\nBurritt contra.\nJudgment on the motion was delivered for the majority of the Court by;\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The Court is of opinion that the motion must be refused with costs.\nSection 62 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act provides as follows:\nThe Supreme Court may, in its discretion, order the payment of the costs of the court appealed from, and also of the appeal, or any part thereof, as well when the judgment appealed from is varied or reversed as where it is affirmed.\nFor twenty-five years this section, as all the other sections of the Act, has been construed as applicable to the Crown. It was so interpreted, for instance, in the cases of Attorney General v. Flint [28] and The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia[29]; and in The Maritime Bank v. The Queen[30], and The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. Receiver General of New Brunswick[31] no costs were given in this court because the court was of opinion that they were not proper cases for so doing, but upon appeal to the Privy Council costs were given to the Crown against the appellants upon, the dismissal of their appeals[32]. The jurisprudence of this Court in the matter, until overruled by the Privy Council, will be followed in cases in which the Crown is concerned as well as in all other cases.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I neither concur in nor dissent from the judgment given on this motion. I express no opinion either way.\nMotion refused with costs.\nREPORTERS' NOTE.\u2014In the following cases, where the Crown was concerned costs were allowed by this court: Severn v.

The question at issue on this appeal is stated in the judgment reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Laurendeau for the appellant.\nMignault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Le 6 janvier 1888, l'intim\u00e9 et Euphrosine Marchand signaient \u00e0 Beauharnois, devant le notaire Tass\u00e9, un contrat de mariage, dans lequel on lit la clause suivante.\nLes futurs \u00e9poux se sont fait et se font par ces pr\u00e9sentes. au survivant d'eux ce acceptant, donation viag\u00e8re, mutuelle, \u00e9gale et r\u00e9ciproque de tous les biens, meubles et immeubles, acqu\u00eats, conqu\u00eats, propres et autres biens g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, qui se trouveront \u00eatre et appartenir au premier mourant, au jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, de quelque nature qu'ils soient, et \u00e0 quelques sommes qu'ils puissent monter, consister et valoir, et en quelque lieu qu'ils soient situ\u00e9s, pour par le dit survivant en jouir en usufruit, sa vie durant, a sa caution juratoire et gardant viduit\u00e9.\nEuphrosine Marchand d\u00e9c\u00e9da le 22 juillet, 1900, sans enfant ni testament et sans autre bien que sa part des biens de la communaut\u00e9. Le contrat de mariage ne fut pas enregistr\u00e9 de son vivant. Les parties admettent que si cette clause du contrat de mariage ne constitue qu'une stipulation de communaut\u00e9 universelle aux termes de l'article 1411 C. C., l'enregistrement n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire ; si elle forme une donation, le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement en emporte la nullit\u00e9. Ajoutons que les \u00e9poux n'ont jamais eu de propres. L'appelante pr\u00e9tend que cela ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence et que le simple fait d'avoir inclus dans la convention tous les propres tant ceux qui entraient en communaut\u00e9 que ceux qui pourraient en \u00eatre exclus, d\u00e9terminait le caract\u00e8re de la convention et en faisait une v\u00e9ritable donation sujette \u00e0 l'enregistrement. Nous sommes d'abord d'opinion avec la cour d'appel et la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, que, vu que les \u00e9poux n'avaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de leur mariage aucun propre exclus de la communaut\u00e9 et n'avaient aucune raison d'en esp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'avenir, appartenant tous deux \u00e0 des familles pauvres c'\u00e9tait une stipulation pr\u00e9vue par l'article 1411 du Code Civil qu'ils avaient en vue.\nMais en supposant que la convention contiendrait en sus une donation, peut-on en invoquer le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement, lorsqu'il s'agit de mettre en force l'autre partie de la clause c.\u00e0.d., la stipulation de la communaut\u00e9 universelle ? En d'autres termes supposons qu'\u00e0 raison de la possibilit\u00e9 pour les \u00e9poux de recevoir des propres exclus de la communaut\u00e9, doit-il s'en suivre que toute la clause du contrat de mariage est nulle faute d'enregistrement ?\nNous ne pouvons accepter la proposition l\u00e9gale des avocats de l'appelante que cette clause est indivisible Ils nous r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 Sirey, pour \u00e9tablir que la stipulation de communaut\u00e9 universelle autoris\u00e9e par l'art. 1411 du Code Civil, correspondant \u00e0 l'art. 1525 du C.N. est indivisible. Mais personne n'est venu pr\u00e9tendre le contraire.\nLa question, est de savoir si la clause du contrat de mariage qui consacre \u00e0 la lois une stipulation et une donation est indivisible. Sirey ne dit pas qu'elle l'est et pas une seule autorit\u00e9 n'a pu \u00eatre cit\u00e9e dans ce sens\nNous sommes d'avis qu'elle est divisible, et qu'elle peut \u00e9tablir deux conventions distinctes. La donation de propres exclus de la communaut\u00e9 faite en contrat de mariage est sujette \u00e0 l'enregistrement, tandis que la stipulation de l'universalit\u00e9 des biens de la communaut\u00e9 ne l'est pas.

C. and Archambault K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, at' Montreal, by which the appellant's action was dismissed. He claims thereby the value of 473 feet of land of which, as he alleges, the respondent is illegally in possession.\nThe respondent pleaded that, if its officers or contractors had taken possession of any of the appellant's property, they were ready to return the possession of it to the appellant. The appellant replied that the respondent's offer was now too late, and that the city was bound to pay the value of his land of which it was in possession.\nThe judgments of the Superior Court and of the Court of Appeal concede that the respondent is, in fact, in possession illegally of a strip of the appellant s property, but they dismissed the action on the ground that the appellant's remedy is by an action en bornage or au p\u00e9titoire..\nI would think that the controversy between the parties, as it appears upon the record, ought to be determined in the present case so as to avert any further litigation in the matter.\nWhat is now the real controversy between the parties? (See sec. 63 of the Supreme Court Act ) Nothing else than a controversy as to the extent of appellant's land which the respondent's contractors took possession of when they built, in 1892, a permanent sidewalk in front of it. At the trial, one of the witnesses put it at 473 feet, and another one at 271 feet. So that under the circumstances, the record should be remitted back to the Superior Court for the purpose of ascertaining, by expertise or otherwise, as the court thinks proper what is the extent of the appellant's property which is covered by the said sidewalk, and ordering that the respondent should within the delay fixed by the court restore the said property to the appellant in exactly the same state as it was when the said sidewalk was constructed, all the necessary amendments of the pleadings being treated as having been made.\nThere will be no costs upon this appeal nor in the Court of King's Bench.

L.R. 56) affirming the judgment at the trial (2 Ont. L.R. 336) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgments at the trial[2] in favour of the respective plaintiffs. The Canada Atlantic Railway Co., being empowered by charter to build a railway from Coteau Landing to Ottawa obtained from the Railway Committee of the Privy Council an ex parte order approving of the plan and profile filed and proceeded with the construction of the road which crossed Bridge street one of the highways of Ottawa. The city authorities attempted to prevent the operation of the road over this highway claiming that their permission therefor was necessary whereupon the company brought an action for an injunction and damages. The city by counterclaim also asked for an injunction against the operating of the road and for a mandatory order for removal of the crossing.\nThe Montreal and Ottawa Railway Co. was, by its charter, empowered to build a railway from Vaudreuil in Quebec to a point at or near Ottawa passing through the counties of Vaudreuil, Prescott and Russell. Their plan and profile were approved by the Railway Committee and the road was constructed coming into Ottawa and crossing the highway at Wellington street. Similar proceedings to those of the Canada Atlantic Ry. Co. were taken except that the city claimed damages instead of an order for removal of the crossing. It was claimed that the railway had no right to enter the city nor to pass through the County of Carleton as they necessarily did.\nThe actions were tried and decided together and each resulted in favor of the plaintiffs whose judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The City appealed in both cases to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAylesworth K.C. and McVeity for the appellants. The fee in the soil of the highway is in the municipality; Roach v. Ryan[3]; Galbreath v. Armour[4]; R.S.O. [1897] ch. 223, secs. 598, 601, 640 (2), 657; Lewis on Eminent Domain, secs. 110-118. The Railway Committee had no right to authorize the highway to be crossed without consent of the city. The City of Toronto v. Metropolitan Railway Co[5].\nThe Montreal and Ottawa Railway Co. were not authorized to pass through Carleton County and the power to build to a point \u201cat ornear\u201d the city precluded them from coming within it.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondents, The Canada Atlantic Railway Co. The municipal authorities have no proprietary rights in the soil of the streets but only hold them as trustees for the public with a limited power of sale on compliance with the conditions contained in the Municipal Act. Municipal Council of Sydney v. Young[6]; Coverdale v. Charlton[7]; Gas Light and Coke Co. v.

East Freemantle Corporation v. Annois[9];\nNesbitt K.C. and Curle for the respondents, The Montreal and Ottawa Railway Co. As to ownership of highway see Gooderham v. City of Toronto[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reported at page 56 of 4 Ont. L.R., affirming the judgment pronounced at the trial which had granted an injunction as prayed for by the respondents\u2019 action, restraining the said appellants from preventing or interfering with the railway company, respondents, in crossing with their railway a certain street called Bridge street, in the City of Ottawa, and had dismissed a counter-claim of the appellants, for an injunction restraining the respondent company from crossing the said street with their railway.\nThe respondents raised in limine an objection to the appellants\u2019 right of appeal on the ground that the case did not fall within the Act 60 & 61 Vic. c. 34, which governs, as to Ontario cases, the jurisdiction of this Court. But as we have come to the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed on the merits, it is unnecessary to pass upon the point so raised by the respondents.\nThe broad question involved in this case is, whether or not the respondent company had the right to cross the highway in question without expropriating its right of way from and without making compensation therefor to the defendant Municipality in which the said highway is situated.\nWe are of opinion with the court appealed from that the company had that right. The elaborate opinions delivered upon that point in support of the judgment reported,[11], render it useless, as we fully agree with them, that we should here review again the statutes upon which the solution of the question depends. This company is chartered with authority to construct a railway from Coteau Landing to Ottawa. That gives them, by necessary implication, the authority to cross each and every one of the numerous intervening highways between such termini. The interference with them is of necessity made lawful. Then the Dominion statute, 51 V. ch. 29, sec. 90 (g) specially enacts that the company may make or construct, in, upon, across or over any highway, roads, ways, passages, &., and (q) do all other acts necessary for making and maintaining the said railway. The appellants have failed to point to anything in the statute which could at all support their contention that no highway can be crossed without the leave of the municipality. And the Railway Committee\u2019s interference is required, not to give leave to cross, but to decree what measures of protection for the public safety the company will have to adopt under the circumstances of each case. And that has been found as a fact to have been done in this case by the two Ontario courts. Then as to the claim for compensation. It is not an expropriation of the highway that the respondent company are claiming. They do not intend to divest the appellants of their rights of property in the road bed. They merely want to cross it. Now, nowhere in the statute is any provision to be found for compensation to a municipality in such case. And there is no right of compensation if the statute has not provided for any.\nIn the case of the Montreal and Ottawa Railway Company, the further objection is taken by the appellants that the respondent company has no right to enter the City of Ottawa and consequently cannot cross any of its streets.\nThe preamble to the respondents\u2019 special Act says that:\nThe construction of a line of railway from a point on the Grand Trunk Railway in the Parish of Vaudreuil in the Province of Quebec, to a point at or near the City of Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario, passing through the counties of Vaudreuil, Prescott and Russell, would be greatly beneficial to the population of the counties traversed by the railway as to the general trade of the country,\nand the company was authorized to construct a railway,\nfrom a point on the Grand Trunk Railway in the Parish of Vaudreuil to a point at or near the City of Ottawa in the Province of Ontario, passing through the Counties of Vaudreuil, Prescott and Russell, (and were empowered to) connect their railway with the Grand Trunk Railway in the Parish of Vaudreuil and with the railway of any other railway company having a terminus at or near the City of Ottawa.\nThe appellants contend that, as the railway cannot reach Ottawa without passing through the County of Carleton, and as only the Counties of Vaudreuil, Prescott and Russell are mentioned as those through which the railway is to pass, that, coupled with the words \u201cat or near the City of Ottawa\u201d, does not authorize them to enter the City of Ottawa. But that contention cannot prevail. We must give to the words in that charter a reasonable interpretation with reference to the subject matter and the public object that the legislative authority had in view. If necessary to pass through the County of Carleton to reach its terminus, the statute must be read as if that County was included in express words. A statute must not be construed so as to defeat the clear intention of Parliament as the appellants would have us to do here. The same thing may be said as to the words \u201cat or near\u201d. There is no inflexible rule that \u201cat\u201d is always to be construed as exclusive, and we have not to lay down any broad proposition as to its signification. What it means in this statute is all what we have to determine. That the words \u201cto a point at the City of Ottawa\u201d must in this charter be read as \u201cto a point in the City of Ottawa\u201d is to my mind the only reasonable construction to be given to those words under the circumstances. And the words \u201cnear\u201d given as the alternative point where the terminus may be shows that \u201cat\u201d and \u201cnear\u201d cannot be construed as meaning the same thing, as the appellants\u2019 contention implies.\nThen, any doubt in the matter is removed by the Act 63 & 64 Vic., c. 66 by which the railway company is granted in 1900 an extension of four years to complete the railway that their charter authorized them to construct. As their road was then completed up to the boundary line of the City, that statute must be taken as a legislative declaration that their charter authorized them to build up to a point in the City. GIROUARD, DAVIES and ARMOUR JJ. concurred.\nMILLS J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my lord the Chief Justice. I am of opinion that the Railway Company had the right to cross the highway in question without expropriating it. The right of way which a railway company acquire in a public street which continues to be such is a mere easement, and it is for the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to settle the terms and conditions upon which that easement is to be exercised, whenever their authority is properly invoked. I am of opinion that the words \u201cat or near the City of Ottawa\u201d mean \u201cin or near the City of Ottawa\u201d, otherwise, the same meaning would be given to the two words. When it is said A. is at home, the idea conveyed is not that he is near to his home, or upon his border, but that he is within his own domain, and so the proposal to extend a line of railway from the City of Montreal, to a point \u201cat or near the City of Ottawa\u201d means near it, or within its limits.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Taylor McVeity.\nSolicitors for the respondents C.A.

Elson, (1903) 33 S.C.R. 383\nDate: 1903-04-22\nThe North American Life Assurance Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nJane Elson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1903: March 26; 1903: April 22.\nPresent: Sir Elzear Taschereau C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Mills and Armour JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nLife insurance\u2014Delivery of policy\u2014Escrow\u2014Incontestability\u2014Operation of conditions.\nAn application for life insurance dated 16th September, 1894, and made part of the contract to be effected, provided that the issue and delivery of a policy in the usual form should be the only acceptance thereof and that the place of contract for all purpose3 should be the head office of the company at Toronto. The policy insured the applicant's life to the fifth day of October, 1895, and provided that it would not be in force until the first premium had been paid and accepted and the receipt delivered to the insured, and the attesting clause stated that the company affixed its seal and the President and Managing Director signed and delivered this contract \" at the City of Toronto this 27th day of September, A.D. 1894.\" The insured lived in British Columbia and the policy and receipt were mailed at Toronto on September 27th to the company's agent at Winnipeg, and forwarded by him on October 1st to the insured who would not receive it before October 7th. The insured died on 30th September, 1897.\nHeld, Taschereau C.J. dissenting, that the policy and receipt were delivered, and the contract of insurance was completed, at least as early as 27th September, 1894, when the papers were mailed at Toronto.\nThe policy provided that, after being in force for three years, only certain specified conditions therein should be binding on the holder and in all other respects the liability of the company thereunder should not be disputed. The insured violated a condition, but not one so specified, that would have avoided the policy but for this clause. Held, that said provision covered breaches of conditions made during the three years the policy was in force, and was not confined to those committed subsequently thereto, and as the three years expired on 27th September, 1897, the insured dying three days later, the company was liable.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe only questions raised on the appeal were as to the date on which the policy came into force on which depended the operation or otherwise of the clause making it incontestable after the lapse of three years and as to whether or not such clause applied to breaches committed during the three years. The facts on which the decision of these questions depended are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nJ. K. Kerr K.C. and Paterson K C. for the appellants By the terms of the policy and the receipts for the premiums, the policy did not commence its operation until delivered in British Columbia some time later than 5th Oct. 1894. The application provided that the place of the contract for all purposes should be the place of the delivery of the policy. There was, therefore, no contract until the policy was delivered. By the terms of the application, the policy was not in force until the delivery to the insured of the initial premium receipt and this receipt was sent with the policy in letter of 27th September, 1894, by the appellant to Wm, McBride, and followed the same course as the policy, getting into Elson's hands in ordinary course between 7th and 10th Oct., 1894. By its terms the policy was not in force until the annual payment to and acceptance of the first premium due thereon by an authorized agent of the company and the delivery to the insured of the necessary receipt signed by the managing director, the life proposed for insurance being at the time of such payment in the same condition of health as stated in the application.\nThe insured, in May, 1897, entered into a business of extra hazard, that of brakesman on a railroad and was killed in an explosion upon the railway on 30th September, 1897. The policy provided that if he, without a permit, engaged \"in the employment on a railroad\" then that the policy should forthwith become and be null and void without any act on the part of the company and all payments made upon it should be forfeited to the company. The insured was not, therefore, protected by the clause as to incontestability after three years and the appellant is consequently not liable and the judgment of the learned judge at the trial should not have been reversed.\nEven on the assumption that the contract became operative at the time of the application on 18th September, 1894, the clause as to incontestability after three years will not avail the respondent. The deceased entered into the forbidden occupation on a railway in May, 1897, which was within the three years. It must follow by the terms of the policy that in May, 1897, without any act on the appellant's part it became ipso facto null and void. The contract thereupon came to an abrupt conclusion and there was nothing upon which the respondent could base any claim.\nIt is definitely provided that it requires four combining circumstances to put the policy in force in this case :\u2014(1.) Actual payment to and acceptance of the first premium by an authorized agent of the company ; (2.) The delivery to the insured of the initial receipt signed by the managing director; (3.) The life proposed for insurance being at the time of such payment in the same condition of health as stated in the application; (4.) The delivery of the policy. Respondent did not prove the delivery of the receipt or policy before 5th Oct., 1894. The case of Xenos v. Wickham[1] does not apply. See per Piggott B. at p. 309, of that report citing Doe d. Garnons v. Knight[2], and also per Cranworth L.J. at p. 322. Until the special time has arrived or the condition has been performed the instrument is not a deed but an escrow. See also Tiernan v. Peoples Life Ins. Co.[3], at p. 354; Sun Life Assur. Co. v. Page[4]; Confederation Life Association v. O'Donnell[5]. The agent in British Columbia had no power to waive forfeiture or to modify the contract. Elson had notice that the agent had no such authority, and stated his preference to deal directly with the head office at Torouto. For these reasons, Campbell v. National Life Ins. Co.[6], and Moffatt v. Reliance Mut. Life Assur. Soc.[7], do not help the respondent. Elson knew of this limited authority, and therefore Wing v. Harvey [8] does not apply in favour of respondent, nor does Acey v. Fernie [9].\nThe appellant knew nothing of Elson having worked as a brakesman until after his death, and therefore the acceptance of payment of the last premium, on the 29th September, 1897, was no waiver of the forfeiture ; Jacobs v. Equitable Ins. Co.[10] , at p. 46. The appellant was justified in retaining this premium, as it is part of the contract that \" if any material information has been withheld by the insured all sums which shall have been paid to the company upon account of the insurance made in consequence shall be forfeited and the insurance shall be absolutely null and void.\" The retention was no waiver of the forfeiture. Furthermore the insurance was absolutely null and void in May, 1897, and there was therefore nothing left upon which any waiver could operate.\nWe also rely upon The Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Giguere[11] ; Provident Savings v Mowat[12] ; Kohen v. Mutual Reserve[13] ; Misselhorn v Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn.[14] ; McCully's Administrator v. Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co.[15]; Steinle v. New York Life Ins. Co. [16].\nThe respondent cannot recover in this action, as no contract was ever made with her by the appellant.The contract was with the deceased, and with nobody else, and the right to sue passed to his legal representatives, and they are not parties to this action. Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn.[17]; Wright v. The Mutual Benefit Life Assn.[18] ; at page 243,\nDuff K.C. for the respondent. The change of occupation is not disputed, but the plaintiff's case is on the grounds that either a permit was granted, or that breach was waived, and that, even in the absence of waiver, the defendants are not entitled to set up the breach, because of the clause in the policy making it indisputable after three years. The case as to waiver is that in June, 1897, after the change of employment, the insured informed the defendants' manager in British Columbia of the change, who, subsequently, informed his father that the company did not object to the change because it involved no increase of risk. The clause providing that no provisions in the policy shall be waived except in writing under the hand of the President or Managing Director does not help defendants, because, (a) it refers only to waiver of terms of the policy, not to waiver of a breach of such terms, a distinction recognized in the policy ; and (b) if necessary the jury might infer a formal waiver by the company. Wing v. Harvey[19] ; Phanix Life Co. v. Raddin, [20]. Further, by the claim papers, the company had notice in October, 1897, of the change of employment, and with that knowledge they kept a premium paid in September, 1897, five months after the alleged breach. The retention of this premium was a waiver of the alleged breach, because the company cannot, while holding moneys paid on the faith of the policy subsisting, resist an action upon it on the ground that at the time those moneys were received the policy had ceased to be binding on them. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Baker,[21] ; Canada Landed Credit Co. v. The Canada Ag. Ins. Co.[22] . The incontestability clause forbids the defence upon which defendants rely. The obligation of defendants commenced not later than 17th Sept., 1894. The first premium receipt was delivered to Elson on 18th Sept., 1894. This receipt is said by the Managing Director of the defendants to have \" put the policy in force.\" The risk was finally accepted and the policy issued on 27th Sept, 1894. The company \" delivered this contract at the City of Toronto this 27th day of September, A.D. 1894.\" The last sentence of the incontestability clause governs the clause, and at the end of the period, the only defences open to the company are those specified in its earlier sentences. Every other clause in the policy must be read subject to this provision of the incontestability clause. See Davenport v. The Queen[23] at p. 128 ; Doe d. Bryan v. Bancks[24] ; Roberts v. Davey [25]; and other cases in the notes to Dumpor's Case[26] ; Turquand v. Armstrong[27] ; Massachusetts Benefit Life Assn. v. Robinson [28]; Goodwin v. Provident Savings Life Assur. Society [29]; Manufacturers' Life Ins. Co. v. Anctil [30] per Sedgewick J. at p. 126.\nIn the construction of policies the strictum jus or apex juris is not to be laid hold of, but they are to be construed largely, for the benefit of trade and the insured. Per Mansfield L.J. in Pelly v. Royal Exchange[31] ; Notman v. Anchor Ass. Co.[32] ; Fitton v. Accidental Death Ins. Co., [33]; Thompson x. Phoenix Insurance Co. [34] ; Porter on Insurance (3 ed.) p 32.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal upon the ground that, as held by Mr. Justice Martin at the trial, the policy in question did not come into force before the 5th October 1894, and consequently had not been in force for three years at the time of the death of the insured on the 30th September 1897 ; so that the incontestability clause cannot be invoked by the respondent. And without the benefit of that clause she clearly cannot succeed.\nThe application for insurance dated 18th September, 1894, the terms of which application are expressly made part of the contract in question, contains the following declarations and agreements.\nThat a policy if issued in the company's usual form and delivered shall be the only acceptance of this application.\nThat such policy will be accepted when presented subject to the terms n and upon the said policy and as herein set forth.\nThe policy itself dated 27th September, 1894, contains the following declarations and agreements.\nAfter being in force three years the only conditions which shall be binding upon the holder of this policy are that he shall make the payments hereon as herein provided, and that the provisions as to military and naval services, proofs of age and death and limitation of time for action or suit shall be observed. In all other respects after the expiration of the said three years the liability of the company under this policy shall not be disputed.\nThe following is indorsed on the policy :\nThis policy is issued and also accepted by the insured upon the following additional provisoes and agreements therein made a part thereof and, (inter alia) if without a permit the insured engaged*** in the employment on a railroad, steamboat or other vessel*** this policy shall thereupon become and be null and void without any act on the part of the company and all payments made upon it shall be forfeited to the company.\nThe first premium receipt, dated 18th September 1894, is stated to be\nsubject to all the provisions of the said policy and those on the back hereof hereby incorporated herein.\nBy the terms of the policy and of the receipts the contract ended upon the 5th October in any year. And as the premiums were annual premiums the policy must have commenced its operation upon the 5th October, 1894. That seems to me unquestionable.\nBy the terms of the application the contract commenced from the delivery of the policy and the policy was sent by the appellant's letter dated 27th September, 1894, to William McBride at Winnipeg, agent of the appellant, for delivery to Elson in British Columbia. McBride forwarded it from Winnipeg to Elson on the 1st October, 1894. According to the evidence it would then have reached Elson in ordinary course between the 7th and 10th October, 1894.\nBy the terms of the application moreover, the policy was not in force until the delivery to the insured of the initial premium receipt and this receipt was sent with the policy in letter of 27th September 1894, by the appellant to W m. McBride, and this receipt followed the same course as the policy, getting into Elson's hands in ordinary course between the 7th and 10th October, 1894. Until that receipt reached Elson, his life was not insured.\nThe onus was upon the respondent to prove when the contract commenced, and for that purpose she examined Wm. McCabe the appellant's managing director. From his evidence it appears clearly that the contract could not have commenced before the 5th of October 1894. The receipt itself for the premium of 1897 leaves no room for doubt upon that fact. It is a continuance of the policy from the 5th of October, 1897, for one year. That necessarily implies that the first year began on the 5th of October of the year 1894 in which the policy was issued. It reads as follows :\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\nDue October 5th, 1897\u2014$9. 50\/100. Sum insured $1,000.\nReceived this 29th day of September, 1897, Nine 80\/100 Dollars from the owner of Commercial Policy No. 02647, on the life of Geo. Wm. Elson, Esq., for the regular premium due as above stated, hereby continuing the insurance thereunder for twelve months from above due date only, subject to all the provisions of the said policy and those on the back hereof, hereby incorporated herein.\nWM. MCCABE,\nManaging Director.\nElson had taken employment on a railroad contrary to the express stipulation of the policy, so that he had forfeited all his rights under it, and he having died before the expiration of three years from the date that the policy was in force the company is not precluded, by the incontestability clause, from pleading such forfeiture in answer to the respondent's action.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014By their policy of insurance dated at the Head office of the Company, Toronto, on the 27th September 1894, the North American Life Ass. Co. insured the life of George Elson for the term ending at noon on the 5th October 1895 and promised to pay to the plaintiff his mother the sum of $ 1,000 within a certain time after proofs of his death. The policy was mailed by the company on the day of its date to one of its western agents to be handed the insured, and the subsequent premiums were paid annually up to and including that due on the 27th September 1897. About five months before his death the insured engaged in employment upon the Canadian Pacific Railway which is one of the hazardous employments prohibited by the policy. The substantial question raised upon this appeal was as to the meaning and effect of the clause known as the \" incontestable clause \" of the policy sued on. A question was raised and argued by Mr. Kerr as to the date when the policy came into force and we were of the opinion on the hearing (and in fact the respondent's counsel was stopped on the point) that the policy went into operation and took effect from, at any rate, the date when it was posted by the company in Toronto, 27th September 1894, for transmission to the insured. If, therefore, the \" incontestable clause \" covers breaches of the conditions committed during the three years the policy was in force, the company would be liable, the insured not having been killed until the 30th September, 1897, two or three days after the expiration of the three years.\nThe policy contained on its face the following clause :\nAfter being in force three years, the only conditions which shall be binding upon the holder of this policy are that he shall make the payments hereon as herein provided, and that the provisions as to military and naval service, proofs of age and death, and limitation of time for action or suit shall be observed. In all other respects after the expiration of the said three years the liability of the company under this policy shall not be disputed.\nIn order to construe this clause properly it is necessary to read it in connection with the following condi- tion or provision indorsed upon the policy and which was made expressly a part of the contract:\n1. If any statement made in the application and therein declared to be material to the contract, be untrue ; or if any premium, note, cheque or other obligation given for the first or any subsequent premium or any part thereof, or any renewal of any such note or other obligation or any part thereof, be not paid, when due ; or if, without a permit the insured engages as an occupation : (1) in blasting, mining, submarine labour, the production of any explosive material, or in any naval or military service (except in time of war); or (2) engage in aerial or arctic voyages or in employment on a railroad, a steamboat or other vessel; or (3) reside elsewhere than in Canada, Newfoundland, Europe or the United States ; or (4) between the 15th days of June and November in any year reside in any part of the United States south of the 26th degree of North Latitude, or in Europe south of the 42nd degree ; this policy shall thereupon become and be null and void, and all payments made upon it shall be forfeited to the company.\nI am of the opinion that the Supreme Court of British Columbia was right in holding that the object of the above incontestable clause \" was to provide an automatic cutting off at the end of the triennium of all defences arising after the coming into force of the policy except such as are reserved in the clause itself.\" And, I would add further, of all defences arising out of any untrue or incorrect material statement made in the application for the policy.\nThe contention of the appellants was that the clause in question did not operate to relieve the insured from any breach of condition invalidating the policy happening within the three years, but only those happening afterwards. But I think a careful examination of the clause in connection with the first condition of the policy will show that such a contention is both narrow and untenable. In fact it whittles down the meaning of the clause so much as to make it practically illusory and valueless. If given effect to it still leaves the policy liable to be avoided by the company five, ten or even twenty years after it was issued, if some state ment made by the insured in his original application and therein declared to be material turned out afterwards to be untrue, or if the company discovered that within the first three years the policy was in force, the insured had, wittingly or otherwise, broken one of the many conditions to which the policy was subject. I seeks to give an effect to the opening words of the clause \" after being in force three years \" which I do not think they fairly bear and which I feel confident neither party to the contract could have intended, and I think it reaches that conclusion by ignoring or unduly limiting the meaning of the closing sentence of the clause. I construe the first part of the clause as dispensing after three years with further compliance by the insured with any condition excepting the ones expressly reserved, viz. those relating to payments, military and naval service, proofs of age and death, and limitations of time for bringing actions. In that view, with which Mr. Kerr concurred, the last sentence was unnecessary. That last sentence, however, does not confine itself to stipulations about conditions but broadly and unreservedly says\nin all other respects after the expiration of the said three years the liability of the company under this policy shall not be disputed.\nOne part of the clause dispenses with future compliance with the general conditions and the other renders the policy indisputable after the three years, except for breaches of some of the special conditions which are retained and continued. The words of the latter clause are not that the liability of the company shall not be disputed because of breaches committed after three years, as is now contended for, but that absolutely and in all other respects than the ones specifically set out, it shall be indisputable. If the clause is to operate as containing the limitation sought to be put upon it now by the company then they must alter its phraseology and clearly insert the limitation.\nThe counsel for the respondents were on the argument pressed with the question whether the clause covered untrue statements made in the application and Mr Patterson felt himself compelled to admit that apart from fraud he thought it did. If it does it is indisputable that the clause relates as well to breaches within the three years and covers them as to breaches occuring after three years. Once it is admitted that the phase \" In all other respects \" with which the last sentence begins applies to untrue statements made in the original application, then, in my opinion, it must follow that it covers other breaches although made within the three years. In fact the last sentence was unnecessary if limited alone to breaches arising after three years. There could be no breach because there was no condition then existing. The first part of the clause annulled all conditions after three years excepting those expressly retained, and there would therefore be no necessity for the last sentence at all. But it was, in my opinion, inserted to cover the obvious intent and meaning of the parties to the contract and to give assurance to the party insuring that, after the lapse of the three years, he need not worry about his policy because it was indisputable except for the breach of the two or three conditions or things specifically mentioned and which therefore he would have to be careful about.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Drake, Jackson & Helmcken.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Cowan, Kappele & McEvoy.\n[1] L.

The point in controversy between the parties was as to which of them should bear the cost of that portion of the bridging in question which extends across Lacroix street at the Place Viger terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Montreal. The questions arising on the appeal are stated in the judgments reported.\nATWATER K. C. and ETHIER K.C. for the appellant.\nLAFLEUR K. C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appeal should in my opinion, be allowed in part and the judgment appealed from varied in the manner and for the reasons stated by my brother Girouard.\nGIROUARD J In this, as in all cases where big corporations are litigants and large interests at stake, the record is voluminous, but after having been threshed out in two courts, where their respective pretentions have been fully discussed, I think the issue before us is narrowed down to a simple question of interpretalion of contract.\nOn the 19th December, 1893, the City of Montreal and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company signed a notarial agreement and a plan annexed to it as part of the same, whereby the parties undertook to provide for the erection of what was called the Eastern Station near Place Niger. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. undertook to build a large station, freight sheds and other works, and the city promised to deliver to the railway company a certain area of land between Craig and Notre-Dame Streets, Berri Street to the west and Lacroix Street to the east, and to construct an iron bridge or viaduct along Notre Dame Street. All these extensive works are indicated in the deed and plan which were both signed by the parties and their counsel. The construction of the iron bridge by the city alone is involved in this appeal. Clause 5 of the contract declares:\nThe corporation covenant that they will construct and maintain a bridge for highway purposes along Notre Dame Street, from Bern Street to Lacroix Street, as shown on the said plan.\nThe city commenced to build the bridge, but before reaching Lacroix Street expressed the opinion that they were not called upon by the contract to go beyond the westerly limit of Lacroix Street. Thereupon the following deed of compromise was arrived at in 1896. I quote the whole deed in order to understand fully the intention and agreement of the parties:\nWhereas under and by a certain deed of agreement passed before the undersigned notary on the nineteenth day of December eighteen hundred and ninety three between the said City of Montreal and the said railway company about the construction of the Eastern Station in the said City of Montreal, the said City of Montreal did undertake to construct and maintain a bridge for highway purposes along Notre Dame Street from Berri Street to Lacroix Street as shown on the plan annexed to the said deed, of such a height as to make the land below it available for railway purposes, and to give the said company the right to use the land below the said structure as it may require for railway purposes;\nWhereas the said City of Montreal alleges that it has constructed the said bridge from Bern Street to the south-west line of Lacroix Street according to the said contract:\nWhereas the said railway company has contended that under the clause hereinabove cited of the said deed of agreement and according to the plan annexed to the said contract, the said city is bound to continue the construction of the said bridge up to a point on the north-east side of the said Lacroix street, as shown on the said plan, which contention the said City of Montreal regards as incorrect and not in conformity with the said agreement and clauses thereof;\nWhereas the said parties have agreed some time ago to have that question decided by the court and in the meantime to proceed with the completion of the said bridge;\nWhereas under said understanding the said city has continued the said works up to date, but is now unable to continue on account of its inability of advancing the funds necessary for the said works; And whereas the said parties are desirous to complete the said bridge as shown on the said plan as soon as possible;\nNow therefore these presents, and I the said notary, witness:\nThat the said parties do respectively agree one with the other as follows:\u2014\nThe said railway company agrees to advance to the city all the moneys necessary for the completion of the said bridge, either on Notre Dame or Lacroix Street as shown on the said plan to the extent of thirty five thousand eight hundred dollars the amount of the city's estimate for the cost of completing the bridge as aforesaid, and the said city agrees to proceed with the said bridge on the following terms, under the supervision of the said railway company's Engineer.\nAnd the City of Montreal agrees that it will apply to the Legislature of the Province of Quebec at its next session for and will use its best endeavour to obtain legislation permitting the city to raise the money necessary to complete the said bridge as aforesaid, and if such legislation be obtained, or (1 believe \"and\" was intended) if a court of competent jurisdiction finally decides that the city is liable under the said agreement to bear the cost of constructing and completing the said bridge further north than the line of the southerly limit of Lacroix Street then any moneys advanced in the mean time by the said company for that purpose, as hereinabove provided, shall be forthwith reimbursed by the city to the said railway company with five per cent per year interest thereon, and the city shall bear alone the cost of constructing and completing the said bridge as aforesaid.\nAnd the said railway company undertakes that if the said judgment finally decides that the said city is not liable under the said agreement to construct the said bridge further north then the line of the southern limit of Lacroix Street, then the said railway company will forthwith, on demand, repay to the said city all moneys which the said City may have expended either before or after the execution hereof in completing the same, provided that the amount of such expenditure and the amount expended for the same purpose by the said railway company shall together not exceed thirty-five thousand eight hundred dollars, the amount of the said city's estimate of the cost of completing the bridge as aforesaid, the said company being not bound to repay any sum over said amount, and will also pay interest on such moneys as may have been disbursed by the city for the said purpose at the rate of five per cent per annum from the respective periods of such disbursements\nNothing in these presents shall be held to affect or diminish the rights of either party under the said agreement of the nineteenth of December eighteen hundred and ninety-three.\nA total sum of $35771222 was advanced to the city in pursuance of this compromise. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company now sues the corporation for an inter- Creation in their favour of the contract of the 19th December 1893 and the reimbursement of the monies so advanced.\nThe city met this action by alleging her own construction of the contract and for the first time set forth by a separate action and an inscription en faux that the plan annexed to the deed was not the one agreed to by the corporation, and that it had been signed by error.\nA long enqu\u00eate necessarily followed the allegation of error. The Superior Court (Lonelier J.) maintained that it had been Proved and dismissed the action of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. The learned judge further held that the contract of the 19th December, 1893 which must control the plan wherever inconsistent, did not support the interpretation of the railway company, and that the city was not bound to construct the bridge beyond the westerly limit of Lacroix Street. In appeal this judgment was reversed, and the city was condemned to pay the full amount demanded with interest and costs.\nWe all agree with the court of appeal that there was no error, and that the appeal of the city from the judgment dismissing their action must be rejected, as well as the inscription en faux. The learned Chief Justice reviewed at length all the facts bearing upon this branch of the case and we fully concur in his conclusion. He said:\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement la cite connaissait Cette erreur (si elle a exist\u00e9) des 1895. C'\u00e9tait le temps de r\u00e9pudier son contrat; an lieu cela, en 1896 elle a fait un compromis avec la compagnie dans lequel elle admet le contrat de 1893 pr\u00e9tend avoir rempli son obligation de construire son viaduc en s'arr\u00eatant \u00e2 ligne sud-ouest de la rue Lacroix et n'\u00eatre pas oblig\u00e9e de construire au.del\u00e0. Alors ii est convenu que la cit\u00e9 parach\u00e8vera la construction avec les argents que la compagnie s'oblige a lui fournir, sauf \u00e0 rembourser la compagnie si la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec lui permet de pr\u00e9lever des fonds pour le parach\u00e8vement de l'ouvrage, on si une cour de justice la d\u00e9clare li\u00e9e par son contrat \u00e0 faire la parte du viaduc \u00e0 travers la rue Lacroix. La cite consentait donc alors \u00e0 ce que le contrat f\u00fbt ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 suivant sa forme et teneur et il serait trop tard maintenant que la compagnie a avanc\u00e9 des fonds sur la foi de l'acte de 1896, de r\u00e9pudier la contrat de 1893. Nous sommes d'opinion que la cite n'a pas prouv\u00e9 l'erreur qu'elle invoque et m\u00eame qu'elle no pourrait pas 1 invoquer apr\u00e8s avoir consenti l'acte de compromis de 1896.\nAs to the other branch of the case, namely, the interpretation of the contract of the 19th December, 1898, this court is divided. Two take the view of Mr. Justice Lonelier and three agree in part with the court of appeal. Sir Alexander Lacoste, continuing his remarks, said:\nIl ne reste que la derni\u00e8re question: La cite s'est-elle oblig\u00e9e par le contrat de 1893 \u00e0 construire le viaduc \u00e0 travers la rue Lacroix? Elle s'est oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 construire le viaduc suivant le plan; or le plan d\u00e9montre que le viaduc s'\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de la ligne sud-ouest de la rue Lacroix La cite pr\u00e9tend qu'il v a contradiction entre le contrat qui dit \"from Bern street to Lacroix street\" et le plan. Nous ne voyons pas la contradiction; \"from\" et \"to\" n'excluent pas n\u00e9cessairement l'une ou l'autre rue Construire un chemin de fer d'une ville \u00e0 une autre no veut pas dire qu'on n'entrera pas dans l'une on l'autre ville, Si un plan n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte, la cite aurait Pu pr\u00e9tendre avoir satisfait \u00e0 son obligation en construisant un viaduc de la ligne sud-est de la rue Berri \u00e0 la ligne sud-ouest de la rue Lacroix. Maes le plan est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 former partie du contrat, par cons\u00e9quent ii explique et compl\u00e8te la convention et doit \u00eatre suivi.\nIn this view we also concur. The words from and to are not always exclusive. This depends upon the circumstances of each case. Suppose C. acquires a piece of laud situated from B to C Here the words are evidently exclusive. But when the deed provides that a certain piece of work is to be constructed, as in this case along Notre-Dame Street from Henri Street to Lacroix Street as shewn on the said plan\" the words mean as far as the plan shows, along Notre Dame, but not exceeding the most distant line of Lacroix Street. That part of the plan referring to this work, which is reproduced below, shows plainly that the iron bridge extends along Notre Dame Street below the western limit of Lacroix Street and even its eastern limit and along Lacroix Street north of Notre Dame Street for wherever railway tracks are indicated the superstructure or bridge was necessary. [Page 403]\nHere the plan defines the meaning of the words from and to, that is along Notre flama Street to the easterly limit of Lacroix Street. We believe therefore that the city was bound to construct the bridge to the easterly line of Lacroix Street, but nothing more, and the judgment appealed from must be varied accordingly.\nFrom the last remarks of the learned Chief Justice we are inclined to believe that the court of appeal had at first entertained some doubt upon this point. He says:\nJ'aurais eu quelque doute sur la partie du viaduc qui est en dehors de la rue Notre Dame au nord-ouest sur la rue Lacroix mais ce doute est dissipe par la convention de 1896. Il y est dit que la compagnie advancera \u00e0 la cite tout l'argent n\u00e9cessaire \"for the completion of the said bridge either on Notre Dame or Lacroix street,\" et que la cite remboursera si une cour d\u00e9cide que la cite est tenue de construire \u00e0 ses frais au del\u00e0 de la ligne sud-ouest de la rue Lacroix\nThe continuation of the bridge along Lacroix Street had to be built without any delay; it was necessary to both the city and the railway company and naturally the deed of compromise provided for the construction of the whole structure so as to afford as little inconvenience as possible to the public. But the city never promised by the deed of compromise to do more work than it stipulated in the contract of 1893. The last clause of the deed of compromise of 1896 so declares in express terms:\nNothing in these presents shall be held to affect or diminish the rights of either party under the said, deed of agreement of the 19th of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-three.\nThat is the interpretation given by the railway company itself, which claims no right under the deed of compromise beyond the reimbursement of the funds advanced to Complete a work which they allege the city had undertaken to do by the terms of the contract of 1898. We have endeavored to show that their contention is unfounded. On the other hand the city seems to concede in the deed of compromise that it is bound to build along Notre-Dame Street south of Lacroix Street., It agrees in fact to reimburse if obliged under the contract of 1893 to construct further north than the southerly limit of Lacroix Street. Likewise the railway company agrees to refund all moneys expended by the city in completing said bridge, if the courts hold that it is not so obliged without saying where the work was to be done on Notre Dame Street south of Lacroix, or outside of its easterly limit But all these contentions and distinctions cannot be maintained in face of the express stipulation that the rights of the parties remain intact and unaffected. The deed of compromise may be badly worded but the last clause leaves no doubt as to the intention of the parties. The city never undertook to construct outside of Notre Dame Street and the railway company only contemplated building the bridge out-side the distance between Lacroix Street east and Henri Street whether on Lacroix or Notre Dame Streets. Therefore that part of the bridge along Lacroix or east of Lacroix, along Notre Dame, must be built at the ex-pense of the railway company.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed in part, and judgment appealed from varied. The appellants are condemned to reimburse to the respondents the cost of that part of the iron bridge or viaduct extending along Notre 1ameStreet south and the whole width Of Lacroix Street from limit to limit, and no more, said cost\u2014-unless the amount thereof be agreed to by the parties within fifteen days\u2013to be ascertained by the Registrar of this court who, after having heard the parties and their witnesses, shall settle the judgment for the amount so agreed to or ascertained, with interest at the rate of five per cent from the date of payment and costs in the Superior Court and court of appeal. As the cont\u00e9ntions of the appellants are not fully adopted, no costs will be allowed before this cour\nDAVIES J. \u2014i have had the advantage of reading the opinion prepared by my brother Armour in this case, and I fully agree with him that the agreement between the parties having been ratified by provincial statute was not open to attack in the courts on the ground of alleged error or mistake in connection with the plans attached to and made part of the agreement.\nI am also clearly of the opinion that the supplementary agreement, although its language is in parts obscure and somewhat difficult to interpret does not alter or modify, and was not intended to alter or modify, the respective rights or obligations of either of the contracting parties under the main and original agreement of 1893. The language of the concluding paragraph of the agreement of 1896, if any doubt otherwise existed on the point, is in my mind conclusive. It says:\nNothing in these presents shall be held to affect or diminish the rights of either party under the said agreement of the 19th of December, 1893.\nReferring, then, back to this agreement of 1893, we find that it was a contract providing for the construction and equipment in the eastern part of the City of Montreal of a terminal railway station of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company on certain specified terms and conditions and on certain reciprocal obligations of the parties to the contract. Attached to this agreement was a large general plan which was declared by the agreement \"to form part of it,\" and was referred to in many of its paragraphs to show more definitely what their language meant. The plan showed the station and grounds attached, the numerous outbuildings and works contemplated the different tracks and sidings proposed to be constructed leading into and from the Stan, and the several streets crossed by them and the general scheme of an eastern railway terminus in the City of Montreal.\nThe particular clause out of which the litigation arose reads as follows:\n5 The corporation covenant that they will construct and maintain a bridge for highway purposes along Notre-Dame Street from Berri Street to Lacroix Street, as shown on the said plan of such a height as to make the land below it available for railway purposes, but the upper level of said bridge must not be higher then the level of Notre-Dame Street, and to give the company the right to use the land below the said structure as they may require for railway purposes.\nLacroix Street and Bern Street run at right angles to Notre-Dame street which latter is one of the principal streets of Montreal. Lacroix Street was a short street running from Craig Street to Notre-Dame Street, but not going beyond these streets. The plan attached to the agreement showed the proposed different railway tracks crossing Notre-Dame Street the construction of the bridge over which was being provided for, as extending along Notre-Dame Street for a distance including the entire width of what may be called a prolongation of Lacroix Street, and a small distance beyond it. It showed these tracks to run up and over a part of Lacroix Street, which was also marked on the plan t to be bridged \"but by whom was not, of course, stated.\nThe Court of King's Bench held that under this agreement and plan and the subsequent agreement of 1896, the city was liable to pay for the construction of the entire bridge as shown upon the plan, as well over Notre-Dame Street as over Lacroix Street. But as I have said I am clearly of the opinion that the agreement of 1896 does not alter the rights or obligations of the parties under the agreement of 1893, and it is not, in my judgment, open to argument that any liability on the part of the city exists under this latter agreement for that portion of the bridge built over Lacroix street and not forming part of Notre-Dame Street. The only point, therefore, on which I differ from the judgment of my learned brother Armour is as to the distance the city was bound to build the bridge over and along Notre-Dame Street. He is of opinion that the words of the agreement \"along Notre-Dame Street from Bern Street to Lacroix Street\" must be construed to be limited to the distance between the two nearest side lines of these latter streets and if we had to depend upon the words of the section eliminating those referring to the plan, I should have no difficulty in accepting his construction. But I am of opinion that the additional words \"as shown upon the plan\" clearly indicate a different meaning. I think the clause of the agreement under review read in the light of the plan to which it refers and which was made a part of it, shows that what the city was contracting to build was the contemplated bridge along Notre-Dame Street and that as the plan clearly showed the bridge as extending along Notre-Dame Street nearly across what would be the prolongation of Lacroix Street which opened into it the obligation of the city is not to be limited to that portion of the bridge along Notre-Dame Street up to the western (or south-western) side-line of Lacroix Street but goes further and covers that portion of the bridge along Notre-Dame Street lying opposite to the opening of Lacroix Street. The words \"to Lacroix,\" therefore, must be intercepted in the light of the plan, as \"into\" or to use the language of the agreement t to Lacroix Street as shown on the plan,\" and these latter words in my opinion, impose a larger obligation upon the city than the clause would if the reference to the plan had not been there. The city is not bound to construct any part of the bridge beyond the prolongation of the eastern or north-eastern side of Lacroix Street, nor any part of the bridge on Lacroix Street. Having already decided that the agreement and plan cannot be impeached for error or mistake, we cannot use the plan which the city produced, but which was not annexed to the agreement, as the one which they intended to be bound by. But even this plan shows the bridge to extend along Notre-Dame Street beyond the western (or south-western) line of Lacroix Street, although not quite so far beyond it as the governing plan attached to the agreement shows-\nI am therefore of opinion that this appeal should be allowed in accordance with the judgment of my brother Girouard in which I agree.\nMILLS J.\u2014In this case the City of Montreal agreed to aid the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in making certain improvements relating to that railway and which the company had contracted to make within the City of Montreal. These improvements are mentioned in the amended declaration of the railway company. The railway company affirm that by a deed of agreement entered into on the 19th of December, 1893 the City of Montreal contracted to construct and maintain a bridge along Notre-Dame Street from Bern Street east-ward to Lacroix Street, as shown upon a certain plan attached to and forming part of the said deed and the railway track went beneath this bridge. They affirm that by this deed the parties to it were bound as soon as the said agreement was ratified by an Act of the Provincial Legislature, 57 Victo ch. 55, according to the true intention of the contracting parties. A difference of opinion arose between the municipal representatives of the City of Montreal and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company with reference to the construction of the bridge, the city maintaining that, under the said agreement, they were required to construct, according to the plan attached, or intended to be attacked, so much of the proposed bridge as extended from. Bern Street to Lacroix Street, and that they had so completed so much of the work as they were bound by the agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to do at their own cost and charges when they built that portion of the. stricture extending from the eastern boundary of Berri Street to the western boundary of Lacroix Street. The bridge as shown upon the plan extended far beyond the limits mentioned in the agreement, as it extended from the westerly side of Bern Street to the easterly side of Lacroix Street and thence along Lacroix Street for a distance of one hundred and twenty feet, and, as the street itself is eighty feet in width, this would mean the structure of between two hundred and three hundred feet more of bridge than the city maintains they are bound to build.\nI am of opinion that the city is right in this contention, When they contracted with the railway company to build within two limitary lines, as shown on the plan, they meant to become bound for the construction of so much of the bridge, in the way the plan indicated, as lay between these limitary lines, and no matter how much of the structure shown upon the plan may have existed beyond these limits, it did not because it is found there, bind the city to the completion of the whole work at its own cost and charges.\nThe words \"from\" and \"to\" in their ordinary meaning are words of exclusion, and there is no necessary implication that they are used in this agreement in any different sense.\nIt has been held where a grantor conveyed lands extending to the bank of a stream, that the stream was excluded, and so I think here, the street from which the work takes its commencement, to the street to which in the agreement it is to be extended, are neither included in the work for which the city becomes bound. The words are:\nThe corporation covenant that they will construct and maintain a bridge for highway purpose along Notre-Dame Street from Berri Street to Lacroix Street as shown on the said plan of such a height as to make the land below it available for railway purposes but the upper level of the said bridge must not be higher than the level of Notre-Dame Street and to give the company the right to use the land below the said structure as they may require for railway purposes.\nIf it had been intended that the city should construct the whole of the bridge as shown on the plan then the limitary lines mentioned ought to have been such as to have embraced the whole bridge but this is not the case. A large portion of the structure lies outside of the limits mentioned and those limits must in this case govern.\nOn the fourth of August, 1896, it was agreed between the city authorities acting on behalf of the city and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, that the company should advance to the city all the moneys necessary for the completion of the said bridge as shown on the plan, and that the judgment of the court should be sought to decide whether the construction put upon the agreement by the city or by the railway company was the true legal construction.\nThe agreement that the city should build according to the plan along Notre-Dame Street from Bern Street to Lacroix Street, did not by the agreement of the parties enlarge the obligation into which the city had previously entered. The obligation of the city is to be gathered from the written instrument by which they become bound; the plan attached was intended to illustrate that agreement and to make plain, without further words, the kind of structure that was required in which both the city and the railway company were interested, hut it could not supersede the agree- ment and could not require the city to construct a work not lying between the limitary lines mentioned, but extending far beyon them.\nIf it is said in a contract that C is to construct a bridge for D extending from A street to B street, the words are exclusive and if this be done according to a plan attached, and that plan shows the structure continued far beyond B street, it cannot on reason or authority be maintained that C is bound for the construction of any portion of the work beyond that mentioned in his agreement.\nI am of the opinion that when the City of Montreal bridged Notre-Dame Street between the eastern boundary of Berri Street and the western boundary of Lacroix Street, it did all that it had contracted to do and the remainder of the work done by the city under the subsequent agreement is done at the expense of the railway company. I am therefore of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs both in this court and in the court below and that the action should be dismissed with costs.\nARMOUR J.\u2014The Legislature of the Province of Quebec having by the Act 57 Vict. ch. 55sec. 1 ratified and confirmed the deed of the nineteenth of December eighteen hundred and ninety-three scheduled to the said Act, and all the conditions and stipulations therein contained, and authorized the contracting parties to fulfill and carry out the conditions thereof according to their terms and tenor, and granted power to the said parties to do all things necessary to carry out the said agreement according to the intention of the contracting parties, the said agreement became part of the statute law of the Province of Quebec, and was not open to attack on the ground of error or otherwise without first obtaining the repeal of the Act, for how could any court hold that to be invalid which the legislature had ratified and confirmed?\nIt is a common practice to schedule to private or special acts agreements made between the undertakers and other persons and to declare such agreements valid and binding between the parties thereto. The effect of so doing seems to be to make the agreements part of the statute and to exclude the possibility of contending that they are ultra vires as .being beyond the powers of the contracting parties or void as containing stipulations which would be illegal or void but for the statute, for the agreements by incorporation into the statute cease to be voluntary contracts and acquire statutory effect\" Hard castle, 3rd ed. 497. And see Manchester Ship Canal Go. v. Manchester Race course Co, ([1]); The Caledonian Railway Co. v. Greenock and Wemyss Bay By. Go. ([2]).\nThe right of the plaintiffs to recover against the defendants must therefore depend upon the proper construction to be put upon the agreements entered into between them of the 19th December 1893 and of the 4th August 1896 respectively.\nBy clause 1 of the agreement of the 19th December 1893 the defendants covenanted that they would acquire (in so for as they had not already acquired the same) and would within the time thereinafter mentioned for that purpose convey to the plaintifs, an area of land bounded on the north by Craig street, on the east by Lacroix street, on the south by Notre Dame street and on the west by Berri street, including the streets within that area as shewn on the plan attached to the said agreement and forming part thereof, and also that part of Parthenais Square (about 4000 feet) which was then in the possession of the plaintiffs by a simple permission of the defendants. And by clause 5 of the said agreement the defendants covenanted that they would construct and maintain a bridge for highway purposes along Notre-Dame street, from Berri street to Lacroix street, as shewn on said plan of such a height as to make the land below it available for railway purposes, but the upper level of said bridge must not be higher than the level of Notre-Dame street and would give the plaintiffs the right to use the land below the said structure as they might require for railway purposes.\nBy the agreement of the 4th August, 1896 after reciting clause 5 of the agreement of 19th December, 1893, and after reciting that the City of Montreal alleged that it had constructed the said bridge from Berri Street to the south-west line of Lacroix Street according to the said contract; that the said railway company had contended that under the clause therein before cited of the said deed of agreement and according to the plan annexed to the said contract the said city was bound to continue the construction of the said bridge up to a point on the north-east side of the said Lacroix Street as shown on the said plan which contention the said City of Montreal regarded as incorrect and not in conformity with the said agreement and the clause thereof; that the said parties had agreed some time before to have that question decided by the court, and in the meantime to proceed with the completion of the said bridge; that under said understanding the said city had continued the said works up to date but was then unable to continue on account of its inability of advancing the funds necessary for the said works, and that the said parties were desirous to complete the said bridge as shown on the said plan as soon as possible; the said railway company agreed to advance to the said city all the moneys necessary for the completion of the said bridge either on Notre-Dame or Lacroix Street, as shown on the said plan to the extent of thirty-five thousand eight hundred dollars, the amount of the city's estimate of the cost of completing the bridge as aforesaid, and the said city agreed to proceed with the bridge on the following terms under the supervision of the said railway company's engineer, and the City of Montreal agreed that it would apply to the Legislature of the Province of Quebec at its next session for and would use its best endeavour to obtain legislation permitting the city to raise the money necessary to complete the said bridge as aforesaid, and if such legislation should be obtained or if a court of competent jurisdiction should finally decide that the city was liable under the said agreement to bear the cost of constructing and completing the said bridge further north than the line of the southerly limit of Lacroix Street, then any moneys advanced in the meantime by the said company for that purpose as therein before provided should be forthwith reimbursed by the city to the said railway company with five per cent per year interest thereon and the city should bear alone the cost of constructing and completing the said bridge as aforesaid. And the said railway company undertook that if the said judgment finally decided that the city was not liable under the said agreement to construct the said bridge further north than the line of the southerly limit of Lacroix Street then the said railway company would forthwith on demand repay to the said city all moneys which the city might have expended either before or after the execution thereof in completion of the same, provided that the amount of such expenditure and the amount expended for the same purpose by the said railway company should together not exceed thirty-five thousand eight hundred dollars the amount of the said city's estimate of the cost of completing the bridge as aforesaid, the said company being not bound to repay any sum over said amount, and would also pay interest on such moneys as might have been disbursed by the city for the said purpose at the rate of five per cent per annum from the respective periods of such disbursements. And by the said agreement it was provided that nothing therein should be held to effect or diminish the rights of either party under the said agreement of the 19th of December, 1893.\nBy the Act of the Province of Quebec, 61 Vict. ch. 53, the City of Montreal was authorized to borrow the sum of $3100000 for the following among other purposes:\nAmount which the City shall perhaps be called upon to pay for Lacroix Street Bridge $350000\nThe covenant of the defendants contained in the agreement of the 19th December, 1893, was that they would construct and maintain a bridge for highway purposes along Notee-Dame street from Berri to Lacroix street as shown on the plan thereto attached. The bridge shown on the \"plan thereto attached extended from the northerly side of Henri street to the southerly side of Lacroix street, thence across Lacroix street to the northerly side thereof, a distance of eighty feet and up Lacroix street a distance of one hundred and twenty feet. The defendants did not covenant that they would construct and maintain the bridge as shown on the plan, but only that they would construct and maintain a bridge along Notre Dame Street from Berri Street to Lacroix Street as shown on the plan, and under no possible construction of their covenant could the defendants be held liable to construct and maintain the bridge up Lacroix Street, nor could the defendants in my opinion, upon a proper construction of their covenant be held liable to construct and maintain the bridge across Lacroix Street from the southerly to the northerly side thereof as shown on the plan, but only to construct and maintain a bridge along Notre-Dame Street, from the northerly side of Berri Street to the southerly side of Lacroix Street, as shown on the plan. The words \"from\" and \"to\" are words of exclusion in their primary sense and must be so construed unless the subject matter or the context manifestly require that they should be given a wider meaning. Dougall v. Sandwich & Windsor P.& G. Road Jo. ([3]); Bradley v. Rice ([4]); Bonney v. Morrill ([5]); Montgomery v. Reed ([6]); State v. Libby ([7]).\n.And here there is nothing in the subject matter or the context which requires that they should be given a wider meaning.\nIn indictments for nuisance by not repairing roads the words \"from\" and \"to\" exclude the termini Rex v. The Inhabitants of Gamlingay ([8]); Rex v. The Inhabitants of Upton on Severn ([9]); Reg .v. Fisher ([10]); Reg. v. Botfield ([11]).\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants were not liable under the agreement of the 19th December, 1893, to construct the said bridge further north than the line of the southerly limit of Lacroix street.\nIt was, however, contended that even if the court should determine this question in the defendants' favour the defendants would nevertheless be liable to the plaintiffs for the money advanced by them for the purpose of constructing and completing the bridge further north than the line of the southerly limit of Lacroix street by reason of the defendants' covenant contained in the agreement of the 4th August, 1896, that they would apply to the Legislature of the province of Quebec at its then next session for and would use their best endeavor to obtain legislation permitting them to raise the money necessary to complete the said bridge as aforesaid and if such legislation should be obtained that they would forthwith reimburse the plaintiffs the money so advanced; but I am unable to accede to this contention and give effect to this covenant because by so doing I would be affecting and diminishing the rights of the defendants under the agreement of the 19th December, 1893, and by the agreement of the 4th August, 1896, in which this covenant is contained it is expressly provided that nothing therein shall be held to affect or diminish the rights of either party under the said agreement of the 19th December 1893. In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier & Archambault.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lafleur, Macdougall & Macfarlane.\n[1] [1900] 2 .Ch.

The amount of the notes represented the price o1the tender with average interest added, and the municipality reserved the privilege of making payments upon the acceptance of progressive estimates on the works as completed from time to time, without interest or previous notice \"en d\u00e9duisant les int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s au taux de six pour cent par an \u00e0 \u00e9choir apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9poque des paiements et lesquels \u00e9taient compris dans le prix de soumission pour la totalit\u00e9 des deux ann\u00e9es.\" The mean date was settled as 15th Dec. 1899, and the notes for the balance due were delivered in 1900. The trial court allowed the municipality interest on advance payments from the dates on which they had been respectively made, both before and after 15th Dec. 1899, up to 15th Dec. 1901 but the judgment appealed from disallowed all interest prior to 15th Dec. 1899, on the payments which were made before that date. Held, that upon the proper construction of the contract the method followed by the court of appeal as to the calculation of interest on the advance payments was correct.\nThe court of appeal however calculated this interest on the basis of the actual cost of the works\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, on this point, that the interest should be calculated on the basis of the actual amounts of the advance payments made.\nCertain of the works were not executed by orders from the municipality and, on this head, the trial court refused to deduct $2,442.00 from the plaintiff's claim. The ju4gment appealed from did deduct this amount from the judgment in favour of the plaintiff. It appeared, however that the plaintiff had. at least tacitly, consented to this diminution and made no protest in respect thereof.\nHeld, that, under the circumstances, the plaintiff could not claim the sum in question as damages under articles 1065 and 1691 of the Civil Code\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reforming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, at the trial (Archibald J.) which maintained in part the plaintiffs action with costs, and Cross-Appeal by the plaintiff against the judgment of the said Court of King's Bench, in so far as it reversed the judgment of the trial court.\nThe questions at issue on the main appeal are stated in the head-note and judgments now reported.

Deux questions se pr\u00e9sentent 1o Le mode de calculer les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les paiements faits par anticipation, sanctionn\u00e9 par la cour d'appel, est-il celui pr\u00e9vu par le contrat des parties? 2\u00b0 Le march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait est-il sujet \u00e0 diminution des travaux en indemnisant l'entrepreneur?\nJe dois dire que ce n'est pas la question des int\u00e9r\u00eats qui m'a embarrass\u00e9. Je crois que le mode de les calculer adopt\u00e9 par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance n'est pas celui qui est pr\u00e9vu par le contrat. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne sont pas d\u00fbs du jour de chaque paiement, mais seulement \u00e0 compter du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1899, ou subs\u00e9quemment si les paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits apr\u00e8s cette date.

Cette date moyenne fut fix\u00e9e par les parties au 15 d\u00e9cembre 1899 et c'est alors seulement qu'un on plusieurs billets portant cette date et payables \u00e0 deux ans de date, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat, pouvaient \u00eatre demand\u00e9s par les entrepreneurs.

C'est cette balance\u2014que les entrepreneurs chiffraient \u00e0 la somme de $45,017.81\u2014qui fut transport\u00e9e le 3 octobre 1900 \u00e0 la Banque Provinciale du Canada, et qui est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente action. Les parties sont d'accord sur toutes leurs transactions, \u00e0 l'exception de la question des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les paiements faits par anticipation et d'une r\u00e9duction de $2442.00 \u00e0 raison de la diminution de certains travaux par la ville\nDes paiements par anticipation furent faits avant et apr\u00e8s le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1899. M. le juge Archibald, qui jugea en premi\u00e8re instance, accorda les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter de la date des paiements jusqu'au 15 d\u00e9cembre 1901. En appel il fut jug\u00e9 que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats ne doivent courir qu'\u00e0 compter du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1899 s'ils out \u00e9t\u00e9 faits avant cette date, et du jour o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits s'ils le furent apr\u00e8s. Nous sommes tous d'avis que c'est le mode pr\u00e9vu par le contr\u00e2t.\nDe cette fa\u00e7on, si le 15 d\u00e9cembre, 1899, la corporation e\u00fbt pay\u00e9 le prix entier du march\u00e9, le montant total des int\u00e9r\u00eats qui en faisaient partie devait \u00eatre d\u00e9duit. Elle n'avait alors pay\u00e9 qu'une partie, savoir $58,422.66, en quatre paiements, et elle a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9duction pour autant, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s pendant deux ans, et ainsi de suite lorsque des paiements subs\u00e9quents furent faits. En un mot, lorsqu'elle faisait un paiement par anticipation, elle avait droit d'\u00eatre rembours\u00e9e des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compris dans le prix du march\u00e9. C'est aussi la m\u00e9thode qu'a consacr\u00e9e en partie la cour d'appel Si l'on en juge par les consid\u00e9rants suivants de son jugement :\nThe Court, etc.\u2014Considering that the intention of the parties to the contract between the appellant and the commercial firm of U. Pauz\u00e9 et Fils was that a delay of two years for the payment of the price of the works contracted for should be allowed, to date from the day to be agreed upon as the mean date of the completion of the works which date was subsequently established to be the 15th day of December, 1899, that compound interest at the rate of six per centum per annum for such two years should be added to the real price in consideration of such term of two years for its payment, that the appellant should give promissory notes to the contractors for the price of the works with the addition of such compound interest for two years, bearing date on the day to be agreed upon as the mean date of the completion of the works and payable two years after date, and that the appellant should have the privilege of paying the whole or part of the price by anticipation and would be entitled to an allowance of compound interest at the rate of six per centum per annum on the portion of the real price, that is the price less the addition of the compound interest for two years, represented by all payments so made, from the 15th day of December, 1899, if made before that date, to the 15th day of December, 1901, and from the date of payment if made within the term of two years stipulated for the payment of the price of the contract to the 15th day of December, 1901 :\nConsidering that the appellant is entitled to compound interest only for two years on the payments made before the 15th'day of December, 1899 and to the compound interest from the date of payment on the payments made subsequently to the 15th day of December 1899, to the 15th day of December 1901; that there is therefore error in the method employed by the court of first instance fur calculating such compound interest, which was calculated on all the payments from the date on which they were made whether before or after the 15th day of December 1899;\nConsidering that the rebate of compound interest to which the appellant is entitled amounts according to the calculation hereto annexed to the sum of $10,989.13 and not to the sum of $12.730.45 allowed by the judgment appealed from.\nDoth declare that the sum due on the claim of the commercial firm of U. Pauz\u00e9 et Fils by the appellant to the respondent as the transferee of the contractors, is $25,838.19, on account of which the respondent has received the promissory note of the appellant for $22819.56 payable on the 15th day of December 1901 leaving a balance of $3,018.63, and doth condemn the appellant to pay this balance of $3C 18.63 to the respondent with interest from the 15th day of December 1901 at the rate of six per centum per annum and costs of suit in the Superior Court, the whole with the reservation of all rights which the respondent may have under and in virtue of the promissory note for $22,819.56 against the appellant.\nDans une note, au bas du jugement on trouve une table du calcul de ces int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s. Elle nous fait voir que, pour en d\u00e9terminer le montant, la cour a pris comme base le co\u00fbt actuel 1the real price) des travaux. Nous croyons que c'est l\u00e0 une erreur. Ces expressions real price ne Se trouvent pas au contrat Le contrat, il est vrai dit que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 sera d\u00e9duit du montant du co\u00fbt des travaux\". Mais cela ne veut pas dire co\u00fbt r\u00e9el on real price, mais le co\u00fbt porte au contrat. c'est-\u00e0-dire le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el et les int\u00e9r\u00eats qui furent ajout\u00e9s. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est la seule raisonnable et possible m\u00eame en face de la clause 15e des sp\u00e9cifications :\u2014\nLa ville pourra payer etc.,\u2014en d\u00e9duisant les int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s au taux de six pour cent par an \u00e0 \u00e9cheoir apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9poque des paiements et lesquels \u00e9taient compris dans le prix de soumission pour la l\u00e9talit\u00e9 des deux ann\u00e9es.\nEn d\u00e9terminant le montant des int\u00e9r\u00eats nous n'avons pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el des travaux mais le mon- tant des sommes pay\u00e9es.

C'est la seule diff\u00e9rence qui existe entre les deux cours c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il faut d\u00e9duire $1,358344 de la condamnation rendue contre elle.\nC'est sur la question de la diminution du prix que nous avons longtemps d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 Cette diminution se monte \u00e0 $2,442.00. Je suis tent\u00e9 de croire, avec mon confr\u00e8re le juge Armour, que l'article 1691 du Code Civil invoqu\u00e9 par la cour d'appel pour justifier cette diminution, ne s'applique qu'au cas de la r\u00e9siliation enti\u00e8re du contrat et qu'il con sacre un droit exceptionnel en faveur du propri\u00e9taire qui ne peut s'\u00e9tendre au del\u00e0 du cas pr\u00e9vu par le texte de cet article savoir la r\u00e9siliation et non pas la modification ou l'abandon partiel du contrat de sa part. Il s'agit ici d'une simple contravention an contrat; alors quel est le recours du cr\u00e9ancier Lorsque l'on consid\u00e8re qu'aux termes de l'article 1691 le propri\u00e9taire doit payer les dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats dus \u00e0 l'entrepreneur, ne peut on pas soutenir avec raison que le droit de r\u00e9silier tout le contrat est illusoire en pratique et qu'il ne conf\u00e8re aucun avantage r\u00e9el? La loi ii est vrai, ne permet pas de r\u00e9pudier les contrats bilat\u00e9raux, ni d'en violer aucune des dispositions. Mais lorsque la chose arrive, quelle est la cons\u00e9quence?\nL'entrepreneur pourra-t-il demander le prix de l'ouvrage comme s'il l'e\u00fbt fait? L'article 1065, C.C., nous donne la limite du droit du cr\u00e9ancier dans un pareil cas :\nToute obligation rend le d\u00e9biteur passible de dommages en cas de contravention do sa part\"\nComme on le voit, ii n'est pas dans une pire position que celui qui en r\u00e9siliant un march\u00e9 et devis reste dans les limites de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9. Appliquant donc la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant l'inex\u00e9cution des obligations, les entrepreneurs n'avaient dans l'esp\u00e8ce qu'une demande pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais comment peuvent-ils la faire valoir? Ils n'ont pas protest\u00e9 contre la diminution ils ont continu\u00e9 les travaux comme si elle n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite * ils v ont donc consenti an moins tacitement. La cour d'appel affirme que de fait, elle leur \u00e9tait profitable et la cour de premi\u00e8re instance ne contredit pas cette appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve. Dommageable on non la diminution.n'a donn\u00e9 lien \u00e0 aucune action ou r\u00e9clamation pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de la part des entrepreneurs. Il n'en est aucunement question dans la cause. Voil\u00e0 cependant tout ce qu'ils pouvaient demander. Ils ne l'ont pas fait et ii y a toute raison de croire que ce f\u00fbt parce qu'ils n'en avaient pas soufferts\nNous sommes donc d'avis de renvoyer le contre-appel avec d\u00e9pens et d'accorder en partie l'appel principal et de modifier le jugement de la cour du bane du roi, avec d\u00e9pens devant cette cour et la cour du bane du roi. L'appellante est condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e la somme de $1,660.99, l'int\u00e9r\u00e9t sur icelle \u00e0 compter du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1901, au taux de six pour cent par an, et les frais de la demande en cour sup\u00e9rieure; le tout avec la r\u00e9serve de tous les droits que l'intim\u00e9e peut faire valoir \u00e0 raison du billet promissoire de l'appelante, pour $22,899.56, qu'elle retira de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nDAVIES J. Concurred in the result of the judgment for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard\nMILLS J. In this easel entirely concur in the judgment of my brother Armour and I do not feel that I can usefully add anything to what he has said in his judgment\nARMOUR J. The defendant contracted with the firm of U. Pauz\u00e9 & Fils to construct certain drains and do certain grading for the defendant, and it was the agreement that the 15th December, 1899, should be taken to be the date of the completion of the works, and that the price fixed for the works should be paid for by the promissory note of the defendant payable in two years from that date. The price fixed for constructing the drains was $118,479.97, and for doing the grading, $21,375. These sums did not represent the true cost of the works but the true cost of the works with interest at six per cent per annum, compounded for the two years of the currency of the promissory note added to such true cost and it was agreed that the defendant should be at liberty to pay at any time any part of the said note before the expiration of the two years, and should thereby become entitled to a rebate of such compound interest. The contractors completed the works except a portion thereof which they were directed by the defendant not la do and they claimed in addition to the fixed price the sum of $2,708.94 for extra work and the defendant claimed the sum of $2442500 as a deduction from the fixed price for the work which the contractors refrained from doing by direction of the defendant. Considerable sums of money were paid by the defendants in respect of the contract as will be shown hereafter In October 1900, the contractors assigned their claims against the defendant to the plaintiff, who thereupon brought this action demanding a promissory note dated the 15th December, 1899, payable in two years for the balance due in respect of the contract or in the alternative, demanding payment of such balance. The defendant pleaded that, after the commencement of the action, it offered the plaintiff a promissory note dated the 15th December, 1899, payable in two years for the sum of $22,819.66, and offered the attorneys of the plaintiff the sum of $58.75 for their costs and it delivered to the prothonotary of the court the said promissory note.\nThe cause was tried in the Superior Court by Archibald J. who disallowed the claim of the defendant for the sum of $2442.00 as a deduction for work not done and found the offer of the defendant insufficient that the balance due was $26,539.37 for which sum he ordered the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff its promissory note dated the 15th December, 1899, payable in two years and in default he ordered the defendant to pay the said sum with interest at six per cent per annum from the 15th December, 1901, and to pay the costs of the suit. The defendant thereupon appealed to the Court of King's Bench against the said judgment on the ground of the disallowance of the claim for the deduction of $2,442.50 which court maintained the appeal with costs in favour of the appellant against the respondent, set aside and annulled the judgment appealed from, and proceeding to pronounce the judgment which should have been rendered declared that the sum due on the claim was $25,838.99 on account of which the respondent had received the promissory note of the appellant for $22,899.56 payable on the 15th day of December, 1901, leaving a balance of $3,018.63, and condemned the appellant to pay this balance of $3018633 to the respondent with interest from the 15th day of December, 1901, at the rate of six per cent per annum, and costs of suit in the Superior Court the whole with the reservation of all rights which the respondent might have under and in virtue of the promissory note for $22,81..56 against the appellant. The defendant thereupon appealed to this court against the judgment of the Court of King's Bench so far as it found the balance due to be $25,838.99, and the plaintiff cross-appealed against the allowance of the deduction of $2442.50.\nThe defendant contended that the Court of King's Bench should not have interfered with the computation made by the Superior Court of the balance due by the defendant, for it only appealed to that court by reason of the disallowance of the sum of $2,442,50 but they appealed against the judgment and having done so it was in the power of that court to give the judgment which the Superior Court ought to have given. Besides the allowance by the Court of King's Bench of the deduction of $2442500 rendered a new computation necessary in order to ascertain the balance due by the defendant.\nI am of the opinion that the allowance by the Court of King's Bench of the deduction of the sum of $2,442.00 was erroneous.\nThe contract between the contractors and the defendant was for fixed sums for the entire works, and the contractors refrained from doing that portion of he works contracted for, represented by the said sum, by the orders of the defendant and the defendant was consequently not entitled to any deduction for the work so omitted to be done.\nThe law relied upon by the defendant and maintained by the Court of King's Bench as authority for allowing the deduction was article 1691 of the Civil Code:\nThe owner may cancel the contract for the construction of a building or other works at a fixed price, although the works have been begun, on indemnifying the workman for all his actual expenses and labour and paying damages according to the circumstances of the case.\nBut this article clearly did not apply to this case for there was no cancellation of the contract within the meaning of that article which plainly means an entire cancellation of the whole contract. It does not orive the owner power to cancel the contract as to one part of the work contracted for and to maintain it as to another; he must either cancel it in toto or not at all. The power is given to cancel the contract, but no power is given to cancel a part of it.\nNo authority was cited for the construction put upon this article by the Court of King's Bench and the opinions of the commentators upon it seem to me to be opposed to such a construction. The price payable at the end of the two years for the construction of the drains was\n$118,479 97\nFor the grading\n21,375 00\nFor extras\n2,708 94\n$142,563 91\nThese items included interest for two years at six per cent per annum compounded; the actual amount therefore payable to the contractors on the 15th December 1899, was $126,881.37, on account of which the defendant paid prior to the 15th December, 1899, the following sums :\n1899.\nOct. 28 , ...\n$30,204 86\nNov. 4\n2,832 57\n\" 18.,\n7,960 43\nDec. 6\n8.125 00\n\" 10\n8,300 00\nAmounting in all to\n$57,422 86\non which amount the defendant was not entitled to any interest and which being deducted from $126-881.37 leaves a balance on the 15th December, 1899, of $69,488.51.\nThe following shows the state of the account subsequent to the 15th December, 1899 :\nDec. 15\nTo balance\n$69,438 51\n\" 29\n\" 14 days comp.int\n157 55\n69,596 06\n\" \"\nBy cash\n15,300 00\n54,296 06 1900.\nJan. 4.\nTo 6 days comp. int\n52 58\n4,348 64\n\" \"\nBy Cash\n5,655 00\n48,693 64\n\" 30\nTo 26 days comp. int\n203 90\n49,097 54\n\" \"\nBy Cash\n18,962 45\n30,135 09\nAug. 16\nTo 198 days comp. int\n203 90\n30,338 99\n\" \"\nBy Cash\n4,953 78\n$25,485 21\n1901.

The defendants had previously made a special contract with plaintiff but delivered the receipt to his agent at the point of the shipment with a variation of the special terms made with him in respect to all shipments to him as consignee during the shipping season of 1899, the variation being shown by a clause stamped across the receipt of which the plaintiff had no knowledge. One of the shipments was sold at an intermediate point on the line of transportation on account of non-payment of freight by one of the companies in control of a connecting line to which the goods had been delivered by the defendants.\nHeld, that the plaintiff's agent at the shipping point had no authority, as such, to consent to a variation of the special contract, nor could the carrier do so by inserting the clause in the receipt without the concurrence of the plaintiff; that the sale, so made at the intermediate point, amounted to a wrongful conversion of the goods by the defendants and that they were not exempted by the terms of the shipping receipt from liability for their full value.\nAs the evidence shewed definitely what damages had been sustained, and there being no good reason for remitting the case back for a new trial, the Supreme Court of Canada, in reversing the judgment appealed from (9 B. C. Rep. 82), ordered that the damages should be reduced to those proved in respect of the goods sold and converted. Armour J., however, was of opinion that the jugdment of Craig J. at the trial, including damages for the loss on other goods, should be restored.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia [1] reversing the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory with costs and ordering a new trial between the parties upon amended pleadings.\nThe action was to recover damages for loss of and damage to goods which the defendants undertook to carry from Victoria, B.C. to Dawson City, under the contract for carriage set out in the judgment now reported, and either wholly failed to carry or only carried after great delay, and also a certain sum for agreed rebate on freight. The case was tried in the Territorial Court, Yukon Territory, before Mr. Justice Craig who gave judgment for the plaintiff for $28,855.85 for damages and costs. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which by the judgment now appealed from[2] reversed the judgment of the Territorial Court, and ordered the pleadings to be amended and a new trial had between the parties.\nThe material facts of the case are stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies who delivered the judgment of the court.\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper K.C. and Davis K.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff's representative at the port of shipment had no authority to vary the special agreement nor could the company do so by inserting the stamped clause without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff. But, even if the stamped clause is binding, it does not exempt from liability under the facts of this case, the loss of some shipments and the delay and consequent damage to others being caused by the defendants' own wilful act. The contract of 19th June, in connection with the negotiations at and before its execution, bound the defendants to carry all shipments by plaintiff during the season of 1899, and guarantee their delivery in that season and to pay all charges in order to carry them through, freight being C. O. D. at Dawson. They also were bound to pay the plaintiff a rebate of 7 1\/2 p.c. on the total freight. The defendants undertook to carry more than they could handle, created a blockade at Bennett and White Horse, and thus by their own wilful act, prevented the performance of their contract. The most notable example was with regard to a shipment of potatoes and onions which arrived at Bennett on 21st Sep. by the White Pass Railway. The defendants' agent knew they were there, took no steps to pay back\u2014freight nor to ship them on. Although he could have done so immediately, he did nothing. He might have notified the plaintiff by wire, but he did not, and on 28th Sept. the railway company, (who were the defendants' agents) under some imaginary right (see Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co'y v. Huth [3], sold the shipment to a man who forthwith shipped them to Dawson on a scow, towed by the defendants' boat as far as White Horse, and thence down to Dawson without a tow, and arrived there in good order on 22nd October. He realized $9,000 for this shipment immediately on arrival. If defendants had taken these goods on the 21st and put them on a steamer which was running every day from Bennett or on a scow to be towed, they would have got down. The only claim that the railway company could have had was for their freight charges; had these been paid the goods would not have been sold.\nPitts was not our agent and notice to him was not notice to us. The bill of lading is not the contract under which these goods were shipped. It is nothing more than a receipt or document to show title. The contract was made long before the bills of lading were given on 19th June. We may be bound by ordinary terms as to carriage in the bill of lading; but we deny that a clause in it can effect an alteration of our rights under the original contract, See Rodoconachi v. Milburn Bros.[4], at page 319; Gledstanes v. Allen,[5], and Wagstaff v. Anderson, [6], per Bramwell LJ., at page 177, and in Sewell v. Burdick,[7], at page 105; Leduc v. Ward, [8] per Esher, M.R.; Abbott on shipping, (13 ed.) pp. 345, 350 where the whole matter is discussed.\nEven if the stamped clause applies, it does not exempt from liability against the negligence and the wilful wrong of the defendants. See remarks of Bramwell L.J., in Lewis v. Great Western Ry. Co.[9], \"owner's risk means at the risk of the owner minus the liability of the carrier for the misconduct of himself or servants.\" See also Robinson v. Great Western Ry. Co.[10]; D'Arc v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[11]; McCawley v. Furness Ry. Co.[12] ; Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Fitzgerald[13], at page 214; Leake on Contracts, 604. The liability for negligence remains unless clearly contracted out of: The Xantho[14] at pp. 510, 512; Hamilton Fraser & Co. v. Pandorf & Co.[15]. The North West Transportation Co. v. Mackenzie[16], has no application, as in this case, there was no refusal to take the goods; the goods were taken as the Judge has found under the terms of the contract. The only question is whether the terms of the contract have or have not been varied by the bill of lading. The principle is laid down by King J. in that case, at page 45, and the clause relied on by Mr. Justice Martin was obiter.\nThe learned Judges erred in finding that the stamped clause applied and, even if right upon that finding they are wrong in the conclusion as to its effect. Brit. & S. A. SS. Co. v. Anglo-Argentine L. S. & P. Agency [17] shows that the bill of lading merely fixes whether the goods are taken by weight or measurement.\nWe rely upon the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, and his findings of fact which are fully justified by evidence and conclusive of the case, and also that the plaintiff was entitled to a rebate of 71\/2 per cent upon the whole amount of freight from Victoria to Dawson and not only upon such part only as was applicable to carriage by defendants' boats. There are no means of finding out how much freight was applicable to any portion of the voyage, therefore, the contract must be construed as meaning a rebate on the whole through freight.\nDuff K.C. for the respondents. The shipments were made by Pitts at Victoria, B.C. and consigned by him to the order of Bank of Commerce at Dawson City, not to appellant, and the bills of lading were forwarded to that bank with drafts attached for collection. When in addition to the natural difficulties of the route and the trouble created by the sudden falling of the river, there was an unexpected rush of business for Dawson in 1899, and in August a blockade of freight occurred both at Skagway and White Horse, the congestion was so great that it became plain that difficulty would be experienced in delivering freight already shipped without reference to future business likely to be transported over the same route. In consequence the respondents and other companies issued a notice to shippers that, on and after August 20th, shipments for Dawson City and Yukon points could only be accepted subject to the conditions: 1. That the carriers did not guarantee delivery before the close of navigation, and were released by the shippers and consignees from all claims in respect of non-delivery; 2. That freight charges to Bennett, B.C., be prepaid. And, with notice of these conditions, Pitts continued to ship goods after the 20th August, the bill of lading containing the condition stamped upon its face :\u2014\"This shipment is made and accepted at owner's risk of delivery during 1899, and the carriers are released by all parties in interest from all claims and liability arising out of or occasioned by non\u2014delivery during 1899.\" The trial judge finds as a fact that Pitts took each bill of lading with distinct notice of this condition. This condition is sufficient to exonerate the carrier from all liability in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case. Peninsular & Oriental S. N. Co. v. Shand, [18]; Carr v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co. [19]; Crawford v. Browne, [20]; Dickson v. Great Northern Ry. Co. [21]; Beal on Bailments, page 411, et seq; Peek v. North Staffordshire Ry. Co. [22]; Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Ry. Co. v. Brown [23]. The only matter, therefore, open for litigation is whether or not the company are liable for breach of contract for refusing to receive the goods except on a condition exempting them from liability for failure to deliver during 1899. This issue, however, has not been tried. The court of the first instance proceeded throughout on a misconception, and if the appellant has any remedy he must resort to some other form of action than the one which he has adopted.\nThe trial judge found that respondents were guilty of actual negligence. If he is right in holding that the contract of 19th June governs and that the guarantee was a part of it, then the question of negligence becomes immaterial. As a matter of fact, however, the finding of negligence proceeds upon the misconception of the duty of the respondents and a misunderstanding of the circumstances surrounding the shipment. In the first place, the blockade occurred before the freight reached respondents, and arose from causes which they could not control. The trial judge finds negligence because the appellant's goods were not forwarded in preference to those of other shippers. There was no contract requiring this and no such duty was imposed upon respondents. All goods were forwarded as rapidly as possible in the order of arrival at Skagway. By reason of the sudden falling of the river, all the larger vessels were compelled to carry much less than their usual tonnage; moreover, the season closed so rapidly that they were not able to make as many trips as it was reasonable to suppose they could accomplish. It is perfectly clear that Wilson's goods were not intentionally delayed.\nThen, the appellant was not the legal owner nor consignee of the goods and had therefore no right of action. Leggatt on Bills of Lading, pages 635, 636, 637; Cahn v. Pockett's B. C. S. P. Co. [24] at page 65; Shepherd v. Harrison [25]; Kent v. Worthing Local Board [26] We also refer to Abbott on Shipping (13 ed.) pp. 590-593; Moes v. Leith, etc., Co.[27]; Robertson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[28]; Norman v. Binnington [29].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nDAVIES J.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, and a majority of the court are of the opinion that the damages assessed and allowed by the trial judge should be reduced.\nThe learned judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in reversing the judgment of the trial judge and ordering a new trial, did so upon the ground that after the contract of June, 1899, a new contract was entered into between the parties for the carriage of the plaintiff's goods, and that the terms of this new contract were to be found in the several bills of lading signed at the time the goods were shipped, and which terms controlled and governed the responsibility of the defendants for the carriage of the goods.\nAs, however, we are of the opinion that the trial judge was right in holding that the goods were carried under the contract of carriage made between the parties in June and that the terms of this contract could not be varied without the concurrence of the plaintiff who was one of the parties to it, we are not called upon to express any opinion as to the meaning and effect of the stamped clause placed upon the several bills of lading after the 22nd August, 1899, and purporting to limit the carrier's liability. The plaintiff had no notice of this material change in the terms of his contract, and Mr. Pitts, who shipped the goods to him from Victoria, was not his agent to accept or agree to any such change, nor in fact did he pretend to do so. The Supreme Court of British Columbia were of the opinion that the plaintiff's action, if any, was one simply for a refusal of the defendants to carry the goods under their June contract with the plaintiff. We do not, however, agree with this view, but concur with the trial judge that their action was not a refusal to carry the goods under their contract, but an attempt made by them to vary its terms by the addition of a clause further limiting their contractual liability.\nThe June contract was in the following terms:\nCANADIAN DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, LTD.\nFREIGHT CONTRACT entered into 19th June, 1899, between T. G. Wilson, of Dawson City, shipper, and Canadian Development Company, Limited, No. 32 Fort Street, Victoria, B.C., carriers; whereby it is agreed that the goods of class and quantity herein mentioned shall be shipped and carried between the points at the rate and on the terms herein set forth, viz : From Puget Sound and British Columbia ports to Dawson City.\nDate of Shipment.\u2014Throughout season of 1899.\nClass of Goods.\u2014General merchandise.\nQuantity.\u2014Exclusive contract for season of 1899.\nRates as fixed by joint tariff and classification of commodities hereunto annexed, subject to payment of extra packers' charges over White Pass and Yukon route on shipments made prior to July 10, 1899. Shipper to have a rebate at end of season equal to seven and one-half per cent (7 1\/2%) on the amount of business routed over our steamers.\nTerms of Payment\u2014C. O. D., Dawson City.\nConsignees\u2014T. G. Wilson, Dawson City.\nShipper to be protected in event of rate war.\nA shipping receipt in ordinary form in use by the company to be given for the goods at the time of shipment, to be carried under and pursuant to the terms of the shipping receipt.\nT. G. WILSON, Shipper,\nCanadian Development Co., Limited.\nPer R. T. ELLIOTT.\nThe joint tariff referred to in this contract was one entered into between a number of transportation companies fixing the rates of through freight to Dawson City from British Columbia and Puget Sound ports. The only one of its terms or stipulations which was made applicable to the contract in question in this suit was that fixing the rates. Its other terms or stipulations applied simply as between the companies which were parties to it.\nThe last clause in the contract of June between the parties hereto provides that a shipping receipt in the ordinary form in use by the company was to be given for the goods at the time of shipment, and that they were to be carried under and pursuant to the stipulations of that receipt.\nThe terms of that shipping receipt, so far as they are material in determining the liability of the defendant company, are as follows:\nIt is agreed that in settlement of any claim for loss of or damage to any of the within mentioned goods, said claim shall be restricted to the cash value of such goods at the port of shipment at the date of shipment.\nIn consideration of the goods being carried by the company at a reduced rate, it is expressly agreed and declared that the shipper waives and abandons any right accorded, by statute or otherwise, to hold the company responsible in any manner for the keeping or safe or prompt carriage of the goods, and waives and abandons all advantage and benefit accorded by the statute, 37 Vict. c. (blurred), to the shipper, and himself accepts all responsibility for the safe-keeping and carriage of the goods, and agrees to hold the company absolved and discharged from delays, damages or losses, from whatever cause arising, including delays, loss or damage arising through negligence or carelessness or want of skill of the company's officers, servants or workmen, but which shall have occurred without the actual fault or privity of the company.\nThe terms of this agreement are undoubtedly very wide and relieve the company from liability for losses or damages arising out of their contract for \"the safe keeping and carriage of the goods\" even when caused by the negligence or carelessness or want of skill of the company's officers, servants or workmen. But it was clearly not intended to relieve them of all respon- sibility because their liability for damages caused \"by the actual fault or privity of the company\" is expressly reserved and we are of opinion that, with respect to such of the plaintiff's goods as were actually converted and sold by the defendant company or their agents, while being carried by them to Dawson, the cause does not exempt them from liability. Nor do we think the clause restricting claims for loss of or damage to the goods to their cash value at the port of shipment covers or was intended to cover cases where the goods were wrongfully sold or converted to their own use by the carrier. It is impossible to conceive that such a clause should be so construed as to enable the carrier wantonly to destroy the goods while being carried by him to their destination, and possibly at a time and place when their value had become enormously enhanced, and then say to the owner: \"True it is, I have without justification destroyed your goods, but I am only liable to pay you their value at the place of shipment.\" We do not construe this clause limiting the amount of the claim which the owner of the goods can make for loss or damage to his property as extending to cases of either wanton or unjustifiable destruction or conversion of the goods. In the late case of Price v. The Union Lighterage Company[30] Walton J. reviewed the cases upon the construction to be given to these contracts of carriage and his remarks and conclusions are instructive.\nNow with respect to the shipment of potatoes and onions sent forward on the 5th September, the evidence is that these goods were sold by one of the companies or parties to whom the defendants had given them because of the non-payment of the freight. The purchaser at this wrongful sale himself took the goods forward to Dawson and realised a very handsome profit. We are all of the opinion that for this wrongful conversion or destruction of the plaintiff's goods for the carriage of which to Dawson the defendants had contracted, they have not exempted themselves from liability. By the express terms of the contract the freight was not payable by the plaintiff till his goods were delivered to him in Dawson. The non-payment of the freight which was made an excuse for the sale of the goods, was, as between the parties to this suit, due entirely to the actual fault of the defendants.\nThe evidence as to the actual loss sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of this wrongful conversion of his goods was not contradicted, nor was it seriously contended that, if liable at all, the amount claimed as damages for the goods sold was excessive. As the evidence shows definitely the damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the wrongful destruction of this shipment, as distinct from the damages claimed on the other shipments from which the defendants have by contract exempted themselves from liability, we see no good reason for remitting the cause back for further evidence.\nThe damages must be reduced to those proved with respect to the goods sold and converted while on their way to Dawson, viz.: $13,904.71.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs in all the courts, and the damages reduced to the amount above specified.\nARMOUR J.\u2014I agree with the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of the learned trial judge, and am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith & Macrae.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Clarke, Wilson & Stacpoole.\n[1] 9 B.

The latter built and lived on the land and cultivated a large portion of it for more than ten years when he removed to a place a few miles distant after which he pastured cattle on it and put up fences from time to time. His father died before he left the land. In 1870 he deeded the land to his four sons who sold it in 1873, and by different conveyances the title passed to P. in 1884. In 1896 the descendants of the younger children of M. gave a deed of this land to B. who proceeded to cut timber from it. In an action of trespass by P.\nHeld, that the jury on the trial were justified in finding that the eldest son of M. had the sole and exclusive possession of the land for twenty years before 1870 which had ripened into a title. If not the deed to his sons in 1870 gave them exclusive possession and if they had not a perfect title then they had twenty years after in 1890.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above headnote. Roscoe K.C. for the appellants.\nBorden K.C. and Gourley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favour of the plaintiff, respondent, ordering the appellants to restore to him the goods replevied and payment of nominal damages for the trespass. The judgment of the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, the trial judge, in favour of the respondent, and upon appeal his judgment was confirmed.\nAs the decision of the case mainly depends upon the question whether or not the rights of the parties are to be determined by the provisions of the Statute of Limitations, it may be well to state certain fundamental propositions, the proper application of which to the facts in controversy must settle this appeal.\n1. According to the English law the word \"possession as applied to real estate, has a purely technical meaning. The word \"occupancy\" is not a word of legal import apart from its popular acceptation. Occupancy may as a matter of fact negative possession in its legal sense, but possession in the same sense is consistent with non-occupancy. In other words, all land in the dominions of the Crown must be in the possession of some one, whether that \"some one\" be the Crown itself or a natural or artificial entity. \"Vacant\" land\u2014\"abandoned\" land, (where title is involved) is an impossibility. Possession must be somewhere\u2014in somebody\u2014and he who has the title is presumed to have the possession unless the actual dominion and occupancy is elsewhere.\n2. Where the owner (also a non-technical word)\u2014the person having a present legal estate, whether by word of mouth or by a written instrument\u2014lets blackacre, the tenant accepting and entering by virtue thereof has possession of every foot of ground comprised in blackacre, although he may possess himself of but one foot of it only.\n3. Where a person without title and without right (in Canada we call him a \"squatter\") enters upon land, his possession in a legal sense is limited to the ground which he actually occupies, cultivates and encloses; it is a possessio pedis\u2014nothing more.\n4. But where a person in good faith under a written instrument from one purporting to be the proprietor, enters into blackacre\u2014a definite territorial area\u2014his actual occupancy of a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in the absence of actual adverse occupancy by another, gives him a constructive possession of blackacre as a whole. He has it, as the phrase is, under \"colour of title.\"\n5. At common law and notwithstanding the old limitation statutes, the actual and exclusive possession of a tenant or parcener could not work to the detriment of his co-tenant or co-parcener. His possession was theirs and could be invoked not only as against the alleged title of a trespasser, but in aid of their own:\n(But this principle has long since been changed by statute both in England and Nova Scotia.)\n6. Since this change, therefore, exclusive possession by one of such co-owners is regarded as adverse against the others.\n7. But independently of that, and notwithstanding the statute, his grant or feoffment of the whole estate to one entering into possession under it operates as an ouster of the others and the latter's right under the Statute of Limitations begins from the date of the grant. In the present case one Samuel McLellan obtained a grant of the land in dispute in 1821 and a year afterwards permitted his son, Robert, to enter into possession of it. For more than ten years, and until after the death of his father, he lived upon it, built a house and barn upon it, and cultivated a considerable portion of it. It appears that afterwards he removed from the place some few miles distant where he continued to live, but the evidence shows, and the jury has found, that he occupied the land and had sole and exclusive possession for twenty years before the year 1870. And I think they would have been justified in finding a sole and exclusive possession for 47 years.\nSamuel McLellan, Robert's father, left ten sons and four daughters, and it is proved that not one of these children, nor any of their descendants, ever claimed title to nor occupancy of any portion of the land in dispute, from the time that Robert entered it in 1823 down to the commencement of this action in December 1899, and that during all of that period, when fencing or pasturing or cultivation of any kind, or the taking of wood or timber therefrom, was necessary, Robert and those claiming under him were the only ones that ever attempted or claimed or exercised the right to do so. In 1870 Robert conveyed the lot to his four sons, Samuel. Charles, John A. and Albert, and although none of them lived upon the lot the possession must be presumed to be in them, they taking seizin under their father. These four brothers just mentioned, in December 1873, sold to one Frederick A. Fullmore, but Fullmore's deed was not registered. Fullmore's title was sold under a registered judgment against him by the sheriff to one Amos Hill on the 13th June 1882, and Hill conveyed to one J Gourley Peppard, by deed dated the 24th March, 1884, the two latter deeds being registered. The plaintiff is the administrator of Gourley Peppard. The defendant purported to purchase the lot from Charles McLellan (who had previously conveyed to Fullmore as above mentioned), Edward McLellan and Sylvius McLellan, nephews of Robert McLellan, and cousins of Charles, the deed being dated 10th August, 1896, and registered in November following. It is under this deed that the appellants claim the right to cut the timber in question.\nIt is, I think, clearly established, as already intimated, that Robert McLellan having been let into possession of the land by his father, then being the patentee from the Crown, the Statute of Limitations began to run against the father in the father's lifetime; that twenty years exclusive possession, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, would give him a good title at their expiration. So that his possession, after his father's death, would not, under the common law, inure to the benefit of his co-heirs, the brothers and sisters above mentioned. That would be a sufficient answer to the plaintiffs claim. But assuming otherwise, the deed from Robert McLellan, he then being in possession, to his four sons, in April, 1870, gave them exclusive possession of the whole lot, and even supposing they had not then a perfect title, that title became perfect twenty years thereafter, namely, April 1890.\nThe purchase therefore by the defendant in 1896 could not avail as against their deed and possession.\nA point was raised at the argument as to whether the defendant's title was good inasmuch as the deed to Frederick A. Fullmore was not registered. The subsequent deeds were registered, as already stated, and it is not necessary to decide whether under the Registry laws these deeds are of no avail as against the purchase by Bentley in 1896 inasmuch as the trial judge found, and we think upon sufficient evidence, that the consideration for his deed was merely nominal and deeds of that character do not come within the protection afforded by the Registry laws.\nOn the whole we are of opinion that the judgment below should not be disturbed.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Norman J. Layton.\nSolicitor for the respondents: G. H. Vernon.\n"

Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, Bishop H. Porter, of Bridge water in the County of Lunenburg, who was the owner of certain gold mining areas at Leipsigate Gold District, in Lunenburg County, on May 9th, 1900, gave a 60 days' option at the price of $6,000 upon those areas to the defendant Pelton, with liberty to do development work on the areas in the mean time.\nThe defendant Pelton, though unknown to the plaintiff, was in partnership with the defendant Holden and the option was taken for the benefit of the partnership, and by the directions of the defendant Holden. Work was done upon the areas, an extension of the option was obtained, and before it expired the defendants decided to purchase the areas and the plaintiff was notified to that effect. The sum of $1,000.00 was paid to the plaintiff by a cheque furnished by the defendant Holden and a note for $1,000.00, signed by the defendant Pelton and indorsed by the defendant Holden, was given to the plaintiff The plaintiff executed a transfer of the areas to the defendant Pelton, and received an agreement executed by him alone by which he undertook to organize a company to operate those areas, said agreement being in the words and figures following:\u2014\n\"Memorandum of Agreement made this 6th day of August, 1900, by and between George W. Pelton, of Waltham, Massachusetts, Mining Engineer, at present of Bridge water, Nova Scotia, of the first part and Bishop H. Porter, of Bridgewater aforesaid, in the county of Lunenburg, druggist, of the second part.\n\"Whereas by transfers from said Bishop H. Porter and from Watson Porter dated and delivered this day, the said Bishop H. Porter has sold and conveyed to said George W. Pelton, his executors, administrators and assigns, the gold mining areas as set forth in said transfers for the sum of six thousand dollars, although the consideration stated in said transfers is the nominal sum of one dollar; and whereas there is at present unsettled the balance of four thousand dollars of said purchase price: Now, therefore, this agreement witnesseth that the said George W. Pelton, for and in consideration of the delivery of said transfers, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and of further valuable consideration, doth hereby for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, covenant, promise and agree to and with the said Bishop H. Porter, his executors, administrators and assigns, to settle and arrange the said balance of the purchase price in the following manner, that is to say: That he will forthwith proceed to organize a bon\u00e2 fide joint stock company in connection with said gold mining areas so transferred as aforesaid, and that upon the due organization thereof he will cause to be issued and delivered to said Bishop H. Porter, his executors, administers and assigns, four thousand dollars worth of capital stock in said company at market price.\"\nThe defendant Holden, after the purchase of the areas from the plaintiff, returned to the United States where he lives and obtained a charter in the State of West Virginia for a joint stock company by the name of the Black Hawk Mining Company, with a capital of $1,000,000 divided into shares of $1.00 each, with head office in Boston. The defendant Holden appears as one of the incorporators of that company, but the defendant Pelton's name does not appear. The other incorporators were E. W. Baxter, W. C. Keith, H. B. Holden and S. K. Paige. Upon the company being organized the defendant Pelton transferred to it the areas obtained from the plaintiff and received in payment 999,995 shares fully paid and non-assessable of the company's stock.\nThe other five shares were subscribed for by the five above named incorporators who received one share each and paid $1.00.\nThe defendant Pelton then transferred his shares to the company, his stock certificate was cancelled, and the stock was re-issued.\nWith the money obtained from the syndicate, the company, under the local management of Pelton, built a mill and did a certain amount of development work underground and while engaged in these operations endeavoured to sell as much stock as possible.\nAbout 15,000 shares were worked off through paid agents upon about 40 investors at par, although the actual value of a share based upon the price paid for the areas and the money expended in the development was not more than $ .03 a share.\nAfter May, 1901, it became impossible to sell any more stock and the company stopped paying wages to the men at the mine and in consequence the workmen quit work, attached the property and all operations ceased.\nThe stock of the company never acquired a market value, and the plaintiff never received any stock, nor any part of the $4,000 due.\nThe plaintiff's action as launched was for damages for breach of agreement of August 6th, 1900, to deliver to him $4,000 worth of stock, and was based on the assumption that Pelton and Holden were partners in the transaction and that the agreement was signed by Pelton on behalf of both. The trial judge refused to allow the statement of claim to be amended by adding a charge of fraud.\nRussell K. C. and Wade K. C. for the appellant. Pelton signed the agreement as agent for Holden who ratified his action and is therefore liable. Hunter v. Parker[1].\nIt was not necessary that this agreement should be under seal and the technical rule as to sealed instruments does not govern it. Tapley v. Butterfield[2]; Harrison v. Jackson[3].\nHolden was present when the agreement was signed and it was done at his request. It was therefore, in law, his own act. Ball v. Dunslerville[4].\nHolden having adopted the contract and received the benefit of it is liable in a court of equity. Conant v. Miall[5].\nThe statement of claim should have been amended to meet the evidence given by defendant himself and it may still be amended. Zwicker v. Feindel[6]; Riding v. Hawkins[7].\nNew combe K.C. for the respondent. Holden was not a party to the deed and did not execute it. He cannot therefore be held liable on it. Pollock on Contracts, p. 98. Chesterfield &c. Colliery Co. v. Hawkins[8]; Russell v. Annable[9].\nA person cannot bind others by executing a deed under seal. Lindley's Law of Companies pp. 193-5, ed. 6. Fry on Specific Performance, p. 85.\nThe amendment was properly refused. Lever & Co. v. Goodwin Bros.[10]; Bentley & Co. v. Black[11]. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014The appellants applied at the opening of the argument to add three alternative claims We are of opinion that all proper amendments should be made where the court is satisfied that such amendments are necessary to do justice and the nature of the demand is not changed, and that neither party can be prejudiced. Such amendments must be dealt with in each case in the sound exercise of a judicial discretion. We cannot in this case interfere with the exercise of a discretion in the court below.\nOn the cause of action as stated by the plaintiff there can be no doubt The argument addressed to us by the appellant's counsel, that although the contract entered into between Pelton and Porter was under seal the appellant was entitled to sue Holden, was:\n(a). Because it was a contract which could be made by an instrument in writing and the seal was unnecessary.\n(b). Because the original promise to pay for the land could be relied upon against Holden and the price in money claimed since Pelton's promise under seal to pay in stock worth $4,000 had not and could not be fulfilled and the plaintiff could revert to the original consideration.\n(c). Because Pelton was really a partner of Holden and the partnership name was simply Pelton, and therefore the partnership was bound by the signature \"Pelton\" under seal, as a partnership signature.\n(d). Because Holden was an undisclosed principal of Pelton, and therefore bound by the sealed instrument signed on his behalf.\n(e). Because Pelton was really signing for the benefit and on behalf of Holden. (f). Holden by his fraudulent dealings with the company had rendered the stock of no value.\nThe cases for over a century establish the rule of law firmly that where partners contract under seal they are bound by the form of the instrument, and where parties so signing are merely acting as agents and are so described, only the parties signing can be bound. A principal or partner cannot be bound unless he has given authority for his signature under seal, and is designated as a party to the deed. A cestui que trust cannot either sue or be sued upon a covenant made by and in the name of a trustee on his behalf.\nThe case of Schack v. Anthony (1813)[12], seems to completely set at rest the contentions (a) and (b) above referred to.\nIn Re Pickering's claim, (1871)[13], the arguments (d) and (e) were in substance unsuccessfully urged by Sir Roundell Palmer as answers in equity to the technical rules at common law relating to instruments under seal.\nSee also Colder v. Dobell, (1871)[14]. and particularly Hannen J. at p 500.\nBeckham v. Drake, (1841)[15], affirmed on this branch sub nom. Drake v. Beckham,[16].\nWe think too that the evidence discloses that the option to purchase given to Pelton was exercised by him by the instrument under seal in question in the action and we see no evidence of any other bargain. The evidence seems also to indicate that Pelton fell in with a suggestion that Holden should sell his stock and that the failure of the mine to realise the high hopes of the promoters has caused the change of view indicated by the letters of the 20th May 1901, and 24th September 1901. We think it is a case of disappointed hope and that the evidence in no way discloses any reason for allowing on terms a charge of fraud to be added.\nThe case of Conant v. Miall, 1870,[17], so much relied on by the appellants, is quite consistent with all the authorities. That was a case of property purchased for an undisclosed principal who affirmed the transaction and took a conveyance of the land, and the unpaid vendor was held entitled to recover against the principal to whom the land had been conveyed and in whom was then vested the balance of the purchase money.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs in all courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wade & Paton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Stakes were planted to show the side lines and the railway fencing, at the points in dispute, was placed, here and there, above the water-line, although the company could not have the quantity of land conveyed unless they took possession to the edge of the river. P. remained in possession of the strip of land between the fence and the water's edge and of the bed of the stream ad medium filum and after the registration of the deed to the company, sold the rest of his property including water rights, mills and dams constructed in the stream to the defendant's auteur, describing the property sold as \"including that part of the river which is not included in the right of way, etc. \" The plaintiffs never operated their line of railway but, immediately on its completion, under powers conferred by their charter, and The Railway Act, 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, leased it for 999 years to another company and the railway has been ever since operated by other companies under the lease. The plaintiffs' action petit ire, including a claim for damages, was met by pleas (1) That the lease was an alienation of all plaintiffs' interest in the lands occupied by the railway and left them without any right of action ; (2) that the right of way sold never extended beyond the fencing, such being the interpretation placed upon the conveyance by permitting P. to retain possession of the strip of land in 4uestion and the river ad medium filum ; (3) that by ten years possession as owner in good faith under translatory title the defendant had acquired ownership by the prescription of ten years and (4) that, by thirty years adverse possession without title, the defendant and his auteurs had acquired a title to the strip of land and riparian rights in question. On appeal the Supreme Court held :\n1.\u2014That the description in the deed to the railway company included, ex jure; naturae, the river ad medium filum aquce as an incident of the grant and that their title could not be defeated by subsequent conveyance through their vendor and warrantor, notwithstanding that they may not have taken physical possession of all the lands described in the prior conveyance.\n2.\u2014That the possession of the strip of land and the waters and bed of the river ad medium filum by the vendor and his assigns, after the conveyance to the company, was not the possession animo domini required for the acquisitive prescription of ten years under article 2251 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, but merely an occupation as tenant by suffrance upon which no such prescription could be based.\n3.\u2014That the failure of the vendor to deliver the full quantity of land sold and the company's abstention from troubling him in his possession of the same could not be construed as conduct placing a construction upon the deed different from its clear and unambiguous terms or as limiting the area of the lands conveyed.\n4.\u2014That the terms of the description in the subsequent conveyance by P. to the defendant's auteur were a limitation equivalent to an express reservation of that part of the property which had been previously conveyed to the company and prevented the defendant acquiring title by ten years prescription, and further that he was charged with notice of the prior conveyance through the registration of the deed to the company.\n5.\u2014That the acquisitive prescription of thirty years under article 2242 of the Civil Code could not run in favour of the original vendor who had warranted title to the lands conveyed to the company because, after the sale, his occupation of the part of the property the possession of which he had failed to deliver, was merely on sufferance.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed on the questions of law as summarized, Davies J, dubitante, but the findings, on conflicting testimony in respect of damages, made by the trial judge were not disturbed on the appeal. On the question raised as to the right of action to recover the lands and for damages caused to the permanent way, it was\nHeld affirming the judgment appealed from, that the lease to the companies which held and operated the railway, amounted to an emphyteutic lease assigning the domaine utile and all the plaintiffs' rights in respect of the railway reserving, however, the domaine direct, and, consequently, the plaintiffs had the right of action au p\u00e9titoire as the party having the legal estate, although the right of action for the damages, if any, sustained would belong to the lessees who held the beneficial estate.\nSemble that, if necessary, the lessees might have been allowed to be added as parties, plaintiffs in the action, in order to recover any damages which might have been sustained, if there had been any satisfactory proof that damages had been caused through the fault of the defendant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Saint Francis, dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was au p\u00e9titoire for a declaration of the plaintiffs' title to lands in the Township of Hatley on the bank and in the bed of the Massawippi River and for the demolition of a mill and mill-dam constructed thereon by the defendant and his grantors and also for $2,000 damages resulting from the penning back of the waters of the river by the mill-dams which caused damages to the permanent way of the company on the shores of Lake Massawippi.\nThe plaintiffs had, in January, 1870, purchased from one Putney a parcel of land adjoining his mill property, in the Township of Hatley, containing four and three-tenths acres in superficies and described as bounded on one side \"by the Massawippi River\" and they alleged that they immediately took possession thereof constructed their line of railway thereon and that as riparian proprietors, they were entitled to all the riparian rights thereto appertaining'. The fences along the right of way, at the point in question, had been built a short distance from the edge of the river and Putney had continued to use the strip of land between the fence and the water's edge and also the bed of the river in connection with his mills and in the construction of the mill-dam. The deed to the company was duly registered and, afterwards, Putney sold the mill property and his rights in the river bed to persons from whom the defendant acquired, the description of the property sold including :\" that part of the Massawippi River which is not included in the right of way of the Massawippi Valley Railway on said lot, which lies easterly of said right of way.\" The possession of the strip between the fence and the water's edge by Putney and his assigns, including the defendant, deprived the company of the full quantity of land conveyed to them, but they took no measures in ejectment, nor to prevent those persons using the bed of the river, until November, 1899, when the action was brought principally on account of the inconvenience and damage the company suffered through the damming of the river at the mill-site causing the waters of Lake Massawippi to rise and wash away part of their permanent way.\nThe plaintiffs were incorporated under charter (25 Vict. ch. 61,) with power to construct the railway, and it was provided that The Railway Act (14 & 15 Vict ch. 51) should be considered as incorporated in the special Act. Section 15 of the special Act provided that the company might enter into agreements with any other railway company for leasing the railway or the use thereof for any period, and under these powers the company immediately, upon the completion of construction leased the railway with all its appurtenances to the Connecticut & Passumpsic Railway Co. which operated the railway till it was merged in the Boston & Lowell Railway Co. which was afterwards merged in the Boston & Maine Railway Co. which held and operated the railway at the time of the present action.\nThe pleas material to the issues on the present appeal were those denying the plaintiffs' title and right of action, au p\u00e9titoire or for damages; the pleas claiming title by possession of ten years with translatory title and of thirty years without title, and the general traverse of the claim for damages.\nIn the trial court F. X. Lemieux J. held that the plaintiffs had alienated all their interest in the railway and had no right of action ; decided the questions as to title and. possession in favour of the defendant and in appreciating contradictory testimony as to the damages, found as a fact that, giving preference to the testimony of the witnesses for the defence there had been no damages caused through the fault of the defendant and the action was dismissed with costs. The judgment appealed from held that the plaintiffs had reserved the domaine direct and had a right to bring the action au p\u00e9titoire and, on the sole ground that the defendant had acquired ownership by effective possession during ten years under a valid translatory title and considering that \"for this reason\" there had been no error in the judgment of the trial court, the court below affirmed \" the enacting part of the decree\" with costs against the present appellant, (Hall J. dissenting).\nLafleur K C. and Cute for the appellants. The plaintiffs reserved the domaine direct, the legal estate, in the railway and all their rights in. respect thereof; the lease is emphyteutic and consequently they are fully entitled to the petitory conclusions as to all the land and rights between the railway fence and the centre line of the Massawippi River, and to have all constructions on the west half of the river demolished, subject to such compensation as experts may determine to be their actual value. We have established damages largely in excess of the amount prayed for, and there is sufficient evidence upon which to make an award without the necessity of further expertise as suggested by Mr. Justice Hall.\nAs to the claim by thirty years possession, the deed by Putney to the company bears date the 3rd of January, 1870, the action was served on 5th December, 1899, less than thirty years afterwards and, at any rate, Putney cannot prescribe against his own conveyance in which he became warrantor of plaintiffs' title.\nThe prescription of ten years cannot apply as there was notice of the prior title in the registry office which charged all subsequent grantees with knowledge and prevented any possession m good faith.\nThe appellants must succeed on the petitory conclusions, so far as concerns the strip of land between the railway track and the river. The title deed in distinct and positive terms covers this land. The appellants' rights to the half of the river bed should also be maintained. The deed describes the property as bounded \u201con the south-easterly side by the Massawippi River,\" a stream, floatable \u00e0 buches perdues. This description would convey all rights in the river to the middle of the stream ; Hurdman v. Thompson ([1]). The bed of the river to mid-Channel is an adjunct of the grant of adjacent land upon the bank unless it is especially excluded there from. In the present case there is no exclusion. In fact there is, in the subsequent deeds, an admission that it was intended to be included. In the deeds from Putney to LeBaron, and from LeBaron to respondent's immediate auteur, in which the land on the opposite shore and the remaining rights in the river were conveyed, the property is described as \"including that part of the Massawippi River which is not included in the right of way of the Massawippi Valley Railway, thus recognizing that a portion of the river was included. If any portion was included it must be the full half of the river because there is no reference to the subject except in the general description \"bounded by the Massawippi River.\"\nAs to the damages, the dam was gradually but materially added to from time to time increasing its height and more particularly increasing its width. The effect of widening the dam was to make it tighter, increasing the height of the water, and giving a larger head. The damages growing more pronounced from year to year, became so serious that, in 1899, appellant instituted the present action for damages to the road bed and to recover possession of the property illegally detained, and by removing the dam, to prevent further damages. The railway is built along the lake shore, close to its waters for a distance of eight or nine miles. The dam is about three-quarters of a mile from the outlet of the lake and the fall from the waters of the lake to the crest of the dam is only an inch or two, the water being practically level between the dam and the lake. The expert evidence is that the dam must of necessity raise the water in the lake and that the rise would correspond with the height of the dam. The respondent's witnesses, however, testify that the dam does not have any effect. So remarkable a result would seem to require explanation.\nH. B. Brown K. C. for the respondent. The transfer made by plaintiffs to the Connecticut & Passumpsic Railroad Co. for the term of 999 years and called a lease, and by which, in express terms, the plaintiffs demised the road with all its franchises, rights and privileges, is in effect an alienation. Art. 1593 C. C. ; 25 Vict. ch. 61 s. 15. A lease for 999 years is, for all purposes under our law, a transfer in perpetuity. Arts 389 390 391 C. C. * 27 Laurent nos. 47, 48 ; Fuzier Herman, Code Annot\u00e9e, Art. 530, note 2 ; Art-1709, note 7 ; Lorrain L Locateurs et Locataires \" p. 3 nos. 9 10. If the contract be regarded, however as a contrat innomm\u00e9 a bail-\u00e0-rente, or an emphyteutic lease, it operates an alienation during the term of its existence. 4 Pothier (ed. Bugnet). \"Bail \u00e0 rente\" no. 111 : Arts. 567, 568, 569, 570, 571 C. C. ; Lampson et al. v. Belanger ([2]). If the contract operates as an alienation, plaintiffs have no right of action and are without interest. Art. 77 C. P. Q.\nNor can the plaintiffs claim damages. The question as to whether the lessors and lessees can join in an action for damage is not in issue here. They are not joined. The lessor, who has not suffered any damage, cannot maintain the action in its own name alone. Even under an ordinary lease, it is not competent for the landlord and tenant to bring a joint action against a trespasser for damages, although both parties in such case may sustain injury, their injury being entirely separate and distinct; Beaudry-Lacantinerie, uContrat de louage,\" p. 227, Nos. 532, 533. The lessees and their successors have in fulfillment of the terms of the lease maintained the road-bed and there is no recourse of the lessees in any form against plaintiffs. Where then is the interest that can warrant a condemnation for damages in favour of the plaintiffs who have not suffered any damage ?\nThe sale from Putney dated 31st Jan. 1870 is of a strip of land described as having the line of the Massawippi Valley Railway running through it, and bounded on one side by a line drawn at a distance of three rods north-west from the centre line of said railway and on the other side by the Massawippi River, as selected and laid out by the company for the purposes of their railway.\" This is the form given in the Act, 25 Vict. c. 61 At this time the company had already taken the land which they required for their railway, and which Putney intended to sell. Within a few months they put up their permanent fences along the right-of-way as already established and left Putney in possession of this narrow strip outside of the fence which is in dispute. Under the Act 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51,. sec. 13, the company was required to construct and maintain these fences, \" to divide and to keep their land from the neighbouring properties.\" They interpreted their own deed, by erecting* the fence in the position where it has ever since remained and which is in accordance with the pretentions of the defendant ; Langevin v. Morrissette ([3]). The possession of defendant and his auteurs has ever since been acquiesced in by the company which also has taken freight from defendant's mill, and put in a siding up to the mill at his expense, to encourage him to enlarge his business, and the idea of now claiming the land on which the mill stands comes very late. The fact that for upwards of 29 years since their title, and for upwards of 30 years since their possession, the companies have treated the disputed land as outside of their limits lays a very heavy onus upon the plaintiffs,, especially in view of the money expended in good faith and the business built up on the territory now disputed. See Dunn v. Lareau ([4]) at page 230 and Delorme v Cusson ([5])\nThe company could only acquire title to land necessary for the construction, maintenance, accommodation and use of the railway.\" 14 & 15 Vict. c. 51, s. 9, ss. 2. See the remarks of Halsbury L. J. in London Brighton & South Coast Ry Co. v. Truman ([6]) The presumption of ownership ad medium filum aquce may be rebutted Duke of Devonshire v Pattinson ([7]). As regards this company with power to acquire land simply for the purposes of a railway, the presumption of ownership ad medium filum aquce, beyond their right of way as laid out would not exist at all. Of. 14 & 15 Vict. c. 51, s. 9 ss. 3; Norton v. London 8c North Western Ry. Co. ([8]).\nTwenty years before the action Putney sold the property in question to LeBaron, and posts were planted, showing the westerly side line outside the railway fence as it then was and as it is to-day. One of these posts still exists undisturbed. The thing sold had been seen, examined, surveyed, and was known as lying between the railway fence on one side and the middle of the river on the other ; Dunn v. Lareau ([9]) Sixteen years before action, LeBaron sold the same property to Wilder Reed, and in 1895, Wilder Reed sold to defendant, who, by himself and his auteurs, has been in possession under translatory title in good faith. When in the deed from Putney to LeBaron the property sold is described as \"including that part of the Massawippi River which is not included in the right of way of the Massawippi Valley Railway\", the parties meant, it is manifest, the right of way as it existed and had been fenced off then for over nine years.\nAlthough the period between the date of the deed from Putney to the Company, to the date of service of the action, falls short of thirty years by about a month, yet that deed was merely an amicable settlement of the compensation for an expropriation, which had already taken place more than a year previously, with the consent of Putney. The deed is retroactive to the date the company took possession. Abbott's Railway Law of Canada, p. 211; art. 1085 C. C, There has consequently been 30 years acquisitive prescription in favour of the defendant.\nDefendant is, in any event, entitled to retain the property until he has been paid for his improvements, which have been made in good faith.\nThe question as to whether or not the dam has been the cause of the damage claimed to the road-bed along Lake Massawippi is a question of fact, and the trial Judge before whom the witnesses were examined, came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs had failed to establish this feature of their action. This decision should not been interfered with on appeal l The Village of Granby v. M\u00e9nard, ([10]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. This seems to me a simple case. Both parties have Putney as their warrantor. Though as to the respondent he is but remotely so, that makes no difference. Art. 187 C. P. Q. So that the solution of the controversy between the parties depends exclusively upon the question, 1st. whether the piece of land that Putney sold to the appellants in 1870 is bounded by the River Massawippi or not, and 2ndly. whether that sale includes the bed of the river ad filum aquce. If not, their action must be dismissed whether the respondent has any title to the property or not. And, \u00e0 converso, if the land purchased by the appellants from Putney includes the land up to the river with the river ad filum, aquce, the respondent's contentions are untenable and he must surrender the property in dispute to the appellants.\nNow there seems to me but one possible answer to that question. First, the deed of sale to the appellants in express terms gives the river as the boundary of the land sold ; secondly, they purchased four acres and three-tenths, and they would not have that quantity if they did not go as far as the river ; thirdly, on the plan deposited with the Government as required by the statute then in force (14 & 15 V. ch 51) it appears unmistakably that the land previously indicated by the appellants as wanted for their railway was bounded on the east by the river. Mickelwait v. Newlay Bridge Co. ([11]).\nThe respondent contends that the words \"the same having been selected and laid out \" in the deed should be read as if the description of the land previously given were immaterial. But that contention cannot prevail. If anything in that deed is immaterial, it is those very words and not the description. Then they cannot be read with the addition of the word \"as\" preceding them for the simple reason that that word is not there. They mean if anything at all s selected as laid out as per the plan filed according to the statute.\" It must be held consequently that the appellants' purchase from Putney includes the strip of land between the railway fence and the river. Thai being so, there is no room for the contention that their title does not include the river\nIt is settled law 'that a deed of sale which gives a non-navigable river as the boundary on one side of the land sold cannot be read as implying a reservation of the river, or as excluding it from the sale ; and in such a deed, if the description is doubtful, it has to be construed against the vendor. Duranton, Vol. 5, No. 223; 2 Demolombe. Servit, no. 275. In other words the bed of the river is included in the sale of the land\nunless the terms of the sale clearly denote the intention to stop at the edge of the river. Kent's Comment \"Vol. 3, p. 427 unless there be decided language showing a manifest intent to stop at the water's edge\". Angell, on Watercourses, No. 10; Hurdman v Thompson ([12]) : The Queen v. Robertson ([13]).\nThe French, law and the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec are in the same sense. And it is not strictly accurate to call this a presumption. The river is, ad filum aquce, included in the sale itself ex jure natures, as an incident of property, as a part and parcel of the land sold just as the windows and doors of a house, or its chimneys and heating apparatus, form part of a sale of the house if not reserved in clear language. This deed must be read as if the property sold was described in express words as bounded by the middle of the river. Lord v. The Commissioners for the City of Sydney ([14]). The intention to include the river in the sale is proved by the fact that it was not excluded.\nNow the appellants' deed having been duly registered in 1870, Putney could not in 1879 give any title of the same property to LeBaron. He did not do so in fact but simply sold whatever of that lot 24 he had not sold to the appellants ; but assuming that he has done so, the sale is a complete nullity, according to the express provisions of Art. 1487 C. C. The appellants' title could not be defeated by their vendor and warrantor himself. The sale to them was as perfect in 1870 for the part not delivered by their vendor, as it was for the part they took physical possession of. Art. 1472 C.C. And not only between them and Putney, but also as to third parties they became the legal owners of all the property they purchased the moment that their deed was registered. Art. 102 -1027 2089, 2096 C. C. Le Baron then had no title to this property and consequently could not convey any to W. Reed nor the latter to the respondent. Kaigle v Pierce ([15]) The possession that Putney kept of the river is of the same charac er and cannot be viewed in any other light than the possession that he was allowed to keep of the strip of land bordering it ; Rondeau v. Charbonneau ([16]) ; that is to say, a possession not distinct and separate from that of the shore, and not as proprietor, but by sufferance of the owner, upon which no plea of prescription of ten years can be based.\nIt is no doubt true that in construing? a deed the manner in which it has been executed by the parties may furnish a guide for it's interpretation, hut that rule can be invoked only when the intent of the parties appears by the deed itself to be doubtful ; it cannot defeat a clear and unambiguous written agreement ; Putney could not he admitted, under the circumstances of this case, to contend that his failure to deliver the thing sold is by itself evidence against his contract to do so sufficient to defeat it.\nThe respondent would contend that the clear stipulation in the deed of sale to the appelants must give way before the presumption resulting from Putney's possession up to 1879. But when a vendor so continues to remain in possession with the consent express or implied of the vendee the legal presumption is that thereafter he possesses as tenant. Art. 1608 C. 0. He clearly cannot possess animo domini anything that he has sold.\nThen Putney himself subsequently acknowledged appellants' rights in the river by selling to LeBaron whatever of that lot he had not sold to the appellants,\nincluding that part of the river which is not included in the right of way of the Massawippi railway,\nterms that necessarily imply the admission that the appellants' right of way included a part of the river and are equivalent to an express reservation of that part in their favour, and the Reeds acquired what LeBaron himself had bought from Putney, not more nor less. They consequently have no title to the property in dispute. Chalifour v. Parent ([17]). But assuming that they have, they cannot in good faith have believed that Putney had the right to sell to LeBaron in 1879 what they knew by the registry office and their own title deeds he had sold in 1870 to the appellants.\nUnder any view of the case, therefore, the respondent's plea of prescription by ten years cannot prevail.\nThen as to the thirty years' prescription, it could not under any circumstances have run during Putney's possession, for Putney could not possess as proprietor what he had himself sold the appellants. Arts. 2193, 2196 0. 0. He being their warrantor could not if he had been called en garantie, be admitted to impugn himself the title he gave them and attempt thereby to derive a benefit from his failure to perform, his obligation to deliver what he had so sold\nAs to the appellants' right of action, I am of opinion, with the Court of Appeal, that the respondent's contentions on this point as on the others are unfounded. Then if necessary I would have allowed the joining of the appellants' lessees as co-plaintiffs by way of amendment.\nAs to the damages, I see nothing in the case that would justify an interference with the findings of fact of the trial judge upon this part of the action against the appellants' contentions upon contradictory evidence.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs in all the courts against the respondent, less however the costs of enqu\u00eate which are to be borne by each party, (chacun ses frais d'enqu\u00eate et d'exhibits), and less half the cost of the printing thereof in this court ; the record to be remitted back to the Superior Court for the expertise necessary for the valuation of the improvements made on the property by the respondent; (Arts. 411 to 418 C. C.) ; which improvements the appellants have agreed to pay. The Superior Court thereafter upon the payment of such improve- less the costs due by the respondent s'ily a lieu to enter judgment according to the appellants' conclusions au p\u00e9titoire.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. agreed with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J. I do not dissent though I entertain grave doubts based upon the decision of the Privy Council in Dunn v. Lareau ([18]).\nNESBITT J. concurred for the reasons stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cate, Wells & White.\nSolicitors for the respondent Brown & Macdonald.\n[1] Q.

These provinces have therefore asked that a reference be made to the Supreme Court of Canada for a determination of the question in difference.\n\"The Minister, therefore, recommends that the following question suggested by the Government of New Brunswick and approved as the Minister of Justice is informed by the Government of Nova Scotia, be referred to the Supreme Court for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Victoria, Chapter 25 intituled 'An Act to amend Chapter 135 of the Revised Statutes intituled An Act respecting the Supreme and Exchequer Courts.\u2019\n\"In determining the number of representatives in the House of Commons to which Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are respectively entitled after each decennial census, should the words \"aggregate population of Canada, in subsection 4 of section 51 of the British North America Act 1867, be construed as meaning the population of the four original provinces of Canada, or as meaning the whole population of Canada including that of Provinces which have been admitted to the Confederation subsequent to the passage of the British North America Act?\n\"The Committee submit the same for approval.\n\"(Sgd.) JOHN J. McGEE,\n\"Clerk of the Privy Council.\"\nCounsel:\nFor the Dominion of Canada: The Honourable Charles Fitzpatrick K.C, Minister of Justice and Attorney General for Canada. E. L. Newcombe K.C, Deputy Minister of Justice.\nFor the Province of Ontario: \u00c6milius Irving K.C.\nFor the Province of New Brunswick: The Honourable William Pugsley K.C, Attorney General for the Province of New Brunswick, and Geo. W. Allen K.C.\nFor the Province of Nova Scotia: The Honourable J. W. Longley, K.C, Attorney General for the Province of Nova Scotia, and E. M. Macdonald Esq.\nFor the Province of Quebec: L. J. Cannon K.C., Deputy Attorney General of the Province of Quebec.\nIrving K.C. for the Province of Ontario. Your Lord' ship read yesterday the reference that has been made to this honourable court, and it would hardly seem necessary to read it again. But as it is but a few lines and I would like to state the issue that Ontario takes upon it, I therefore, with your permission, will read it.\n\"In determining the number of representatives in the House of Commons to which Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are respectively entitled after each decennial census, should the words 'aggregate population of Canada\u2019 in sub-section 4 of section 51 of the British North America Act, 1867, be construed as meaning the population of the four original provinces of Canada, or as meaning the whole population of Canada including that of Provinces which have been admitted to the Confederation subsequent to the passage of the British North America Act?\"\nThat, I understand, is the question, and the issue that Ontario takes upon it is: That sub-section 4 of section 51 should be construed as meaning the population of the four original provinces of Canada and that there has been no legal change in that to the present time.\nI have to beg leave to refer your Lordships to the clauses of the British North America Act which bear upon this question. The third clause of the Act provided that there should be one Dominion.\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, to declare by Proclamation that, on and after a day herein appointed, not being more than six months after the passing of this Act, the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one Dominion under the name of Canada; and on and after that day those three provinces shall form and be one Dominion under that name accordingly.\"\nThen follows section 4 which is as follows;\n\"The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, commence and have effect on and after the union, that is to say, on and after the day appointed for the union taking effect in the Queen's proclamation; and in the same provisions, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, the name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act.\"\nThen the next clause says:\n\"Canada shall be divided into four provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\" The next clause I do not think is material to the issue, but I come to clause 8 which says:\n\"8. In the general census of the population of Canada which is required to be taken in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy one, and in every tenth year thereafter, the respective populations of the four provinces shall be distinguished.\"\nThat is a very important clause and bears very much upon the general question that is to follow. Then I have to ask your Lordships to allow me to go to section 51 which is the section indicated in the question submitted to your lordships.\n\"51. On the completion of the census in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy one, and of each subsequent decennial census, the representation of the four provinces shall be readjusted by such authority, in such manner, and from such time as the Parliament of Canada from time to time provides, subject and according to the following rules.\"\nThere, your Lordships see that the census which by section 8 was to specially distinguish, the populations of the four provinces, is there again referred to as the representation of the four provinces involved in the census provided for in section 8. The rules are as follow:\u2014\n\"1. Quebec shall have the fixed number of sixty five members.\"\n\"2. There shall be assigned to each of the other provinces such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to the number of its population (ascertained at such census) as the number sixty-five bears to the number of the population of Quebec (so ascertained).\"\nThen sub-section 3 provides for the computation in fractional numbers which I do not think it is important to trouble your Lordships with. Sub-section 4. which is the sub-section to which your Lordships' attention is particularly directed is as follows:\n\"(4). On any such re-adjustment the number of members for a province shall not be reduced unless the proportion which the number of the population of the province bore to the number of the aggregate population of Canada at the then last preceding readjustment of the number of members for the province is ascertained at the then latest census to be diminished by one twentieth part or upwards.\"\nYour Lordships will see there, that the number of members shall not be reduced unless the proportion which the number of a particular province bore to the number of the aggregate population of Canada, is ascertained at the then latest census to be diminished by one twentieth part or upwards. Now then the next question as I understand here is: What does \"Canada\" mean in that clause? At that time and up to say 1871, there was no question that by \"Canada\" was meant the four provinces which had been before specified under the clause to which I drew your Lordships' attention, as embraced under the term \"Canada\" as constituted under this Act. It says \"Canada\" shall be taken to mean \"Canada\" as constituted under this Act, and in the general census of the population of Canada the respective populations of the four provinces shall be distinguished. Well my Lords, this is as it were the first resting place. Under this Act as it stood then there could be no question but that the re-adjustment was to be of the four provinces, and of the aggregate population of those four provinces thus described here in this particular clause under the word \"Canada\" as the earlier clauses of the Act has contemplated might be done. Then, the following clause, section 52, may be read because it bears an important signification with reference to this.\n\"52 The number of members of the House of Commons may be from time to time increased by the Parliament of Canada, provided the proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed.\".\nNow, that might be taken to mean, on the first glance, that Parliament, provided it did not disturb the proportionate representation, might increase the number of members over all the provinces above what they were under the original Act. But it also is capable of being applied differently and I think we will find one of the elements of difference in the following section:\n\"146. It shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, on Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, to admit those colonies or provinces, or any of them, into the Union, and on address from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and the North-western Territory, or either of them into the Union, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the Addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"\nI therefore say that it is on such terms and conditions in each case expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, that representation in Parliament is to be accorded; now the representation of the provinces prescribed by this Act, as far as we have gone, is of these four first provinces, and if that proportionate representation which is the whole keystone of this Act be preserved, then the Parliament of Canada shall have the right to increase its number of representatives from time to time provided the proportion of representation is not disturbed. I think that is a point that cannot be got over. I think that there can be no disturbance of that arrangement. In this Act, by section 52, it was contemplated that the area of Canada as it then was should be enlarged on terms and conditions to be approved by the Queen and upon addresses to be submitted. If these terms and conditions, as we shall come to them, provide for representation in Parliament and representation in the House of Commons, then here we have laid down the rule under which it is to prevail, namely: Provided the proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed; not the proportionate representation of provinces that may be brought in hereafter. This is the primary condition connected with the whole of the building of the act of union.\nMR. JUSTICE ARMOUR: It seems to me that you lose sight of the recital of the Act providing for the union. The union is not to consist only of these four provinces but it is to consist also of such provinces as may be brought in from time to time.\nAnd then section 4 says: \"The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, commence and have effect on or after the union, that is to say, on or after the day appointed for the union taking effect in the Queen's proclamation; and in the same provisions, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, the name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act.\"\nMr. Irving: That is when there is a proclamation introducing the outlying provinces.\nMR. JUSTICE ARMOUR: Suppose only one province comes in and then there was a decennial census, how is that province's representation to be ascertained? Must it not be with regard to the aggregate population of the whole?\nMr. Irving: But there would have been no census taken of it, if I understood your Lordship's premises?\nMR. JUSTICE ARMOUR: I say, suppose only one province was introduced, and that after the decennial census had taken place.\nMr. Irving: Including that province.\nMR. JUSTICE ARMOUR: Yes. Then how is that province's representation to be adjusted?\nMr. Irving: That province's representation was to be adjusted according to the distribution of the four original provinces\nMR. JUSTICE ARMOUR: But then, the four original provinces are always to remain the same according to your theory, and therefore you would have a stray horse in the province that was outside.\nMr. Irving: This province outside joins subject to terms, according to its proportion of the four provinces of which it is not one.\nMr. Justice Armour: Then you would not include its population at all in ascertaining its representation; you would simply take the population of the four provinces.\nMr. Irving: Of the four provinces.\nMr. Justice Armour: What proportion then would you give?\nMr. Irving: Whatever was the 65th as provided with reference to Quebec. Then it would get its members in that same proportion.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: That is all that is contended for now.\nMr. Irving: That is all I am contending for now. My learned friends, however, say that there is to be a pool of the whole population.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: And there will be representation by population in each province of Canada; that is what they are contending for.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: Of course.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: That is the old question.\nMr. Irving: I am contending for the same thing only it is a different way of putting it. My learned friends take the grand total or aggregate of the whole census of the Dominion of Canada and I say that it should be the aggregate of the four provinces as they were at the last decennial census.\nMr. Justice Armour: The motive power that put the British North America Act into force was desire to obtain representation by population.\nMr. Irving: Does it say so in the recital, my lord? Mr. Justice Armour: The effect of your contention would be that there would be no such thing as representation by population and the older provinces would have a certain representation according to the time when they were constituted, and the newer provinces would have a representation of their own.\nMr. Justice Davies: I understand you are only arguing so far as the unit is concerned. You say the unit is obtained by dividing the population of Quebec by the population of the old four provinces.\nMr. Irving: Yes, my Lord.\nMr. Justice Davies: And the other construction involved the division of the population of Quebec by, the population of the whole Dominion.\nMr. Irving: Yes, my Lord.\nMr. Justice Davies: That is the only point between you; representation by population would still remain.\nMr. Irving: I am coming to that. If his Lordship will permit me to say so, I do not think the words \"representation by population\" are in this Act from one end of it to the other, and whatever the arguments may have been before, I do not think we can now import them into this Act. This is a strict question of the construction of an instrument of Government which is like a great charter.\nMr. Justice Armour: You are entitled to look at the position of things when the British North America Act was passed in order to ascertain what they were intending to do, but you are not to alter the wording of the Act by that.\nMr. Irving: I do not know that the political question of representation by population as it was argued before Confederation ever assumed such a concrete form that one could say exactly what was to be introduced here. Mr. Justice Mills: Your contention is confined to the assumption that the word \"Canada\" in the British North America Act means the four provinces.\nMr. Irving: I contend that, my Lord.\nMr. Justice Mills: What name would you give to the additional Territories when these Territories became Provinces? You have a larger Dominion and you have no name that you could apply to the entire Dominion.\nMr. Irving: I do not now that it is any argument in favour of the broader question, as to what are the conveniences or the inconveniences to which it may lead, unless we can find in any of the subsequent Acts anything which would lead to a different view than the view I am endeavouring to uphold now.\nMr. Justice Mills: Take section 101 of the British North America Act which provides for the constitution of a general court of appeal in Canada. Would not your contention go this far, that a court of appeal created under that Act would be a court of appeal for the four provinces and not a court of appeal for any other portion of the Dominion?\nMr. Irving; I would like to look at that particular clause before I would give your lordship an answer to that if it be deemed that I should give an answer to it. Section 101 says:\n\"101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organisation of a general court of appeal for Canada.\"\nMr. Justice Mills: Would that be the four provinces only?\nMr. Irving: I do not say that necessarily. I am now on the question of representation. I am not dealing with reference to any wider question. I am confined to the question of representation and I say that so far, if I have made out expressly that those four provinces are to be the body from which the unit is to be established among themselves and that that is to prevail everywhere, then that does not affect other questions that may arise upon other subjects, because I do not present a scheme which would be perfect as a whole. Your Lordship may say that it is extremely inconvenient. That may be so but I am not dealing with that. I am dealing with what is laid down according to the statute and its convenience or inconvenience has nothing to do with it. I say, therefore, that for other colonies coming in there is a rule preserved by which representation may be given to them. That is rather anticipating some remarks which I am going to make, but does not alter at all the fact that a general court of appeal of Canada should not apply to these provinces that may be admitted. I am only dealing now with the question of the respective representation in Parliament of the four original provinces and illustrating how other provinces might be affected, and that there is a rule existing to give them representation upon the distribution, in section 52:\n\"Provided the proportionate representation of the province prescribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed.\"\nNow the next in order is the Imperial Act of 1871. Prior to that there had been two Acts of the Parliament of Canada. One of them was on the surrender, or the acquisition perhaps would be at this time the proper term, of Rupert's Land. That provided for the peace, order and good government of that part of Canada, and there is also the \"order\" afterwards for giving Manitoba a constitution and a representation. It was deemed questionable, whether the Province of Canada had any power to admit or to create a new province out of the territories without special power, the British North America Act not covering that. This Imperial Act is as follows:\n\"Whereas doubts have been entertained respecting the powers of the Parliament of Canada to establish provinces and territories admitted, or which may hereafter be admitted, into the Dominion of Canada, and to provide for the representation of such provinces in the said Parliament, and it is expedient to remove such doubts and to vest such powers in the said Parliament.\"\nThe second clause is:\n\"2. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time establish new provinces in any territories forming for the time being part of the Dominion of Canada, but not included in any province thereof, and may, at the time of such establishment, make provision for the constitution and administration of any such Province, and for the passing of laws for the peace, order and good government of such province and for its representation in the said Parliament\"\nThat was establishing a new province. Then again:\n\"3. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time, with the consent of the Legislature of any province of the said Dominion, increase, diminish or otherwise alter the limits of such province upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the said Legislature, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any such increase or diminution or alteration of territory in relation to any province affected thereby.\"\n\"4. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time make provision for the administration, peace, order and good government of any territory not for the time being included in any province,\"\nNow then, those matters do not apply so much to Manitoba. This was for establishing new provinces, but in the case of Manitoba the following acts were passed by the Parliament of Canada: An Act for the temporary Government of Rupert's Land and the North West Territories when united with Canada; and an Act to Amend and continue the Act 32 and 33 Vict. ch. 3 and to establish and provide for the government of the Province of Manitoba, shall be deemed to have been\u2014\nThe Chief Justice: Do I understand you to contend, or if I understand you well I think you do contend, that the word \"Canada\" in sub-section 4 applies to the four provinces only.\nMr. Irving; Yes, my Lord.\nThe Chief Justice: Do you contend that the word \"Province\" preceding and subsequent, extends only to the four provinces?\nMr. Irving: Only to the four provinces.\nThe Chief Justice: The word \"Province\"?\nMr. Irving: Yes\u2014on any such readjustment.\nThe Chief Justice: Does that mean only for a province?\nMr. Irving: Yes.\nThe Chief Justice: That is one of the four provinces.\nMr. Irving: That is one of the four provinces.\nThe Chief Justice: And later on if in the North West Territories or British Columbia or Manitoba, or if anywhere the number should be reduced, this would not apply according to you\u2014this applies only to the four provinces*\nMr. Irving: To the four provinces.\nThe Chief Justice; Altogether.\nMr. Irving: Altogether.\nThe Chief Justice; I do not see how you can work it out. Mr. Irving: I have not got quite through, my Lord; I am trying to work it out. These four provinces are to be measured in their readjustment by the aggregate of these four provinces, under the name of \"Canada\". I understand that the argument on the other side will be, that the aggregate population of Canada is the aggregate of the whole of Canada whatever it may be, a dozen provinces or a dozen territories, and then that these four provinces are to be measured by the unit of Quebec divided under that grand total. Now, I come back to it being to the four provinces, and then I say: That the representation which is to be accorded to the other provinces is to be in the same proportion according to the unit that is allowed to Quebec out of the population of Canada, that is, of these four provinces.\nI am now at 33 Vic. ch. 3, which is one of the Acts of Canada which was validated by the Imperial Act of 1871, and therefore it has to be read as, and is in fact, an Imperial Act to the full extent as though it were embraced in the British North America Act. The first clause of that Act deals with the boundaries of Manitoba and the second clause gives to Manitoba a constitution. This Act gives a constitution to the Province of Manitoba and section 2 deals with the application to the Province of the provisions of the British North America Act which may be said generally to apply to all the provinces, but it does not touch the question of representation. It says:\n\"On, from and after the day upon which the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, under the 146th section of the British North America Act 186t, shall, by order-in-council in that behalf, admit Rupert's Land and the North West Territory into the union or Dominion of Canada, there shall be formed out of the same a province which shall be one of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada and which shall be called the Province of Manitoba.\"\nThat excludes all the special provisions relating to Ontario and Quebec or New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, but it takes all the clauses which I may say were common to all those provinces and grants them as a constitution to Manitoba, but it does not touch the question of representation which is dealt with in a separate section. It provides for representation in the Senate and it now provides for representation in the House of Commons in this manner:\n\"4. The said province shall be represented, in the first instance, in the House of Commons of Canada, by four members, and for that purpose shall be divided by proclamation of the Governor General into four electoral districts, each of which shall be represented by one member.\"\nThat Act was passed in 1870.\n\"Provided that on the completion of the census in the year 1881, and of each decennial census afterwards, the representation of the said province shall be readjusted according to the provisions of the 51st section of the British North America Act 1867.\"\nTherefore, it provides in the case of Manitoba, that its representation shall be readjusted according to the provisions of the 51st section; the 51st section as I am now arguing to be read as dealing with the original four provinces.\nI am not at the clause giving representation to Manitoba. Follow me for a second if you please. There they say, that after 1881 the representation shall be readjusted according to the provisions of the 51st section of the British North America Act, 1867. That leaves the 51st section, as I read it, untouched. In the clause immediately but one before where they were giving a constitution to Manitoba they say this: \"As if the province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act\". Why did they not add that on here with reference to the representation, if they meant to do it? Before I get through my argument I hope I shall be able to convince your Lordships, that there is no way in which section 4 is affected, except by what is presumed to be implied. Now, this gives Manitoba an absolute constitution and it says that it shall have the use and the right to all those powers as though Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act. Then the next clause but one to that says that the representation shall be readjusted according to the 51st section, but it does not go on to say, as though Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united. That is absolutely left out. These Acts are instruments of government; they have got to be read absolutely and in express terms in accordance with what is laid down and so construed. You cannot by adding to the instruments of government imply ideas.\nMr. Justice Mills: That Act was passed immediately after the disturbance in Manitoba, and it was made a subject of discussion in Parliament, as I remember very distinctly, as to whether the Parliament of Canada could by an Act of Parliament, give to a province a constitution under which it should come into the Dominion and which would be unalterable. And so Parliament by certain resolutions that are embodied in the Imperial Act of 1871 got over the ultra vires provisions of this Act of 1870.\nMr. Irving: Yes my Lord, but this Act of 1870 which I have been reading having been declared valid and effectual by the Imperial Act is exactly the same as though it were a part of the British North America Act.\nMr. Justice Mills: Made so by the Imperial Act. Mr Irving: Yes. It is the Imperial Act that l am relying upon. The Acts which I have read to you, shall be and be deemed to have been valid and effectual for all purposes whatsoever from the day on which they respectively receive the assent in the Queen's name of the Governor General of Canada. Therefore, my Lord, I do not think that this can be explained away by my learned friends. Now, my Lords, I pass to the case of British Columbia. I come to the order-in-council of the 16th May 1871 relating to the admission of British Columbia and it is to be found in the volume of the Dominion statutes of 1872, in the order-in-council in the early part of the volume numbered, in Roman numerals, LXXVII. I refer to section 8 of that, and it is repeated in every one of the addresses so that it is not necessary to refer but to one for they are all alike. It says:\n\"8. British Columbia shall be entitled to be represented in the Senate by three members and by six members in the House of Commons, the representation to be increased under the provisions of the British North America Act 1867.\"\nNow, with reference to that, the minimum of British Columbia was there settled to be six members to the House of Commons, but on a change of population such as the British North America Act would recognise, it would be liable to be increased. Now the 52nd section of the British North America Act made this provision:\n\"52. The number of members of the House of Commons may be from time to time increased by the Parliament of Canada, provided the proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed.\"\nTherefore in the case of British Columbia, starting with six members, the Dominion Parliament has power to increase the representation of the number of members to the House of Commons provided the proportionate representation prescribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed. Therefore so soon as British Columbia had a population which in the ratio of Quebec would entitle it to an increase this section 52 would grant it to the province of British Columbia as a right.\nI now take the case of Prince Edward Island and I refer to the order-in-council in that case. It is to be found in the Dominion statutes of 1873; in the orders-in-council grouped in the front part of the volume at page 12 in Roman figures. It provides as follows:\n\"That the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by 15000 or upwards since the year 1861, the Island shall be represented in the House of Commons of Canada by six members, the representation to be adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act 1867.\"\nThat again brings up the same provision, that it is to be readjusted under the provisions of the British North America Act. Now I believe that there is one other Act which I wish to bring to your Lordships' notice. Of course I am taking only the Imperial Acts which are the only Acts we are interested in. This Act is an Act passed in 1886, 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 35. It is an Act respecting the representation in the Parliament of Canada which for the time being formed part of the Dominion of Canada but are not included in any province. About the same period in the same month of June, there was an Act passed by the Parliament of Canada here respecting the representation of the North West Territories, and this Act that I am now about to read is merely an Act to validate that Act which was then being passed here or had been passed and it recites: \"Whereas it is expedient to empower the Parliament of Canada to provide for the representation in the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, or either of them, of any territory which for the time being forms part of the Dominion of Canada but it is not included in any province.\n\"The Parliament of Canada may from time to time make provision for representation in the Senate and House of Commons or in either of them, of any territories which for the time being form part of the Dominion of Canada, but are not included in any province thereof.\"\nThat is the general purview of the Act. Then it states that \"any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada before the passing of this Act for the purpose mentioned in this Act shall, if not disallowed by the Queen, be and shall be deemed to have been valid and effectual from the date at which it received the assent in Her Majesty's name of the Governor-General of Canada.\" That refers to the Act of the Dominion of Canada which was being passed in the very same month of June[and which is chapter 24.\nThe Imperial Act refers to this Dominion Act although it was only passed a few weeks before and they probably had not official intimation of it having been passed. It says:\n2. Any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada before the passing of this Act for the purpose mentioned in this Act, shall, if not disallowed by the Queen, be and shall be deemed to have been valid and effectual from the date at which it received the assent in Her Majesty's name, of the Governor General of Canada. \"It is hereby declared that any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, whether before or after the passing of this Act, for the purpose mentioned in this Act or in the British North America Act 1871, has effect, notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, and the number of Senators or the number of Members of the House of Commons specified in the last mentioned Act is increased by the number of Senators or of Members as the case may be, provided by any such Acts of the Parliament of Canada for the representation of any provinces or territories of Canada.\"\nHon. Mr. Justice Mills: That Imperial Act was passed upon the address of the Governor General in Council of Canada to the Government at home. Mr. Irving: Yes, my Lord. I have now referred to all the legislation or statutes bearing upon the question, and I can only reiterate that which I have stated from the beginning, is the view that I am laying before your Lordships. The word \"Canada\" in subsection 4 is to be construed as Canada at that particular period, and not the population of Canada as it may be enlarged from time to time.\nPugsley K.C., for the Province of New Brunswick\u2014The question my Lords, which you are called upon to determine is, I think I may fairly say, one of the very greatest importance, not only to the smaller provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but also to the province of Ontario. It is of special importance to the smaller provinces because, under the terms of confederation, we were granted representation relatively to our county boundaries, and New Brunswick went into confederation with a population of 250,000. It is proposed now, if the contention of my learned friend the Minister of Justice prevails with a population of 80,000 greater than at the time of confederation its representation shall be cut down from 15 members to 13 members. Starting as we did with a population of 250,000, it is proposed that now, when we have a population of 80,000 greater, the representation of the Province of New Brunswick shall be cut down from 15 to 13 members. That is the proposition, and we have only to look forward to the very rapid increase which is likely to take place in the Province of Quebec in view of the new territory which is being added to that province, and also of the rapid increase in the North-West; we have to look forward to the time coming, inside of 30 years at all events, when, if the view of the other side prevails, our representation in New Brunswick would be cut down to five or six members. Therefore your Lordships are called upon to deal with a question which is of very great importance indeed, looking to the future of this country.\nNow, my Lords, it seems to me that there is a misapprehension as to the question of representation by population, as applying to the new provinces and the Territories. I submit that under the British North America Act there is no provision whatever for representation in Parliament of the Territories or new provinces, no provision whatever. You may search the British North America Act from beginning to end and you will find no provision with reference to the representation either of the Territories or of new provinces.\nMr. Justice Armour: Except it comes in under the 4th clause of section 51.\nMr. Pugsley: But when any new province comes in it may or may not agree to come in under section 51. It was competent for the Imperial Parliament to provide, when Manitoba was created a province, that instead of her representation being readjusted from time to time she should have six members until her population reached 100,000 and after that she should have ten members.\nMr. Justice Armour: If it comes in at all, it must come under the provisions of the British North America Act. Mr. Pugsley: But not under section 51.\nMr. Justice Armour: No, section 146.\nMr. Pugsley: I submit not, my Lord. I submit that Manitoba might have been given 50 members; that if Manitoba said: We won't come unless you agree that for all time we shall have at least 50 members in the House of Commons, she need not come into confederation unless she got that. British Columbia might have said we will not come unless you will agree that for all time we shall have ten members. She did stipulate that for all time she should have at least six members. But it was quite competent in the agreement to stipulate that she ought never to have less than twenty members, or that her representation for all time should have been 20 members, or 50 members. It seems to me, my Lords, that you will not find in the Act anything which prevents the Queen in Council, upon proper addresses being sent, providing for any representation or any mode of representation which might be agreed upon.\nThe Act says:\n\"On the completion of the census the representation of the four provinces shall be readjusted by such authority in such manner, etc.\"\nBut Parliament is not dealing with any other province and, my Lords, it is a curious fact if you look at the history of the matter, that in framing that section 51, the first draft contained the words \"each of the provinces.\" Then it was changed to the representation of \"the four provinces,\" then when you get to the third draft it was changed back to \"each province,\" and finally when we get to the British North America Act it is put \"the representation of the four provinces.\" Your lordship will find the drafts in Pope's Confederation Documents. It is rather curious to see the way in which that expression was changed from time to time, showing that those who had the drafting of the Act were giving to it a great deal of thought, and one can very easily see how the words \"each province\" were put in. Some one may say: Well, that would imply that we are making some provision for the representation of new provinces and we want to avoid any possible interpretation of the Act in that way; we are making no provision for the new territories or provinces which may come in, we are leaving that absolutely as a matter of arrangement to be come to from time to time, and therefore in order that there should be no doubt about it, in the final draft and in the Act as it was passed by the British Parliament the words \"each province\" were left out and the words \"the four provinces\" were inserted. This shows that the intention of those who framed the Act, and the intention of the British Parliament, was that they should then legislate simply for the four provinces.\nAny way, my Lord, should they not do that. They were legislating for provinces all of which were pretty well settled; provinces which had been established for a great many years and in respect to which the increase of population was likely to be, perhaps not exactly the same but pretty nearly the same. Then when they come to make provision for the possible entry of new provinces by section 146 they make that provision, so far as I have said, for representation. I would like to read to your lordships section 146 and I think section 147 has a bearing also on the subject. Section 146 is:\n\"146. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, on Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia, to admit those colonies or provinces, or any of them, into the union and on address from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory, or either of them into the union, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any order-in-council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"\nNow, then my Lords, was it not competent for British Columbia to say: We will come into confederation but we will only come in on the terms that we shall have six representatives, or ten representatives, or twenty representatives.\nMr. Justice Davies: Quite competent, if you establish your first proposition: That section 51 only relates to the four provinces and does not lay down any rule for the whole.\nMr. Pugsley: It says:\n\"And the provisions of any order-in-council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"\nSo that the moment the order-in-council was passed agreeing that British Columbia should have six representatives and that that should never be decreased, that order-in-council had the effect of an Act of Parliament, and I submit with all deference that the representation of British Columbia can never be reduced.\nUnder section 147 it is provided:\n\"117. In case of the admission of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, or either of them, each shall be entitled to a representation in the Senate of Canada of four members.\"\nThere is provision made here for representation in the Senate but none whatever for representation in the House of Commons.\nNow my Lords, upon the ground of reason, subsection 4 should be construed as we are contending for, and I think that it is fair to look at what was the object of the framers of the union when they put in that saving clause. It is fair for me to call your Lordships' attention to the fact that if the contention on the other side prevails, that saving clause is not of the slightest benefit to the old provinces\u2014you might as well not have it in there at all.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: What is the saving clause?\nMr. Pugsley: Subsection 4. The saving clause is that the representation of a province shall not be reduced unless the proportion which its population bore to the aggregate population of Canada at the last readjustment of representation has been by the latest census diminished by one twentieth part or upwards.\nNow the object of that was that even although the population of Quebec might increase more rapidly than the population of any one of the four provinces, yet that the population of the whole four must be taken together and unless one had gone back more than one-twentieth relatively to the whole it should not lose a representative. That is a departure to a certain extent from the principle of representation by population, but it was to enable these small provinces to maintain their representation. And if your Lordships look at the proceedings which took place in connection with the Quebec Conference you will see that it is put forward all the way through that subsection 4 was a safeguard which would prevent any decrease of representation. That subsection was looked upon as an absolute safeguard. Well my Lords it is no safeguard at all if every ten years you can bring in a new province from the vast territories of the North-west. It is no safeguard at all if when you bring in a new province the whole population of that province is to be counted against you; not merely the increase but the whole population. It is argued on the other side that if, on the first of July, Assiniboia should be carved out of the North-west Territories and brought in to confederation we would be faced not merely with the increase of population in that territory since 1891, but with the total population and that that total population should count against us. It is argued upon the other side that if to-morrow Newfoundland were brought into the union, that we would not have to meet the mere increase in the population as compared to our own, but we would be met with the entire population of the Province of Newfoundland.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Suppose Newfoundland would come into confederation to-morrow and there should be a provision in the address that Newfoundland should be entitled to 25 members and that its representation should never be less than that number, do you mean to say that that would be within the provisions of the British North America Act?\nMr. Pugsley: I mean to say that it would be absolutely binding if that were agreed to by the Kingin-Council, that it would have the force of an Act of the Imperial Parliament and would be binding.\nYour Lordships have the right to look at the object of the saving clause. You have the right to look at the object with which that was inserted there, and if you find that the new provinces which may be brought in from time to time count against us not merely as to the increase but absolutely the whole population of these provinces as against our increase, why you would destroy the effect altogether of that saving clause and defeat the object with which it was put in.\nNow, my Lords, there are, it seems to me three questions which your Lordships are called upon to determine here. In determining the representation to which the Provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\u2014they being three of the old provinces\u2014are entitled after each decennial census, you are to take the words \"aggregate population of Canada\" as meaning first the population of the four provinces; or secondly, the population of the seven provinces as they are constituted today; or thirdly, the population of whole of Canada.\nThese are the three questions which we would like your Lordships to determine because of course in the future it may make a material difference whether it means simply the provinces, or whether it means all the territories of Canada as well. Because if the territories are to be excluded then of course it would necessarily raise for the old provinces a very important question as to what should be done when it is proposed to bring in new provinces out of the territories; to carve out new provinces from the territories. Therefore it is a very material question whether\u2014even if we are wrong in our view that the new provinces are not to be included, as to whether the territories should be included.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: That is not material in the present issue.\nMr. Pugsley: It is in the case as submitted. It is involved in the question. It is put in the case as to whether the aggregate population of Canada means the population of the four original provinces, or the population of the whole of Canada including the new provinces which have been admitted since. It therefore necessarily involves the determination by your Lordships as to whether it means the four provinces; whether it means the population of the whole of Canada including the territories, organised and unorganised; or whether it is limited to the population of the new provinces.\nNow, my Lords, I want to deal for a few minutes with the question as to whether you could by any possibility make \"Canada\" in subsection 4 mean the whole of Canada, both new provinces and territories organised and unorganised. And it seems to me that my learned friends upon the other side are driven to argue that in order to sustain their contention. If you take section 51 you will see that it is dealing with the representation of the four provinces, and when by subsection 4 it says:\n\"The number of representatives for a province shall not be reduced unless the proportion which the number of the population of the province bore to the number of the aggregate population of Canada at the then last preceding readjustment of the number of members for the province, is ascertained at the then latest Census to be diminished by one twentieth part or upwards;\"\nwhen it says that, it seems to me that you cannot count in the population of the territories in respect to which no adjustment is to take place. How can you count in that, the population of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan and Alberta and the people living away up in the Peace River with respect to which there is to be no readjustment of representation; in respect to which this section has no application whatever. It seems to me therefore that you must give to the expression \"Canada\" a limited meaning in that subsection. I do not know whether it is proposed by the Government in this Redistribution Bill to take into account all the population of Canada or not, but it seems to me it would be a most absurd thing to say that you could do so; because you are only to take into account the population of that part of the country whose representation you are readjusting.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Why should the territories have representation at all?\nMr. Pugsley: They have, but it is not subject to readjustment. They will have ten representatives under the new bill but they are not entitled to that by virtue of their population.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: They are entitled to six by virtue of population.\nMr. Pugsley: Therefore it is proposed that this Parliament shall add four members to the representation of the North West Territories not based upon population at all. And there is nothing in the British North America Act and nothing in any of these subsequent Acts which allows of any readjustment of representation of the North West Territories. There is no provision for it. My learned friend will not contend that the representation in the North West Territories could be readjusted.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: Of course it could and it will.\nMr. Pugsley: You will contend that it can be readjusted.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: And will; the statute provides for it.\nMr. Pugsley: Then if Parliament gives them four more members than they are entitled to, surely that would be ultra vires, if they are subject to the provisions of section 51.\nIn section 2 of the Act of 1886 (49 & 50 Vict. ch. 35) which is an Imperial Act, I find this provision:\n\"Any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada before the passing of this Act for the purpose mentioned in this Act shall, if not disallowed by the Queen, be, and shall be deemed to have been, valid and effectual from the date at which it received the assent, in Her Majesty's name, of the Governor General of Canada. It is hereby declared that any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, whether before or after the passing of this Act, for the purpose mentioned in this Act or in the British North America Act, 1871, has effect notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act 1867, and the number of Senators or the number of members of the House of Commons specified in the last mentioned Act is increased by the number of Senators or members, as the case may be, provided by any such Act of the Parliament of Canada for the representation of any provinces or Territories or Canada.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: We can give them whatever we like.\nMr. Pugsley: That is what I say; they can give them whatever they like. If Parliament thought fit to bring in Assiniboia it could give Assiniboia 20 members although the population would not entitle it to more than two. Parliament is supreme in regard to that and I am showing that there is nothing, in the legislation which has been enacted by the Imperial Parliament which by fair implication can compel or induce your Lordships to take away the rights of the four original provinces.\nYou must find in the later statutes clear and express language to cut down the rights of the older provinces. That is our argument. I recognise of course that as to the new provinces there may be some anomalies, but while that is the case, and while, as has been said, there may be some stray sheep, yet in respect to British Columbia Parliament has made a different provision. Parliament may make different provisions as regards the other provinces but the reasonable thing to do is, as far as possible, to make the representation of them all subject to readjustment from time to time. They were not bound to come in under these terms and it does seem to me that your Lordships might fairly hold as to the original provinces, when you come to apply subsection 4, that the aggregate population of Canada means the four provinces which are there referred to, but having reference to the later Acts which say in respect to Manitoba, in respect to British Columbia, in respect to Prince Edward Island, that section 51 shall apply as to representation, you may very well say that in considering the representation which they will have, you will take into account the whole population of Canada, You have to give to \"Canada\" in subsection 4, if I am right, a limited meaning. You cannot say that \"Canada\" means the whole of Canada. You cannot say that it includes all the territories in respect to which there is no provision for re-adjustment.\nMr. Justice Armour: You must contend that the word \"province\" in section 51 does not mean any province of Canada but means Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\nMr. Pugsley: I do not mean in construing it generally, but only when you are construing it in reference to the rights of these four original provinces and with regard to their representation. What I contend is that then you must give to Canada the meaning of Canada as comprising these four provinces. It may be that when you are dealing with the representation of new provinces you will have to give to it a wider meaning and say that it means Canada including the new provinces which have been brought in.\nMr. Justice Armour: I think that weakens the force of your argument. Mr. Pugsley: Possibly it does, but it is possible that construction might have to be given to it. I submit, my Lords, that the fair way to view the matter is this: That these four provinces constitute Canada under the British North America Act and it is expressly provided that their representation shall be readjusted in that way, and that therefore, seeing that that gives them very important rights which would be most materially altered if you are going to bring in new territories, you are not going to apply a rule in respect to which you have no basis so far as the provisions for readjustment are concerned. Suppose you were to bring in Assiniboia as a province you have no figures with respect to which you can compare our increase, because it never has been in the Dominion before and then you would have to set against our increase of population its whole population. Therefore it is that before your Lordships would hold that the rights of the older provinces shall be cut down, it seems to me that you must find very clear and very express words to that effect.\nAllen K.C. follows for New Brunswick; My Lords, I have only one or two words to add to what my learned friends have said, because if I were to speak at any length I would be only going over the same ground. It seems to me perfectly clear that the original meaning of these words in sub-section 4 of section 51 of the British North America Act \"population of Canada\" must have been undoubtedly the population of the four original provinces. Now, unless the learned gentlemen on the other side can find equal authority in the British North America Act to change that meaning, we must still put the same construction on these words that would have been put upon them if we were now in the year 1867 instead of the year 1903. I do not think that this court will be very astute to take away the rights of the old provinces under some general words that may be possibly found in a statute which was passed not to affect the representation of the four provinces originally in the Dominion but passed for the purpose of giving representation to the new provinces. Unless the words are so express and so clear, in the Acts relating to Manitoba and British Columbia, that the court cannot possibly construe them in any other way than that they must affect the rights, the representative rights, of the original provinces as set forth in subsection 4 of section 51 of the British North America Act, I think the court will allow these rights to remain exactly as they were.\nThe particular doctrine that I wish to enforce upon your Lordships' attention, you will find in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, (3rd ed.) page 113:\n\"One of the presumptions is that the legislature does not intend to make any alteration in the law beyond what it declares either in express terms or by implication; or in other words beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters beyond the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the Legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness, and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have that meaning in their wider or usual or natural sense, would be to give them a meaning in which they were not really used. General words and phrases therefore, however wide and comprehensive in their literal sense, must be construed as strictly limited to the actual objects of the Act and as not altering the law beyond.\"\nTherefore I take it, may it please your Lordships, that when we undertake to construe the Acts relating to the admission of British Columbia, Manitoba or any other province into this Dominion, we must construe them having in mind the purport of these Acts, which was not the cutting down of the representation of the old provinces but the admission into the Dominion of new provinces and the provision of representation for them.\nNow, so much on that point. There is just one other point which I do not think any of my learned friends have touched upon and I would like to bring it to your Lordships' attention. It is a well known maxim in the construction of statutes that the meaning of all words in a statute are to be taken as of the very day on which the statute was passed, not as I have seen it stated somewhere or other as of the time in which you are going to put the Act in force.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: That is in the Interpretation Act.\nMr. Allen: You must find out what was the meaning of the words at the time the Act was passed.\nNow I refer again to the same book Maxwell on Statutes, page 83:\n\"The words of a statute must be understood in the sense which they bore when it was passed.\"\nAnd in the case of Shape v. Wakefield[1], the same principle is laid down. Now the rule that is there applied is that the words of the statute must be construed as they would have been the day after the statute was passed. Very well. The day after the passage of the British North America Act \"Canada\" unquestionably meant these four provinces, and the burden rests on the learned gentlemen opposite to produce some authority other than that of the British North America Act to change the meaning of this word Canada from the four provinces to the seven provinces, or to the whole of Canada whichever they may happen to argue. I do not know which they will choose and under the authorities which I have read to your Lordships it is not enough to produce some other Acts which were passed for other purposes and affect this issue only by implication; there must be clear and unmistakable words to be found for that purpose. I will not take any more of your Lordships' time, because I feel everything has been touched upon.\nE. M. Macdonald, for the Province of Nova Scotia.\u2014My Lords, I would like to submit that having regard to the question as to what interpretation should be placed upon the meaning of this word \"Canada,\" that there are three constructions that are open to a person who applies himself to the consideration of that subject. First, there is \"Canada\" as meaning the four provinces; then there is \"Canada\" made up of the seven provinces; and then there is \"Canada\" made up of all the provinces and the territories of the Dominion. It is open to interpret the word \"Canada\" in either one of these three ways.\nOn behalf of Nova Scotia I submit that the proper interpretation is the interpretation which my learned friends who have preceded me from Ontario and New Brunswick have submitted to the court. I may be pardoned if in the presentation of the few words I am going to say I have to repeat something that my learned friends have said before me. I point out to your Lordships that when we look at section 51 we find decidedly and distinctly that that section purports to deal only with the representation of the four provinces which were all parties to the confederation. In the preceding section they deal with the representation in the Senate, and the representation in the Senate is fixed definitely and positively as regards these four provinces. It then goes on to deal with the four partners to the confederation. It makes Quebec the unit, it provides for the increase of members, it provides for the fact that each province will have as many members as it can have by comparison with the unit from Quebec, and then this fourth and saving clause comes in, introduced by common consent of all four members of this confederation, which said: There may come a time when one portion of this confederation may increase in population abnormally and we will provide a rule amongst ourselves which will apply to these four provinces alone. To shew that that is so, when we come to deal with section 146 we find that a clear line is there laid down. Section 146 anticipates the entrance into the Dominion of the colonies of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, and it says that these colonies can be admitted upon the presentation of an address to the federal Parliament and upon the passage of an order-in-council by the federal government these provinces become part of confederation upon the terms contained in the agreement. The very important question of representation was left out for the reason that that was one of the great stumbling blocks on account of which Prince Edward Island did not come into confederation. As in the case of Newfoundland it was left absolutely open to deal with it by agreement between the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of these provinces in future. That this was so will be gathered from the fact that when we come to look at Rupert's Land and the method that was adopted in settling with that portion of the Dominion, permission was given for Rupert's Land to come into confederation upon an address from the Parliament of Canada. That address was presented to the Parliament of Canada and an order-in-council was passed, but it was held that the address did not cover all the terms and conditions necessary to make a proper government. So the Imperial Parliament passed in 1868 an Act called The Rupert's Land Act which gave to the Dominion Parliament the power to confer upon that portion of this country certain rights and privileges and all the machinery of government. The federal authorities here, in 1871, came to the conclusion that even under the original address, and even under this special Act, there was no power of the federal Parliament to deal with the representation of that country. If representation was a matter that was to work in all these other provinces along the same lines as section 51,why should there be a necessity for all this legislation, why was this doubt-removing Act passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1871 which expressly stated as follows:\n\"Whereas doubts have been entertained respecting the powers of the; Parliament of Canada to establish provinces in territories admitted, or which may hereafter be admitted into the Dominion of Canada, and to provide for the representation of such provinces in the said Parliament, and it is expedient to remove such doubts, and to vest such powers in the said Parliament:\n\"Be it enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:\n\"1, This Act may be cited for all purposes as 'The British North America Act, 1871.'\n\"2. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time establish new provinces in any territories forming for the time being part of the Dominion of Canada, but not included in any province thereof, and may, at the time of such establishment, make provision for the constitution and administration of any such province, and for the passing of laws for the peace, order and good government of such province, and for its representation in the said Parliament?\"\nNow, if Rupert's Land was coming into confederation, and it this system under section 51 was the system that was to govern other provinces in coming into confederation where was the necessity for this express legislation? In dealing with British Columbia, that Province joined the confederation under agreement and under petitions from the Legislature of that province and from the Dominion Parliament, and one of the provisions of that agreement (I take it verbatim) is as follows:\n\"British Columbia shall be entitled to be represented in the Senate by three members and by six members in the House of Commons, the representation to be increased under the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867.\"\nNow I submit, my Lords, that if the representation of each new province in the confederation was to depend on section 51 there was no necessity for any special stipulation in any one of those agreements in regard to the matter. But in respect to British Columbia the order-in-council, which is the charter of its liberties as a member of this confederation, does not say that the representation of British Columbia can be decreased in accordance with section 51. It does not make that portion of sec. 51 applicable to all. It simply says that the representation of British Columbia can be increased in accordance with section 51. Therefore the whole of section 51 does not apply to British Columbia but only so much of it as provides for the increase of members in accordance with the subdivision of that section. I have been endeavouring to point out to your Lordships that the representation of each one of the provinces that came into the confederation after 1867 was a matter which was determined and fixed solely by the agreement in each particular case. These agreements specified the rights of the provinces and the rights of the Dominion, and set out in a general way that all the legislation which applied to the whole of the provinces of the Dominion should apply to each one of the provinces but when it came to the question of representation there was a specific arrangement in each case. I have ventured to call your Lordships' attention to the arrangement which was made in regard to British Columbia. In regard to Manitoba we find a general section in the agreement which made all the various portions of the Act which were common to the whole Dominion applicable to that province and, in section 4 of the Act relating to Manitoba, there is also an express provision in regard to representation where it says that, on the completion of the census in the year 1881 and of each decennial census afterwards, the representation of the province of Manitoba shall be re-adjusted according to the provisions of the 51st section of the B.N.A. Act 1867. That was a specific provision in regard to Manitoba. When we come to look at Prince Edward Island we find that the clause which was inserted in the agreement there, and which dealt with the future relations of the province to the Dominion, is contained in the following words: \"The representation to be adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act.\"\nNow we submit that these provisions in each one of these agreements became the specific law as regards the representation of each province when these addresses were confirmed by the Order in Council; that these orders-in-council had the effect of independent Acts of the Imperial Parliament; that each one of them stood on its own particular basis and dealt with the particular rights of a particular province, and that so far as representation was concerned it was deemed necessary to insert a clause in regard to representation in each case and it was not left to the British North America Act to work out this question alone.\nI submit that section 51 applies only to these four provinces, and as one of your Lordships well said, you have to infer something in regard to that, in order to make that applicable to the new provinces and, when the charters of these new provinces were granted, Parliament dealt with this representation and treated section 51 as being the system that is worked out applicable to these four provinces, and when these new partners to confederation came in, in one case representation was to be increased and in another case the re-adjustment was to be made from time to time in each case using different language calling for different interpretation. That being so, where you have the British North America Act not dealing, as it does not deal, with the representation of the new provinces in any way, it is significant that section 147 proceeds to deal with the representation in the Senate in so far as Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island are concerned evidently on account of some special considerations, but it leaves the question of the representation of these or any of the different colonies mentioned in 146, so far as the House of Commons is concerned, as a matter to be adjusted by the agreement which may be arrived at. That being so, I submit that whatever agreement each one of these provinces made for itself, it cannot be held that they could interfere with or take away the rights of any one of the original provinces under section 51. That is a question of the construction of statutes upon which I need not cite to your Lordships any authority.\nBut I want to submit further that that is the most natural interpretation to be placed upon the Act. As I have said, there are three interpretations that may be placed upon the word \"Canada\"; the four provinces, or the seven provinces, or Canada as it exists territorially or geographically. I submit with confidence that it cannot be argued that the computation of the aggregate population of Canada is to include the population of these territories as well because, within the purview of this Act and within the purview of the different provinces that were added to this confederation and which were in contemplation, there was no regard to territory in the position in which our North West Territories are to-day, If the other is to be taken it can only be that we must read into section 51\u2014instead of saying the representation of the four provinces, you must say the representation of the seven provinces; and if that is so you have an unnatural condition of affairs. You reach out into the realm of uncertainty. It may be that it is wise from a certain standpoint to have regard to representation by population, but at the same time this Act must be interpreted in the light of the parties who were partners to it originally, and they might very well have said, and I submit they did say, that uncertain as they were as to the development of the rest of the country, and having regard only to certain provinces some of which had not come into confederation, they would observe this system of representation so far as the original provinces were concerned, and each province that came in afterwards was to be dealt with equitably. But the original partner said that if conditions later on arise by which representation by population under an increased immigration or anything of that kind would create new conditions, then a new principle can be applied by the Imperial Parliament under the new conditions. I submit that if you take the total population of the four provinces and treat that as the aggregate and work out the proportion of each province alone, excluding the new provinces that come in, you have a fairer system than if you entered into the realm of uncertainty as to whether the territories or the new provinces have a right to be counted in. The territories cannot come in; they do not come in under the Imperial Act. The only representation the territories have in the Federal Parliament is by virtue of the permissive Act enabling Parliament to give them representation. They are not members of confederation. They do not work out their rights under section 92 or in any of the other ways in which provincial legislatures work out their rights. They have no status as members of the confederation at all, and it would be a violation of the original theory on which confederation was based if the Territories were to be permitted to be counted into the computation today, and by so doing deprive any one of the original provinces from the advantages which they gained under section 4.\nI do not want to take up too much time and I submit my Lords, in conclusion, that if you take the population of the original four provinces of confederation as the total you have a clear and definite working of the statute which can give the re-distribution of representation for all times. Up to the present, and so far as we can foresee, it is fair and equitable all around. It is clear and definite. You preserve the integrity of the original four provinces unaffected by any legislation regarding new provinces and you will not affect the original four provinces in any way.\nCannon K.C. for the Province of Quebec: May it please your lordships, as the Province of Quebec fully indorses the position taken by the Dominion in this case, and shares the interpretation of the section which has been given to it by the Minister of Justice of Canada, it will be probably as well that I should wait until the Minister of Justice of Canada has submitted a case and, if I have any further case to make particular to the Province of Quebec, if it is agreeable to the court I might then be heard.\nFitzpatrick K.C. for the Dominion of Canada:\u2014Perhaps at the outset my Lords, I ought to say there is no provision in the British North America Act with reference to the representation of the provinces except possibly section 37 which provides for the representation of the four original provinces, so that the question of the number of representatives given to a province when it comes into the Dominion is a matter of absolutely no concern. That which is important and that which is necessary because it is provided for by the Act is a re-adjustment of the representation on the occasion of each decennial census, and that is what we are called upon to deal with here. This reference comes before your Lordships as the result of the scheme of representation prepared under section 51 of the British North America Act. This section I submit respectfully to your Lordships is a section with the action of which we have absolutely nothing to do, which we can neither amend so as to extend nor so as to restrict its provisions. Section 51 is an enactment of the Imperial Parliament which is absolutely beyond our jurisdiction and control in so far as the Parliament of Canada is concerned, and the whole question with which we are concerned to-day is simply to see how, in the operation of this act, the re-distribution of the representation of the provinces is to be made. I may say my Lords that, so far as my' knowledge goes, a question of this sort now comes before your Lordships for the first time. You have had, no doubt, frequently to consider questions in which the relative powers of the Federal Parliament and the provincial parliaments were at issue, but in all my knowledge at no time have you been called upon to consider the question of the relative rights of the provinces as between themselves.\nNow, it is not necessary for me to say to your Lordships that this is an exceedingly important matter. It is important because, on the solution of this question, depends the whole principle upon which the British North America Act is founded, that is to say, the principle of the relations which are to exist with respect to representation as between the provinces. It is a matter of vital importance to each province of course that it should be sustained, or maintained rather, in the enjoyment of those powers conferred by the British North America Act. But it is a matter of no less importance to the provinces that they should be maintained in the rights conferred upon them with respect to their representation. Now, I will proceed immediately to state the construction that it has been my duty to advise the Government to place on section 51 of the British North America Act. Section 51 provides:\n\"On the completion of the census in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and of each subsequent decennial census, the representation of the four provinces shall be readjusted by such authority, in such manner and from such time, as the Parliament of Canada from time to time provides, subject and according to the following rules.\"\nI take it, my Lords, to be a settled rule of construction that a word used in a statute is to have as far as possible the same meaning throughout the whole statute, and I say it is a rule of construction that the same word repeated in a section of a statute should undoubtedly have the one meaning. Now my Lords, what is the meaning of the word \"Canada\" in this section 51, first paragraph. The construction I put on it is this my Lords, that as the original Parliament consisted of 181 members as provided by the statute, the Parliament of Canada is a variable term which is to be construed at the time of each decennial census with respect to its representation and with respect to the area of country over which it has supreme legislative control. It is a term which is to be construed in one way in 1871, in another way in 1881 and in another way in 1891. But it is to be construed at the time you seek to put that section into operation.\nNow I say, moreover, my Lords, that the words \"four provinces\" are to be construed also at the time of each decennial census and if in 1871 there were but four provinces in the Dominion, then of course the meaning of the term is clear. If to these original four provinces another province is added, then it means five provinces and so on at the time of each decennial census, it will mean the number of provinces at that time subject to the legislative control of Canada.\nAn Act speaks for the present; it is always speaking. I need not refer your Lordships to section 3 of the Interpretation Act \"the law shall be considered as always speaking.\" I admit, my Lords, that there is no similar provision in the English Interpretation Act of 1889 but that is not a new rule That was an old rule of construction which has been laid down as a proper rule in the case of Ex parte Pratt[2], and your Lordships will find it adopted in Elbert on Legislative Methods and Forms, page 248. I shall not weary your Lordships with reading the clauses, I simply refer you to the authorities. Now, my Lords, my reason for stating that the word \"Canada\" in section 51 is applicable to Canada as we have it to-day, and for stating that the \"four provinces\" are not to be read as four provinces, but are to be read as seven provinces as we have it to-day, my reason for stating that is that the evident intention of the British North America Act was to include all the British provinces and territories in North America. That was the clear and evident intention of those who passed the Act and the provisions of that Act were to be made applicable to all these provinces and territories when they came within its operation. The British North America Act itself did not constitute the Dominion of Canada. The British North America Act made provision for a federation to be constituted a Dominion by statute, a Dominion that was to be brought into being as a result in the first instance of the Queen's proclamation, and the limits of which might be varied and extended at any time under the provisions of section 146 of the Act. The Act itself is so framed, the terms of it are so broad, that they are intended to apply to all these provinces and territories leaving it to time to work out the periods at which these provinces and territories would come within its operation. Now, that that is the construction to be put on it is apparent from the terms used in the Act itself. Your Lordships will find that the preamble of the Act provides:\n\"Whereas the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\"\nThat is the first part of the enactment. Then the fourth paragraph reads: \"And whereas it is expedient that provision be made for the eventual admission into the union of other parts of British North America.\"\nIn the first instance four provinces were considered in this provision. It is provided in the preamble that it is intended that all the other provinces shall come in.\nThen, my Lords, you will find that section 3 makes provision for the consolidation or rather the federating into one Dominion of the four original provinces. That is to be done by proclamation.\nThen, my Lords, section 146 makes provision for the bringing into the confederation of the other provinces which were in contemplation at the time the Act was passed, that is to say, Newfoundland, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, and the Act further makes provision for the bringing into the confederation of the territories so that there should be but one Dominion as referred to in the preamble of the Act, and this is provided under section 4 to which I shall have occasion later to refer.\nNow section 3 to which I referred a moment ago, says:\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, to declare by Proclamation that, on and after a day therein appointed, not being more than six months after the passing of this Act, the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one Dominion under the name of Canada.\"\n\"Under the name of Canada;\" the name of the Dominion is to be Canada.\n\"And on and after that day those three provinces shall form and be one Dominion under that name accordingly.\"\nSo that until such time as the proclamation issued, this Act was not applicable to these provinces. Then you have got section 4 in which the term \"Canada\" may be considered as having been defined. Section 4 says:\n\"The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, commence and have effect on and after the union, that is to say, on and after the day appointed for the union taking effect in the Queen's Proclamation, and in the same provisions, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, the name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act.\"\nNot Canada as constituted under section 3, by authority of the proclamation. Thus, my Lords, you must not only consider the four original provinces as they are brought in under section 3 of the royal proclamation, but you have also to consider the other provinces and territories as they may be brought in under section 146 of the British North America Act.\nIf you take section 146, my Lords, you will find that it provides:\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, on addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or provinces, or any of them into the union.\"\nThat is to say, to bring them into the union which is provided for by section 4.\n\"And on addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and the Northwest Territory or either of them, into the union, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed, and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any order-in-council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"\nNow, my Lords, it is outside the question to discuss this question as to whether British Columbia came in with the number of representatives that it ought to have had under the constitution or not. That is outside the question we are now considering. But my construction of section 146 is this, that the Queen had the right by order-in-council to legislate in the way and subject to the limitations contained in section 146. The order-in-council became and had the effect of an Imperial Act of Parliament so long as the powers conferred by section 146 were exercised subject to the limitations contained in section 146. Legislation by order-in-council is an exceptional legislation and can only be exercised subject to the limitations in the power authorising the legislation to be had in that form. An Act of the Imperial Parliament, might modify, alter or amend the British North America Act, might absolutely repeal the Act or alter any of the terms or provisions of it, but the order-in-council cannot do that. The order-in-council can only legislate in so far as its provisions are within the provisions of the Act, and it would not be competent with respect to the imperial order-in-council for them to pass an order-in-council which would have for effect the altering or the amending of the provisions of the Act, That order-in-council ought to be made subject to the provisions of the Act and under the control of all the provisions of the British North America Act, so that no order-in-council could be passed that could in any way affect this section 51 of the Act.\nNow, my argument therefore is that section 4 must be construed as meaning Canada as it may be from time to time constituted under the provisions of the British North America Act and the Canada of to-day is composed of the several provinces which form the Dominion of Canada.\nIf that is not the meaning of the word, if that is not the construction to be put upon it, take section 91 of the Act.\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\"\nWhat is the meaning of the word \"Canada\" there? Does that not mean the provinces and territories subject to the legislative jurisdiction of Canada.\nIf your Lordships will look at section 8, it says:\n\"In the general census of the population of Canada which is hereby required to be taken in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one and in every tenth year thereafter, the respective populations of the four provinces shall be distinguished.\"\nAccording to the construction put on section 51 by my learned friends it would be necessary to construe that, as being the population of Canada restricted to the four provinces, and that you are under an obligation to distinguish between the respective populations of the four provinces but not to go any further, and as a result you would be forced to the conclusion that there is no provision for any census in Canada beyond the four original provinces.\nMr. Justice Armour: Complaint is made that you are taking into consideration the territories that are not provinces at all, unless you read section 4 \"a province\" as covering \"a territory.\"\nMr. Fitzpatrick: I may say to your Lordships that that is not a matter, as I shall have occasion to show, that is of importance. The method of distribution in regard to the territories is not of importance.\nMr. Pugsley: It is not now perhaps, but it might be ten years to come.\nMr. Justice Davies: The answer will determine it and it might be of immense importance.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: It is of importance for the future but dealing with it in a practical way as a practical legislator, I say, as I shall have occasion to point out when I consider the scheme now proposed, that whether you take the territories or not, the fact with respect to the numerical representation is not affected. Mr. Justice Davies: At present. Mr. Fitzpatrick: At present it is not, but of course it would be exceedingly interesting for the future that it should be considered and I submit, as far as I am concerned, that I want to take the word \"Canada\" in the sense in which it is used in the first paragraph of section 51. The Parliament of Canada means the Parliament having legislative jurisdiction over the whole of Canada including territories as well as provinces.\nI submit that your Lordships have to read all the British North America Act together, the. Acts of 1867, 1871 and 1886 ought to be read together and considered together, one amending the other, and your Lordships will find in the Act of 1886 provision is made for the representation of the territories.\nMr. Justice Armour: Does it make any provision with regard to the readjustment?\nMr. Fitzpatrick: No, my lords, but it is interesting from this standpoint that the Imperial Act was passed in June, 1886, and an Act had been passed in the previous May, assented to on the 2nd of June, where provision was made and the subsequent Act confirms the Act of the Parliament of Canada. I shall have occasion to refer to that afterwards and your Lordships will have to read all the Acts, Canadian and Imperial, to see the bearings of this issue.\nWith your Lordships' permission, I had perhaps better dispose of this question of the territories at once, with respect to its application to the question now before you. If we eliminate the territories, that is to say, eliminate the population of the territories in our estimate of representation, the position would be\u2014I shall not weary your Lordships to take the figures, for I presume that your lordships will want me to submit to you afterwards the figures in written form\u2014if you eliminate the population of the territories, in your computation of the representation of the provinces, the result would be that Ontario would very nearly escape a decrease but not quite.\nThe population in Ontario in 1891 was 2,114,321. The population of the Dominion eliminating the population of the territories exclusive of the population of the territories, was 4,734,272. Now, that would be expressed by the decimal fraction 446.\nIn 1901, the population of Ontario was 2,182,946. The population of the Dominion in 1901, eliminating the population of the territories, was 5,159,666. That would be expressed by the decimal fraction .423.\nThe result would be that the difference between the representation in 1891 and 1901 is the difference between these two decimals, which is 23\/100, so you see that is a diminution.\nNow we come to Nova Scotia. In 1891 the population of Nova Scotia was 450,396. The population of the Dominion was 4,734,272. That would represent the decimal fraction '951.\nIn 1901, the population of Nova Scotia was 459,574, and the population of the Dominion 5,159,666. That would be expressed by the decimal fraction .891.\nThat would be a diminution of 60 or more from the one-twentieth part of .951. New Brunswick, in 1891, had a population of 321,263' The population of the Dominion was 4,734,272. The decimal fraction would be .678. In 1901, the population of New Brunswick was 331,120. The population of the Dominion was 5,159,666. That would represent the decimal fraction .642. That would be a diminution of .036 and that of course would be more than a twentieth part.\nNow with respect to Prince Edward Island, I shall not weary your Lordships with the details but in either alternative, whether you include the territories or not, and if you give to the word Canada in the fourth subsection of section 51 the construction contended for by my friends, or if you eliminate the territories, it is perfectly immaterial; Prince Edward Island loses in any case, so that your Lordships see with respect to the practical effect of this legislation, whether you include the territories or eliminate the territories, the result is the same. The provinces would lose their proportion of representation and the only point on which my learned friends can save Ontario. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the only point on which they can save the representation of these three provinces, would be that your Lordships would come to the conclusion that the word \"Canada\" in the fourth subsection of section 51 means exclusively the four original provinces. We may as well put the question clearly now. If your Lordships came to that conclusion the representation would be affected.\nNow, as I said a moment ago, my Lords, we have section 146 which makes provision for a rounding off of the confederation or for including in the confederation the provinces that originally contemplated coming in. That is to say Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. As your Lordships are aware, taking the matter up historically, at the conference at Charlottetown, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island were represented as part of the Maritime Provinces. Therefore for the purpose of giving effect to the original intention of the parties, section 146 contains the necessary provisions but not only do they provide at the time for these two provinces, but they also make provision for the carrying out of the intention of the Act, the intention expressed by Sir John A. Macdonald at the time of the Quebec resolution, and which you will find expressed by Lord Carnarvon when he introduced the British North America Act in the House of Lords. That is to say, the same day in Canada would be included all the provinces and territories of North America that owed allegiance to the British flag, and for that purpose section 146 is extended beyond this and includes British Columbia which was then a Crown colony, and the North-West Territories and Rupert's Land, and it is provided that these provinces of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island shall come in upon addresses of their legislatures and from the Houses of Parliament of Canada, that British Columbia shall come in upon addresses of the Legislatures of Canada and British Columbia, and that the territories shall be brought in upon addresses from the Houses of Parliament and Canada. Acting on the powers conferred by that section, 33 Vict., ch. 3 of the statutes of Canada, was passed in 1870. That statute provides by section 1 that:\n\"On, from and after the date upon which the Queen by and with the advice and consent of Her Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, under the authority of the 146th section of the British North America Act, 1867, shall, by order-in-council in that behalf, admit Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory into the union or Dominion of Canada\u2014\" Here are the words of importance to which I wish to draw your Lordships' attention:\n\"There shall be formed out of the same a province, which shall be one of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada.\"\nThat is to say, you shall carve out of the North-West Territories and Rupert's Land a province that shall be one of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada. This is the legislation of 1870. That is the Province of Manitoba.\nThe Chief Justice: Previous to that Rupert's Land and the territories had been admitted into the Dominion.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: By order-in-council, not as a province merely as territories, my lord. They had no representation or anything of that sort. They simply came in for the purpose of being administered.\nSection 2 provides that Manitoba:\n\"On, from and after the said day on which the Order of the Queen in Council shall take effect as aforesaid, the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, shall, except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to, or only to affect one or more, but not the whole of the provinces now composing the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this Act, be applicable to the Province of Manitoba, in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the several provinces of Canada, and as if the Province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act\"\nActing under the powers conferred by section 146 of the British North America Act, this Province of Manitoba was carved out of the territories of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories, and made a province of the Dominion and special provision is made that the provisions of the British North America Act, with the exception I pointed out a moment ago, shall be made applicable to Manitoba as if Manitoba was one of the original provinces in the Dominion.\nBut that is not all my Lords. Your Lordships will find in section 4 this further provision with respect to representation, that is, the question now in hand:\n\"The said province shall be represented, in the first instance in the House of Commons of Canada, by four members, and for that purpose shall be divided by proclamation of the Governor General into four electoral districts, each of which shall be represented by one member: Provided that on the completion of the census in the year 1881, and of each decennial census afterwards, the representation of the said province shall be readjusted according to the provisions of the fifty-first section of the British North America Act, 1867.\"\nNow my Lords, when this Act was passed, doubts were expressed in the Commons here as to whether or not the Parliament of Canada had the power to infringe on the provisions of the British North America Act, to such an extent as to give this province with its limited population four members which was out of all proportion to the number of its population. That is to say it was an interference with the principle of representation by population, and when you come to look at the debates, if your Lordships would be interested in doing that, that is the point taken. Doubts were expressed and as a result a statute was prepared, passed by the Parliament of Canada and sent home to the Imperial Government and they were asked there to enact Imperial legislation for the purpose of getting rid of the constitutional objection urged against this Act. As a result of that, the Manitoba Act as it is familiarly called, the British North America Act of 1871, was passed. I shall not worry your Lordships with a recital of the details of that Act, but you will find in that Act special provision made for the confirmation in its entirety of this Act of the Dominion of Canada. Therefore as the result of the British North America Amending Act of 1871, the provisions of this Act, 33 Vict. ch. 3, are incorporated in the British North America Act and the British North America Act is amended pro tanto.\nTherefore, 33 Vict. ch. 3 gathers from the Act of 1871 the same force and effect as if it was an Imperial Act and if there is any repugnancy between the two this Act of 1871 shall be considered as amending the other.\nWith respect to Manitoba section 51 must be construed to read instead of \"four provinces,\" \"five provinces,\" and the Parliament of Canada must be read as including Manitoba. Then in passing I will draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that not only the first paragraph of section 51 is amended, but section 8 which provides for the census is also amended, and in the general census of the population of Canada which is required to be taken in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one and every tenth year thereafter, the respective populations of the five provinces are to be distinguished.\nAnd your Lordships will have occasion to see the importance of that when I come to draw attention to the use of the words \"population of Canada,\" the words to be construed here in subsection 4 of section 51; of the effort that must be made to give to these words \"population of Canada\" in subsection 4 an entirely different meaning from what they have in section 8 in respect to the census.\nThen you will find that an order-in-council is passed at Windsor, on the 6th of May 1871, always under the terms of section 146 of the British North America Act, which provides:\n\"Whereas by addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and British Columbia respectively, of which addresses copies are contained in the schedules to this order annexed\"\nand so on.\nAnd these are the words of importance:\n\"Her Majesty by and with the advice and consent of Her Majesty's Privy Council declares that on, from and after the 20th day of July 1871 the said Colony of British Columbia shall be admitted into and become part of the Dominion of Canada.\"\nThat is, become part of the Dominion which is established as one Dominion by the British North America Act.\nThen your Lordships will see what are the terms and conditions under which British Columbia comes in It is provided that\n\"British Columbia shall be entitled to be represented in the Senate by three members and by six members in the House of Commons. The representation to be increased under the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867.\"\nSection 10 provides:\n\"The provisions of the British North America Act 1867 shall (except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to, and only affect one and not the whole of the provinces now comprising the Dominion and except so far as the same may be varied by this minute), be applicable to British Columbia in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion, and as if the Colony of British Columbia had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\" Now, my Lords, I am not concerned at the present time with the question as to whether or not six members should have been assigned to British Columbia at the outset. But I ought to say in passing that the number of representatives which may be granted to a province when it originally comes in, is to be fixed arbitrarily. There is no means under the British North America Act to determine the number of members to which a province is entitled. The only means we have is the aid of the census, but you will find whatever may be the number of representatives granted to a province when it first comes in, provision is afterwards made that at the decennial census the readjustment is to take place, and that is the provision of section 51, which as I said operates automatically, and if there is any amendment made to the operation of section 51, as the result of the passing of the order-in-council under which British Columbia comes into confederation, I submit and it is not necessary to go further, that it is an exceedingly serious matter to say that British Columbia or any province could come in and, as the result of an order-in-council, have more favourable conditions than any province already in. At any rate the question is not up now. It does not affect the issue but is a mere matter of academic interest.\nNow, you have British Columbia brought in in 1871, and when British Columbia comes in under the order-in-council for which provision is made by section 146, and when it is stated that British Columbia is to be one of the provinces of the Dominion and is to be considered as if it had been one of the provinces from the beginning, as if it had been one of the original provinces, entitled to all the rights, subject to all the obligations of the original provinces, what does that mean? If that is out of the proper limits, if that order-in-council with the restriction I pointed out a moment ago has the effect of Imperial Legislation, the result is with respect to the British North America Act, that those portions of it which are repugnant are amended and instead of having five provinces we have six, British Columbia having come in, and then you have British Columbia forming part of the one Dominion, subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada having all the rights of the other provinces and subject to have its representation readjusted under the provisions of that Act, that is to say, under the one provision which has reference to readjustment, section 51. I trust I have made my meaning clear as far as I have gone.\nThen, if we have dealt with British Columbia, let us get down to Prince Edward Island which came in under an order-in-council' of the 6th of June 1873. There you will find that the two first paragraphs are absolutely in terms the same as the paragraphs with respect to British Columbia, but there is a slight difference with respect to the question of representation With respect to Prince Edward Island, the words used are:\n\"That the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by 15,000 or upwards since the year 1861, the Island shall be represented in the House of Commons of Canada by six members.\" The same as British Columbia:\n\"The representation to be re-adjusted\" (instead of to be increased from time to time) under the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867.\nThen, my Lords, the second next paragraph in it on page XIII is absolutely in terms the same, contains the same words as those to which I had occasion to refer a few moments ago in connection with British Columbia, and you will there find again the words: \"Be applicable to Prince Edward Island in the same way and to the same extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion and as if the Colony of Prince Edward Island had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\"\nThe same argument applies here, and the position I take is the same, that is, up to the present time we have the four original provinces with the addition of Manitoba making it five, and of British Columbia making it six, and now of Prince Edward Island making it seven, and as a result the first paragraph of section 51 is to be amended so as to read \"seven provinces\" and the Parliament of Canada is to be construed as meaning thereafter the Parliament of Canada which includes the seven provinces and of course the territories which had come in before.\nNow the order-in-council to which I referred with respect to the territories, is that of date the 3rd of June 1870.\nThen on the 25th of June, 1886, you find the last amendment to the British North America Act passed by the Imperial Parliament which makes provision for the Parliament of Canada to provide for the representation of the territories.\nYour Lordships will bear in mind that on the 2nd of June of the same year, an Act providing for the representation of the North-West Territories had been passed by the Parliament of Canada. Some doubts it appears had been expressed with respect to the right of the Dominion of Canada to pass such legislation and it was to give validity to that legislation that this Imperial Act was passed. But I draw attention to the last paragraph of this Act of 1886 which makes provision for all the British North America Acts to be read together. I do not know if it was necessary but as a matter of precaution the three Acts are to be read together, the Acts of 1867, 1871 and 1886 so that they form but one Act thereafter.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Could you suggest any reason why they did not ask for Imperial validating legislation in respect to British Columbia, whereas they did in respect to Manitoba?\nMr. Fitzpatrick: There is something very curious in respect to that. I think that with respect to British Columbia the question of the representation was also discussed in the House. Your Lordships will find it, if you are interested, in the discussions in the House of Commons on the validity of this British Columbia Act and the same doubts with respect to its validity were expressed because of the fact that a disproportionate number of representatives were given to British Columbia. It was stated by eminent authorities, Sir Alexander Galt and Hon. Edward Blake and some others, that this was an infringement, but I want to draw attention to this. If your Lordships will remember in 1870 a memorandum was prepared by Sir John A. Macdonald, then Minister of Justice, to which reference was made by the Attorney General from New Brunswick, drawing attention to the doubts expressed with respect to the validity of the Manitoba Act of 1870, and asking for confirmatory legislation which resulted in the passing of the Act of 1871. In that Act, in the order-in-council then prepared, I would like to draw attention to this curious feature. Sir John Macdonald points out that:\n\"There is in the Act no provision whatever for the representation in the Senate or House of Commons of Rupert's Land or the Northwestern Territory or British Columbia.\"\nHe draws attention to the fact that the same difficulty might possibly arise with respect to British Columbia as has arisen with respect to Manitoba, and in his conclusion he says:\n\"Under these circumstances, as the question as to the constitutionality of the Act of the Canadian Parliament has been raised, and as the doubt may cause grave disquiet in the territories which have been or may hereafter be added to the Dominion; and in order also to prevent the necessity of repeated applications to the Imperial Parliament for legislation respecting the Dominion, the undersigned has the honour to recommend that the Earl of Kimberley be moved to submit to the Imperial Parliament at its next session a measure;\n\"1. Confirming the Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vict. ch. 3, above referred to, as if it had been an Imperial statute, and legalising whatever may have been done under it, according to its true interests.\n\"2. Empowering the Dominion Parliament from time to time to establish other provinces in the Northwestern Territory, with such local Government, Legislature and constitution as it may think proper, provided that no such local Government or Legislature shall have greater powers than those conferred on the local Governments and Legislatures by \"The British North America Act, 1867,\" and also empowering it to grant such provinces representation in the Parliament of the Dominion. The Acts so constituting such provinces to have the same effect as if passed by the Imperial Parliament at the time of the union.\n\"3. Empowering the Dominion Parliament to increase or diminish from time to time the limits of the Province of Manitoba, or of any other provinces of the Dominion, with the consent of the Government and Legislature of such provinces.\"\nThese are the things he asked for and they were all granted by the amending Act of 1871, the Imperial Act: \"Providing that the terms of the suggested Act be applicable to the Province of British Columbia whenever it may form part of the Dominion.\"\nThat was not granted in reference to British Columbia, and why? The reason is that it is perfectly obvious that it is provided under section 146 that British Columbia is to come in on an address and may be dealt with absolutely in the same way as Prince Edward Island or Manitoba, but there might have been doubt with respect to the territories.\nI draw attention to this, I do not attach importance to it, that by implication the Imperial authorities did not consider it necessary to do what your Lordship sugggested might possibly be done.\nNow, my Lords, my theory is that as a result of the issuing of the proclamation in 1867, and under section 3 of the order-in-council to which I have referred made pursuant to section 146 of The British North America Act, that all these provinces and territories came in and formed part of the Dominion, and that at the decennial census that took place after they came in, that is to say the decennial census of 1881, the Parliament of Canada then was the Parliament of Canada having legislative jurisdiction over all these several territories and provinces, and the words \"four provinces\" ought to read \"seven provinces.\"\nIf that be not the law, if that be not the rule of construction to be applied to section 51, where do you get, where does the Parliament of Canada get, the authority to deal in so far as representation is concerned with the readjustment of the representation of any province? The provinces came in with a certain number of representatives, but where do we get authority to deal with the readjustment of that representation, and where do you find authority for this especially, that they should come in under the terms of the addresses and be subject to all the provisions of The British North America Act and, in the terms of the order-in-council, as if they had formed part of the Dominion of Canada from its inception and yet they are not to be subject to the control of section 51.\nI am not dealing with subsection 4 but with the first paragraph of section 51. How do they come in? Are they to be dealt with under section 51 or are they to be exempt from it? I submit they are to be dealt with under section 51, because they come in subject to the provisions of the Act, and the stipulation is made on their behalf that they are to be considered as if they had formed part of the Dominion from its inception. If that be the case I say the Parliament of Canada means the Parliament of Canada having jurisdiction over all these provinces and if they do not come in under section 51 how is their representation to be readjusted, where does the Parliament of Canada get authority to deal with them?\nIt is important in a statement of this sort to see how you are going to give effect to these provisions. What does this provide. This section provides for a readjustment of the representation of the provinces after each decennial census. Not only is the readjustment of the representation of the provinces provided for on the occasion of each decennial census, but the mode of readjustment is provided for also. The statute provides how the readjustment is to take place, if makes provision as to when and as to how, for the time and the method.\nHow is it to be done my Lords? Here is the first rule of all:\n\"Quebec shall have the fixed number of 65 members.\"\nThat is the starting point. The principle is representation by population, that is the principle laid down here, and it is to be ascertained by the aid of the pivotal province, Quebec. As the number 65 is to the population of Quebec, so is the number of representatives of any other province to x, the result, or rather to put the proportion properly the population of Quebec is to the population of any one of the other provinces, as the number 65 is to x.\nThe time when readjustment is to take place is fixed as a sequel to each decennial census, and the mode of operation is by Quebec having a fixed number of 65. You then find section 2 of section 51 which says:\n\"There shall be assigned to each of the other provinces such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to the number of its population (ascertained at such census) as the number sixty-five bears to the number of the population of Quebec (so ascertained).\"\nThat is the provision of the Act in relation to the provinces outside of Quebec, and you must remember when it is proposed to depart from this principle, it is proposed to be done against the Province of Quebec; in favour of the other three of the original provinces, but against Quebec.\nNow, my Lords, the rules laid down by section 51 for the readjustment of the representation is to take Quebec with the fixed number of 65 members. Then you assign to each of the other provinces such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to its population as the number 65 bears to the population of Quebec.\nLet me put it to you in this way. Assuming the population of Quebec to be 1,600,000 and the number of representatives 65, then if you divide 65 into 1,600,000 the result is \u00bf5,000 and that would be the unit of representation. Then take that unit of representation and apply it to each of the provinces, that is to say assuming the unit of representation with respect to Quebec, the pivotal province, to be 25,000, then you take the population of any province, no matter what its population may be, and divide it by 25,000, and that quotient is the number of representatives to which it is entitled, an exceedingly simple method of finding out how the principle of representation can be worked out. You will see it is the most simple method by which this principle can be worked out. If your Lordships do that, and that is what the Act provides for, you will find that the result is that the population of Canada, taking the unit of population as we get it from Quebec, would entitle the people of Canada to be represented by 211.07 members.\nOn the other hand, if you take the principle contended for by my honourable friends, and apply it in the way I have done for Quebec, you get this result, First you get a unit of representation that varies according to each province. You get 25,367 for Quebec, 23,000 for Ontario, 22,000 as the unit for Nova Scotia, and 23,000 as the unit for New Brunswick. You got a unit of representation that varies for each of the provinces, and it would be unjust to Quebec that it should require to have a unit of 25,000 while Nova Scotia has a unit of 22,000.\nMore than that you have section 52 which you have to consider.\n\"The number of members of the House of Commons may be from to time time increased by the Parliament of Canada, provided the proportionate representation of the provinces, prescribed by this Act, is not thereby disturbed.\"\nThe number of members may be increased by the Parliament of Canada from time to time. That is what they are doing. The Maritime Provinces would increase the number by their construction and in addition to that violate the proviso of sec. 52 which provides that the proportion of representation shall not be disturbed. They would increase the number of representatives and disturbs the proportion of representation. That is what their construction leads to. Now let me see how far it is possible to put that construction on subsection 4 of section 51.\nNow, in the result my Lords, if my construction is correct, section 8, to which I would ask your Lordships' attention now, has a most important hearing upon the question at issue. In sec. 8 the words \"population of Canada\" mean the population of the old provinces and also the population of the new provinces and the territories.\nThat is the basis of it. Let that be granted and we have the basis of the whole question. Let us take up section 51 and you will find in section 51 that it is provided that the re-adjustment of the representation of the provinces is to take place after each decennial census which decennial census is provided for by section 8.\nNow, with respect to the question in hand, your Lordships will see that a re-adjustment is to take place on the completion of the census, and is to be carried out by the Parliament of Canada subject to the rules that are laid down in section 51. If your Lordships admit that the word \"census\" means the census of the population of Canada, as we have it at the time of each re-adjustment; that the \"Parliament of Canada\" is the Parliament which has legislative jurisdiction over that territory inhabited by the population as taken in the census; it seems to me that we have the case in so far as section 51 is concerned.\nLet us go on to deal with the other provisions of section 51. The first subsection, of course, there is no doubt about. Quebec is to have under that subsection 65 members. There is no discussion about that. But then let me ask your Lordships to look at subsection 2 of section 51 which provides:\n\"There shall be assigned to each of the other provinces.\"\nThat is to say, each of the provinces reading it at the time at which the British North America Act came into effect when the proclamation was first issued.\n\"Such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to the number of its population (ascertained at such census) as the number 65 bears to the number of the population of Quebec (so ascertained).\"\nSo that your Lordships will see that section 8 is the basis of the operation of section 51. It is \"the population of the provinces ascertained at such census.\" Now my Lords, if the new provinces are not affected by section 8; if they are not part of the population of Canada within the meaning of section 8; how is their population to be ascertained? If they do not come within the operation of section 8; if they are not part of the population of Canada, their census cannot be ascertained and as a result, my Lords, they can get no representation at the time of the readjustment. Do your Lordships follow me?\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: I do not follow that.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: Well, my lord, let me put my argument in another way. Each province is entitled to have after each decennial census a readjustment of its representation; that readjustment to be made upon the following basis: Quebec to have 65 members, and the population of Quebec divided by 65 gives the unit of representation. That unit of representation divided into the population of each of the other provinces gives as a result the number of representatives to which each province is entitled. Now my Lords, how is the population of each province into which the unit of representation is to be divided to be ascertained? Is it not the population of each province as ascertained by the census under section 8? Does your Lordship follow me in that?\nMe. Justice Sedgewick: Yes.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: If it is the population ascertained by the census by what census is that population to be ascertained except it is by the census which is required to be made by section 8. There is no other census. Section 8 provides that the census shall be of the population of Canada, and therefore if the inhabitants of the new provinces are not part of the population of Canada within the meaning of that section then the basis on which the readjustment is to be made fails. If it is conceded that the words \"population of Canada\" for the purposes of the census include all the provinces and territories, then I submit that these words must have the same meaning in subsection 4 of section 51. The argument of my learned friends on the other side is that \"the population of Canada\" in subsection 4 of section 51 means the population of the four original provinces. It seems to me that it is impossible that you should give to the same words in different parts of the same statute a different meaning, but that is the position into which my learned friends are necessarily driven. I submit my Lords that to determine the representation in the Dominion Parliament to which all the provinces are entitled you must take the population of Canada as ascertained by the general census and then you have a definite meaning given to the words \"population of Canada\"; and that meaning is as I have so often repeated that \"population of Canada\" includes all the provinces and all the territories. My learned friends suggest that when the four original provinces constituted Canada under the Act by virtue of the proclamation, section 51 provided that they should have a representation proportionate to their population and that they then had in this respect acquired vested rights which could not be affected by the subsequent admission into the union of other parts of British North America.\nAdmitting that originally the union was limited to the four provinces, you cannot cut out of the statute section 146 which provides that on addresses from the Parliament of Canada, and from the Legislatures of the provinces in that section mentioned, those provinces may be admitted into the union upon such terms and conditions as are in the addresses expressed. Let us deal with the case of Manitoba in the first instance. The last lines of section 2, of 33 Vic, ch. 3 read \"the provisions of the B N.A. Act shall apply to Manitoba in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the several other provinces of Canada, and as if the Province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act\"; and the proviso of section 4 of the same Act is to this effect\u2014\"provided that on the completion of the census in the year 1881 and of each decennial census afterwards the representation of the said province shall be re-adjusted according to the provisions of section 51 of the B.N.A. Act 1867.\" Are we to assume that these words are not wide enough to include subsection 4 of section 51 and that Manitoba is not to have the benefit of that section to the same extent and in the same way as the four original provinces? Then what becomes of the argument as to vested or acquired rights. If they had such rights, were they not at liberty to waive them when they adopted this Act? Further if we remember that 33 Vic. ch. 3 has, as I have already pointed ont. the effect of an imperial statute and must be read with the Act of 1867, is the consequence not that the first Act is amended by the second, and that Manitoba must be dealt with in all respects as if it had been one of the provinces originally united by the B.N.A. Act.?\nWhat I have said of Manitoba applies with equal force to British Columbia and Prince Edward Island. In the terms and conditions in each case provision is made that the representation is to be re-adjusted under the provisions of the B N.A. Act and that each province is to be dealt with as if it had been one of the provinces originally united by the B.N.A. Act. Therefore, impliedly, these other provinces when they came in were made subject to section 51.\nBut, my Lords, there is more than that. I will ask your Lordships to follow me while I read subsection 4 which provides:\n\"On any such readjustment the number of members for a province shall not be reduced unless the proportion which the number of population of the province bore to the number of the aggregate population of Canada at the then preceding re-adjustment of the number of members for the province is ascertained at the then latest census to be diminished by one-twentieth part or upwards.\"\nYou always get back to the census. Here you find that it is the aggregate population of Canada ascertained at the then latest census that is to determine the decrease, or the maintenance of the status quo. By which census is the \"population of Canada\" referred to there to be ascertained? It is the population of Canada referred to in section 8 my Lords. Therefore, as you always get back to the meaning of the words \"population of Canada\" in section 8, the construction I have contended for, that is to say, the population of Canada in its entirety, the matter is concluded, because it is that population of Canada ascertained by that census under that section that determines the meaning to be put upon subsection 4.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: It is a great protection to the representation of the decreasing provinces, because there must be a decrease of more than one-twentieth during the ten years. It may be a little smaller decrease than the one-twentieth for the ten years, and the result may be that not a single one may be left in the province after a time, and still they would be entitled to their full representation.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: I have no desire to put forward a provincial view of this matter at all; on the contrary, so far as the Dominion Parliament is concerned, our desire and our duty is to see that the Act operates automatically without respect to consequences. One of the important features of this scheme of re-distribution is the consideration to be paid to the intention of those who formed part of confederation at its inception. If your Lordships will consider it, you will see that Canada was originally formed of the four provinces, Quebec being one. The construction which my learned friends put upon this subsection 4 is a construction which is applicable to three provinces and not to four because it cannot affect Quebec.\nWhether the population of Quebec be decreased by one-twentieth or not, her representation remains the same. It is only with respect to three provinces, and not to the four provinces that it is of importance. But my Lords Quebec consented to have 65 members with the understanding that these 65 members in proportion to the population of Quebec should determine the representation of the other provinces, so that a man in Quebec should have by reason of his vote, the same political influence in Canada as a man in any other part of the Dominion. If this Act is construed properly, then every man in the Dominion of Canada will have the same amount of political influence as the result of his vote.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: That is emphasized by section 52.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: Yes my Lord. If you divide 65 into the population of Quebec, you find that the unit of representation is twenty-five thousand, three hundred and sixty-seven. You take that unit of representation and divide it into the population of the other provinces as ascertained by the last census, and you get a result which operates equitably between all the provinces and which gives a number of representatives to each province in proportion to the number of representatives which Quebec has in respect to its population and its number of 65.\nAnd if my learned friends' construction of the statute should apply, the result would be that you will have 92 members for the province of Ontario; that you will have twenty members for the province of Nova Scotia; that you will have fourteen members for the province of New Brunswick, with this consequence that you would have one unit of representation for Quebec representing 25,367; that you would have another unit of representation for Ontario representating 23,727; that you would have another unit of representation for Nova Scotia representing 22,978, and another unit for New Brunswick representing 23,651. Now my Lords, what is the further result? It is that we would have for Canada 219 members of Parliament; whereas based upon the population, and upon the principle that Quebec is the pivotal province and that that province furnishes the unit of representation, there should be only 211 members. I shall conclude with this statement to your Lordships: That in order to give effect to the argument of my learned friends, it is necessary for you to give the same words in the same section different meanings; you will be obliged to give to these words different meanings throughout the Act; you will have to construe each clause of that Act by giving a different meaning to the same words, in different sub-sections even, and give to those words in subsection 4 of sec. 51, with respect to the census of Canada, a meaning entirely distinct and entirely different from the meaning which you give to the same words in section 8 which provides for the taking of the census. My learned friend is driven to that conclusion, and I say it is an impossible conclusion; it is a conclusion that your Lordships cannot adopt. It is a conclusion contrary to every principle of the construction of statutes.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, follows\u2014My Lords, I have little to add to the very able and exhaustive argument of the Attorney General, and perhaps it would not be necessary for me to occupy your Lordships' time at all but that there are one or two considerations which it seems to me demonstrate the futility of the argument advanced by my learned friends on the other side and which show its fallacy so clearly, that perhaps I may be justified in adding a few remarks.\nNow, my Lords, referring to section 4 which has often been quoted, that section does not say what my learned friends have submitted it does say, or what they appear to think. It says:\n\"Unless it is otherwise expressed or implied the name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act.\"\nThe whole basis of the argument of my learned friends proceeds upon the assumption that the union of the British American provinces was consummated and brought into effect by the immediate operation of the British North America Act; and assuming the false premise to start with, they argue as if the words in section 4 were not as they appear in the statute, but that the name \"Canada\" should be taken to mean Canada as constituted by this Act. Now, my Lords, if it were as my learned friends contend, I submit they would not have much of a case, although they might have something to argue upon. The question might be arguable if the effect of the statute and the words of the statute were as assumed all along for the purpose of their argument; but when you consider what the words of the statute are, and how it was that this union came into effect, I submit that it is perfectly apparent that they have not a vestige of a case on which to base an argument here.\nMy Lords, you have to refer, as has been said, to section 146 in connection with section 4. I have not heard my learned friends contend, and I presume they would not venture to contend, that the terms of union, the terms of the addresses under which British Columbia, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and the Territories were brought in, have altered the construction which is to be put upon section 51. They say that paragraph 4 of section 51, in using the expression \"aggregate population of Canada\" refers to Canada as comprising only the four original provinces, and that this is an inelastic clause which cannot be extended. Will your Lordships refer to section 146 with me for a moment. Let me read it in this way, because we are entitled to read it in this way for the purpose of arguing this point.\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen to admit the provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia or any of them into the union and to admit Rupert's Land and the Northwestern Territory or any of them into the union, subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nAnd referring to clause 3:\n\"It shall be lawful for the Quean to declare by proclamation that on and after a day therein appointed, not being more than six months after the passing of this Act, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one Dominion under the name of Canada.\"\nIt becomes apparent, my Lords, that it was an executive Act which constituted the Dominion of Canada and not a legislative Act. Her Majesty acted under a delegated power in bringing about the confederation of the provinces. The constitution was framed, adopted and sanctioned by Parliament and it was a hard and fast constitution which could not be altered by the executive; but there was a power delegated to the executive to bring in the members of that confederation by an executive Act, namely, by a proclamation so far as the three original provinces were concerned, and by orders-in-council so far as the others were concerned. Therefore when you speak of \"Canada\" as constituted under this Act, you must necessarily have regard to Canada as existing by virtue of the Acts of the Crown, authorised by the statute, and it makes no difference in the reading of section 146 that there are certain preliminary requirements to the passing of the orders-in-council. If the statute stood as I read section 146 to your Lordships a few moments ago, then it would have been quite competent for all these executive Acts to have come into effect at the same time; the proclamation might have issued, the orders-in-council might have issued and the seven provinces would have been united at the same time. I say, my Lords, if you leave out for the purpose of this argument that which is quite immaterial in section 146, viz. the reference to the addresses of the Parliament of Canada and of the Legislature\u2014leave them out for a moment (because I say that these addresses cannot and it is not contended by my learned friends that they do alter the construction of section 51) leaving these out, it is an Act of the Crown that brings in the original provinces; it is a similar Act of the Crown that brings in the other provinces. If these had been left out, I say that the seven provinces could all have come into the union at the same time, and if so, does any one pretend to say that under section 51 you would limit the aggregate population of Canada to four of the provinces rather than to the whole and if to four, then to what four do you limit it under these circumstances? There is no reason why you should limit it to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New-Brunswick rather than to British Columbia, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and one other of the four. My learned friends' case is like this, and their whole contention proceeds upon a basis to which this condition of things, which I mention for the sake of illustration, would be a parallel. If an Act were passed now providing that the West Indies should form part of Canada, and should come into the union on certain terms laid down by the Imperial Parliament, unless that Act expressly amended the British North America Act so as to make, for the purposes of section 51, the West Indies a part of Canada, they would have to be excluded in computing population because the West Indies under those circumstances would not be included in Canada as constituted under this Act. They would come in under another Act. But here, it is not by this Act as my learned friend said in his argument (whether he misread the statute or not I do not know; probably he thought the statute meant that but there is a most important distinction); it is not \"by\" this Act but \"under\" this Act that Canada is constituted. Canada is constituted under this Act, as to the provinces later brought in, in the same way precisely as it is constituted in respect to the earlier provinces.\nThat name \"Canada\" is used in at least 48 different sections of this Act and it would lead to the most absurd and impossible results if it should be construed for the general purposes of the Act as referring merely to the four provinces. It would no doubt be very confusing also if separate and distinct considerations have to be applied to each of these 48 sections for the purpose of determining whether \"Canada\" as therein used refers only to the four provinces, or to the whole Dominion, or to a portion of the Dominion.\nTherefore, my Lords, I submit that there is no ground, according to the letter of the statute, for applying any restricted meaning to the word \"Canada\" as used in section 51, par. 4, and according to principle \"Canada\" for the purposes of that section must include the whole, or otherwise there is produced an absence of uniformity and equality.\nThere is no doubt, my Lords, that it was intended that these provinces should be represented upon equal terms. I would like to know what would be the result if the view of my learned friends was adopted with regard to par. 4 of sec. 51. You have got to deal with the expression \"aggregate population of Canada\" and that clause undoubtedly applies to all the provinces that have been brought in since 1867. Now with regard to Manitoba if you consider whether Manitoba's representation should be decreased, is Manitoba's representation to be compared with the aggregate population of the four provinces, or is it to be compared with the population of the five provinces of which Manitoba is one? And so with regard to British Columbia?\nMr. Justice Davies: There are three possible contentions which have been submitted to us.\nMr. Newcombe: But I am showing my Lord that there are six possible contentions. I am showing that there are a great many more possible contentions than my learned friends have mentioned. You have the words \"the aggregate population of Canada\" and my learned friends say that means the aggregate population of the four original provinces of Canada. Now suppose you have to read just Manitoba under that and to ascertain whether the population of Manitoba has diminished more than one-twentieth, having regard to the aggregate population of Canada, are you going to compare the population of Manitoba with the population of the four provinces for that purpose, or are you going to compare it with the five provinces including Manitoba? Or having regard to the present condition of things are you going to take in British Columbia, and are you going to take in the Territories, and are you going to take in Prince Edward Island? My learned friend, Mr. Pugsley, felt that there was a difficulty about it when he said that there were three different constructions and no doubt he was anxious to limit the number of the constructions as much as possible, but when you come to look into it there are at least six different constructions, every one of which is quite as hopeful as the one my learned friend Mr. Pugsley put forth.\nMr. Justice Girouard: There is one for each province.\nMr. Newcombe: Nearly one for each province, my lord. Manitoba certainly could advance precisely the same argument when her population came to be readjusted, in regard to the aggregate population of Canada as constituted the moment that she came in. That would give us five provinces instead of four, and when British Columbia came in we will have six provinces instead of four, and when P.E.I, came in we would have seven provinces instead of four. The result of that would be, and the result of my learned friends' argument inevitably must be, that under the conditions which may arise, Manitoba, British Columbia or Prince Edward Island, say one or more of them, might lose a member on account of a decrease which would not justify the taking away of a member from New Brunswick, and therefore the result would be inequality and want of uniformity and all kinds of diversity under the provisions of the Act.\nI submit, my Lords, that if it had been desired or intended to bring in provinces or territories upon such terms as my learned friends contend for, it would have been impossible to do so under the provisions of section 146. It is manifest, I submit, that the terms and conditions affecting the constitution of the union or Dominion are expected where it speaks of the terms and conditions mentioned in the addresses under which these provinces may be brought in. The terms and conditions are terms and conditions of union in one Dominion, subject to the provisions of this Act.\nAs to the territories, there is nothing in section 51, par. 4 with regard to the aggregate population of Canada, which makes that expression dependent upon those parts of Canada which have representation. It merely says that the population of each province shall be compared with the aggregate population of Canada for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is to be decrease, regardless of whether any of these portions have representation or not. Your Lordships must admit that there might be, as originally contemplated by the Act, parts of Canada which would not be represented, because according to the concensus of opinion, when this Act was passed and before any amendments, there was no authority to provide for representation of the unorganised territories of Rupert's Land or the North West. They had to get an amending Act for that purpose; and when they passed the British North America Act of 1867, they used the words \"aggregate population of Canada\" having regard to Canada as to be composed of provinces which must be represented, and as to be composed of territories which under the Act as it then stood (accepting the common view) could not have been represented.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Might or might not.\nMr. Newcombe: Could not, my Lord, if you assume that it was necessary for that purpose to amend the Act. On what principle then are you going to exclude the unrepresented portions of Canada when you have regard to the words \"aggregate population of Canada\" in section 51 par. 4? It seems to me, my Lords, that as my learned friend, the Attorney General said, Canada is a geographical term\u2014Canada as bounded by so and so.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Whether represented or not.\nMr. Newcombe: Certainly, my lord, whether represented or not. It means the whole Dominion of Canada. I want to point out further that in the Rupert's Land and North West order-in-council, under which that territory became part of the Dominion of Canada, it says expressly:\n\"It is hereby ordered and declared by Her Majesty that from and after the fifteenth day of July 1870, the said North Western Territories shall be admitted into and become part of the Dominion of Canada.\"\nIs that expression intra vires of the Queen in Council? It says in terms that the North West Territories shall become part of Canada. If that Was a declaration founded on statutory power, then it has the same effect as the statute, and the North West Territories are a part of Canada; but it does not stop there because it is expressly reiterated and affirmed by the British North America Act of 1886. You go to the British North America Act 1886 to get representation, and if it depends on representation, as Mr. Justice Armour suggests, then they have got representation.\nThe Parliament of Canada may from time to time make provision for the representation in the Senate and House of Commons or either of them of any territories which for the time being formed part of the Dominion of Canada but are not included in any province thereof.\nMark the words \"formed part\". Now Rupert's Land and the North West Territories had been annexed to Canada when that Act was passed. They are the only territories which the Act contemplates or which could be by any possibility referred to in the words I have read, and they form part of the Dominion of Canada.\n\"And this Act and the British North America Act, 186-7, and the British North America Act 1871 shall be construed together and may be cited together as the British North America Act 1867 to 1886.\"\nMr. Allen: Would you re-adjust their representation under section 51?\nMr. Newcombe: There is a special provision with regard to their representation, that it is regulated by the Parliament of Canada. Whether it should be readjusted or not, is quite aside from the point. The question at present is: Whether the territories form part of the Dominion of Canada geographically speaking, and you invoke there again section 4 which says that unless it is otherwise expressed or implied Canada shall mean Canada as constituted under this Act. Canada as constituted under this Act included the territories; the territories are expressly referred to by the British North America Act of 1886 as a part of Canada. Then we get the expression \"aggregate population of Canada\" and how are you to import into that the exclusion of the territories. It says, unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, and there is not a single section in the whole Act that expresses or implies, with regard to the term \"Canada\", a meaning as including less than the whole, or shows the purpose of the qualification, except section 22 which refers to Canada in relation to the constitution of the Senate and provides that it shall be divided into three divisions. It is probably implied there that the word \"Canada\" is used in that section as relating only to the original provinces because three divisions could not be said to embrace the western provinces, but this is an exception which proves the rule.\nTherefore, my Lords, I submit that the only meaning which you can give to this paragraph 4 consistently with the letter of the Act and consistently with the principle promoted by the Act, is that the aggregate population of Canada refers in all circumstances to the territorial area of Canada defined as school boys learn in their geographies.\nCannon K.C., for the Province of Quebec: May it please your Lordships. On behalf of the Province of Quebec which I represent on this reference, I beg to say that Quebec concurs entirely in the opinion of the Dominion of Canada as expressed by the learned Attorney General and the Deputy Minister who have preceded me. We concur with them as to the interpretation of the words \"aggregate population of Canada.\" It will therefore be unnecessary for me to repeat any of the arguments which have been so forcibly placed before your Lordships by the Minister of Justice and his deputy. I would merely wish to refer to section 51 of the British North America Act, if your Lordships would allow me, and briefly to point out in what way I consider the interpretation to be put upon sub-clause 4 of section 51 by my learned friends from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is illegal, and would operate injuriously to the Province of Quebec, and destroy that proportion of representation which was prescribed by the 8.N.A. Act. It has been admitted on all sides by the counsel who have preceded me, that the system of representation which was given to Canada by the British North America Act was representation by populations Upon that point there is no question, Now, representation by population being the accepted principle in the B.N. A. Act section 51 goes on to state how this representation by population will be readjusted. This readjustment is to take place under section 51 every ten years, after each decennial census, and subsections 1 and 2 fix the unit of representation under which the redistribution shall take place. Subsection 1 says:\n\"Quebec shall have the fixed number of sixty five members.\"\nAnd subsection 2 says:\n\"There shall be assigned to each of the other provinces such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to the number of its population (ascertained at such census) as the number sixty five bears to the number of the population in Quebec (so ascertained).\"\nAs to these two subsections, may it please your Lordships, there is no difficulty whatever. The learned counsel who preceded me on both sides interpreted these two subsections in the same manner, namely, that the unit of representation is one 65th of the population of Quebec at a given census, and that the proportion of one 65th of the population of Quebec to the population of the other provinces, gives these provinces the right of representation in the Parliament of Canada. There is, I say, perfect accord as to the interpretation of the clauses which fixes the manner in which the representation may be increased after a given census. Subsection 3 deals with fractions of the unit of representation that is fixed by section 2 and states that fractions of such a unit will give the right to an additional member. Then we come to subsection 4 upon certain words of which the present reference has been made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, as to how the words \"the aggregate population of Canada\" are to be interpreted. Two interpretations of this subsection 4 are given, one by my learned friends representing New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and the other by the learned Attorney General of Canada and Deputy Minister with whom I concur on this point. It struck me, in listening to the argument of my learned friends from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, that they seem to give a double interpretation, if I may so express myself, to the words \"aggregate population of Canada,\" in this subsection 4. If I understood their argument rightly I think that in so far as the new provinces and the territories are concerned, they admit that the aggregate population of Canada means all Canada including all the provinces and the Territories. But when it comes to the three old provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia\u2014and this seems to me a very singular legal pretension\u2014then they say that the same words in the same subsection of the Act shall be given another interpretation, and they say that these words \"aggregate population of Canada\" which for the new provinces and the territories means the population of all Canada as geographically constituted at a given time has another meaning for the three old provinces, and only means then Canada as constituted at the time of the passing of the B. N. A. Act, and applies only to the four old provinces of Canada. As I say, at first sight, this pretension seems to me rather singular from a legal standpoint, since in order to put it before the court they are obliged to interpret the words in one sense for a certain number of the provinces and the territories, and in another sense for the four old provinces.\nWe contend that these words \"aggregate population of Canada\" apply to all Canada as constituted at the time that the re-adjustment takes place. Now, may it please your Lordships, I think that is the natural interpretation conformable to the wording of the British North America Act. As I have said, this Act gave Canada representation by population and section 51 fixes the unit of representation and made the Province of Quebec the pivotal province as to the unit of representation. As to the increase, we all agree that the increase at a given census to any province whatever is the increase which is equivalent to one 65th of the population of Quebec at that same census over and above the number of members which it already has; this increase will give it the right to an additional representative in the House of Commons of Canada. Of course the decrease or reduction in the number of members is not treated in the same proportion as the increase. The B. N. A. Act has provided, and very wisely I think, that once a given province has obtained additional representation, it will not lose that representation by the mere loss of the same number of population which gave it the representation, but it must sustain a heavier loss in its population to be deprived of the additional member which was given to it by the preceding census.\nWhen it comes to making a province lose one of its additional representatives which it had a right to by the preceding census, then the B. N. A. Act requires a larger decrease in the population than the increase that was required to give it an additional representative. But still I claim may it please your Lordships, and that is the point I wish to put before your Lordships as forcibly as I can; I claim that this proportionate decrease required by subsection 4 in order that the province should lose a representative must be on the proportion of the same population which is taken into consideration in order to give an increase to the representation of the province. Although the proportion is not the same amount still I say the proportion is based upon the same population for the decrease as for the increase, and that must necessarily be so in order not to interfere with the system of representation by population which is established by the British North America Act.\nOn the other hand, it is argued that although Quebec is bound to accept the increased representatives in the western provinces under section 51 on account of increase in population still the other provinces who have a decrease in population would not lose representation in proportion to the decrease of their population, the proportion being taken upon the same provinces. I must submit that if that were held it would be an unjust and illegal consequence under section 51. Quebec is obliged to accept the increased representation which the increase of population gives to the western provinces, but on the other hand the older provinces, if they have undergone a decrease of population which causes them to lose, taking into consideration the proportion of the whole population of Canada at the last preceding census, the old provinces I say must submit to that decrease if we wish that proportionate representation which is enacted by section 51 to remain in existence.\nI think my Lords that if the interpretation put upon subsection 4 by my learned friends from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were accepted, then this interpretation would be absolutely against the provisions of section 52 of the B. N. A. Act, and that proportionate representation of the provinces which is absolutely and peremptorily ordered by section 52 would be destroyed. It seems to me that we cannot come to any other conclusion on that point. Now, my Lords, I would merely wish to mention that it seems to me very clear that in this subsection 4 of section 51 the word \"Canada\" should be read and understood to mean Canada as it exists to-day. My learned friend the Attorney General of Canada cited the section of the Interpretation Act (Revised Statutes of Canada ch. 1, sec. 7 subsec.3) which if the court will allow me, I will read:\n\"The law shall be considered as always speaking and whenever any manner or thing is expressed\u2014\u2014\nThe Chief Justice: That does not apply to the B. N. A. Act.\nMr. Cannon: I do not pretend that it applies to the B. N. A. Act which is an Imperial statute. But I submit that this is a rule of the English common law. It is a rule which applies in England also and it is a rule which will be found in Elbert as cited by the Attorney General of Canada. I. think that rule is very concisely put in that subsection of the Interpretation Act. Now, my Lords, I would merely wish to say in conclusion that the British North America Act 1867 appears to me to be a kind of treaty or articles of partnership between certain possible partners who are mentioned therein, and that the different clauses and articles of this treaty or deal of partnership must be applied equally to all the parties who have since that date come under this treaty or deed of partnership. I think that in the interpretation which the Government of the Dominion is giving to these words \"aggregate population of Canada\" it is acting within the true letter and spirit of the British North America Act and I hope that this opinion will be upheld by your Lordships. With these remarks may it please your lordships. I leave the matter in your hands.\nPugsley K. C., in reply\u2014It seems to me, my Lords, that the argument which the learned Attorney General for Canada addressed to your Lordships, having reference to the result of yielding to our contention, was an argument that might rather have been applied some thirty odd years ago when the British North America Act was being framed, than to-day; because that saving clause was inserted in the British North America Act in order to bring about the very result which he says would be brought about if our contention prevails. The object was, that even though a province might fall slightly below its proportion relatively to the province of Quebec, yet it should not lose a representative if, taking the aggregate population of the four provinces, its proportion had not fallen below the one-twentieth. One can readily understand that the smaller provinces might have refused to have entered into confederation unless that safeguard was provided. And if your Lordships should have the curiosity to read Pope's Confederation Documents you will see how strongly that was dwelt upon as a safeguard which was held out to the Lower Provinces. It was said by reason of that saving clause contained in sub-sec. 4: You need never fear that there will be a decrease in your representation. Now, my learned friends representing the Province of Quebec complain that we, representing the other provinces, insist as strongly as we can upon this provision of the constitution being recognised. We do not ask that there should be any violation of the terms of the compact of union. All we ask is that these terms shall be carried out and what we say is that when by the British North America Act it is provided that the representation of the four provinces shall be readjusted in the mode which is thereby described, that the statute means what it says and that is all we ask your Lordships to determine.\nMr. Fitzpatrick: Without regard to any amendment.\nMr. Pugsley: Without regard absolutely to any amendment made for another purpose and which only professes to relate to the new provinces and which does not profess to take away or to alter or to interfere with the rights of the old provinces. We say that this compact, this treaty which we entered into, ought not to be altered by any agreement to which the legislatures of the provinces were not parties; to which the people of the provinces were not parties.\nMy learned friends it seems to me, are seeking to have the British North America Act interpreted as if instead of the words \"the four provinces,\" in section 51, the words were \"the representation of each province.\" They are seeking to have it interpreted just as if the British North America Act had remained as it was in some of the drafts of the bill which your Lordships will find, if you desire to look at them, in Pope's work to which I have referred. I find in the Confederation Documents by Joseph Pope on page 164 that the third draft of the bill provides as follows:\n\"There shall be a general census of the people of the Dominion of Canada taken in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and decennially afterwards; and immediately after the said census, and immediately after every decennial census thereafter, the representation from each province in the House of Commons shall be readjusted by such authority, in such manner, and from such time as any Act of the Parliament of Canada from time to time directs.\"\nThat expression is contained in two of the drafts but when we come to the final draft however the words \"each province\" are omitted, and so that there can be no doubt as to what is meant the words \"the four provinces\" are inserted instead.\nIn St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[3] Mr. Justice Strong used this passage:\n\"In construing this enactment (the British North America Act) we are not only entitled, but bound, to apply that well established rule which requires us, in placing a meaning upon descriptive terms and definitions contained in statutes, to have recourse to external aids derived from the surrounding circumstances and the history of the subject matter dealt with, and to construe the enactment by the light derived from such source, and so to put ourselves as far as possible in the position of the legislature whose language we have to expound. If this rule were rejected and the language of the statute were considered without such assistance from extrinsic facts, it is manifest that the task of interpretation would degenerate into mere speculation and guess work.\"\nIn the case just referred to, Mr. Mowat, who was counsel in the case said: \"In various cases it has been decided, I am not quite sure whether in this court or in other courts, reference has been made to the resolutions upon which the British North America Act was founded. What degree of importance should be attached to them has not been stated but at all events it is reasonable for judges to look at them, and if they do find that they throw any light on the subject they should avail themselves of that light.\" I have the impression that in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, the late Mr. Justice Fisher thought it was quite proper to look at the proceedings of the Quebec Conference, and he claimed it was his duty to do so in order to get such light as they would throw upon the matter with a view of enabling him the better to construe the statute.\nIn Pope, page 126, the words are \"the representation from each province shall be readjusted.\" As I have said my Lords, you will find these words changed back and forth. In the first draft it is the \"four provinces.\" I do not know what it was in the second draft, but in the third draft it was \"each province,\" and I think it was in the fourth draft also; but when you come to the final draft and to the Act as it was passed by the Imperial Parliament the words are \"the four provinces.\"\nMr. Justice Girouard: You attach much importance to the difference of the wording.\nMr. Pugsley: I do my Lord, because if those who were drafting the bill were looking forward to future provinces coming in under that section no better words could have been used than \"each province,\" but as they were introducing a safeguard, and as they were providing for provinces which were comparatively old, they thought it better not to use any words which would be open to doubt and therefore they inserted the words \"the four provinces,\" so that it would clearly appear that in respect to representation it was with those four provinces and with those four provinces alone they were dealing, leaving the question of representation in the other provinces to be considered in the future.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Do you mean to say that the words \"four provinces\" excluded the new provinces?\nMr. Pugsley: They do so as far as section 51 is concerned, and I say you have to look to the orders-in-council in reference to other provinces to see what their rights are and they cannot in any way alter the rights which were given to the old provinces under this section.\nMr. Justice Mills: By sections 91 and 92 you have the terms and conditions as to the division of power. Would the order-in-council override that?\nMr. Pugsley: No my Lord and for this reason; that the order-in-council and the Imperial Act both provide that the various sections of the statute that are not particularly applicable to the provinces shall apply to the new provinces. It is quite consistent for me to admit that, and yet argue that the right in respect to representation has not been affected so far as the old provinces are concerned, because representation in respect to new provinces is not dealt with at all.\nMr. Justice Mills: Your contention would go this far: That the terms and conditions of union would embrace the distribution of powers and that it would be from the terms and conditions yon would have to ascertain what the powers of the new provinces were in the union.\nMr. Pugsley: I would say my Lord, that by necessary implication these words would extend to the new provinces, but it does not at all follow that the provision with regard to representation in respect to which no provision is made so far as a new province is concerned is not entirely different. Your Lordships can see that in order to provide a proper safeguard you might have to have, and you would have to have, a very different proportion if you were considering new provinces and new territories in respect to which the increase of population would necessarily be much more rapid than in the old provinces. You can very well see that the framers of confederation would recognise, that if the population of new provinces and territories had to be considered it would be no safeguard at all to put it at one-twentieth, and it would be utterly useless to have it there. It seems to me that my learned friends upon the other side must be entirely wrong in their statement that provision could be made under section 146 by order-in-council in respect to the representation if it were at all at variance with the provisions of section 51, and their whole argument seems to be based on that. I submit my Lords that if you read section 146 you will, I think, agree with me that any order-in-council which they chose to pass providing any terms of union that they pleased to agree to, the moment that was assented to by the Queen in council it had all the force and effect of an Imperial statute.\nMr. Justice Davies: You do not consider at all the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Pugsley: No my Lord because it would not be necessary to put them in. Let me read section 146. Surely it will not be denied that the Imperial Parliament can make any provision it likes. Section 146 reads:\n\"It shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council on Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or any of them into the Union on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the Addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any order-in-council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\"\nMr. Justice Armour: That is all controlled by \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Pugsley: A complete answer is, that the Act makes no provision with respect to these new provinces.\nNow my Lords, just consider how unreasonable it would be to construe the British North America Act or section 51 in the way in which my learned friends think it should be construed. The Dominion originally consisted of four provinces. The idea of the safeguard in subsection 4 is that a reduction of representation shall depend upon the proportionate increase in these four provinces. Now if the contention of my learned friends is correct, the moment you brought in British Columbia you would have introduced an element which was not taken into consideration and could not have been taken into consideration upon the previous readjustment because it was no part of Canada, and therefore so far as the older provinces are concerned you would have to be placing their increase merely against the whole population of the new province which is brought in. And therefore, even although the increase of New Brunswick might have been greater than the increase of the five provinces including British Columbia, yet we would still lose our representative because you could not take into account the increase, but you would have to take into account the whole population of British Columbia as it did not form part of Canada previously. I have one reference to make and I shall not trouble your Lordships further, because the case has been exhaustively argued and there is nothing I can say further to aid your Lordships. The report which the learned Attorney General for Canada mentioned yesterday, the report which was made by the then Minister of Justice, Sir John Macdonald, on the 28th day of September 1870, under which the Imperial legislation is enacted absolutely confirms, it seems to me, the position which we take. I find in Hodgins Dominion and Provincial Legislation page 10, that Sir John Macdonald reported:\n\"The general purview of the British North America Act 1867 seems to be confined to the three provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, originally forming the Dominion.\"\nThat is our view, my Lords.\nMr. Justice Mills: That was due to the way in which that territory was brought into Canada. There were no conditions stated.\nMr. Pugsley. But the view of the Minister of Justice was that the British North America Act makes no provision whatever in regard to and does not have in view representation from the territories, and that was why Sir John Macdonald thought it necessary to have additional legislation on the subject. Now my Lords, the Deputy Minister of Justice when he referred to section 22, held that \"Canada\" must not always receive the same interpretation so far as the British North America Act is concerned. He admits that Canada in section 22 only means a part of Canada. He admits that \"Canada\" there does not mean the whole of Canada because it says:\n\"In relation to the constitution of the Senate, Canada shall be deemed to consist of three provinces, namely Ontario. Quebec and the Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\" Mr. Justice Girouard. That is an exception made by the statute but whenever there is no exception you must take the other view and give a large interpretation to the word \"Canada.\"\nMr. Pugsley: I think your Lordship does not quite understand. What I understood to be admitted, and what I would say as to that is, that in interpreting that section your Lordships must hold that \"Canada\" only means there Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.\nMr. Justice Girouard: The statute says so.\nMr. Pugsley: That is true, and so in section 51 it says the \"four provinces,\" and where can be the difference. Here it gives in detail what the four provinces are, namely, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and in the other case it says the four provinces which are the provinces which are being constituted into a confederacy. It seems to me my Lord that if my learned friends here have to contend as they have that in construing subsection 4 you are to take the population of the territories as well as the new provinces, they are driven into a very great difficulty because the result of their contention is that in applying this saving clause you will have to bring in a portion of Canada which is not represented in the House of Commons at all. You would bring in the Peace River country, you would bring in the district of Ungava; you would bring in all the unorganised territories which contain a population of 75,000, the organised territories containing a population of 150,000. The unorganised territories form a part of the Dominion of Canada. You would therefore not only be obliged to bring in a portion of the territories in respect to which there is a representation but which is not to be readjusted at all under section 51, but you would also bring in a large population of the unorganised territories which has no representation in Parliament which contains about 75,000 people, and in respect to which there will be a very rapid increase of population in the near future; because judging by the way that western country is filling up population is not going to be confined to the organised territories.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This Order of Reference involves the interpretation of clauses 51 and 14b of the B. N. A. Act which, it seems to me, are capable of only one construction. As I read them, they mean the aggregate population, as ascertained at the latest census, of all the provinces and territories then constituting Canada. Sec. 51 lays down the principle to be applied to the readjustment of the representation of the four original provinces, and sec. 146 and the Imperial statutes relating to the territories; 34 & 35 Vict. ch. 28, and 49 & 50 Vict. ch. 35, provide for the admission of other provinces into the union, and that these new provinces, whether formerly independent of Canada, like Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, or created out of the territories, like Manitoba, shall be subject to the provisions of the B. N. A. Act. They and the territories\u2014not only the four original provinces\u2014constitute Canada and the Dominion of Canada, and are governed by the same constitution, in so far as it may not be inconsistent with the terms of their union respectively.\nI am therefore of opinion that subsection 4 of section 51 of the B. N. A Act means the whole population of Canada; that is not only the aggregate population of the four original provinces, as ascertained at the latest census, but also the territories, whether represented in Parliament or not, and all the provinces which have been created or admitted into the union subsequent to the passage of the B. N. A Act, 1867. DAVIES J.\u2014This reference is made for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of this court as to whether in determining the number of representatives in the House of Commons to which Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are respectively entitled, after each decennial census, the words aggregate population of Canada, in subsection 4 of section 51 of the British North America Act of 1867, should be construed as meaning the population of the four original provinces of Canada, or as meaning the whole population of Canada including that of the new provinces which have been admitted to the Confederation subsequent to the passing of the British North America Act.\nThe question we are asked to answer involves the proper construction to be given to sec. 51 of the B. N. A. Act. It is contended on behalf of the Provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, that the section in question applies in terms only to the four provinces which were declared to comprise the Dominion when the B. N. A. Act came into operation and that it was only intended to have such limited application excepting in so far as subsequent orders-incouncil, under the 146th sec. of the Act admitting other provinces into the union, might extend to these new provinces the principles and benefits of the section. It was strenuously contended, however, that the extension of the operation of the section in question to new provinces could not take away from any of the four first provinces comprising the Dominion rights which the section gave and was intended to give them.\nThere is no doubt a good deal to be said for the argument thus presented arising from the use in the section under review of the language \"the representation of the four provinces shall be re-adjusted\" by Parliament after each decennial census in manner therein provided. I have, however, after careful consideration of the whole Act and its amendments, reached the conclusion that the argument of the Attorney General for Canada must prevail and that the expression \"four provinces\" means, and must be read as \"several provinces\" comprising the Dominion. Any other construction gives rise to incongruities and difficulties which would render the operation of the section different in different provinces of the Dominion and would defeat what appears by the 51st and 52nd sections of the Act to be the basic principle intended to govern the representation of the people in the House of Commons, viz., \"the proportionate representation of the provinces.\" The B. N. A. Act is an instrument of government and must be read and construed in the light of its declared objects. Its preamble, while declaring the desire of the three provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown, further declared the expediency of providing for \"the eventual admission into the union of other parts of British North America\" and its enacting part made provision for carrying out these objects. These two main objects of the Act must at all times be borne in mind while construing any of its sections. The union was not consummated by the act itself, but by an executive Act of the Crown authorised by the 3rd section of the statute, and in like manner the extension of the Dominion by the admission of other parts of British North America whether provinces or territories from time to time took place by similar executive acts (sec 146).\nThe 4th section provides that in construing the provisions of the Act unless otherwise expressed or implied \"the name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act.\" I think the contention submitted on behalf of the Dominion is correct, and that this means Canada as constituted from time to time under the Act And so applying this principle to the 8th section requiring a decennial \"census of the population of Canada\" to be taken, I think it obviously meant Canada as it was constituted at the time appointed by the statute for the taking of each decennial census. Any other construction involving a partial census only would seem absurd and calculated to defeat the object Parliament must have had in view. It is true the same section requires the respective populations of the four provinces into which Canada was first divided to be distinguished, but again I adopt the reading of the Attorney General that this means, and by virtue of subsequent amendments of the Act must necessarily mean, the several provinces comprising the Dominion from time to time, and whose subsequent admission was either expressly contemplated originally or subsequently authorised by Imperial legislation. The scheme for the decennial readjustment of the representation of the people in the House of Commons of Canada contained in secs. 51 and 52 is, as I have said, expressly declared to be the \"proportionate representation of the provinces,\" and is based upon the well known principle of representation by population. It is to work automatically. Quebec is selected as the pivotal province and has an arbitrary number of 65 members assigned to it. The division of that number into its population after each decennial census gives the unit of representation on which the readjustment for the whole Dominion is to be based, and subsec. 2 accordingly applies it to \"each of the other provinces.\" Subsec. 3 directs fractional parts of the unit less than a half to be disregarded, and subsec. 4 around which the main argument revolved and which in the argument at bar was called the \"saving clause\" provided against a province losing any of its representation unless the proportion which the number of its population bore \"to the number of the aggregate population of Canada at the then last preceding readjustment of the number of members for the province as ascertained at the then latest census should be found to be diminished by \"or upwards.\"\nI am of opinion that this section is a general provision applicable and intended to be applicable to all the provinces forming part of the Dominion from time to time. It is obvious that no reduction in the representation accorded to any one of the newly admitted provinces could be made under this subsection, until that province had been made part of the Dominion for two decennial periods because the standards or proportions fixed by the subsection and by virtue of the existence of which alone the reduction could be made could not be found till after that. But apart from that limited and special period the provision was intended to cover the cases of all the provinces for which the previous section had provided there should be a decennial census and the general words \"the number of the aggregate population of Canada\" are to be given their proper and plain meaning, and read so as to include the population of the provinces and territory added from time to time as well as that of the four original provinces into which Canada was first divided. These words are not to be limited, even when working out the application of the section to the other provinces, to the population of Canada as it existed territorially when confederation was first formed. The Attorney General for New Brunswick admitted that with respect to Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, each of which joined the union some years after it was originally constituted, and also with respect to Manitoba which was created as a province by subsequent legislation, a larger construction than the one contended for by him with respect to Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick must necessarily be given to the words in question. The result would follow that two or more different constructions must be given the same phraseology in the same subsection and instead of the same section working automatically after each decennial census as between the population of a province and the aggregate population of Canada, as I think was intended, it would have to be worked out on the basis that there were three or four different \"aggregate populations of Canada\" dependent upon the several times when the different provinces whose union with the Dominion was contemplated actually became part of it. This certainly is a conclusion and a result which only the clearest and strongest language would justify us in reaching, and so far from the language of this section being clear and strong enough to justify a construction so opposed to ordinary rules I am of opinion it is perfectly consistent with the larger and better construction which, excepting in the special cases where a meaning territorially limited is expressly given or is necessarily to be implied, requires the general sections of this instrument of government, the British North America Act and its amendments, to be construed as embracing as well the territory and people subsequently admitted to the union as those originally constituting it.\nSubsequent Imperial legislation in 1871 confirming the Dominion legislation constituting a part of Ruperts Land and the North-West Territory a province of the Dominion under the name of Manitoba, and afterwards in 1886 empowering the Dominion to provide for the representation in the Senate and Commons of Canada of any territory which for the time being formed part of Canada but was not included in any province thereof, declared that the original Act and its amendments should be construed together. This legislation of 1871 as confirmed by the Imperial Parliament provides that the provisions of the British North America Act 1867,\nexcept those parts thereof which are in terms made or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more of the provinces now composing the Dominion\nshall be applicable to the new province of Manitoba,\nin the same way and to the same extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion and as if the Province of Manitoba had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\nSecs. 51 and 52 do not certainly come within the above exceptions and even if reasonable doubt did exist as to the true meaning of the sections under review this subsequent imperial legislation would seem to remove them.\nUpon the whole, after careful consideration, I am of the opinion that after the admission of new provinces and territory into the union, the expressions \"Canada\" and \"Province\" throughout the Act of 1867, must unless specially restricted by the context be necessarily given an interpretation different from that which they respectively bore before these provinces or territory were admitted, and must be taken after such admission to apply to and include these subsequently admitted provinces; and the words \"aggregate population of Canada\" in the 51st sec. of the Act held to mean the population of Canada as it is constituted under the British North America Act at each decennial census.\nMILLS J.\u2014In my opinion the subsection referred to must be held to mean the whole population of Canada according to its last decennial census. It is important, in considering this question, to ascertain whether the British North America Act, 1867, and the amendments made thereto, place the provinces which are now included within the Dominion, upon a footing of equality in respect to the representation of the people of those provinces in the House of Commons of Canada; whether each province is entitled, as nearly as may be, to representation in proportion to the population of all Canada, as it exists after the last census taken, under the authority of the Act, or whether the four provinces which constituted the Canadian confederation at the outset, are exceptionally dealt with and are entitled to have their representation under subsection 4 of section 51, remain undiminished, if the population of each province, compared with the population of the four taken together, is not diminished by one-twentieth part or upwards. In order that this question may be clearly understood, and the Act correctly construed, it is necessary to briefly refer to the constitutional discussions which took place in old Canada, now Ontario and Quebec, before the act of confederation was adopted, and out of which this provision of the British North America Act grew. When we look at the terms of the union agreed to at the conference of Quebec, between Canada and the Maritime Provinces, and which constituted the basis of the terms submitted to the Colonial Secretary and which are contained in the British North America Act, they will aid us in more clearly understanding what the framers of the Act sought to accomplish.\nThe Imperial Parliament, in the preamble of that statute, state that Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed a desire to be federally united under a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom; so that, in passing the Act, they are meeting the views of the delegates of the provinces mentioned, and they also declare that such a union would conduce to the welfare of the provinces, and promote the interests of the Empire. In this statute, the Imperial Parliament is giving effect to the wishes of the provinces mentioned, but it is well known that it was not the ministers and other prominent men of the provinces named in the Act, alone, that met in the city of Quebec in 1864 to agree upon a plan of union,\u2014to that plan prominent public men in Prince Edward Island and in Newfoundland were also parties They discussed the terms upon which the union was to be brought about; they agreed that it should be a Federal union; they agreed upon the distribution of legislative jurisdiction to be made between the Provincial Legislatures that then existed, and the Parliament of Canada, which was yet to be created; they agreed that there should be a Senate and a House of Commons in which all the provinces were to be represented; they agreed that the Federal Government should be called into existence under a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, that is, with ministers responsible to the House of Commons, and with a Parliament Supreme in the Government of the Dominion. In passing the Act, the Imperial Parliament were meeting the views of all the provinces that had taken part in settling the terms of union. In passing into law this plan of union, the Imperial Parliament sought to give effect to the wishes of the people whose representatives had taken a part in settling the terms of this instrument of Government. They agreed that the basis of representation in the House of Commons should be population, as ascertained by the official census to be taken every ten years. They agreed that the number of members for the House of Commons should be 194, distributed among the provinces whose delegates had settled the plan of union, as follows:\nUpper Canada, 82.\nLower Canada, 65.\nNova Scotia, 19.\nNew Brunswick, 15.\nNewfoundland, 8.\nPrince Edward Island, 5.\nThis was to be the representation based on the population of each province, as nearly as it could be ascertained at the time. It was further provided, until the official census of 1871 could be made up, that there should be no change in the number of representatives to be returned from the several provinces. It was also provided that the communication of the Maritime Provinces should be promoted by the general government securing without delay the completion of the Intercolonial Railway from the Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, through New Brunswick, to Truro in Nova Scotia. This was thought a work essential to the union. The delegates looked to the extension of the Dominion to the westward, so as to include ultimately the whole of British North America, and to this end they further agreed that the communications with the Northwest Territories and the improvements necessary to that end, which were also required for the development of the trade of the great west with the sea-board, were subjects of the highest importance to the Federated Provinces, and should be prosecuted at the earliest period that the state of the finances would permit. The Quebec conference was largely made up of the advisers of the Crown in the five provinces of British North America, to the eastward of the territories, and which became six provinces by the dissolution of the incorporate union between Quebec and Ontario. All the provinces of British North America, except British Columbia, were represented in the Quebec conference, and they were all that it was thought possible to embrace at once in the union. They all assisted in framing the constitution, and they agreed, without dissent, that each province after entering the union, should be represented in the House of Commons according to its population.\nQuebec was to have 65 members and the number of representatives to which each of the other provinces would be entitled could be ascertained by dividing the whole population of each by one sixty-fifth of the population of Quebec. It was agreed that the census should be taken every ten years, beginning with the year 1871, and the number of representatives mentioned, with which a province entered the union, was to continue to be the number by which it was entitled to be represented in the Commons of Canada until its population was ascertained by the taking of the census, after which a readjustment was to be effected, if this was found necessary. If the population of a province bore to the aggregate population of Canada a less proportion by one-twentieth than it did by the previous census its representation was to be diminished, but if the relative diminution was less than one-twentieth it was not thought desirable to necessitate the disturbance of its electoral districts by requiring readjustment. It was also provided that the number of members in the House of Commons might be, from time to time, increased by the Parliament of Canada provided that a proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by this Act was not thereby disturbed.\nThis plan of union marked out by the Quebec Convention and ratified by the legislatures of the several provinces was further discussed by the delegates from the various provinces that assembled in London, and since known as the London Conference, where an Act was finally prepared and introduced into the Imperial Parliament by Lord Carnarvon, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies.\nTwo of the provinces that were parties to the conference were not prepared, at once, to join the union and so the union of the remaining four provinces was proceeded with. The whole scheme was not allowed to stand over because two of the provinces that had taken part in settling the terms of the union hesitated afterwards to enter it.\nWhen we examine the terms of the British North America Act with those facts before us, we shall be better able to understand its scope and bearing, and the provisions that were made with the view of bringing into the union those parts of British North America that were not, in 1867, included.\nIn the preamble of the Act it is stated that the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed a desire to be federally united in one Dominion, under the Crown of the United Kingdom, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom,\u2014similar in principle as respects the relations of the constitutional advisers of the Crown, to the Sovereign and to Parliament. The British North America Act is largely taken up with providing a plan of government for Canada. The system of government that prevailed in each of the four provinces was continued. The only change made was in the diminution of the legislative authority of each, and in supplementing what remained of the constitution of Ontario and Quebec, so as to give to each a separate provincial organisation. The executive authority being in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, the executive government was declared; but there being no Federal Parliament, the constitution of the legislative authority in the Dominion had to be provided for. The preamble of the Act declares that it is expedient that provision be made for the eventual admission into the union of other parts of British North America. So that, although but four provinces were embraced when the British North America Act, 1867, first came into operation, it was expressly declared in the preamble that it was expedient that provisions be made for the eventual admission into the union so proclaimed of other parts of British North America. It was the declared intention that all parts should be embraced and the Act was so framed that this intention might be carried out without further Imperial legislation; and we are called upon to so interpret and construe the Act that this intention may be accomplished.\nI think, if we give full effect to the reason and spirit of the terms employed in the Act, it will not be found difficult to carry out the intentions of Parliament. In construing the British North America Act we must examine it in the light of the surrounding circumstances at the time it became law. It rests upon agreement. It is the result of compact. It is the outcome of a treaty between the provinces that were represented in the Quebec Conference in 1864, and in the London Conference at a later period. Lord Carnarvon assigned this origin as a reason, in addressing the House of Lords upon the bill, for not treating it as an ordinary bill, and for asking Parliament to accept its terms as it had come from the hands of the parties that had given it their sanction. They were representative men in self-governing provinces, that had agreed to surrender a portion of that authority which they had previously exercised to bring about a strong and durable union which was intended to embrace the whole of British North America. We must interpret the Act as a public instrument of government, so as to secure its effective operation The word Canada at the outset meant the four provinces that constituted the Dominion under the Act; since then, the intention stated in the preamble of the Act of admitting other parts of British North America into the union has been carried out, and the provisions for this purpose which the Act contains have been brought into operation. By section 22 Canada as it first existed, for the purpose of determining the representation in the Senate, consisted of three divisions, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This was the extent of its territorial limits; but section 147 provides that in case of the admission of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, \"each of them shall be represented by four Senators in the Senate of Canada.\" Prince Edward Island when admitted is to be deemed to be comprised in the division of the Maritime Provinces, but Newfoundland is not embraced in that division.\nSection 146 provides for the admission of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, Rupert's Land and the North-west Territories. These were to be brought in on such terms and conditions, in each case, as are in the addresses expressed, and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\" British Columbia and Prince Edward Island were so brought in after stating in the addresses various terms and conditions, some of which are necessary and some are surplusage, as the British North America Act assigned to the proper authority the matters referred to without any agreement.\nArticle 10 provides\nthat the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, shall, (except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to, and only affect one and not the whole of the provinces now comprising the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by this minute), be applicable to British Columbia in the same way and to like extent as they would apply to the other provinces of the Dominion and as if the Colony of British Columbia had been one of the provinces originally so united by the said Act. The Attorney-General of British Columbia v. The Attorney-General of Canada[4].\nIn the terms and conditions by which Prince Edward Island is admitted into the union, beside many other things, it is provided, article 14, that the provisions in the British North America Act, 1867, shall, except those parts thereof which are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to, and only to affect one and not the whole of the provinces now composing the Dominion, and except so far as the same may be varied by these resolutions, be applicable to Prince Edward Island in the same way, and to the same extent, as they apply to the other provinces in the Dominion, and as if the Colony of Prince Edward Island had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\nIn the case of these two provinces they were brought into the union under the power bestowed by section 146 of the British North America Act. And they are to exercise the legislative power bestowed under sections 92 and 93 of the Act, and to stand towards Canada in exactly the position they would have stood had they been originally united by the British North America Act. Can it then be said that they are not to be, after entering the union, enumerated in section 5, in section 8, in sec, 22, and in sec. 51 of the Act as if they had been included when the Act passed the Imperial Parliament? In the judgment of the Privy Council in The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada (1), their Lordships say they do not think it admits of doubt, and it was not disputed at the bar, that sec. 109 of the British North America Act must now be read as if British Columbia was one of the provinces therein enumerated. With that alteration it enacts that all lands, mines, minerals and royalties, which belong to British Columbia at the time of the union, shall for the future belong to that province and not to the Dominion. In order to construe the exceptions in that enactment which is created by the eleventh article of the union, it is necessary to ascertain what is comprehended in each of the words of the enumeration, and particularly in the word \"royalties.\"\nAnd on the previous page of the same judgment their Lordships say, in speaking of the eleventh article[5]\u2014\nIt is part of the general statutory arrangement of which the leading enactment is that on its admission to the federal union, British Columbia shall retain all the rights and interest assigned to it by the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, which govern the distribution of the provincial property and revenues between the provinces and the Dominion, the 11th article being nothing more than an exception from these provisions.\nSo upon the authority of their Lordships the name of the Province of British Columbia should be inserted in those sections in which the provinces are named, such as sections 5, 37, 51, 102, 129 and others of like character.\nIn the case of Manitoba, a difficulty was created by the manner in which it was brought into the union. The mistake was pointed out in the discussion which took place in Parliament, and is referred to in a memorandum submitted to Council by Sir John Macdonald on the 2nd of January, 1871, as Minister of Justice. In the addresses for the admission of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories into the Dominion of Canada, no provision was made for the future creation of provinces out of the territory under the authority bestowed by the British North America Act. The territory was acquired and placed under the jurisdiction of Canada, with no power for the creation of provinces out of it, without further imperial legislation. Manitoba received her constitution from Canada. Her powers of local self-government were professedly bestowed by an Act of the Canadian Parliament; so that it was a province whose powers might be enlarged, restricted or abolished by the Parliament of Canada. The relation existing between it and Canada was not federal, and so Imperial legislation was subsequently sought to validate what had been done and what might have been legally done under section 146 of the British North America Act, when the North-West Territories and Rupert's Land were being included within the Dominion of Canada. The Imperial Confederation Amendment Act of 1871 was passed to provide for the establishment of provinces out of the territories, and to secure their federal union with those already in Canada. This Act was necessary, because no provision had been made for the formation of provinces out of the territory acquired in its terms of admission.\nIt is too plain to call for discussion that the three provinces now included in the Dominion of Canada, but which were not in when the Dominion was proclaimed, stand towards Canada in exactly the same relation as the four provinces that were first embraced. They are in the union, under the authority of the imperial statute\u2014as much so as if they had been in the union from the beginning. They are entitled to be enumerated along with the four provinces wherever that enumeration is employed to indicate the number of provinces embraced in the Dominion when the confederation Act was first enacted, and as if they had then been included. It is clear that a limited and specific power is bestowed under sec. 146 upon Her Majesty to legislate upon the receipt of addresses from the houses of the provincial legislature, and the two Houses of the Parliament of Canada; and the proper exercise of that power, amends the British North America Act wherever the number of provinces is mentioned, so as to make that number correspond with the number of provinces embraced in Canada at the time after the last admission to the union is made. At the outset there were but four provinces, and but four were in consequence mentioned in the Act, wherever it became necessary to refer to the number of provinces included in the union. At the present time there are seven, and seven should be now substituted in the British North America Act for four, wherever the word four is used, and when additional provinces are admitted into the confederation, the number of provinces in the union should be correctly stated in sections 5, 8, 51, and wherever the word four may be employed in the Act, as correctly stating the number of provinces within the Dominion. It follows from the provisions made for ultimately embracing the whole of British North America into the union, that the people of the different provinces were intended to stand, in respect to their representation in Parliament, upon a footing of perfect equality, and that the provisions of the 51st section of the British North America Act were intended to apply to the population of every province that might thereafter be admitted into the union, as well as to the population of each of the four provinces that were first included. I think this is reasonably clear from the provisions made for the admission of other provinces in North America, until the whole of British North America was included within the Dominion of Canada. A fair construction of sec. 146 makes it possible to carry this avowed intention into effect on lines consistent with the provisions of the Act. The policy of uniting all British North America under the constitutional Act of 1867 certainly contemplated a confederation that, when completed, would consist of many more provinces than those originally embraced. And sec. 146 makes provision for the admission of other provinces without the necessity of further legislation by the direct act of the Imperial Parliament. As these proceedings were to be taken under the authority of the Act, and without any interference with the terms and conditions already settled, and the distribution of power already made between the Dominion and the provinces, the legislature of the province to be admitted, and the two Houses of the Dominion Parliament, were entrusted with settling the terms and conditions of admission of such province in the Dominion in each case, which, when embraced in the imperial order-in-council, were to have the same effect after Her Majesty's approval, as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom; so that the terms and conditions of that order-in-council are to be read as if they were a part of the British North America Act. This is not a strained, but an obvious construction of the Act alike called for by its letter and spirit. Were it necessary to do so, it would be our duty to make the words of the statute yield to its reason and expressed intention. In adopting this construction we are giving effect to the intention of Parliament, and following a rule necessary to carry into effect the provisions of our constitution. The courts of England have, on more than one occasion, preferred to follow the reason rather than the exact letter of the law; Fowler v. Paget[6]; Rex v. Banks[7]; The Queen v. Tolson[8]; Reg. v. Prince[9]; but in this case, in giving effect to the declared intention of Parliament, we are not required to give to the word any unnatural construction, for we have in our judgment adhered to the letter and spirit of the Act of Confederation.\nWe concur in this opinion.\n(Sd.)

N. A. Act, 1867\u2014Representation of P. E. L in House of Commons.\nThe representation of the Province of Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons of Canada is liable to be reduced below the original number of six under s. 51, s.s. 4, B. N. A. Act, 1867, after a decennial census.\nSpecial Case referred by the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration.\nThe case so referred was in the following terms: \"Extract from a report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council approved by His Excellency on the 16th May, 1903.\n\"On a memorandum dated 12th May, 1903, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that in connection with the proposed readjustment of the representation in the House of Commons of the Provinces of the Dominion consequent upon the last decennial census, the Province of Prince Edward Island contends that its representation in the House of Commons is not liable to be reduced below six, although the application of the provisions of section 51 of the British North America Act, 1867, would, in view of the census returns result in a reduction.\n\"The Minister states that he does not agree with the view advocated by the Government of Prince Edward Island and the province has asked that a reference be made to the Supreme Court of Canada for a determination of the question in difference.\n\"The Minister therefore recommends that the following question, suggested by the Government of Prince Edward Island, be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25, intituled 'An Act to amend Chapter 135 of the Revised Statutes intituled An Act respecting the Supreme and Exchequer Courts,' viz:\n\"Although the population of Prince Edward Island, as ascertained in the census of 1901, if divided by the unit of representation ascertained by dividing the number of 65 into the population of Quebec is not sufficient to give six members in the House of Commons of Canada to that province, is the representation of Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons of Canada, liable under the British North America Act, 1867, and amendments thereto and the terms of Union of 1873 under which that province entered Confederation, to be reduced below six, the number granted to that province by the said terms of Union of 1873?\n\"The Committee submit the same for approval.\n\"JOHN J. McGEE,\n\"Clerk of the Privy Council.\"\nThe following counsel appeared:\nFor the Province of Prince Edward Island: A. B. Aylesworth, K.C.; The Honourable Arthur Peters, K.C., Attorney General of Prince Edward Island, and Mr. E B. Williams.\nFor the Dominion of Canada: E. L. Newcombe, K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice for the Dominion of Canada. Aylesworth K.C.: If your Lordships please, Mr. Attorney General Peters and Mr. Williams, of Charlottetown, are also of counsel for the province in the case, and unless it is contrary entirely to your Lordships' traditions to hear more than two counsel, I have no doubt that each would be very pleased if your Lordships would allow him to address the court.\nThe Chief Justice: Of course, this is not a usual case. We do not even give a judgment; nothing but an opinion. It binds nobody, and we did hear a good many counsel on the reference the other day but of course they were representing the different provinces. You are asking now that three be heard on one side; is that it?\nMr. Aylesworth: Yes, my Lord.\nThe Chief Justice: I do not think there would be any objection to it under the circumstances of the case. We will hear the learned gentlemen.\nMr. Aylesworth: We shall endeavour to present the considerations which it appears to us affect the matter, as briefly as may be. Of course everything depends, for disposal of this question, upon the provisions of our constitution, the Act or instrument of Government, the British North America Act. Under the British North America Act, as your Lordships will be aware, there was provision made by section 146 for the subsequent admission into the union of Prince Edward Island as well as of British Columbia, Newfoundland and such portions of the territories from time to time as it might be desirable to take in. As to Prince Edward Island, the provision of the British North America Act was that upon addresses from both Houses of the Parliament of Canada and both Houses of the Provincial Legislature, the Queen might, by order-in-council, upon such terms and conditions as are expressed in the addresses, subject to the conditions of the Act, admit the province into the union. Addresses were passed by the respective legislatures and the terms and conditions of union agreed upon and incorporated in an order-incouncil, by which on the 26th of June, 1873, it was provided that Prince Edward Island should be admitted into confederation\nOur position is that, under the terms of that compact and agreement, Prince Edward Island was given six members in the House of Commons and that that representation was then fixed for the island; not as a matter of right, not as a matter of giving representation by population in accordance with the provisions of the British North America Act itself, but because of the peculiarly isolated position of the province, and because, unless there had been an arrangement of that sort it would, as the delegates to the conference from the Island stated, have been quite impossible to have carried in the Island the terms of union.\nWe have it then in the first place: That by agreement, by compact between the Dominion then an established Government on the one part and the provincial legislature of the Island on the other part, it was a term of the union that the representation of the island should be six members at least, and it was never contemplated that that number should at a future time be reduced.\nThe Chief Justice: Prince Edward Island came in, in 1873?\nMr. Aylesworth: Yes my Lord. At that time the population of the Island would not according to the unit of representation have entitled it to more than five members, but from the first it had been the position taken by those representing the island in the various conferences, that with regard to confederation five members would not satisfy and that unless a larger representation than five members could be secured it was idle to propose terms of union which it could be expected would be acceptable to the people of the Island. Your Lordships will find in the Quebec resolutions, that at that time it was proposed that Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island should join the union, and that the House of Commons should consist of 194 members of whom five should represent Prince Edward Island. Now, the debates on the resolutions in the conference at Quebec, and especially the attitude taken by the delegates of Prince Edward Island at that time, demonstrated that it was just because of that small representation which the resolutions proposed to allot to Prince Edward Island, that the Island refused at that time to enter confederation. The Island and Newfoundland not joining in confederation, the statute provided by section 37 that the House of Commons should consist of 181 members. The resolutions had contemplated 13 more or 193 members altogether; five for Prince Edward Island and eight for Newfoundland, but as those colonies were not joining in the pact of confederation the number was reduced to 181 when the Act itself came to be passed. The position taken by the representatives of the Island at that time as detailed in the debates, leading to the passage of the Quebec resolutions, demonstrates that the feature of union amongst others, that one at all events particularly, was one in regard to which the delegates felt strongly and by reason of which among other things the Island at that time was unwilling to enter confederation. It is put in that way in the most distinct manner by the different representatives of Prince Edward Island. Mr. Palmer speaking at the conference puts it this way:\n\"(a.) When a colony surrenders the right to self-government she should have something commensurate in the federation. Why give up so great certainties where we have only a feeble voice.\"\nMr. Whalen says:\n\"Our people would not be contented to give up their present benefits for the representation of five members. It may be said that confederation will go on without Prince Edward Island and that we shall eventually be forced in. Better however than that we should willingly go into confederation with that representation.\"\nColonel Grey says:\n\"The provision of five members is unsatisfactory, Prince Edward Island is divided longitudinally into three counties. We cannot divide three counties into five members.\"\nMr. Galt had proposed six members and Mr. Coles said:\n\"I approve that rather than Mr. Brown's motion because it allows us to give to our counties two members each.\"\nAnd finally on this subject Mr. Pope said:\n\"The circumstances of Prince Edward Island are such that I hope the Conference will agree to give us such a number as we can divide amongst our three constituencies. Nature as well as the original settlement of the Island has made three counties and it would give rise to much difficulty if we had to adjust five members to the three counties. I cannot ask it as a matter of right, but as one of expediency, as one without which it is impossible for us to carry the measure in Prince Edward Island.\"\nThat being put distinctly before the members of the conference at Quebec none the less the resolutions were passed, and by the seventeenth resolution the proposal was, that Prince Edward Island should have but five members if it entered confederation. Prince Edward Island declined to do so and confederation became accordingly an accomplished fact under the statute, with the representation of the other of the four combining provinces fixed by section 37 of the Act at the figures which the conference proposed. Then the authorities both in this country and in the old country continued to urge that whether Newfoundland came in or not, Prince Edward Island should at all events be admitted upon some terms. We have a notable letter from Lord Granville to the Governor General on the 4th of September 1869 (which will be found in the Journals of the Prince Edward Island House of Assembly, 1870 page 15Y in which Lord Granville urges upon the Governor-in-Council that in settling the basis of arrangement between the provincial and Dominion governments, the Dominion Government should deal with the Island;\n\"I trust that in settling the claims proposed as the basis of this arrangement the Government of the Dominion will deal liberally as well as justly with the Island.\"\nAt this stage, when it was a matter of negotiation between a great commonwealth such as the union of these provinces extending from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Pacific Ocean had made, there was on the one hand the large contracting party, the Dominion, which could afford to be generous in the matter of representation with its small sister who was considering the advisability of entering into the federal pact.\nThere had been, as your Lordships may see from the attitude taken at the Quebec Conference, just that line of division, just that very circumstance, that the representation of so few as five members out of a house of 194 was felt to be entirely inadequate; would have given to the island as a constituency so feeble a voice in the councils of the nation that there was no return offered for the manifest advantages of self that the Island would by entering confederation be giving up. The House had now by lapse of time and by the admission into confederation of the new provinces of Manitoba and of British Columbia, come to have a representation of 200 members by the statute of 1872; and there being a slightly larger representation in the whole House of Commons than there had been at the origin of confederation in 1867; there being this emergency; it was suggested from the Colonial Office that the Dominion could afford to deal generously and to deal liberally with the Island in the matter of representation. It came to be a matter of agreement between the Dominion on the one part and the Island on the other, and it was settled that there should be six representatives, and upon that footing and basis these addresses were passed by the provincial houses at Charlottetown and by the Dominion Legislature here and incorporated in the Queen's order-in-council admitting the province.\nNow according to representation by population there was no such right. If one had divided the population of Prince Edward Island as it stood in 1873 by the unit fixed in section 51 of the statute in reference to the population of Quebec, the Island would not have been entitled to six members at all; it would have been entitled to barely five; and that circumstance coupled with the fact that the province had been, from the time of the original proposal for confederation, standing for better terms, so to say, standing out for larger representation; now that the terms of union were being arranged it was stipulated on their part and agreed to by the Dominion that they should have a representation larger than their population entitled them to. That seems to us one of the very strongest circumstances as then demonstrating that the intention of both sides at the time was that Prince Edward Island should never have less than the number of six representatives.\nMr. Justice Davies: Do I understand you to say that when the Island was admitted in 1873, the population at the previous decennial census, with the addition allowed for the years between 1871 and 1873, would not have entitled them to six.\nMr. Aylesworth: Not according to the Quebec unit. As a matter of fact I think they would have scarcely five, but it would have been so near to five that if Prince Edward Island did come in upon the strict basis of representation of population they would have been awarded five only. It is recited in the resolutions clause 12:\n\"That the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by 15,000 or upwards since the year 1861, the Island shall be represented in the House of Commons of Canada by six members.\"\nThe population in 1861 had been 80,857. and in 1871 it had come up to over 95,000, the actual increase being that 15,000 as recited in the resolution. The population of Quebec in 1871 being 1,191,516 the unit of representation as fixed by that population for the decade of the seventies was 18,331, and your Lordships will see that that would not entitle Prince Edward Island with a population of even 95,000 to the representation of 6 members.\nMr. Justice Davies: The point I want to take is this\u2014making a proportionate allowance for the two years from 1871 to 1873 which of course must be estimated, would that give them the six members.\nMr. Aylesworth: I think it manifestly would not, but of course under the statute we are dealing with the decennial census and at that time in 1873 the returns of the census of 1871 were probably not finally received. If under these circumstances we find, as we do, that the resolutions called for a representation of six members in a house of 200, it seems to us that we find the strongest grounds for the confidence that it was a matter of compact and arrangement, and that it was intended to be a fixed minimum below which the representation of that province was never to fall. Your Lordships of course see the alternative. We have now as a result of nearly thirty years of confederation an increase in our population over the number when we entered the union of nearly 10,000. But, by reason of there being a much larger increase in population in the province of Quebec, although our people now number nearly 104,000, we are not according to the present unit of representation entitled to more than four members. Quebec has grown from 1,190,000 in 1871 to 1,650,000. and the unit of representation has accordingly advanced from 18,000 to 25,000. Cur 104,000 people are now entitled to a member for each 25,000 souls and that would give us four members. And as Quebec increases its population in the decades to come, Prince Edward Island, limited in area, even though it advanced at the same rate per cent that it has advanced in the past, must gradually be over taken, and it is a mere matter of arithmetic to compute how long it will be until Prince Edward Island can have no member at all, and until its population would fall below the unit of representation. The unit of representation is growing, and each decade there is an advance of 2,000 or 3,000; it was. 18,111 in 1871; it was 21,000 in 1881; it was 23,000 in 1891, and it is 25,000 now. It advances by 2,000 or more each decade, because the population in Quebec increasing as it does and its representation being fixed at 65, we have a greater number of individuals each decade to be represented by the one member. At that rate of advance, even granting to Prince Edward Island its increase in population upon the same percentage basis as in the past, with 2,000 square miles of area circumscribed as it is, by natural conditions, it is bound to be overtaken and unless there is an actual decline in the population of Quebec, in the course of three or four decades more Prince Edward Island will have been reduced to one member and finally to none at all, because their whole population will not entitle them to one member.\nNow, can such result ever have been contemplated by those who framed this statute on the terms of union between the Island and the Dominion. We think not. We think it is not a question of representation by population in that sense. There are other circumstances that are to be taken into account. The principle of representation by population is just enough as between the larger provinces; as between the different sections of the different provinces. That principle could very well be employed in such a case, but when you have a community isolated as Prince Edward Island is, you have it circumscribed and limited so that it cannot expand and grow. Its voice in the Parliament of the country will be feeble indeed unless you adopt some other principle than the strict one of representation by population in fixing its representation in the House.\nThe next step in the argument is, on our part: That there is no provision in the British North America Act for any reduction in representation unless it is in the case where there has first been an increase. Our position is that the British North America Act never contemplated Quebec, of course, having less than 65; equally it never contemplated Ontario being reduced below 82.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Why not?\nMr Aylesworth: Because section 37 of the Act provides for a Parliament of 181 members for the four provinces that were then in the union and for no less; and it would be no Parliament at all if it had, we would say, 175 members. There is no provision in the British North America Act for a reduction below 181. That never was contemplated, and no matter what the population might be, no matter what the readjustments might be, there were never to be, our submission is, less than 82 for Ontario; less than the number fixed by section 37 for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia respectively.\nBefore discussing in a little more fullness the position under this clause of the union, let me point out or emphasize the further considerations that I have already alluded to. We were, as of course any province is that enters into confederation, surrendering something of our independence of government. We were of course entering confederation necessarily subject to the provisions of this Act, as section 146 declares, and we could no I have validly stipulated\u2014even if we had so desired\u2014that after that we should have control over any of the matters mentioned in section 91 of the Act. The Island Legislature was necessarily giving up its control over these subjects of legislation. What was it getting in return? What else but a right to a voice in the passing of such laws by means of at least six representatives from the province.\nThen we have the circumstance that is adverted to and made the ground for, as it were, pressing the claim. At all events the insistence on six members by the Prince Edward Island delegates in respect to the natural and geographical subdivision of the island into three sections, is a circumstance of some importance in that connection. The British North America Act fully recognised the subdivision of the country into counties, and the representation of different sections in the Parliament of the Dominion by counties. That is the scheme of representation provided by section 40 of the statute, and the schedule to the Act annexed. We hear of three counties on the island, and these three counties were set beyond and separate, each from the other, by deep indentations into the coast line, and sea gulfs separating one of the three subdivisions from each of its fellows. It was marked out for the representation of some multiple of three.\nI cannot pretend to say that that was by any means to be a governing consideration, but that was certainly in the minds of those who were framing these resolutions as demonstrated by their remarks upon that occasion and that consideration certainly influenced the matter at the time. It is just as impossible to day as it was forty years ago to distribute proportionately five members or four members among three counties. That consideration was advanced and urged by the delegates of the island at the Quebec conference. It has been relied upon in their subsequent negotiations in regard to these matters, and it is a circumstance of importance, as it seems to us, in the consideration of the matter still.\nAs I say, there are these circumstances in the discussion of the Quebec resolutions and of the terms of union in 1873, which demonstrated the views of those who debated the terms under which the island should join the Dominion. But aside altogether from any such question, upon the nature of the terms and conditions themselves it can be readily seen that the idea of those who framed, and the idea on the part of the provincial representatives, was that for which we contend when they introduced the language of clause 12.\n\"That the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by 15,000 or upwards since the year 1861, the island shall be represented in the House of Commons of Canada by six members; the representation to be readjusted from time to time under provisions of the British North America Act, 1867.\"\nI do not know what the fact may be as to whether the census returns of 1871 had been completed at the time of the framing of this resolution; the reference to the approximate increase that the population had been increased by 15,000 or upwards, seems to indicate lack of absolute certainty as to the figure. But the reference to the figures of 1861 seems important. Why word the resolution in that way? Why preface it by that consideration? We interpret that as simply meaning this: The population of the Island is increasing, and inasmuch as it had increased by 15,000 in the last decade, inasmuch as it is an increasing thing, we will give a representation of six subject to re-adjustment.\nNow, our population at that time as I have said would have given us but five and one-eighth or barely over five members. We are then given six members because of the fact that we are of an increasing population. Then I refer further to the provisions of clause 14 of the resolution;\n\"The provisions of the British North America Act 1867 shall, except those parts that are referable to one province only-\"\nwhich does not apply here\u2014\n\"and except so far as the same may be varied by these resolutions, be applicable to Prince Edward Island.\"\nThat is possibly in view of the provisions of section 146 which authorised the Queen in council to define or to approve the terms of union expressed in the resolutions \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\" That perhaps is a provision to which if it in any way conflicted with the expressed terms of the statute no effect could be given, but treating it as a provision which is not opposed, as we hope to convince your Lordships it is not, to anything contained in the statute, it seems an additional guarantee to Prince Edward Island in this minimum representation.\nThe provisions of the British North America Act 1867, except so far as the same may be varied by these resolutions, shall be applicable to Prince Edward Island in the same way and to the same extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion and as if the Colony of Prince Edward Island had been one of the provinces originally united by the said Act.\nYour Lordships will remember the wording of section 51 of the British North America Act in its terms applies to only four provinces. The language is:\n\"The representation of the four provinces shall be re-adjusted.\"\nI do not overlook the circumstance\u2014of course I may not do so\u2014that the other day, in assigning reasons for the disposal made of the questions submitted as to the interpretation of section 51, Mr. Justice Mills, at all events, of your Lordships' bench, expressed the view that the word \"four\" ought to be read as if it were \"seven\" and that section 51 would in that view be applicable to all the provinces of the Dominion however few or many they might be from time to time.\nThe point I was seeking to make\u2014if it is open to me at all\u2014on section 51 was as I have indicated, that it does not profess to apply to any but the four provinces that were then united. That at all events is the language, and if that be a correct view of its scope, then reading it with this 14th resolution you have nothing in conflict, but you have as one of the terms of the compact of union with Prince Edward Island the stipulation that the provisions of the British North America Act, except to the extent that they are varied by this resolution, shall be applicable to Prince Edward Island. Now, one of the variations\u2014the principal one so far as one can see in the whole series of resolutions\u2014is this on the matter of representation, and that representation haying been fixed by resolution 12 we think it immediately followed as one of the articles of the treaty, that the British North America Act, except so far as it might be varied by these resolutions, was to be applicable.\nMr. Justice Girouard: The opinion of the court is that section 51 should be construed as meaning the whole population of Canada including the provinces which had been admitted into confederation subsequent to the passing of the British North America Act. Now yon are asking us to decide the very reverse.\nMr. Aylesworth: No my Lord; let me point out. The court has undoubtedly declared that under subsection 4 of section 51, the phrase \"the population of Canada\" means the population of seven or of eight or of all the provinces. But that is quite a different thing my Lord from the question I am submitting; whether the representation of any province except the original four is to determined by that rule of proportion based upon the aggregate population of the whole Dominion. Your Lordships were not asked anything in the other case by the reference, as to whether section 51 was applicable to the provinces that have joined Confederation since 1867. The court was asked merely with reference to the words \"the aggregate population of Canada\", and the court answering what was meant by \"the aggregate population of Canada\", declared that it meant the whole population of the whole Dominion, seven or eight provinces. Now, that might well be the basis of representation in each one of the four original confederating provinces and not be the basis in a specially admitted province such as Prince Edward Island.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: But the Queen's orderin-council admitting Prince Edward Island into the union provided expressly that after 1873 the subsequent representation of the province should be readjusted according to section 51.\nMr. Aylesworth: No my Lord. The only thing we have in that regard is in resolution 12 which I have referred to; that the population having been increased by 15,000 since 1861 the Island should be represented in the House of Commons of Canada by six members, the representation to be re-adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: The opinion of this court on the former reference says that these four provinces are in the same position as others coming in afterwards.\nMr. Aylesworth: No; all that this judgment says\u2014at least the only answer that goes formally from the court is that as far as re-adjustment is necessary under 51 you must take the population of the whole Dominion as the basis.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Is it not the same thing?\nMr. Aylesworth: I do not think so. If your Lordship had the clause before you, you would see what I am contending for. By section 51 it is provided that after each decennial census the representation of the four provinces shall be re-adjusted. These four provinces were of course the two Canadas, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The representation of these four is to be re-adjusted in the following manner: Quebec shall have a fixed number of 65. There shall be assigned to each of the others\u2014I read that, each of the other three\u2014such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to the number of its population as the number 65 bears to the population of Quebec. That will provide a house of say 185 members. Then there is no change as to the remainder of the House. Of course that is unfair representation to Quebec I grant. It is equally unfair representation to Ontario, and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but while it is so it is comparatively a little thing; it is over-representation at most to the extent of two or three or four members, a trifle in the whole; a large thing to the small province, but a thing of small consequence to the other members of confederation.\nUpon the terms of our union there is just a further reference I wish to make. By clause 6 your Lordships will find the provision for paying annual subsidies to the island:\n\"In consideration of the transfer to the Parliament of Canada of the powers of taxation, the following sums shall be paid yearly by Canada to Prince Edward Island for the support of its Government and Legislature; that is to say: $30,000 and an annual grant equal to 80 cents per head of its population as shown by the census returns of 1871, namely, 94,021; both, by half yearly payments in advance. Such grant of 80 cts. per head to be augmented in proportion to the increase in population of the Island as may be shown by each subsequent decennial census until the population mounts to 400,000, at which rate the grant shall hereafter remain, it being understood that the next census shall be taken in the year 1881.\"\nThat recites that the population is now 94,021 and provides that 80 cts per head of that population shall be paid it annually, and then that that grant of 80 cts. per head shall be augmented in proportion to the increase of the population of the Island as may be shown by each decennial census. Now, it happened that the population of the Island increased from 94,000 in 1871 to 108,000 in 1881; increased again to 109,000 in 1891 and fell off in 1901. That is to say, it was larger in 1891 than in any other period since the Island entered into the union. Does this grant of 80 cts per head fall off? No. The provision is that this grant of 80 cts. per head shall be augmented in proportion to the increase of the population of the Island, and having once gone up to 80 cts. on 109,000 it never comes down no matter how much the population of the island falls off decade after decade.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Is not that against you on the rules of construction?\nMr. Aylesworth: Because it is expressed in the one clause and not in the other? I do not think so, I am not going to argue that there is anything in the British North America Act itself inconsistent with the contention that we are putting forth, but rather the reverse. There is on the face of these resolutions what constitutes the terms of our union with the Dominion, a clear expression in clause 6 which I read, that decrease in the population was not to affect our rights in that regard. As a matter of fact the authorities of the Dominion acquiesced in this interpretation of that clause.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: There is nothing in the British North America Act to prevent the original four provinces from giving any amount of subsidy to British Columbia or Newfoundland or Prince Edward Island.\nMr. Aylesworth: Certainly, and clearly there is nothing in the British North America Act to prevent them from giving undue representation to any of the outlying district\u2014I mean representation greater than the population would warrant.\nMr. Justice Davies: There is nothing to prevent you granting it when the province comes in, but is there not everything to prevent excepting that province from the readjustment which applies to the whole?\nMr. Aylesworth: Of course that is the point I am arguing. Let me ask your Lordships to permit a brief reference to Gray's Book on the History of Confederation page 58., upon this very question of whether representation by population was the governing principle of the statute. He says:\n\"Thus at the first inception on entering into the union, population was not intended to be held as the only rule for representation. Though taken as a guide the apportionment must be more or less arbitrary. Existing arrangements, territorial and other considerations must be taken into account, and modifications to suit circumstances necessarily made; but, after entering the union, future changes of the entire representation were to be governed by that principle. Such seemed to be the views on this subject. The principle itself was affirmed simply and explicitly in the 17th resolution in the conference at Quebec; but in the constitution as subsequently settled at Westminster and enacted by the British North America Act, 1867, while the re-adjustment made by the Quebec resolution is adhered to, the principle explicitly laid down 'that the basis of representation in the House of Commons shall be by population,' is not re-declared. So marked a distinction, it must be presumed, was intentional to remove any doubt that the confederation of the four provinces then formed should have free scope for terms that might be necessary thereafter to bring in other portions of British North America.\"\nThat is exactly the principle upon which we submit the Dominion, under the invitation or at the suggestion of the Home authorities, acted in regard to the admission of Prince Edward Island. They were invited to be generous and to deal liberally with their small sister. They did so and it would be a most illusory thing if granting that in the terms of the original compact, they are entitled to take it away at the expiration, it might be, of a couple of years. Mr. Justice Davies: Where would be the distinction from the illusory standpoint in Prince Edward Island losing a member under the terms it came in on and New Brunswick losing a member under the terms it came on.\nMr. Aylesworth: I have to say\u2014unless I am precluded from saying it by your Lordships' view as expressed the other day\u2014that my admission of the true construction of section 37 is that Nova Scotia could never have less than 19.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: What do you make out of the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" in section 51?\nMr. Aylesworth: My interpretation of section 51 is this: Wherever you increase above the original representation as fixed by section 37, you may re-adjust that increase by wiping it out altogether, but there is no provision in the statute from start to finish for a house of less than 181 members. Would it be any Parliament at all with 160 members under the British North America Act? By section 52 there is a careful provision that the number may be increased. There is no provision that it may be decreased and surely one may say that a provision for decrease would be more necessary than one for increase. No matter how much you increase you still have at least 181 members and one would have thought no express provision for increase would be necessary. But in abundance of caution, by section 52 it is provided that you may increase. Surely the inference is the strongest that you should not cut down; you may not make a house smaller than the minimum fixed by the Act itself in section 37. If then you have a minimum house of 181 for the four original provinces, upon the basis of proportion you cannot cut any one of these four provinces below the numbers fixed by the statute. Mr. Justice Nesbitt: Suppose one of the provinces by constant influx of population or the growth of manufacture should become very populous. Take Nova Scotia; it cannot go below 19 but it can go to 70.\nMr. Aylesworth: Yes, and so increasing in population that increase beyond 19 might be re-adjusted and according to the terms of the statute might to up and down. It may be that the position was not contemplated of a province ever falling below the figures fixed by the original compact, by the statute. It may be that was not thought of, but however that may be there is certainly no provision for it here and the absence of such a provision is very marked, in the presence of such a very careful provision for increase.\nMr. Justice Davies: There is no provision if we give to the word \"re-adjustment\" the limited meaning you suggest. But giving it the ordinary meaning which it bears in the English language there is a provision for reduction. I do not quite catch the meaning of your argument or the full force of it on section 37. The statute does not say arbitrarily there shall be 181 members of Parliament, but \"subject to the provisions of the Act\" evidently contemplating the possibility of less.\nMr. Aylesworth: But what are the provisions of the Act in that regard? Section 52 provides for increase not decrease. Does section 51 provide for any decrease of the aggregate? Not that I am able to see.\nMr. Justice Davies: It provides for the operation of the rule, the result of which may be a decrease.\nMr. Aylesworth: To re-adjust; not to decrease.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: If you re-adjust an account between two merchants that means that you have to add to one and subtract from another. Re-adjustment must be capable of only one meaning. Mr. Aylesworth: Let me ask your Lordships to look at at it as I have just been putting it. We have three sections defining the number of members in the House of Commons of Canada; sections 37, 51 and 52. Section 37 gives us a certain number to start with, namely 181 members, and the House of Commons shall consist of that number subject to the provisions of the Act. That must mean subject to these other two clauses; subject to 51 and 52. Now 52 says that the number of 181 may be increased. Then under sections 37 and 52 together, the number shall be 181 or more, and that number is to be readjusted by section 51.\nLet me take it piece by piece. If we have a given number of 181 you could readjust 181 by subsection 4 in any different way you please from the particular way stated in section 37. You have the fixed number of 181, and you could readjust that among the four constituents which make up the 181. Similarly you could re-adjust 194 or you could re-adjust 213 or any number you like. Now there is not a hint anywhere in the statute as to reducing the aggregate membership of the House of Commons.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: \"Subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Aylesworth: Which is not a reduction of the whole.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Why not?\nMr. Aylesworth: Because by section 51 subsection 4 it is a re-adjustment not a reduction; it is a re-adjustment by reducing one province and increasing another province. You have a fixed number.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Section 52 will allow the Dominion Parliament giving Quebec 100 members, so that instead of dividing the population of Quebec by 65 you will divide it by 100 and then re-adjust the representation of the other provinces accordingly. Mr. Aylesworth: That may be what is contemplated by section 52, though I would not have thought so, and I have considered that possibility. I thought that section 52 meant simply this: That from time to time as re-adjustment demanded an increase above 181, which section 37 had fixed as the minimum, that increase could be given to the whole membership of the House of Commons, but that increased membership must proceed according to the provisions of section 51. Now if there had been in clause 52 any provisions for decreasing, if it had said the number may from time to time be increased or diminished preserving the proportion, the argument I am now presenting would have no place; but when you have by section 37 such a careful provision for 181 members distributed among the provinces there mentioned, it seems to me that the intention of the framers of the statute was a minimum House of Commons of 181, increasing as section 51 calls for increase from time to time, but never going below these figures.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: That would be if it were not subject to the provisions of this Act\nMr. Aylesworth: This much is certain, that unless that construction is the true one, our province is liable to be deprived absolutely of its representation and that never could have been contemplated.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: The word \"re-adjust\" seems to be wide enough as we find it in the dictionary.\nMr. Aylesworth: No doubt, but I read \"readjust\" in section 51 in the light of 37 and 52. Your Lordships will observe in section 51 that while there is the provision by subsection 2 of assigning to each of the other provinces a number proportionate to the representation of Quebec,\u2014that is the phrase,\u2014there is in subsection 3 the provision that one-half of the unit is to count as a whole, and that less than one-half is to be ignored, and by subsection 4 there is a provision preventing reduction of any province unless the falling off in the population is one twentieth of the whole. But that is the whole scope of that section. There is nothing in clause 2, which is the only section that deals with the aggregate membership, indicating a reduction in the whole number. There is re-adjustment by assigning to each of the other provinces a proportionate number of the whole whatever that whole may be. Where then do you find any idea of reducing? You can reduce a province but it does not follow that you will reduce the whole below the original number.\"\nI have just one or two considerations to urge looking at the matter from the standpoint of the opposite party to the compact or arrangement under which we came in. Certainly the view of the representatives of the island is abundantly manifested by the course they have taken and by the language they have used. Is it not equally clear that the same view obtained on the other side? We have in the first place the circumstance that nine years after the admission of the island into the union the re-adjustment of 1.882 took place, and at that time upon the unit of population or the representation as it then stood, the Island would have been entitled to only five and one-fifth members; slightly greater than it had been entitled to at the time of its entrance into the union which was barely five and one-eighth, it being five and one-fifth in 1882. There was no reduction from six to five in 1882.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: That could not be. A decennial census must occur twice before you could make a reduction.\nMr. Aylesworth: That is of course if subsection 4 has application. But if that clause had application, as certainly its words state, to the four provinces, it would have to, and did not, touch the representation of Prince Edward Island in 1882. At all events, the figures of the census in 1882 show as I said that Prince Edward Island was then entitled only to one-fifth over the five members. Its representation remained unaltered. We point to that circumstance as one of significance, and it seems to have peculiar significance in this that at that time the first Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, was the very statesman who had presided in the conference in 1873 under which the terms of the admission of the island had been settled. He must have been distinctly aware of what the intention was under which these resolutions had been framed, and if we find no alteration made in the representation of Prince Edward Island although the falling off in population or the variation of population would have called for it\u2014if we find no variation made in the representation of the island until after Sir John A. Macdonald's death, it certainly seems a circumstance indicating the understanding of the terms upon which the Island was admitted into confederation.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Did not a reduction take place in 1891?\nMr. Aylesworth: Not until after the death of Sir John A. Macdonald. He died in June, 1891, and the redistribution was by statute 55 & 56 Vic. in 1892.\nMr. Justice Davies: The census returns could not have been in to enable the re-adjustment to be made before Sir John A. Macdonald died.\nMr. Aylesworth: Certainly not, but in the re-adjustment of 1882 the Island is certainly untouched. There is a still further consideration upon the statute that I present in the same regard. By section 147 of the statute the representation of Prince Edward Island, in case it is admitted, in the Senate of Canada shall be four members. Prince Edward Island when admitted shall be deemed to be comprised in the third of the three divisions into which Canada is divided in relation to the constitution of the Senate provided by this Act, and accordingly after the admission of Prince Edward Island (whether Newfoundland is admitted or not) the representation of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the Senate shall if vacancies occur be reduced from 12 to 10 members respectively, and the representation of each of these provinces shall not be increased at any time beyond ten except under the provisions of this Act for the appointment of six additional senators under the direction of the Queen. It is quite evident that there is going to be no reduction in the Senate representation. We have the statute saying so and saying so plainly. The constitution of the House of Commons was fully as important as the constitution of the Senate. We have an express enactment as to the circumstances under which the representation of the Senate may be diminished as well as may be increased. We have provision for increase in the House of Commons under section 52; none for decrease. But with regard to Prince Edward Island, my point is this. You find four senators defined as the representation of the Island in the Senate. That is a fixed number. Now then from first to last the scheme of the British North America Act is that the representation of each and every province in the Commons shall be somewhat in excess of its representation in the Senate. That is so as to Quebec, so as to Ontario, so as to each and every province. Would it not be a most anomalous thing; could it ever have been in the contemplation of the framers of this Act that the day should come when Prince Edward Island should have four senators and only one member in the House of Commons.\nMr. Peters: Or none at all. Mr. Aylesworth: Or none at all. We must not forget that the day is within sight when Prince Edward Island may only have one member or no member unless our contention prevails or the British North America Act is amended.\nWe have a limited area and we cannot increase as the other provinces. Then we submit that upon the construction of the British North America Act which I have endeavoured to argue, that section 51 in terms applies only to the four provinces so far as the readjustment is concerned. That, as I have pointed out, does not conflict with the decision of this court the other day, and full effect may be given to all the answers made by the court to the questions submitted by the Government by giving to the words in subsection 4 the meaning which the court assigned to them without in the least militating against the argument I present that section 51 applies only to the four provinces so far as representation is concerned, and that we in Prince Edward Island are not governed by section 51 at all, but on the other hand are governed by the stipulation of the terms on which we entered into the union. But if I am wrong in that, even though section 51 applies to Prince Edward Island as well as to the other provinces, full effect can be given to this provision as to readjustment by reading that in the way I have submitted, that it is applicable to any increase that may ever be awarded to any particular province. We submit that as a true interpretation of section 51. We read it in the light of sections 52 and 37. One other consideration, and I have presented all that I am able to. I call your lordships' attention to the statute 61 Vic, ch. 3 with respect to the boundaries of the province of Quebec, in which it is declared that the northern and north western and north eastern boundaries are thereby declared to be the following, and there is a description of these boundaries. While that statute takes the place of a declaratory enactment its preamble recites the power to pass it under the British North America Act of 1871; under that statute power was conferred upon the Parliament of Canada from time to time with the consent of any legislature of any province to increase, diminish or otherwise alter the limits of such province. Now then, there being power under the British North America Act, 1871, to increase, diminish or otherwise alter these limits, there certainly was no diminution of the territorial area of Quebec under this statute. It must have been and it necessarily was as we submit an increase. It was not any mere definition of boundaries but it was the fixing of the territorial area of the province within the ['limits prescribed by that statute, and its effect was to increase the territorial area of Quebec which had been in 1864 at the time of the Quebec resolutions, understood to be an area of some 118,000 square miles of territory. There is in that area room for a most enormous extension of population within the provincial limits of Quebec. What is the effect upon the small members of the confederation if you fix as the British North America Act does the Parliamentary representation of Quebec at 65, and double, treble, quadruple or multiply its present population. At once the unit of representation goes up correspondingly, and at once the representation of the province consisting of perhaps 100,000 population goes down. Is not that a variation in the condition of things existing at the time we entered into confederation in 1873; a variation of such character as to emphasize the argument we present; that the minimum representation was intended to be fixed on our request, naming six as the number of members from the Island. Unless you have such a fixed minimum representation for the smaller provinces, they are necessarily face to face with the situation I have described. Ontario has its fertile belt known to exist and about to be penetrated by a railway in contemplation to connect the city of Quebec with the Pacific. Look at the influx of population that is all but certain to follow the building of another transcontinental road through these fertile lands. If there were room for all the other provinces to extend the case would not be so bad, but there is no room for Prince Edward Island, and if the Province of Quebec is going to grow and quadruple its population, the unit of representation would be enlarged and you would destroy at a stroke the representation of the small province. Unless the construction of the statute which I am contending for obtained and unless you hold that there is by section 37 implied, in the absence of any provision for decrease, a fixed minimum for the provinces that entered confederation originally, or that have come in on some compact of union since, you have to face the difficulty which we present, and which in the case of Prince Edward Island has come to be a very real grievance, for there is a very imminent prospect of that province losing altogether her representation in the House of Commons.\nPeters K.C., Prime Minister and Attorney General of Prince Edward Island:\u2014May it please your Lordships. The very able argument made by my colleague) Mr. Aylesworth, leaves very little for me to say; but still there are one or two points that strike me as being of some importance in connection with the case and to which I shall refer briefly. Your Lordships will doubtless recognize the vital importance of this question to the Province of Prince Edward Island. As Mr. Aylesworth has well put it: If the Province of Quebec increases, as it is likely to increase, the day may come and the day may not be far distant, when we shall have no representation at all from Prince Edward Island in the Canadian House of Commons. That is a condition of things we have to guard against. At the very outset I submit most humbly to your Lordships, that so far as your Lordships' judgment of the other day is concerned, as to whether \"Canada\" meant the whole of Canada or only \"old Canada\", with that judgment I entirely agree. I have not a word to say against that judgment. I do not think that that judgment touches at all the question that your Lordships have now before you. The question which we have taken some trouble to get before your Lordships, and which your Lordships have to decide here, is whether or not at the time we entered confederation we entered on terms which entitled us to a representation of not less than six members in the House of Commons. I ask your Lordships to carefully consider the correspondence and the entries in the Journals of the House bearing on this subject. I submit most strongly that old Canada\u2014that is Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, went into confederation under the British North America Act alone; they walked in under that Act in a body. The Province of Prince Edward Island refused to come under that Act. We refused time and again to be bound by that Act. Our delegates went to Quebec and they repeatedly refused to agree to confederation on the terms of this Act, and finally they had to make an alteration in the resolutions before we did come in. Take the resolutions that Mr. Aylesworth has so ably placed before you, and I submit that Prince Edward Island entered confederation not on the same basis as Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. We entered on terms that are actually provided for and which are special to ourselves and I say that if these terms have a reasonable construction given to them as a matter of contract, then the contention of Prince Edward Island before this court will be sustained by your Lordships.\nMr. Justice Davies: The difficulty is section 146 which provides for the island entering into confederation on terms and it explicitly says that such terms must be \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Peters: And what do these words mean in that section. That section only applies to new provinces, and I say that when your construe \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" in that section it means subject to the provisions of the Act with regard to the matter they are talking about. It does not mean with regard to four senators, which section 117, the section immediately succeeding, expressly provides for. If your Lordship will look at the authorities on the construction of statutes you will find that \"subject to the provisions of this Act,\" when found in a section like that, mean subject to the matter you are talking about.\nMr. Justice Davies: Would your contention go to the extent of saying that you could have made terms of union inconsistent with the general provisions of the British North America Act?\nMr. Peters: No my Lord, I will not go to that extent, but I say we have the right and we exercise that right when it is not inconsistent with the British North America Act. The provisions of the different sections of the British North America Act can be reconciled with what we did. For instance British Columbia came in under express terms and she had so many members given to her for all time to come. Why should not we do the same thing? I am not going to weary the court by repeating the argument of Mr. Aylesworth. The whole point is that the terms of the contract or the agreement or whatever you like to call it show that we went into confederation on specific terms. If your Lordships should hold that this was ultra vires, then I ask your Lordships; Of what was it ultra vires?\nMr. Justice Davies: Which is the section which you say expressly gives you this right because it would appear from the terms that you came in and expressly assented to the re-adjustment under the Act. So it goes back to the question Mr. Aylesworth argued; what is the meaning of the clause which provides for re-adjustment.\nMr. Peters: What is the meaning of the word \"re-adjustment\"? I am glad your Lordship called my attention to that. I say that when these four provinces were formed into a confederation, Canada framed a constitution, just as the Chief Justice said the United States framed a constitution. Canada framed a constitution and section 37 of that constitution says that the House of Commons shall contain 181 members and when the constitution said that they were talking about the four provinces only. Then they had to make some arrangement for getting in the other provinces if these provinces wanted to come in, and so they sat down and very wisely, or unwisely, they said: We will arrange this: We will give Ontario 82 members, we will give Quebec so many, we will give Nova Scotia so many, and we will give New Brunswick so many. That was the original formation of the constitution if you like to call it that. They afterwards said they would give Prince Edward Island six members. I say my Lords that if you are going to upset that constitution; if you give a decision by which the 181 members which formed the original constitution of Canada can be decreased; then it is striking very hard at the constitution of Canada.\nThen the framers of the constitution said: Now we have these four provinces agreeing to come in under these terms but Prince Edward Island and the others will not come in under these terms but if they do want to come in we will make a regulation by which they can come in; we will give them a certain representation. We will divide the population of Quebec by 65 so that we will get a unit of representation and fix the representation of these provinces. But Prince Edward Island refused to accept that and we said: We want you to give us a fixed representation just as you have given British Columbia. After fighting the matter out for a number of years, the Government of Canada as it then was thought fit to give us a fixed number of members as they had power to do and they made that contract with us and we entered confederation on the understanding that we would have six members and no less.\nNow my Lords, I have read your Lordships' judgment very carefully. As I said I have nothing to find fault with in that judgment except for one statement made by Mr. Justice Armour who said that it might happen that the population of our province would disappear altogether.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Mr. Justice Armour did not write the judgment.\nMr. Peters: It was a statement made in the course of the argument. Mr. Justice Armour said: \"Suppose the population of the province should disappear altogether and nobody was left there; would you contend that Prince Edward Island should still have its full representation?\" And Mr. Pugsley said: \"Certainly my lord.\" And you can put the converse of that supposition. Quebec has increased its territory by 118,000 miles and suppose the population of that province should increase to a large extent then it might turn out that the unit of representation would be such that Prince Edward Island should have no representation at all. We might have in Prince Edward Island a population of 200,000 in one of the most fertile provinces of the whole Dominion, but the population of Quebec might so increase that we would have no representation at all from Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons. That is what might come about if the contention of the Attorney General for Canada is upheld. I want your Lordships to take that into consideration. We entered confederation on the term that we should have six members and no less. Is it not fair that that understanding should be maintained. We are an island completely surrounded by water; we cannot increase as the other provinces of Canada can increase. That was all taken into consideration at the time we entered confederation. The framers of the constitution said: We are dealing with a province that cannot increase its population; cannot grow larger, and so we will give it special terms.\nNow my Lords before I close, I would like to very strongly impress upon your Lordships what we deem to be the true intent of the arrangement that was made between the province of Prince Edward Island and Canada. I have no doubt at all that if your Lordships will take the trouble to read the Journals of the House of Commons and the debates in our own Local House you will find that we absolutely refused to come in to confederation at all unless we had a fair representation in the House of Commons.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Did not you change your mind.\nMr. Peters: We changed our mind because we got six members as we wanted.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Subject to re-adjustment.\nMr. Peters: Yes, if we ever got to having ten members we might be re-adjusted down; but we were never to have less than six. That is our contention. Mr. Justice Nesbitt: Suppose your population ran up to 400,000.\nMr. Peters: Will you show me one provision in; the British North America Act or in our terms of confederation by which we were to be subject to a decrease below six members.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Section 37 read in connection with the other clauses looks very like it.\nMr. Peters: No my Lord, section 37 does not hold that.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: It depends on what you mean by \"subject to the provisions of this Act,\" and what provisions of the Act govern.\nMr. Peters: But have you not to take that with the other provisions that went before when they formed this compact and got us to come into confederation and said: We will give you so many members, and then they said \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\" Subject to what provisions? Is it subject to the next section which provides for four senators?\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: If you look at section 22 the same argument would apply to that. Section 22 provides for a fixed number of senators in Nova Scotia, and yet Nova Scotia may under subsections 2 and 4 of section 51 be reduced below the fixed number of members.\nMr. Aylesworth: We think not below the number mentioned in section 37.\nMr. Peters: We believe we cannot go below the number of six.\nMr. Justice Girouard: Your argument is that you cannot get the aggregate under 181, but you admit you could get one province below.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Probably they never contemplated a reduction below six.\nMr. Peters: We certainly never did. Mr. E. Bayfield Williams follows: My Lords, there are just a few observations I have to make with reference to some matters that seem to me to have been but slightly touched upon by my learned friends Mr. Aylesworth and the Attorney General, and which when touched upon did not seem to impress your Lordships in the way we think they might. These matters may be looked at, to my mind, in at least a little different way or at all events in a way that would make them more clear. Before starting into these matters of fact I would like to call your Lordships' attention to what we are really here for. We are here to-day construing the constitution of the Province of Prince Edward Island for all time to come as part of the confederation, and in construing the constitution of the Province of Prince Edward Island under the British North America Act and the terms of union we are really construing the constitution of the whole Confederation with reference to certain points. It is laid down by Lefroy and in all books on Constitutional Law:\n\"That the constitution above all things is to be construed in a liberal manner and in such a manner as will give perfect harmony to all sections at the time the question arose.\"\nI submit my Lords that as a matter of fact your Lordships might have given a construction to the constitution in 1867, and if it were possible to admit of two constructions you might in justice construe it differently to day. It is laid down as Lefroy put it:\n\"That special restrictions which at present might seem salutary might in the end prove the overthrow of the system itself.\"\nWe are coming to the time when the restrictions, if such there were\u2014and I claim there were none in the British North America Act\u2014if applied to our province would, in the words I quote, prove the overthrow of the system itself. We have now after 20 years experience of confederation arrived at such a state as to make it possible that in a comparatively short time, although we are recognized as a distinct province of the confederation; given the machinery of a province with all the responsibilities of section 92 of the British North America Act upon us and with other responsibilities given by our own terms in addition to section 92; we have now arrived at a stage when it can be foreseen that we will have no representation in the popular chamber of the House of Commons. To my mind that would be an absurdity that could never have been intended when we entered confederation. When the constitution of Canada was framed it was not framed for a day. Mr. Justice Sedgewick said: \"Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof\" I submit my Lords that that evil day has come so far as the Province of Prince Edward Island is concerned. In dealing with the constitution I claim above all things that the constitution, whether it be a statute or whether it be in the nature of the English constitution, must be dealt with so as to give it a construction that will last for all time to come and such as would have been intended when it was made to last for all time to come. The construction that your Lordships seem to suggest with reference to the constitution of Canada will not last for all time to come because if what are now normal conditions should prevail for the next 50 years, then Prince Edward Island will have no representation in the House of Commons at all, and that my Lords cannot last. I submit also to your lordships that in Clements, Canadian Constitution, and every other constitutional authority you will find the construction advocated which I am contending for. I want to impress upon your Lordships that the constitution must be construed so that there will be no absurdity in it and I submit that the construction we are putting upon the different sections of the Act is the only construction that will not lead to absurdity.\nLefroy page 469; numbers 38 and following:\n\"The constitution is entitled to a construction as nearly as may be in accordance with the intent of its makers.\"\nThe Chief Justice: That is different from our British North America Act, which is a statute.\nMr. Williams: But at the same time it is a constitution.\nThe Chief Justice: You cannot read it as you would the constitution of the United States.\nMr. Williams: That is true my Lord but to a certain extent we combined the benefits of it with the benefits of the British constitution.\nThe Chief Justice: The Privy Council has alluded to that.\nMr. Williams: The Privy Council did allude to it, I think even in The Fisheries Case[1].\nI claim that although the British North America Act is a statute and an imperial statute it is also a treaty with us Notwithstanding that the British North America Act is a statute, it is at the same time a constitution and should not be construed according to Maxwell on Statutes, but with regard to the construction of constitutions in a broad and liberal view which will last for ever.\nThe Chief Justice: It seems to me the question is plain. Section 146 says that you must read this Resolution 12 as if the British Parliament had passed an Act and had said in so many words: Prince Edward Island shall have six members subject to readjustment according to the British North America Act. If the British Parliament had passed an Act of that kind how should we interpret it.\nMr. Williams: We should interpret that as a constitutional Act.\nThe Chief Justice: As if it were a new Act passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1873, saying among other things: Prince Edward Island shall come in but they shall have six members subject to re-adjustment as provided for in the other provinces by the British North America Act.\nMr. Williams: That is perfectly correct and I am leaving that point to ask what does readjusted mean in the light of what I have said.\nThe Chief Justice: It might be that it was the impression of Prince Edward Island at the time, in the minds of the public men when they consented to this, that they did not expect a decrease, but that is not a consideration in the interpretation of a clear Act of Parliament.\nMr. Williams: It is not entirely an impression. If we can give you the express wording of the Act to show what was the meaning of it in the minds of the Conference.\nThe Chief Justice: The framers of the Act may have intended a different meaning from the mind of the British Parliament.\nMr. Williams: The framers of the Act might have a different mind from the wording of the law?\nThe Chief Justice: We must take the Act as it reads. The history that preceded the confederation Act may be more or less enquired into for the interpretation of the constitution. That I believe has been decided in the Privy Council. Mr. Justice Mills did it the other day in giving the opinion of the court in the last reference.\nMr. Williams: He did. The Chief Justice: Rather more extensively than I would have done it myself; however it seems to have been admitted. Though you cannot refer to debates in Parliament it seems to have been admitted that you can refer to the history of the times not only for the interpretation of the constitution but for the interpretation of any Act.\nMr. Williams: And more so for the interpretation of the constitution.\nThe Chief Justice: The same thing\u2014study of the state of the law as it was before and all that kind of thing.\nMr. Williams: Yes my Lord. I would like to mention a word in connection with the observation made by Mr. Justice Davies as to why we were reduced in 1882. Mr. Justice Davies supposed that in 1882 we could not have been re-adjusted because we had had no previous decennial census.\nThe Chief Justice: Of the Dominion. Mr. Williams: Yes my Lord. If that is a construction that must carry with reference to 1882 then section 51 says that there shall be a re-adjustment in 1871 and that re-adjustment would not be possible because there was no previous census on which to make that re-adjustment.\nMr. Justice Davies: The standard to enable you to make a re-adjustment did not exist; it could not exist until there was a decennial census.\nMr. Williams: In 1871 there was not a decennial census, but still they did re-adjust.\nMr. Justice Davies: They re-adjusted of course so far as it was possible to re-adjust.\nMr. Williams: Subsection 4 is the only section in the whole Act relating to reduction either in positive or negative terms but it could not apply in 1871 because there had been no last preceding re-adjustment of the number of members and consequently that must be read out of section 51.\nThe Chief Justice: I do not see how it affects the question at all.\nMr. Williams: I will show in one moment. That section relating to reduction not having applied to any province in 1871, it was not part of section 51 in 1871, but in 1871 there had to be readjustment. I am confining that argument to a great extent to what Mr. Aylesworth spoke of namely that the aggregate House of Commons shall be 181 members and I am giving a meaning to the word \"re-adjusted\" in the light of the fact that in 1871 the reduction clause did not apply. In 1871, the reduction clause not having applied there must be a re-adjustment and there could not possibly be a re-adjustment of the number of members in the way of reduction without reducing the number below 181. Therefore if our contention is correct that the number of 181 cannot be reduced then the word \"re-adjusted\" did not mean reduction in 1871. It meant re-adjustment upon the number given in section 37 and if it meant that in 1871 it must mean the same thing now. Now, section 37 \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" refers to the House of Commons, that is the aggregate House of Commons. The only other section that refers to the House of Commons is section 52 and as my learned friend says the constitution of Canada is 181 members plus or otherwise there is no meaning to that section. Why is it so? They could be increased by subsection 2, according to the contention that your Lordships seem to put forward, and they could be increased by section 146. But the wisdom of the framers of the constitution seemed to point to the fact that they wanted a specific clause saying that you could be increased\u2014they were just as much in need of a clause saying they should be decreased because subsection 2 refers to increase and decrease.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: Do you find anything throwing light on your argument in the introduction by the Imperial Parliament of section 37?\nMr. Williams: I have little to assist me in that as to the meaning of \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: I mean as to the fixing of the number of members.\nMr. Williams: I have nothing except the opinion given by members of the bar.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: But as to the introduction of the British North America Act in the Imperial Parliament.\nMr. Williams: There is absolutely nothing. I went over that and there is nothing except one speech of Lord Carnarvon and that did not go to the merits or demerits of the Act at all but only the great possibilities that would result from it.\nMr. Justice Davies: It is explained by Lord Carnarvon that the Imperial Parliament should not make any material alteration\u2014not even to the dotting of an \"i\" or the crossing of a \"t\".\nMr. Williams: I would draw attention to the fact, which Mr. Justice Davies' remark has brought out, and it is that the Quebec resolutions are materially changed by the British North America Act in this very matter. The Chief Justice: Certainly.\nMr. Williams: And as against the conclusion of representation by population.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: If you read the Memoirs of one Mr. Vansittart you will find what an important thing representation by population was before you were born. Mr. Williams: Well my Lord I will read Vansittart for your Lordship. I have his Memoirs open before me and here is what he says:\n\"On the 19th, Mr. Brown at length had the proud satisfaction of moving a resolution which carried into effect the principle of representation by population which he had been fighting for in Upper Canada for fifteen years or more. The resolution provided, that the basis of representation in the House of Commons shall be population, as determined by the official census every ten years, and that the number of members at first shall be two hundred, distributed as follows: Upper Canada, eighty nine; Lower Canada, sixty five; Nova Scotia, nineteen\"; New Brunswick, fifteen; Newfoundland, seven; Prince Edward Island, five; and that for the purpose of re-adjustments Lower Canada shall be the unit of population, with sixty five members. This resolution was vigorously opposed by the Prince Edward Island delegates, who said their province would not go into confederation if this motion was concurred in as it would have no status whatever. Other members pointed out that it had been well understood at Charlottetown that the principle of representation in the popular chamber should be representation by population, and it was idle to raise the question now. The resolution carried, all concurring except Prince Edward Island. Next day the subject was again informally discussed, but the view of the Prince Edward Island delegates was that this clause would preclude their province from joining the union.\"\nThat is Vansittart my lord. I want to refer particularly to what Mr. Justice Nesbitt said with reference to \"subject to the provisions of this Act I claim that when you say in any Act subject to the provisions of this Act, you mean subject to such provisions of the Act as relate to the very same subject matter. The reference in section 37 is to the House of Commons as an aggregate and to nothing else. That is in the first part. There is only one other clause in the whole Act referring to the House of Commons as an aggregate when we are considering the question of representation, and that is section 52. Therefore section 37 can read perfectly clearly; The House of Commons shall under the provisions of section 52 of this Act consist of 181 members because section 51 is only a re-adjusting clause; with the representation in the House of Commons. The representation in the House of Commons is provided for by section 37 plus section 52. The future readjustment does not relate to the representation of the House of Commons and consequently subject to the provisions of the Act are subject to such provisions as relate to the House of Commons and its representation.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: They are not quite the same subject matter. \"The number of members of the House of Commons:\" Is that not in section 52?\nMr. Williams: Let me point your Lordship's attention to another matter in connection with that supporting my contention and I will quote a case to your Lordship. If it meant that the 82 for Ontario, the 65 for Quebec, the 19 for Nova Scotia and the 15 for New Brunswick, were at any time to be reduced below the original number given, which I claim is the constitution of Canada, and cannot be disturbed, as section 52 says; if it meant that it would read: The House of Commons shall subject to the provisions of this Act consist of 181 members of which 82 shall be elected for Ontario subject to the provisions of the Act; 65 for Quebec, subject to the provisions of the Act, and so on. But they do not do that. They put subject to the provisions of the Act with regard to the House of Commons as a House of Commons and as to the original House of Commons. I hope Mr. Justice Nesbitt follows me.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: I follow your argument.\nMr. Williams: I quote in support of that the case of Ormerod v. Tod Morden[2] which is the only case I can find which puts a construction on these express words \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: What are you citing from?\nMr. Williams: From the Weekly Reporter, vol. 30, page 808. The judgment of Lord Justice Brett. The decision of Lord Justice Brett there defines the meaning of these words as being confined to the subject matter spoken of in the section in which the words occur. And putting that construction on it you should confine \"subject to the provisions of the Act\" to the House of Commons in section 37 and consequently it means section 52. I may say also my Lords that the view that 181 could never be reduced was mentioned by Mr. Dalton McCarthy as a legal opinion, and also by the late Hon. A. R. Dickie, at one time Minister of Justice. They gave that opinion in the House of Commons if your Lordships will permit me to give you the official debates\nThe Chief Justice: You cannot cite such things as authorities.\nMr. Williams: But as your Lordships are only giving an opinion and not a judgment it might be allowed.\nThe Chief Justice: I cannot see why your own opinion is not as good.\nMr. Williams: That may be my Lord and I thank you, but I would lil:e to point your Lordships to the opinion of these 3minent lawyers. Mr. Dalton McCarthy's opinion is contained in the House of Commons Debates, 1892, page 3412, and Mr. Dickie's opinion is to be found on page 3419, at the top. I may say, as Mr. Justice Davies knows, that it is almost impossible for Prince Edward Island to increase rapidly in population because our province is composed of farming lands; we have no manufactures and we cannot extend very much.\nNewcombe K.C. for the Dominion of Canada: May it please your Lordships; what I would have had to say in reply to my learned friends has been so far anticipated by the observations which have fallen from your Lordships, that I shall necessarily be very brief. In the first place I suppose we may eliminate from the discussion those things which have been decided by this court in the opinion recently delivered upon the New Brunswick reference. The decision of Mr. Justice Mills which was concurred in by the Chief Justice, by Mr. Justice Sedgewick and by Mr. Justice Armour, seems to set at rest a number of points to which my learned friends have referred. The late Mr. Justice Mills in his opinion said:[3]\n\"So upon the authority of their Lordships, the name of the Province of British Columbia should be inserted in those sections in which the provinces are names such as sections 5, 37, 51, 102, 129 and others of the like character * * It is too plain to call for discussion that the three provinces now included into the Dominion but which were not in when the Dominion was proclaimed stand towards Canada in exactly the same relation as the four provinces that were first embraced. They are in the union, under the authority of the imperial statute, as much as if they had been in the union from the beginning. They are entitled to be enumerated along with the four provinces whenever that enumeration is employed to indicate the number of provinces embraced in the Dominion when the confederation Act was first enacted, and as if they had then been included.\" Mr. Justice Girouard: What are you quoting from?\nMr. Newcombe: From the judgment of the court as pronounced by Mr. Justice Mills.\nThe Chief Justice: You could hardly call it a judgment.\nMr. Newcombe: No; but it represents the reasons for the answers given by the majority of the court.\nMr. Justice Girouard: The whole court.\nMr. Newcombe: I presume so, but Mr. Justice Davies and your Lordship gave separate reasons.\nMr. Justice Girouard: We came to the same conclusion, but I would not say that the reasons are different.\nMr. Newcombe: Not necessarily different reasons, but you gave reasons, whereas three of their Lordships concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Mills which I am reading:[4]\n\"It follows from the provisions made for ultimately embracing the whole of British North America into the union, that the people of the different provinces were intended to stand, in respect to their representation in Parliament, upon a footing of perfect equality, and that the provisions of 51st section of the British North America Act were intended to apply to the population of every province that might thereafter be admitted into the union as well as to the population of each of the four provinces that were first included. I think this is reasonably clear from the provisions made for the admission of other provinces in North America until the whole of British North America was included within the Dominion of Canada. A fair construction of section 146 makes it possible to carry this avowed intention into effect, on lines consistent with the provisions of the Act.\" Therefore, it is manifest that in the construction of section 51 of the British North America Act, under present conditions, you are to substitute the word \"seven\" for the word \"four\" and to read it as saying:\n\"The representation of the seven provinces shall be re-adjusted by such authority, in such manner and from such time as the Parliament of Canada novices, subject and according to the following rules.\"\nThat disposes of the contention that there is any difference, so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned, between her situation and the position which she would have occupied had she come in with the original four provinces. My Lords, I do not propose to refer at all to the debates or the Journals, or the Quebec Conference, or any of these documents which my learned friends have invoked to show the intention of this Act, as they contend. The letter of the Act itself is very plain and very clear, as I conceive. And that being so I deny the right of my learned friend to refer to or to read any of these papers, and I submit that your Lordships cannot refer to them for the purpose of construing the Act. I need not quote authorities to your Lordships on that because you are familiar with them. It has been laid down time and again by the highest courts, by the Judicial Committee in Appeal which is directly binding upon this court, that documents of that sort cannot be invoked to modify, affect or throw light upon the construction of an Act of Parliament. Therefore, it is that in approaching this question we have to be governed by the letter of the Act and only by the letter of the Act so far as it is possible in construing the words to give a reasonable interpretation to them.\nIt would be a very singular thing if the question which my learned friends have propounded could be answered in their favour consistently with the result in the New Brunswick case recently referred to your lordships. The Province of New Brunswick, supported by the Provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia, framed a question which was before your Lordships a few days ago, with the view of having a determination upon the point as to whether they were liable to have their representation decreased. It was supposed by the advisers of these Governments that that depended upon the construction which is to be given to the words \"aggregate population of Canada\" as used in paragraph 4 of section 51. That question was answered by your lordships favourably to the contention that it included the population of all Canada, and the result as accepted by the governments concerned is that so far as the opinion of this court so delivered could govern, they are liable to have their representation diminished as is proposed by the Redistribution Bill now before the House of Commons.\nSupposing that judgment to stand, my learned friends say, or it is involved in their argument and I presume they will say it in terms: That it is neither here nor there so far as the point is concerned which they are now presenting to the court It would be rather a curious result if New Brunswick and Ontario and Nova Scotia have so far mistaken the point upon which the whole thing depends as to submit a question which is really irrelevant to the inquiry. However that may be the question has been answered by your lordships and I do not propose to re-open anything that was decided upon that question.\nMy learned friends have referred to section 37 which provides:\n\"That the House of Commons shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, consist of 181 members; of whom 82 shall be elected for Ontario, 65 for Quebec, 19 for Nova Scotia and 15 for New Brunswick.\" In 1873 come the terms of union with Prince Edward Island and one of these terms is:\n\"That the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by 15,000 or upwards since the year 1861, the Island shall be represented in the House of Commons by six members; the representation to be re-adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act 1861\"\nI take it in view of what I have said, and particularly with reference to the opinion already given by the court, that we must now, for the purpose of considering the present question, add to section 37 the words: \"Six for Prince Edward Island.\"\nAnd my learned friends' case cannot stand upon any higher ground than that. Then you will have it read:\n\"Six for Prince Edward Island subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nYou have to go to section 51 to find provisions of this Act subject to which Prince Edward Island is to have six members, and subject to which the House of Commons is to consist of 181 members.\n\"51. On the completion of the census in the year 1871 and of each subsequent decennial census the representation of the seven provinces shall be re-adjusted subject to the following rules: Quebec shall have a fixed number of 65 members. There shall be assigned to each of the other provinces such a number of members as will bear the same proportion to its number of population ascertained at such census as the number 65 bears to the population of Quebec so ascertained.\"\nIt necessarily follows from the reading of these two sections together, that you may have an increase or you may have a diminution of the members forming either the aggregate of the House of Commons or the aggregate of any province. I think that follows, my Lords. But it is not necessary in the present circumstances to determine whether or not the aggregate membership of the House of Commons may be reduced or not. That question is not before the court and is not involved in this inquiry, because it may very well happen that the representation of a province may be reduced and the representation of another province may be correspondingly increased, and the total representation in the House of Commons remain the same. I submit that section 52 has no office whatever so far as the present inquiry is concerned; section 52 has never yet been invoked by Parliament. The power given under that section has never been executed, but it may be executed and only in one way\u2014that is, by increasing the number fixed for the Province of Quebec. If Parliament were to provide that Quebec shall have 75 members and that the representation of the other provinces shall be increased accordingly, that would be an enactment quite within the authority of the Dominion Parliament and referable solely to the authority conferred by section 52.\nMr. Justice Davies: Is not the increase of members in the North West referable solely to this also?\nMr. Newcombe: We have a special Act with regard to the North West Territories.\nMr. Justice Davies: You have a special Act, but it is under this section that your power to make an Act giving increased representation surely lies. I may be entirely mistaken, but that was always my assumption. The number of members in the House of Commons can only be increased by a statute. That statute can only be passed pursuant to the power contained in the 52nd section, and when additional members were admitted from the North West and the number of members in the House of Commons was increased to 215, surely it was by virtue of the power in section 52 they did that. Mr. Newcombe: In 49 & 50 Vic. ch. 35 we have:\n\"The Parliament of Canada may from time to time make provision for the representation in the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, or either of them, of any territories which for the time being form part of the Dominion of Canada but are not included in any province thereof.\"\nMr. Justice Davies: That was an additional Act to remove the doubts that existed.\nMr. Newcombe: That was passed in 1886.\nMr. Justice Davies: It is not necessary for your argument I suppose, but I assume that there were doubts expressed and these doubts were properly removed by an Imperial Act. I assumed that the Parliament of Canada have the power under section 52 to increase the number of members from the North West.\nMr. Newcombe: I had supposed, my Lord, that that power came under the amending Act. However, so far as are concerned the provinces that are constituted as forming the Dominion, that section is quite unnecessary to authorize the increase which may come about in case every province had increased relatively to Quebec, so as to require a representation in the House of Commons of say 200 members instead of 181. You have all that provided for in section 51. My learned friend's argument is no doubt very ingenious and his whole point comes to this: That under section 51 and under the terms of the union with Prince Edward Island, the representation of the province may be re-adjusted, but he says that the word \"re-adjusted\" excluded any idea of diminution or increase so far as the whole is concerned. He would perhaps say that it is like a puzzle which we may make by cutting up a sheet of card paper into various figures and mixing them up together. These may be re-adjusted as often as you like for the purpose of making one re-constituted whole, but you cannot take away one of these pieces and you cannot add one to these pieces because that is not re-adjustment. It is diminution or increase. But that very argument, it seems to me, works against my learned friends. We are not here on the question as to whether the House of Commons can consist of less than 181 members, but as to whether one of these provinces mentioned in section 37 may upon any readjustment have less than the number there assigned to it. I have shown that Prince Edward Island does not stand upon any higher ground than Ontario, and I ask your Lordships whether it does not follow plainly and obviously that upon the first re-adjustment, when the provisions of section 51 might be invoked after the Confederation, it may not be necessary to take away two members from Ontario and add these two members to Nova Scotia. If that may be done then the representation of Prince Edward Island which is now five members must on the present occasion be reduced to four; and you decide that, without touching the question at all as to whether under any circumstance the House of Commons may decrease below 181 members. My submission would be\u2014if the court held that that inquiry were material\u2014that the House of Commons could be reduced below 181 members. Either that, or you have a very important case entirely unprovided for by the Act; because it might happen that Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario had each decreased, so that the application of the unit of Quebec after any decennial census to their population would have given them much less than the number of members stipulated by the British North America Act. Then, Quebec must remain at 65, Ontario might have 50, Nova Scotia 10 and New Brunswick 10, and there you have a total of 135 members. That would be the result if no other province had come in and if that condition of population had resulted after any decennial census you would have a House composed of 135 members, unless it be that this provision about readjustment has not gone far enough and has left that case entirely unprovided for. I understand my Lords that that question has not arisen and probably can never arise, so that I do not invite your Lordships to consider it, but rather that we should leave it as many other things are left to be determined in case it ever becomes necessary to determine it.\nMr. Justice Davies: Has it not arisen in the case of Nova Scotia? The totality of members of Parliament and the totality for the province specified in section 37 will remain on the same basis as if they are not controlled by the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act,\" and the opinion of this court being that they were, then Nova Scotia would be properly reduced.\nMr. Aylesworth: Not Nova Scotia but New Brunswick; Nova Scotia is still at the original 19 members.\nMr. Justice Davies: One or other of these provinces would be reduced below the number.\nMr. Justice Sedgewick: Nova Scotia loses two members now.\nMr. Aylesworth: But still they have the original 19.\nMr. Justice Davies: It brings it down to 18 and it is 19 in the statute. Therefore, in the rule which is laid down in the opinion of this court the crisis has arisen. There must be a construction to maintain that opinion of the court in favour of the view we expressed that subject to the provisions of this Act it is not an arbitrary assignment of so many members for all times, but it is an arbitrary assignment of members for each province and the whole House of Commons, until the making of the re-adjustment provided for under section 51. Mr. Newcombe: Yes my Lord. The question as to whether you are reducing the aggregate representation below 181.\nMr. Justice Davies: Or the special representation of the provinces named in the same section, below the number assigned to each of them respectively. You see I am agreeing with you.\nMr. Newcombe: I thought that was not involved because there was no proposal to make any decrease in the aggregate representation of the House of Commons but only with regard to one particular province, and other provinces are getting the benefit of that; we decrease one province and we give an increase to another province. Under the present condition of affairs if you determine this question in my favour, the aggregate representation of Canada is not thereby decreased below 181, or the corresponding number whatever it is having regard to the introduction of the various other provinces. A member is coming off Prince Edward Island and he is going to Manitoba; a member is coming off Ontario and he is going to British Columbia and so on, so that the very thing is working out which, on the most limited construction, section 51 was intended to provide for. My learned friend says that you cannot decrease the number of 181. Granted for the purpose of this point that you cannot decrease the 181, but, you could take your 181 and 65 of them would go into the Quebec space entirely, and the balance might be shuffled back and forth as much as you like.\nMr. Justice Davies: That is not his argument. He says you cannot reduce Quebec below 65, Nova Scotia below 19 and New Brunswick below 15, and when you come to apply the section of clause 51 and reach that point, you must stay your hand. Mr. Newcombe: If he says that, admitting that 181 must have been a fixture and admitting that 65 for Quebec must remain a fixture, then he would say that you cannot take one out of Ontario's 82 and add it to Nova Scotia's 19?\nMr. Justice Davies: That is what he does say. Mr. Newcombe: If he says you cannot do that, then my Lord he is giving no effect whatever to the plainest words which could be used to confer authority to do that very thing. It is said that Lord Thing daughter this Act and I assume he was a very eminent draughtsman. If the draughtsman had had any instructions or had any intention of providing that the aggregate of 181 could not diminish; that Ontario's 82 could not be diminished, and that the members assigned to the other provinces could not be diminished; would he not in all conscience have added to 51 and stated \"provided however that the total representation mentioned in section 37 for the Dominion and for each province is not in any case to be reduced.\"\nThe Chief Justice: What object would there be for the Imperial Parliament to take away from the Dominion Parliament the right either to increase or diminish at will so long as they went on the principle of representation by population.\nMr. Newcombe: No object my Lord.\nMr. Justice Davies: Excepting of course that it might be argued that the smaller provinces might have insisted that applying your rule of representation by population they would prefer to have an arbitrary number that they would be sure of in any event. I suppose that would be the argument. But the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" are very strong.\nMr. Newcombe: My learned friend says that the Dominion Government can afford to be generous to Prince Edward Island because it is a small province, because it is circumscribed by the sea, because it is an agricultural community and its population can never increase beyond a certain limit and because of its broken coast line and deep indentations and everything of that sort. But I submit with all deference to that view that the power of the Dominion to be generous is circumscribed and limited by the British North America Act.\nThe Chief Justice: You need not allude to that. We cannot force the Dominion Parliament to be generous or parsimonious.\nMr. Newcombe: Very well my Lord. If they did give Prince Edward Island a larger representation by her terms of union than she would have been entitled to if her population were taken at that time under the rules laid down in section 51 it was, as I understand it laid down here the other day, that when you bring a province in you have to start with an arbitrary number of representatives. It may be more or it may be less than the province is entitled to, but if the province comes in by agreement it is within the power of the contracting governments to fix that number and then that number will stand by force of the Queen's order until the period of the first readjustment comes around and down it goes or up it goes.\nMr. Justice Davies: The second re-adjustment.\nMr. Newcombe: Quite so my lord. I quite agree that there must be a second decennial census before you can get a standard from which to judge. It is plain that they supposed at that time that Prince Edward Island was increasing rapidly in population and there was the suggestion\u2014and it is in effect nothing more than a suggestion\u2014to the public as justifying the giving of six members to Prince Edward Island: \"That the population of Prince Edward Island haying increased by 15,000 or upwards since the year 1861, the island shall be represented by six members.\"\nThe word \"re-adjusted\" in these terms of union with Prince Edward Island must be taken to have been advisedly substituted for the word \"increased\" which was used in the terms of union with British Columbia two years before, and it seems to be indicative of the intention that the representation should be subject to increase as well as diminution under the provisions of the British North America Act. The reason why Prince Edward Island was given more than its due proportion of members to start with (so far as appears from the terms of union themselves) was that its increase of population since 1861 had been rapid, having increased by 15,000 or upwards and it was no doubt supposed that the increase would continue to be rapid in the future, and so it was thought that it would be better not to tie the province down to five members until the next re-adjustment. But there is nothing in the language of the terms of the union suggesting any other reason for this provision, or pointing to the existence of an intention that the representation should not be reduced if the population should fall below that existing at the previous census.\nMr. Justice Davies: It is not contested that the Dominion and the island have a right to make an agreement, that when the island came in it should have six members irrespective of what their population was.\nMr. Newcombe: No my lord.\nMr. Justice Davies: Had the Dominion power to make a provision inconsistent with section 51?\nMr. Newcombe: Certainly not. I submit that this is clear under the provisions of section 146 which says: \"On such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the colony thinks fit to approve subject to the provisions of this Act.\"\nIt is subject my Lords to the provisions of this Act, which is one constitution for one Dominion of Canada, providing equality, and to give to these terms and conditions either expressly or by necessary implication any such construction as my learned friends contend for, would produce inequality as between the provinces in their representation in the House of Commons.\nI do not think that what I am about to say has anything to do with the case, but in view of what my learned friends have urged as to the possibility or probability of Prince Edward Island losing its representation altogether, I want to point out that there is a clause here which renders that contingency extremely remote and improbable if not entirely impossible. Subsection 4 of section 5 L says:\n\"On any such re-adjustment the number of members for a province shall not be reduced unless the proportion which the number of the population of the province bears to the number of the aggregate population of Canada at the then last preceding re-adjustment of the number of members for the province is ascertained at the then latest census to be diminished by one-twentieth part or upwards.\"\nNow if you consider a case happening at the end of each decade where the diminution is the twenty-first part or upwards of the one-twentieth part, you see that there is a check in the process every ten years, and the province starts over again, and you cannot go back to the beginning for the purpose of considering the proportion. Therefore it may be that a province will have a very much larger representation ultimately in the House of Commons than its population would entitle it to having regard to the unit of the population of the Province of Quebec, because if it can barely avoid during each ten years the proportionate reduction of a one-twentieth part, it gets a new proportion established, and therefore I think that is a very carefully thought out provision. I say that these rules under section 51 are prepared with great foresight and will result. I have no doubt, in doing justice to the small communities as well as in providing just representation to the larger ones.\nMy learned friend the Attorney General for Prince Edward Island asserts that Prince Edward Island entered the union upon a different basis from Ontario and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. I submit that it did not enter upon a different basis, and that it could not enter upon a different basis. It could only enter subject to the provisions of this Act; subject to the application of section 51 and the other sections which apply to all the provinces and not exclusively to any one province in particular. I submit therefore my Lords, that there is very little open for consideration on the present question, if your Lordships are to be governed by the opinion already delivered, and that the answer to that question depends upon the construction of sections 37 and 51 of the statute, having regard to the terms of union with Prince Edward Island which so far as this point is concerned placed Prince Edward Island upon the same footing as one of the original provinces; and that upon the proper interpretation of these sections, the only answer to be given is in favour of the obligation to reduce under the circumstances which exist.\nAylesworth K.C., in reply: Of course if the question which is here propounded is answered by any necessary implication in the opinion already expressed by the court on the previous reference, there is an end to the matter. We cannot ask your Lordships to change your views upon the questions that were then under consideration, but we do ask, and we think we are entitled to submit to the court, that it is only the question that was there put and the answer that was given to that very question, that is in the position of a decision of the court in the matter; and that so far as opinions are expressed which were not necessary to a decision of the question than before the court, we have simply an orbiter dictum which is not necessarily binding at all upon your lordships' court.\nNow the Province of New Brunswick, which was there the actor, did not raise the question (which of course if its legal adviser had seen fit it might have raised) upon the construction of section 37, as to whether or not there was anything to prevent the reduction of its provincial representation below the initial number of fifteen. There had been a reduction below 15 in New Brunswick in 1891\u2014there is to be, it is said, a further reduction in the bill now under consideration in the House of Commons. Those advising the province had that expectation or that possibility before them, and they did not see fit to ask that that question should be submitted to the court. They stated their contention upon an altogether different clause of the statute. They contended that there could be no reduction by reason of a certain specific construction which they sought to have put upon sub clause 4 of section 51. They found as a matter of arithmetic that if you segregated the population of the original four provinces into the number of Quebec, their province would not have diminished by one-twentieth as compared with the population of that portion of the Dominion, and so the question which was before your Lordships then was simply one entirely as to the true meaning of subsection 4 of section 51. It was not material at all, not necessary at all I should say, to a decision of that question that any opinion should have been pronounced upon the construction of the words \"four provinces\" in the principal part of section 51. These words \"four provinces\" may, without detracting in the least degree from the decision of this court in the previous question, have the meaning which I am submitting they should have, namely, the meaning that these words expressed. You can give full effect to every word of the decision which the court gave on the question submitted previously, and still construe the words \"four provinces\" as they read and not the \"seven provinces.\" The answer to the question has just as much meaning and force, though the section itself has application as a means of re-adjustment for the four provinces and not for the seven provinces. And that we submit is the true intention of the framers of the Act. Why is it not so? They had four confederating provinces to deal with and they provided for the manner in which as among these four provinces representation should be from time to time readjusted. What need to provide for the manner of readjustment as to the new incoming provinces, or as to the new provinces to be created. That could be provided for in the terms of the union if it were one of the provinces already in existence that was coming in, or in the terms of creation if it were to be like Manitoba, some province carved out of the territories. There was no need whatever in 1867, that the Imperial Legislature should provide the means of re-adjustment as to new incoming provinces. They were not concerned I submit with that problem at all, but they were leaving that particular problem of re-adjustment to depend upon whatever contract the new Dominion that was then starting into existence might make with the incoming provinces. Mr. Justice Sedgewick: The difficulty of that argument is this: that section 91 or section 92 as well as section 51 would not apply to the incoming provinces of British Columbia or Prince Edward Island specially mentioned in the Act.\nMr. Aylesworth: Not so upon the language, because there is nothing in sections 91 or 92 about the four provinces. It does not use the words \"four provinces\" but it uses the word \"Canada.\"\nIs not that phraseology peculiar? In the previous argument, Mr. Pugsley drew special attention to the way in which the phrase had been changed from \"each province\" to \"the four provinces\" and back and forward in the different drafts of this section which are printed in Mr. Pope's book. That argument has no doubt some weight only if it is necessary to interpret the words \"four provinces,\" and it was not in any way necessary for a decision of the previous question that these words should be interpreted.\nMr. Justice Davies: In reference to the new argument you invoke I would like you to answer this question. It seems to me your case is peculiarly weak for this reason: You say that section 37 provides arbitrarily the number of members which should constitute the House of Commons and that there were also arbitrary numbers assigned to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Ontario, and that the re-adjustment under section 51 when brought into force\u2014and it was brought into force from decade to decade\u2014it could operate but not so as to take away from any of these provinces or from the totality of the House of Commons the specific number assigned.\nMr. Aylesworth: Not so as to reduce.\nMr. Justice Davies: Not so as to reduce. You say that is the effect of the imperial statute, but the trouble with Prince Edward Island is that there is no imperial statute assigning any arbitrary number to her. She comes in with the number assigned by mutual agreement between the Dominion and herself, but there is no arbitrary number assigned by imperial legislation to her. Because, don't you see the whole agreement made between Prince. Edward Island and the Dominion is expressed to be \"subject to the provisions of this Act.\" Now, this 51st clause of your own concession purposes to increase as well as to reduce provided it does not interfere with section 37. Section 37 does not touch Prince Edward Island, and therefore there is not that limitation upon the application of the re-adjustment provided by section 51 so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned, even if there was that limitation with regard to Ontario and Nova Scotia. That point has occurred to me. Is there something in it?\nMr. Aylesworth: Oh yes, there is very much in it. There are a great many points in it. In the first place the effect of the order-in-council admitting Prince Edward Island into confederation has, under section 146, exactly the force of imperial legislation. By section 146 Her Majesty's Privy Council was empowered to legislate in this regard subject to the provisions of the Act, and accordingly that order-in-council was passed embodying and approving the addresses of the houses submitting the terms of union, and these terms at once received all the force of imperial legislation. It is the same as though it were introduced into section 37.\nMr. Justice Davies: If it does it answers the suggestion that the effect of the order-in-council read into section 37 was to amend section 37 by making it read, that the House of Commons shall consist of 187 members of which Ontario shall have 82, Quebec 65, Prince Edward Island 6, and so on. Mr. Aylesworth: Take the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" in section 146, and let me ask if that is not a fair meaning if you give full effect to that. That means that when Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland, come into the union they come in subject to the provisions of this Act; they come in on the terms which may be settled by compact subject to the provisions of this Act. It would be ultra vires of the Act to provide that the judges of Prince Edward Island could hold office for ten years, should be elected, should be appointed by the provincial legislature. It would be contrary to the provisions of this Act to take away from the Dominion Parliament as to Prince Edward Island, any of the powers which section 91 confers. To use the illustration which Mr. Justice Mills put in the other argument, it would be contrary to the provisions of this Act if Prince Edward Island had sought to stipulate that its federal members should sit for seven years instead of five. That would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, and that is the force and as I would submit the full force of the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\" as found in section 146.\nMy learned friend was discussing section 37 when he gave a reference to the authority he cited, but it would be equally applicable to section 146. There was nothing, it seems to be conceded on all hands, to have prevented the Dominion agreeing that Prince Edward Island should have eight hundred instead of six. The question is what effect is to be given to these words in the twelfth clause of our terms of union that we are to have six members, the representation to be re-adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act. That reverts us to the re-adjusting section 51, and I say if that does have the effect of making section 51 applicable to Prince Edward Island, it is a matter of compact and not because section 51 by force of its own language would have applied to Prince Edward Island, because by force of the language in 51 it applies only to the four provinces. But if it does apply to Prince Edward Island as a matter of compact should we not give full effect to the idea of readjustment, and to the word member, and that, notwithstanding this clause and notwithstanding the fact that the aggregate of population on the island increased in the decade. From 1881 to 1891 the population of the Island increased in fact, but still they lose a member. Why? Because they have not increased as fast as Quebec and because their diminution is in fact more than one-twentieth part of the whole. Therefore that protective clause did not protect us in 1891, and it does not protect us to-day in 1901. It will not protect us ten years hence, for although we do increase in population we do not increase proportionately. That is the trouble, and just as certain as we lost one member in 1891 and another in 1901, we shall lose another ten years hence and another twenty years hence.\nMr. Justice Girouard: How is it that in 1892 there was no protest in the House of Commons on the part of the members representing the Island?\nMr. Aylesworth: It was on that occasion that the opinion was expressed that Mr. Williams has referred to by Mr. Dickey and Mr. Dalton McCarthy; that as a matter of course you could not reduce the total representation of the House of Commons below 181.\nMr. Justice Davies: Seduced to a nut shell, your argument on that point is, that section 37 controls the operation of section 51, so as to prevent any reduction of members below the six then specified.\nMr. Aylesworth: That is putting it in a nut shell To give full effect to section 37 as well as to section 51 you have to have a minimum, and that is not in conflict with the argument I addressed to your Lordships this morning as to the fixed number of senators, which it never was intended should be equal to nor greater than the representation in the popular assembly. Just a word upon this recital or preamble which is so significantly inserted here in clause 12 of our resolutions of union which says: \"That the population of the Island having been increased by 15,000 or upwards.\" Why should that have been made a reason for giving six members or an apparent reason for it? There can be no other interpretation of it than the one I suggested, namely that it refers to the fact that the population was increasing, because 15,000 was not the unit of representation by any means. The unit was over 18,000 at that time, and the fact of there being in one year an increase of 15,000 or upwards was not a reason in itself for giving the extra member. Just let me say one other word with reference to what has been pointed out to me since I first addressed the court, and which has reference to what Mr. Justice Davies referred to, namely, the abnormal increase of population in the Island between 1871 and 1873. I am told by Mr. Williams that statistics show that the actual census for the Island for 1861 gave a population of 80,857, and the actual census returns of 1871, as stated in clause 6 of the resolution, show the population to be 94,021 or an actual increase between 1861 and 1871 of 13,164. The recital in clause 12 says, speaking in May 1873, the increase has now become 15,000 and upwards. It had only been 13,000 at the time of the taking of the census in 1871, and therefore they allowed that extra 2,000 or thereabouts as measuring the increase of population in the two years. And even allowing for that, they had not enough to give them an extra member at all, but taking the unit of representation as it stood in 1871 they would have five members and a bare one-eighth (57\/8) but still they gave as a matter of compact, or of generosity if you like, the sixth member.\nMr. Justice Nesbitt: It is a matter of terms.\nMr. Aylesworth: Certainly, and the generosity would be in this sense, that the Dominion was urged by the at home authorities to approach the negotiations in a spirit of liberality and not to stand upon the letter of their right as to representation by population. These are circumstances of course which we advance to the court, not with any suggestion that it is to be considered as a matter of policy, but as circumstances which ought to govern the interpretation of this statute, if it is in any way ambiguous; if it is open to the interpretation we are contending for. I point out that because the opinion of Mr. Justice Mills, that the words \"four provinces\" in section 51 ought now to be read \"seven is not necessary for a decision of the question that is now before the court, and therefore not a binding view so far as the court is concerned now. There was not then before the court for consideration the interpretation of section 37 of the Act and the contention that the number of members shall never be reduced below the figures therein stated. So far as that contention is concerned, it is presented for the first time on behalf of the Island. I think that covers everything that I have to say to your Lordships by way of reply and explanation. I call your Lordships' attention to the language of the statute creating the Province of Manitoba, 33 Vic. ch. 3, passed on the 12th of May 1873, and therefore as much before all parties for consideration at the time of the framing of the terms of union with Prince Edward Island as were the terms of union with British Columbia or the British North America Act itself. By section 4 of that Manitoba Act, representation is provided for and these are the words: \"The said province shall be represented in the first instance in the House of Commons of Canada by four members.\"\nIs not the presence of the phrase \"in the first instance\" of great significance? It suggests at once a temporary measure of memberships. It was in fact more than the population of Manitoba at that time would have entitled it to according to the unit of representation, It was as it were, saying to Manitoba: Though we give you this number of members it is not to be a permanent thing. Now, the relations of the Dominion to Manitoba were very different from the relations of the province of Prince Edward Island to the Dominion. It was no question of compact or terms in the case of Manitoba but it was a question of granting a constitution to a new province and not a question of making terms with an old one. They were unfettered as to the representation they should grant; they might give and they might take away, but in the case of high contracting powers each on the footing of independence and dominion as the Island and the Dominion were at this time this contract was entered into, it would be an injustice to one of the contracting parties if now that party were to be told: You made your terms; you were only stipulating for six members for the time being. There is no hint of such a thing in anything that is said by the contracting parties, and we urge that your Lordships approach the consideration of the interpretation of this treaty under the view which will enable you to carry out the true meaning and intention of both parties to this treaty.\nThe opinion of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, the following question has been referred to the Court by the Governor-General-in-Council:\nAlthough the population of Prince Edward Island, as ascertained at the census of 1901, if divided by the unit of representation ascertained by dividing the number of 65 into the population of Quebec is not sufficient to give six members in the House of Commons of Canada to that province, is the representation of Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons of Canada, liable under the British North America Act, 1867, and amendments thereto and the terms of union of 1873 under which that province entered Confederation, to be reduced below six the number granted to that province by the said terms of Union of 1873?\nThe Province of Prince Edward Island contends that its representation in the House of Commons is not liable ever to be reduced below six members. That contention is based upon the 12th resolution under which the Province, in 1873, was admitted by an Imperial order in Council into the Union under the provisions of the one hundred and forty sixth section of the British North America Act. That resolution reads as follows:\nThat the population of Prince Edward Island having been increased by fifteen thousand or upwards since the year 1861, the island shall be represented in the House of Commons by six members; the representation to be re-adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act.\"\nIn my opinion the province's contention is unfounded. It may well be that the framers of the British North America Act have not foreseen or provided for every possible eventuality in the respective positions of the different provinces of the Dominion, as to population or other matters; it may be that some of the provinces would have refused to join the Union had they foreseen all the results that their adhesion to it is now ascertained to carry. But with such considerations we are not here concerned. On the statute and on the Order in Council of 1873 (which has to be construed as a statute), we must base our answer to the question submitted. The negotiations that preceded both or each of them are merged in the statute and the Order in Council. Now, it has to be taken as a settled proposition, as far as this court is concerned, by the opinion we lately delivered on the reference concerning New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (ante page 475,) that the representation in the federal House of Commons is, as the fundamental basis in that respect of the constitution, based upon population. I need not here do more than refer to the reasoning upon which we reached that conclusion. The Province of Prince Edward Island's contention, that it occupies an exceptional position in this regard within the union, and that it is entitled to a larger representation comparatively in the House of Commons than the other provinces thereof cannot prevail, it was provisionally that it was given six members, till its representation was re-adjusted with that of the other provinces, as provided for by section 51 of the B. N. A. Act. The resolution in question must be read as if the words \"in the first instance\" were inserted therein after the word \"represented\". Otherwise, the words that follow,\nthe representation to be re-adjusted from time to time under the provisions of the British North America Act,\nwould have no meaning whatever. The province would read them out of the resolution. And that cannot be done. They have to be read as if incorporated in a statute, and must be construed as meaning that the representation of the province shall be re-adjusted after every decennial census, as provided for by section 51 of the British North America Act, its representation, in the meantime, to be composed of six members. That section 51 must now be read as if the words \"the four provinces\" in the first paragraph thereof were replaced by the words \"All the provinces\". There is nothing that can have any bearing whatever on the solution of the question submitted in the assertion on the part of the province that it is only upon the understanding that its representation in the House of Commons should never be reduced below six members that it consented to come into the union. That cannot prevail as an argument. The rest of the Dominion are just as entitled to assert that they would not have admitted the province into the union had it insisted, as it now would do, upon more favourable terms than the other provinces in the matter of representation in the House of Commons.\nI would answer the question in the affirmative; that is to say, I am of opinion that as by the Federal census of 1901, the population of Prince Edward Island divided by the unit of representation ascertained by dividing the number of 65 into the population of Quebec is not sufficient to give six members in the House of Commons to that province, the representation of that province must be re-adjusted and reduced proportionately to population as provided for by section 51 of the British North America Act.\n[1] 26 Can.

Turner, and by a covenant and proviso in the said mortgage contained, the said Hugh Chisholm covenanted with the said John R. Turner, his executors, administrators and assigns, to pay the said sum with interest thereon upon certain specified days mentioned therein, and that in default of payment of the interest the whole principal sum should become payable.\n5.

Turner assigned and set over unto the plaintiffs the said mortgage and all moneys due or which should thereafter become due by virtue of the said mortgage, and the full benefit of all the covenants and provisos in the said mortgage contained, and conveyed or purported to convey the said lands to the said plaintiffs. 6. Hugh Chisholm failed to perform his covenant to repay the said moneys and interest, and on the 13th day of February, 1899, the plaintiffs recovered a judgment against him for $650.77, and issued a writ of execution directed to the sheriff of the county of Middlesex, by which he was required to levy the amount of the said judgment upon the goods and lands of the said Hugh Chisholm.\n7. It was agreed between the defendant and the plaintiffs that if the plaintiffs should request the said sheriff to expose the said lands for sale in fee simple under the said writ, the defendant would buy the same at and for the price or sum of $2,350, which is the full value of the fee, and that the plaintiffs would also convey and assign the said mortgage. Doubt having been expressed prior to the sale as to whether the fee would pass to the purchaser under the sale by the sheriff and such assignment of mortgage, it was agreed on behalf of the plaintiffs that if the defendant would so purchase at the said sale he should be placed in the position as regards title of a purchaser buying under an open agreement, and that if the plaintiffs failed to prove a good title to the said lands the purchaser should not be bound to carry out his purchase.\n8. Pursuant to the said writ, the interest of the said Hugh Chisholm in the said lands devised to him was regularly offered for sale by the said sheriff as a fee simple absolute on the 2nd day of March, 1901, and at the said sale the said lands were purchased by the defendant, subject to such agreement, for the sum of $2,350.\n9. The defendant now objects that the restriction in the said will not only constituted a valid restriction upon alienation, and rendered the said mortgage void, but also prevented the lands devised to Hugh Chisholm from being exigible for debt, but in other respects the title has been accepted. 10. It has been agreed that the validity of the said objection shall be submitted for determination to this honourable court by way of a special case, and that the objection for the purpose of such submission shall be stated in the following form:\n1. Did Hugh Chisholm take a fee simple absolute by the said will in the said lands, and was he able to convey the same in fee notwithstanding the restriction in the will?\n2. In any event was the fee simple in the lands subject to sale under execution as against Hugh Chisholm for his debts?\n3. If the court is of opinion that the plaintiffs can make title in either or both ways, judgment is to be for the plaintiffs, otherwise for the defendant.\nThe judgment of the High Court on this special case was that the restraint on alienation was valid though the provision that no debts of the son should encumber the land devised for twenty-five years was void; that the violation of the restriction forfeited the devise and the fee simple did not pass to Chisholm by the sheriff's sale; and that plaintiffs could not give title to the land. The plaintiffs obtained an order under sec. 26 of The Supreme Court Act for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court without a preliminary appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nArmour K.C. for the appellant. At one time the Ontario courts held that a partial restraint against alienation was void; Fulton v. Fulton[1]; Crawford v. Lundy[2]; Gallinger v. Farlinger[3]; but in 1881 they adopted the contrary jurisprudence; Earls v. McAlpine[4], owing to the decision of Jessel M. R. in Re Macleay[5]. The courts in England, on the contrary, have uniformly held partial restraints, as to time at all events, to be void. See Re Rosher[6]; Renaud v. Tourangeau[7]; Re Machu[8].\nJ. Travers Lewis appeared for the respondent but did not wish to be heard.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The late Donald Chisholm by his will dated the 27th day of February, 1887, bequeathed a certain lot of land to his son Hugh Chisholm. Added to the bequest are the following words:\nI will that the aforesaid parcel of land shall not be at his disposal at any time until at the end of twenty-five years from the date of my decease, and further, I will that the said parcel of land shall remain free from all incumbrance, and that no debts contracted by my son Hugh Chisholm shall by any means incumber the same during twenty-five years from the date of my decease.\nHe died soon afterwards.\nIn April, 1896, the said devisee, Hugh Chisholm, having borrowed $500 from one Turner executed as security therefor a mortgage on the said land devised to him as aforesaid with an express covenant to repay the said loan.\nUpon an assignment by Turner to them of the said sum of $500, the appellants recovered judgment upon the covenant against the said Hugh Chisholm for the amount thereof and interest accrued. They then issued a writ of execution directed to the sheriff, by which he was required to levy the amount of the said judgment upon the goods and lands of the said Hugh Chisholm. It was then agreed between the appellants and the respondent, McCallum, that if the appellants would request the said sheriff to expose the said land for sale in fee simple under the said writ, he, the respondent, would buy the same at and for the price of $2,350, the full value of the fee, and that the appellants would also convey and assign to him the said mortgage, which had previously also been assigned to them by Turner. Doubts having been expressed as to whether the fee would pass to the purchaser under the sale by the sheriff and such assignment of mortgage, it was agreed on behalf of the appellants that if the respondent would so purchase at the said sale he should be placed in the position as regards title of a purchaser buying under an open agreement, and that if the appellants failed to prove a good title to the said land the purchaser should not be bound to carry out his purchase. Thereupon, pursuant to the said writ, the interest of the said Hugh Chisholm in the said land devised to him was regularly offered for sale by the said sheriff as a fee simple absolute, and at the sale the said land was purchased by the respondent, subject to the aforesaid agreement, for the sum of $2,350.\nThe respondent, however, objected that the restriction in the said will not only constituted a valid restriction upon alienation and rendered the said mortgage void, but also prevented the land devised to Hugh Chisholm from being liable to execution for debt. In all other respects he was willing to accept the title.\nThe appellants having brought an action for specific performance, it was agreed between the parties to submit the following questions for determination to the court, without pleadings.\n1. Did Hugh Chisholm take a fee simple absolute by the said will in the said land, and was he able to convey the same in fee notwithstanding the restriction in the will? 2. In any event was the fee simple in the land subject to sale under execution as against Hugh Chisholm for his debts?\n3. If the court is of opinion that the plaintiffs can make title in either or both ways, judgment is to be for the plaintiffs, otherwise for the defendant.\nMeredith C. J., the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, before whom the case was heard, held that the provision in Donald Chisholm's will that no debts contracted by his son Hugh should incumber the land devised to him during twenty-five years after his decease was void, but held further that:\nThis court doth declare that the restriction against alienation of the land in question herein contained in the will of Donald Chisholm in the special case set out is a valid restriction upon alienation of the said land, and that the mortgage made by the said devisee, Hugh Chisholm, to the plaintiffs, being against the terms of the said restriction, occasioned a forfeiture of the said devise, whereby the heirs at law of the said testator became entitled to enter upon the said land and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n2. And this court doth further declare that the fee simple in the whole of the said land did not pass by the sale under the said execution against the said Hugh Chisholm, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n3. And this court doth adjudge that the plaintiffs cannot make a good title in fee simple to the said land, and that the said action be and the same is hereby dismissed without costs.\nThe plaintiffs now appeal from the said judgment. The case was argued ex parte before us by appellants' counsel, counsel for respondent submitting to the judgment of the court without argument.\nIt is one that has given me much trouble. I am glad to see that the conclusions I have reached will not affect the result. I give my views of it with great diffidence. Though I have to admit that in certain respects they come in conflict with those that have hitherto prevailed in many quarters on some of the: questions that arise in the case, yet I do not think that I am disregarding any authority that is binding on this court. I certainly do not intend to do so.\nFirst, I fail to understand why the sheriff's sale upon the execution of the judgment for a personal debt of Hugh Chisholm did not convey to the respondent purchaser the fee simple absolute of this property, it being conceded, as held by the court below and not controverted here, that the provision in Donald Chisholm's will that no debts contracted by his son should incumber the land during twenty-five years after his death is void and consequently that the land could be sold under execution for his son's debts. The respondent, of course, bought subject to the Turner mortgage, if valid. But when he gets a conveyance of that mortgage from the appellants, as they agree to do before he takes title, the mortgage and the equity of redemption will be merged in him. It seems to me that under these conditions he would have a perfect title.\nHowever, it is assumed, I suppose, though not exactly put forward in so many words by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, that because the appellants had taken a mortgage to secure their loan to Hugh Chisholm, they had lost the right they otherwise would have had to execute against the land in question the judgment they had recovered against him; or, in other words, that the provision prohibiting the mortgage of the land by the devisee for his debts was valid though the provision that the land could not be sold under a fi-fa for the same debts was void. If such is the law, it would seem to be a very irrational one. If it had been to a third party that a mortgage had been previously given on the land by Hugh Chisholm, for another debt, would it have disabled the appellants from executing their judgment against the fee? Or would it be in the power of judgment debtor in the position of Hugh Chisholm to set at naught the judgment creditor's right of execution by giving a mortgage to a third party before the registration of the judgment and the issuance of the execution to the sheriff?\nAs to the principal question submitted to us at the argument, without dissenting from the conclusions reached by the majority of the court, I would think it immaterial, as between the parties in this case, whether the restraint upon alienation in question is valid or not.\nIf it is invalid as against public policy, as held by my learned brothers, the fee simple absolute of course passed to the devisee, and the sheriff's sale passed it to the respondent. If the restraint is valid, as held by the court below, the mortgage to Turner in breach thereof is void, but the fee remained in Hugh Chisholm and was conveyed to the respondent by the sheriff's sale. A void act cannot operate a forfeiture. Quod nullum est nullum producit effectum. The testator willed this land with prohibition to the devisee to alienate or incumber it. But what is the consequence if he attempts to alienate or incumber? Nothing else but the complete nullity of any act done in contravention of the prohibition, but not forfeiture or nullity of the devise.\n\"I give you this property,\" says the testator to the devisee, \"but I prohibit you from selling it or in cumbering it during 25 years;\" or in a more correct construction, \"I withhold from you the power of so doing that you would by law have.\"\nNow if the devisee does what he is prohibited from doing, he does what he has not the power to do, and the result is that what he has done is void, and if it is void, it is in law as if he had not done it; and if he has not done it, it cannot work forfeiture of the devise. It is the prohibited act that alone is void. The prohibition is the law decreed by the testator, and any act done in contravention of that law is void, as is any act done in contravention of any prohibitive law. But the devise holds good. To hold that the devisee had the power voluntarily to forfeit it would be setting at naught the clear intention of the testator. And I take it to be the law that in construing a will the testator's intention is the primary object to be ascertained. Had he intended that a breach of the prohibition should work forfeiture of the devise he would have said so, as was done for instance inter alia, in the cases of Barnett v. Blake[9]; Hurst v. Hurst[10], and re Porter[11]. But he cautiously refrained from doing so. He, on the contrary, virtually added to the restraint, \"but I do not make it a condition of my devise.\"\nBy the judgment a quo which holds that the restriction in the will under consideration is valid, but that it should be read as a condition of the devise the breach of which annulled it and wrenched the property out of the hands of the devisee, the very object that this testator had in view is defeated. It is not to expose the devisee to be deprived of this property that he attached to the devise the disability to alienate it, but, on the contrary, to force upon him, as it were, for twenty-five years the benefit of the devise; to ensure his holding of the property during twenty-five years; to render it impossible for him, as much as it was in his power to do it, to part with it directly or indirectly. It seems to me illogical that the very act he has forbidden with the view to keep and secure the land in his devisee's hands should be invoked as a reason to turn him out of it. His intention was to take away from him the right he would by law otherwise have had to defeat the object he had in view and to set at naught the provisions he had enacted to force him to execute his decrees. He cannot have intended to leave him the power of voluntarily forfeiting the devise. The law would be inconsistent if it authorised the restraint and at the same time authorised the devisee to brush it away and, if he himself is the sole heir at law, allowed him to so get rid of the restraint. The interpretation, by construction, of the penalty of forfeiture in the will in question would import an intestacy resulting in a gift over of which the testator has not said a word, and bring about the very result he cautiously guarded against for twenty-five years. And the fact that he did not provide for a gift over has great importance in the construction of his will. It shows that he did not anticipate the possibility of a voluntary forfeiture of the devise by his devisee. And he did not intend to leave an intestacy. I would think, consequently, that in any case, the provision in Donald Chisholm's will that no debts contracted by his son should incumber the land devised to him during twenty-five years being void, as held by the judgment appealed from, the execution against Hugh Chisholm of the judgment recovered against him by the appellants bound the land seized, and under the sheriff's sale to the respondent, the fee simple absolute of the said land vests in him. If the restraint is valid, the mortgage is void and his title from the sheriff is good. If the restraint is invalid, the mortgage is valid and as he is the mortgagee and owner of the equity of redemption, the whole estate is vested in him.\nBy what Fry L. J. said in Hurst v. Hurst[12], I cannot but admit that he would probably qualify this reasoning as absurd. But I cannot here be bound by that opinion. Even the adherents of the waning ] colonial servilism that has hitherto found such strong retrenchments in the courts of Canada must concede that we have no claim to the monopoly of absurdities.\nIn reference to the decision of the Privy Council in Renaud v. Tourangeau[13], which has been cited at bar, and commented upon in Earls v. McAlpine[14], I refer to the late Sir William Collis Meredith's judgment in Bourget v. Blanchard[15]. More than usual weight attaches to the judgment of that eminent lawyer in that case upon the cognate question there before him from the fact that it was his opinion that had prevailed in the Privy Council in the Renaud v. Tourangeau (1) case. Now Renaud v. Tourangeau (1), as explained in Bourget v. Blanchard (3), is a clear authority that as the will did not say in that case that the breach of the prohibition would work forfeiture of the bequest, the breach did not work forfeiture. Of course, if it were the express provision imposing forfeiture in a will that made the prohibition illegal, such a provision could not by construction be read in any will if not in it in express terms.\nIn fine, I have not failed to notice that the heir-at-law is not a party to the case, and that the judgment as to him will not be res judicata.\nI would have hesitated, under the circumstances, to force this title on the respondent. However, under the form in which the case has been submitted to the court, he must be taken to have consented that the question of its validity should be determined in the absence of the heir-at-law.\nThe appeal will be allowed, judgment to be entered for the appellants in the action. No costs are allowed to either party in either court. SEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I have doubts in this case but not strong enough to dissent from the result.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question raised for our decision in this case is whether a general prohibition on alienation attached to a devise in fee of lands which prohibition would, if unlimited, be bad by the rules of Common Law, is made good by being limited as to time. I am of opinion that it is not. The will of Donald Chisholm after devising his farm of 100 acres to his two sons William and Hugh in fee and equally dividing it between them, contained the following provision:\nI will that the aforesaid parcels of land shall not be at their disposal at any time until the end of twenty-five years from the date of my decease, and farther, I will that the said parcels of land shall remain free from all incumbrance, and that no debts contracted by my sons, William Chisholm and Hugh Chisholm, shall by any means incumber the same during twenty-five years from the date of my decease.\nWith the exception of the limitation as to time the restraint upon alienation by the devisees is general. The question is one of real property law, and it is a pure question of authority. The general rule avoiding conditions which prohibited a grantee in fee from alienating his land is to be found clearly laid down in all the earlier books of authority, and is founded upon principles about which there can be no doubt and which are easily intelligible. But there can be equally little doubt that upon this general rule there have been grafted several exceptions. The cases of Gill v. Pearson[16], in which the judgment of the full Court of King's Bench was delivered by Lord Ellen-borough, and the later case of In re Macleay[17], decided by Jessell M. R., establish the existence of exceptions to the general rule which it is not necessary for us to call in question. These two cases determine that a restriction upon alienation prohibiting it to a particular class of individuals is good. All the leading text writers upon real property law cite these cases with approval and in my opinion it is too late in the day now for us to call them in question. The whole subject is reviewed exhaustively by Pearson J. in the case of In re Rosher[18]. The same question that is now before us was there before him and he held that the proviso in the will he was construing amounted to an absolute restraint upon alienation during the life of the testator's widow and that it was void in law. The learned judge, while admitting that authority could be found in the notes to Shepherd's Touchstone, 7th. ed., p. 130, for the proposition that a \"grantee might also be restrained from alienation for a particular time being a reasonable one,\" went on to declare, p. 821:\nBrit there has been no judicial decision to that effect; and it is a curious thing that although Littleton's book is more than 400 years old and although Lord Coke died 250 years ago there is not a single judicial decision to be found in the books shewing that a limitation as to time added to such a condition makes it a valid condition.\nHe further stated that even without judicial decision, if he found that this had been an \"accepted dictum of law,\" and that by not following it he should be disturbing anything done in former times over and over again on the faith of the dictum, he should feel himself bound by it, and that it would be exceedingly mischievous to attempt to alter any rule which had been adopted and acquiesced in for more than a century. But he does not find that any such rule existed with respect to the validity of a general restraint upon alienation being validated by a limitation of the time within which it is to be exercised, and he concludes as follows:\nI find that the original rule which says that you cannot annex to a gift in fee simple a condition which is repugnant to that gift is a plain and intelligible rule. So far as I can find that an exception to the rule has been laid down and judiciously decided, I am bound by that exception. But I will not add other exceptions for which I can find no authority and the addition of which to my mind will only introduce uncertainty and confusion into the law which we have to administer.\nIf an exception to a general rule of law is well established by the cases I am not bound to inquire into the logical sufficiency of the reasons given. And so I do not feel it necessary to discuss the cases of Gill v. Pearson[19], or In re Macleay[20], or to justify the reasons which underlaid these decisions. In allowing this appeal we are, it is true, following the decision of Re Rosher[21], but we are not over-ruling either of the other cases above referred to in which limited restraints upon alienation were allowed. The decision we have reached while not being contrary to any judicial decision in England follows that of Pearson J. in Re Rosher, (3) and is in line with the late cases of Re Parry v. Daggs[22]; Corbett v. Corbett[23]; and also with Renaud v. Tourangeau[24]; and the Irish case of Martin v. Martin[25].\nWe have of course been pressed by the case of Earls v. McAlpine[26] decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1881. The restriction upon alienation in that case was no doubt one limited as to time and on the point we have now before us. But the case of Re Rosher (3) had not then been decided, and the authorities cited by Mr. Justice Patterson, namely, Daniel v. Abby[27]; Doe v. Pearson[28]; and In Re Macleay[29]; while they support the contention that a restriction upon alienation limited to a specified class only may be good, do not support the proposition we are asked to indorse that a general restriction upon alienation which, if unrestricted as to time would be admittedly bad, is made good by a time limitation. It seems to me that a time limitation is necessary in any case where restrictions upon alienations are attempted to be imposed upon a fee simple devise, even with respect to a class of persons; otherwise the devise might be bad as contravening the rule against perpetuities. But I cannot concur in the proposal that we should enlarge the exceptions to the general rule against restrictions upon alienations by the addition of one not at any rate judicially adopted in England and which would give validity to a restriction otherwise bad simply by limiting the time during which it should last. I cannot find any rule for determining how long this time might be beyond that suggested by Mr. Preston in his note to Shepherd's Touchstone, p. 130, that \"it must not trench on the law against perpetuities.\" But while that suggestion with respect to a time limitation may be good and necessary when applied to restrictions limited to a class of persons, and which might otherwise be bad for remoteness, I cannot, either on reason or authority, find that its application to a general restriction bad in itself operates to make that restriction good.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and it should be declared that Hugh Chisholm took a fee simple absolute by his father's will in the lands devised to him and was able to convey the same in fee notwithstanding the restriction in the will. And also that the fee simple in the lands was subject to sale under execution as against Hugh Chisholm for his debts.\nMILLS J.\u2014This case arose in reference to the construction of a clause in the will of the late Donald Chisholm, of the township of Mosa, in the county of Middlesex and province of Ontario. The testator died on the 27th February, 1887, and at the time of his death was seized, in fee simple, of the south half of lot No. 3, in the eighth concession of Mosa. He made a will which was duly proved, and by which he devised to two of his sons William and Hugh, his real estate. To William, he devised the east half of the south half of the lot before mentioned; and to Hugh, he devised the west half of the south half of the said lot. The will of the testator contained a clause which restrained the devisees from encumbering, for a number of years, the land devised to them. The clause in question is as follows:\nI will that the aforesaid parcels of land shall not be at their disposal at any time until the end of twenty-five years from the date of my decease, and farther, I will that the said parcels of land shall remain free from all incumbrance, and that no debts contracted by my sons, William Chisholm and Hugh Chisholm, shall, by any means, incumber the same, during twenty-five years from the date of my decease.\nThe question whether or not his absolute restraint of alienation, and the withholding of power to charge the land with the debts of the devisees, is a restraint allowed by law, is the question to be decided.\nIt is not necessary to enter into a very full discussion of the origin and history of estates in land which the English law permits, and how those estates arose, with the incidents which the law now attaches to them.\nI may say that, at one time, the tenant held whatever estate he possessed from the lord of the fee, for his own life, upon condition of certain service, and he could make no transfer of his tenure to another without his lord's consent. He had sworn fealty to his lord, and was bound to render the necessary service for the estate which he held. Subsequently, the tenant of the fee was permitted to part with a portion of his holding, so long as he retained enough in his possession to give security for the service which, by his oath, he was bound to perform. All this was changed by the statute quia emptores, enacted in the eighteenth year of Edward I., and which, while it authorised the tenant to sell his estate in the land, forbade sub-infatuation. Thereafter, the holder of the fee had the right to alienate his interest, and to grant an estate in fee simple, and the purchaser stood to the superior lord in the same position as the vendor had done before him. The holder of the fee has, by law, since then, the right to convey away his tenure, and any attempt to restrain him and to limit his exercise of powers which are incident to the estate, are repugnant to it, and therefore void. Littleton, in his works on Tenures, says:\nSec. 360. Also if a feoffment be made upon this condition, that the feoffee shall not alien the land to any, the condition is void, because when a man is enfeoffed of lands or tenements, he has power to alien them to any person by the law. For if such condition should be good, then the condition should oust him of all the power which the law gives him, which should be against reason, and therefore, such a condition is void\nBut the following section qualifies this and says:\nBut if the condition be such that the feoffee shall not alien to such a one, naming his name, or to any of his heirs, or of the issues of such a one, &c., or the like, which condition does not take away all power of alienation from the feoffee, then such condition is good. This is not a general restraint on alienation, but only a restraint which prevented the property from passing into the hands of one who might be an enemy As put by Mr. Stephen in his commentaries:\nIt was owing to the power of the nobles to make war upon each other, and the frequent use of this right, which made it necessary that a lord might not have a tenant imposed upon him, or the tenant a lord.\nMr. Stephen says:\nFor we may remember that, by the feudal law, a pure and genuine feud could not be transferred by one feudatory to another without the consent of the lord, lest thereby a feeble or suspicious tenant might have been substituted and imposed upon him to perform the feudal services, instead of one on whose abilities and fidelity he could depend. As the feudatory could not alien it in his lifetime, so neither could he by will defeat the succession by devising his feud to another family, nor even alter the course of it by imposing particular limitation, or by prescribing an unusual path of descent. Nor could he alien the estate, even with the consent of the lord, unless he had also obtained the consent of his own next apparent or presumptive heir. And therefore it was usual, in very ancient feoffments, to express that the alienation was made by consent of the heirs of the feoffor; or sometimes for the heir apparent himself to join with the feoffor in the grant. And on the other hand, as the feudal obligation was looked upon to be reciprocal, the lord could not alien or transfer his seigniory without the consent of his vassal; for it was esteemed unreasonable to subject a feudatory to a new superior, with whom he might have a deadly enmity, without his own approbation; or even to transfer his fealty without his being thoroughly apprised of it, that he might know with certainty to whom his renders and services were due; and be able to distinguish a lawful distress for rent, from a hostile seizing of his cattle by the lord of a neighbouring clan.[30]\nThe restraints upon alienation, which were the logical outcome of the feudal system, were gradually relaxed. There was the law of Henry I which enabled a man to dispose of the land which he himself had purchased, for over them the law recognised in him a more extensive power than over those which had come to him by descent from his ancestors He was not, however, to dispose of the whole of what he had acquired, if by doing so he disinherited his children. He might sell one-fourth of what he had inherited, with the consent of the heir. These restrictions were removed by the statute of Quia Emptores, which conferred upon all tenants, whether tenants in chivalry or in sergeanty, the liberty to alien their lands except in the case of the King's tenants in capite, subject to the condition that the purchaser of the fee should hold of the chief lord, and not of the grantor. Pearson J., in referring to the restraint upon alienation mentioned by Littleton, says:\nT confess that I am absolutely at a loss to understand how that exception arose, because it is plainly just as much repugnant to the gift as any other condition would be, for the implied power given to alien to any person or persons he pleases includes a liberty to alien to J. S. if he chooses to do so.\nI think when we trace the history of real property law, that it is not difficult to understand how the limited restraint mentioned by Littleton came into existence. It must not be forgotten that under the feudal system the right of alienation was restrained. That system established certain relations between the lord and his tenant. It was based upon an implied contract upon which the structure of society, as it then existed, rested, and it could not be departed from without the common consent of those concerned. The relaxations in the system are indicative of the changes which society itself was undergoing, and these relaxations did not proceed equally in the direction of all parties concerned. The law, as we would be inclined to make it so as to give to it logical consistency, did not at any time exist.\nIt is the scientific and systematised view that we get from looking back historically over the field after a good deal of progress has been made. It is reasonable to say that where an estate is bestowed, of which the power of alienation is an incident, that one conveying such an estate to another shall not have the power to alter its character, and to make it something wholly different from what it has been made by the law. To do so is to assume the power to make an estate unknown to the law. It is an attempt not simply to convey away an estate, but to exercise a legislative power, and to create a new form of property in land. It was decided in the Wiltes claim of peerage\nthat the Crown could not give to the grant of a dignity or honour, a quality of descent unknown to the law,\nand much less can a private party create an estate in fee simple divested of an alienable character. When we examine the history of real property, we find that after a long series of years there was gradually attached to it those incidents which it now possesses.\nIn 1325 complaint was made in Parliament that the rule applicable to tenants in chief of the Crown were being extended to tenants who held of honours, which had fallen into the King's hands. The King acknowledged the distinction, and admitted that, as the lord of an honour, he had only such rights as were given to other lords by the charter.\nIn 1327, a statute was passed to provide that where alienation was made without a license the King was only entitled to a reasonable fine, and not to a forfeiture of the land.\nIn 1341, it was suggested in the courts of law that before the thirteenth year of Henry III a tenant in chief might alien without a license from the King.\nIn 1346, it was asserted and denied that prior to the thirteenth year of Henry III a tenant in chief of the Crown was as free to alien as any other tenant. In 1352, the question was discussed whether in Henry III's reign the tenant in chief could subinfeudate without license, and it seems to have been held that he could.\nIn 1355, the lawyers again discuss the subject whether anything happened after the twentieth year of Henry III to prevent subinfeudation by tenants in chief.\nIn 1360, a statute was passed which confirmed all subinfeudations made under Edward III and earlier Kings[31].\nThe changes that took place in the law of real property were usually more favourable to the lords than to the tenants. If we look to the charters of the time, it would seem as though from the conquest onward the tenant could alien without the lord's consent; but this was not the case, for we find that in Chester, after the conquest, the confirmation both of the earl and the King was sought, and it is shown by Pollock and Maitland, in their history of the law, that no gift was considered safe that was not confirmed by the King, and that confirmations were paid for, which show that the lord might call in question a feoffment to which he had not given his consent. They also point out that the fee simple is the starting point of English real property law. That the tenant could lawfully do anything which did not damage the interest of the lord. The function of declaring the law fell, in time, to professional lawyers, who favoured men of religion. They were, for the most part, ecclesiastics, and their inclination was to loosen the feudal burden whenever that could be done without prejudice to the King's interest, and they were disposed to concede to the tenant the power of dealing with his own interest in the land. For a time the tenant who wished to alienate had to obtain the consent of his presumptive heir. But early in the thirteenth century this restraint had disappeared, and the word \"heir\" which at one time meant the party who was to succeed the holder, came to show that the tenant held an estate that would continue as long as any heir of his was living, and so the word indicated the endurance of an estate held by one who might have no heir to succeed.\nThe King's prerogative grew gradually out of the right allowed to the lord, though it exceeded it. It was first asserted in an Ordinance of 1256, though it was not strictly enforced. It was said that no one could alien unless his assigns had been mentioned. This assumed that the power of conveying away his estate was bestowed upon him by the previous holder, and without it he could not transfer it. There can be no doubt that the use of the term assigns played an important part in the destruction of those old rules by which the alienation of real property was fettered.\nThe liberty of disposition which the King's courts, in their interpretation of the law, conceded to landholders was so large that it sometimes gave rise to new forms of restraint. As the common law about alienation became clear and well defined feoffors sought to place themselves outside of it by express bargains. Sometimes the stipulation is that the lord shall have the right of pre-emption, sometimes that the lands shall not be conveyed to men of religion. We have seen that the King's tenants in capite could never safely alien their lands without the King's license, and if they did the land might be seized by the King as a forfeit, according to the rigour of the old law regulating the relation between lord and vassal. But by the time of Edward III this was thought too severe a penalty; and it was enacted by 1 Edward III, St. 2 c. 12 that the King should not, in such a case, hold the land in forfeit, but that in all cases of such alienation he should have such a reasonable fine as Chancery might determine. This forfeiture for alienation was wholly taken away, and a fine to be paid by the King's tenants, as a matter of course, was substituted therefor. Some years later, to quiet the title in property, a statute was passed to confirm all alienations made by tenants in chief during the reign of Henry III and before.\nThe law, as it was ultimately shaped in respect to restraints upon alienation, is very fairly stated by Mr. Cruise in his Digest of the Law of Real Property. He says:\nWhere a sum of money is charged upon a real estate, which estate comes to a person entitled to the money, if in fee the charge is merged; and where the money is secured by a term of years, or other legal estate, in the third person, there the charge is also merged, except where the creditors are concerned, or where the person becoming entitled to the charge is an infant and dies during his minority, having by will disposed of the charge[32].\nA condition repugnant to the nature of the estate to which it is annexed is void in its creation. Thus a feoffment in chief upon condition that the feoffees shall not take profits is void, as repugnant and against law, and the estate given is absolute.\nSec. 22. A condition annexed to the creation of an estate in fee simple that the tenant shall not alien is void, being repugnant to the nature of the estate, a power of alienation being an incident inseparably annexed to an estate in fee simple. * * * *\nSec 26. If lands be given in tail, upon condition that neither the tenant in tail, nor his heirs, shall alien in fee, or in tail, or for the term of another's life, but only for their own lives, such a condition is good, because these alienations are contrary to the Statute De Donis[33].\nThese citations from Cruise are in harmony with nearly all the decisions of recent years. The power of alienation is an inseparable incident to an estate in fee simple and there is no power in the proprietor of such an estate to devise it upon condition that the devisee shall have no power to a lienate. In the case of Re Macleay[34] the devise was \"to my brother John of the whole of the property given to me by my aunt, Clara Perkins, on the condition that he never sells it out of the family\" and this restraint Sir George Jessel, the Master of the Rolls, held was a valid condition. There were two previous cases upon which he chiefly relied Daniel v. Ubley[35] and Doe d. Gill v. Pearson[36].\nIn the case of Daniel v. Ubley (2), a man had devised his lands to his wife to dispose at her will and pleasure, and to give to such of their sons as she thinks best. It was held by Crew C. J. Whitlock, and Dodridge JJ. against Jones J. that the wife had a fee simple in point of interest in the estate, while Jones J. held that she had a life estate with a power to dispose of the fee simple. If Mr. Justice Jones' view were correct there would be nothing in that case at variance with the principle contended for by Pearson J. in Rosher v. Rosher[37], and this seems to have been the view taken by Parker C. J. in the case of Tomlinson v. Dighton[38], in which he says \"with respect to the first question, viz, what estate passes by the will to Margaret, the testator's wife,\" we are all of opinion she has but an estate for life, with the power of disposing of the inheritance. And to this the difference is, where a power is given with a particular description and limitation of the estate (as here), and where general, as to the executor to give or sell; for in the former case, the estate limited being expressed and certain the power is a distinct gift, and comes by way of addition; but in the latter, the whole is general and indefinite; and as the persons entrusted are to convey a fee, they must consequently, and by necessary construction, be supposed to have a fee themselves. This is an important rule, for distinguishing between a power and an estate Doe d. Gill v. Pearson[39]. Here one having real and personal estate gave by his will several legacies and annuities, which he directed to be paid by his executrices out of his real and personal estate, which he charged therewith; and then devised certain lands, in the County of York, to his daughters Anne Collut and Hannah Collut, subject to certain legacies and annuities, and in case that either of them should have no issue, they or she having no issue should have no power to dispose of her share, except to her sisters, or their children; and he devised all the rest and residue of his real and personal estates to Anne Collut and Hannah Collut in fee, whom he made his executrices. There were three other sisters. On his death, the executrices entered into possession; afterwards Anne Collut levied a fine of her moiety to the use of her husband in fee, and died. The court held that the condition against alienation, except to sisters or their children, annexed to the devise to Anne and Hannah Collut, and their heirs, was good; and that for the breach of it by Anne, in levying such fine, the heirs of the devisor might enter on her moiety, it being a remainder undisposed of by the residuary clause, which was intended to operate upon such things of which no disposition had been made by the will, and not contemplating the devise over of the respective moieties of the daughters on non-performance of the condition; and held, that one of the several heirs of the devisor might enter for non-performance or breach of the conditions, and recover her own share in ejectment. For that where the entry upon a claim by one of several co-larceners, who make but one heir, is unlawful, such entry made generally will vest the seisin in all as the entry of all. The English cases, apart from these, all recognise the principle that the right of alienation is a necessary incident of the fee.\nChitty J. says In re Machu:\nThe principle that existed in the minds of the old lawyers is clear; they held that an estate could be limited to a person until the happening of an event, and then over, so that when the event happened the estate in that person ceased, and went over; but that if a deed or will contained a devise or gift of an estate in fee simple, and then went on to state that provided something happened the estate should be defeated, that was a condition, and void because it would not operate as a remainder in common law. Therefore, in the law of real property a distinction was made between a condition pure and simple, and a conditional limitation; and that distinction subsists at the present day.\nCt. Attwater v. Attwater[40]; Ware v. Cann[41]; Gulliver v. Vaux[42]; Porter v. Baddeley[43]; Doe d. Stevenson v. Glover[44]; Watkins v. Williams[45]; Shaw v. Ford[46]; In re Rosher; Rosher v. Rosher[47]; In re Parry & Daggs[48]; Renaud v. Tourangeau[49]; Corbett v. Corbett[50]; In re Machu[51]; Holmes v. Godson[52]; Fuller v. Chamier[53].\nWhere property is given absolutely a condition cannot be annexed to the gift inconsistent with its absolute character, and where a devise in fee is made upon condition that the estate shall be shorn of some of its necessary incidents, as that the wife shall not be endowed, or that the husband shall not have curtesy, or that the proprietor shall not have the power to alien, either generally, or for a time limited, such conditions are void, because they are repugnant to the character of the estate[54].\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed, and it should be declared that Hugh Chisholm took an estate in fee simple, relieved from the restrictions imposed by his father's will upon the sale of the estate, and against incumbering it with any debts which he may contract.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

On 2nd March, 1903, on application on behalf of the plaintiff by counterclaim, Mr. Justice Craig amended this judgment by directing an account to be taken of the amount owing by the defendant (Barrett) in the original action, to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, plaintiff therein, and that the difference between the amount of the judgment of the bank against the plaintiff by counterclaim (a defendant in the original action) and the amount owing by the defendant, Barrett, to the bank, should be set off pro tanto against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff by counterclaim against the defendant Joseph Barrett. The judgment as amended was issued on the 4th of March, 1903. On 2nd April, 1903, Barrett gave notice of appeal to the Territorial Court, en banc, and, on 8th April, applied to Dugas J., a judge of said court, to extend the time for filing the appeal books. The court, sitting en banc, is composed of three judges. On the application Dugas J. stated that, for special reasons, he would not sit on the hearing of the appeal and absolutely refused to act in the case, at any stage of the proceedings. The affidavit alleged that by reason of this refusal there could be no quorum for the purpose of the hearing en banc. On 8th April, applications were made, respectively by the Syndicat and Barrett, to extend the time for appealing to the Supreme Court to enable an application to be made for leave to appeal per saltum, and an order was made by one of The judges of the Territorial Court extending the time until 11th June, 1903. In April a notice of motion was given by the Syndicat returnable before the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada, in Chambers, on 18th May, 1903, for leave to appeal per saltum to that court from the judgment in favour of the Bank. Barrett thereupon gave notice of a similar motion for leave to appeal per saltum from the judgment on the counterclaim, but did not proceed with it in view of a settlement made between the Syndicat and the bank, on 6th May. Upon an application, on behalf of Barrett, on 8th June, 1903, an order was made by Mr. Justice Craig extending the time for appealing per saltum to the Supreme Court of Canada for the period of seventy-five days from 11th June, 1903.\nDaly for the motion, cited Schultz v. Wood ([1]) Walmsley v. Griffith ([2]); Vaughan v. Richardson ([3]); and News Printing Company v. Macrae ([4]).\nBethune opposed the motion.\nOn 18th August the following judgment was pronouncd by\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014This is an application by the defendant, John Barrett, for leave to appeal per saltum from a judgment of Mr. Justice Craig of the Territorial Court of the Yukon, pronounced on the 19th of February, 1893, and subsequently amended on the 2nd of March, 1903, and issued on the 4th of March, 1903.\nIt is alleged, and not denied, that Mr. Justice Dugas, for personal reasons, refused to sit as a member of the Territorial Court upon the proposed appeal to that court from the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, and in the affidavit in support of the application of Mr. Pattullo, it is alleged, and not denied, that without the presence of Mr. Justice Dugas there can be no quorum of the Territorial Court. I have had difficulty in obtaining any definite information with respect to the constitution and jurisdiction of the Territorial Court of the Yukon. Section 6 of the Act 62-63 Vict. ch. 11, provides as follows:\nThe law governing the residence, tenure of office, and oath of office of the judge or judges of the court and the rights, privileges, power, authority and jurisdiction of the court and the judge or judges thereof, shall be the same, mutatis mutandis, as the law governing the residence, tenure of office and oath of office of the judges, and the rights, privileges, power, authority and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and of the judges of that court, except as the same are expressly varied by this Act.\nUpon looking at the North-west Territories Act ([5]) we find that by section 42 as amended by 63 & 64 V. c. 44 the Supreme Court of the territories consists of a chief justice and four puisne judges; and by section 49 as amended by 61 V. c. 5, s. 3, three of the judges of the court constitute a quorum.\nUpon inquiry at the Department of the Interior I find that the judges of the Territorial Court consist of Justices Craig, Dugas and Macauley. The Gold Commissioner, in certain cases, is also a member of that court, but would not be qualified to sit in the present case had it been taken to appeal.\nThe first question to be decided is whether, assuming. Mr. Justice Dugas unable to sit, would there be a properly constituted Territorial Court to hear this appeal, if that court consisted only of Justices Craig and Macauley; and would section 6 of 62 & 63 V. c. 11 so apply as to give them jurisdiction?\nThe answer to be given to this inquiry, in my judgment, is by no means clear. As I have before remarked the view of the lawyers in Dawson City and, I may (1) R. S. C, ch. 50. assume, of the Yukon Territorial Court, is that the three judges must sit to form a quorum. The affidavits filed on this application show that the time for appealing to the Territorial Court has expired, and if I should refuse this application the result would be that the appellant would be deprived of any appeal.\nIn a recent case in the Supreme Court from the Yukon Territory an appeal was taken direct to the Supreme Court from a judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, although, at that time by 2 Ed. VII. ch. 35, sec. 6, it was provided that the Territorial Court en banc might hear and dispose of motions for new trials, appeals and motions in the nature of appeals.\nNo motion to quash was made by the respondent, but the court, viewing the question as one of some doubt, of its own motion granted leave to appeal per saltum.\nIn the present case the matter is equally a doubtful one, and in my judgment it is a case in which, under all the circumstances leave to appeal per saltum should be granted, unless the objection taken by Mr. Bethune is allowed, namely, that sixty days having elapsed since the date of the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, neither the Supreme Court nor the court below has or had power to extend the time for bringing the appeal. On this point I find the matter has been determined by the present Chief Justice of the court in an unreported case of Roberts v. Donovan, decided in Chambers on the 8th July, 1895. In that case, upon an application to the Registrar for leave to appeal per saltum the same was refused because more than sixty days had elapsed since the signing of the judgment proposed to be appealed from; the learned Registrar holding that sec. 40 applied, and that the application was too late. His judgment was affirmed by the present Chief Justice. The only distinction between that and the present application lies in the fact that an order has been made by a judge of the Territorial Court extending the time for making the application to the Supreme Court. I am unable to find in sec. 42, or elsewhere in the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, power given to the court below to make such an order. That section clearly, in my mind, applies only to cases where the court below could make an order allowing the appeal; but, in the present case, the court below has no jurisdiction to allow an appeal per saltum, and therefore, in my opinion, the order extending the time for the present application was made without jurisdiction. It has long been the settled jurisprudence of the Supreme Court; Walmsley v. Griffith ([6]); The News Printing Co. v. Macrae ([7]); that neither the court itself nor any judge thereof has jurisdiction to extend the time within which an appeal must be brought as provided for by section 40 of the Act. I regret I feel compelled to hold that neither has the court below such jurisdiction where the proposed appeal is per saltum from the trial judge. Cases must frequently arise like the present in which justice only can be done by extending the time for bringing the appeal.\nBy Parliament alone however can the remedy be provided. The motion must be refused with costs.\nOn the motion by way of appeal His Lordship the Chief Justice, in Chambers, after hearing the same counsel for the parties, affirmed the Registrar's decision.\nMotion refused with costs.\n[1] 6 Can.

When the Act took effect, on 16th May, 1890, the Dominion Lands Regulations of 17th September, 1889, were in force providing that all lands in Manitoba and the North-West Territories should be granted by letters patent containing a reservation of all mines and minerals and the rights necessary for carrying on mining operations. As the railway was constructed, orders-in-council were passed from time to time allotting to the railway company certain of the lands reserved as subsidy under the Act, there being no reference made in the orders-in-council to the land regulations.\nThe Exchequer Court, by the judgment appealed from, held that lands granted as subsidy to railways under 53 Vict. ch. 4 (D.), were subject to the existing land regulations respecting the reservation of baser minerals in the grants thereof, notwithstanding that there was no reference thereto in the orders-in-council allotting the lands to the railway company and that the grant was expressed in the statute to be a free grant subject merely to cost of survey and expenses.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, there being an equal division of opinion among the judges who had heard the appeal, the judgment appealed from stood affirmed and the appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nHelmuth K.C. and Dyce W.

The fall of the scaffold was alleged to have occurred on account of negligence on the part of the defendant in constructing it in an improper manner, insufficient for the purposes for which it was intended and allowing it to become overladen with stone. The defence, in effect set up that the fall of the scaffold resulted from the contributory negligence of deceased in disobeying orders and willfully overloading the scaffold while the foreman was momentarily absent. The work was being carried on in waters affected by the ebb and flow of the tides and appeared to have been of a dangerous character unless it was carefully performed under the surveillance of an experienced overseer. The trial was had before the Chief Justice, Sir L. N. Cassault, who dismissed the action on the ground that deceased had been the cause of his own death through wilful disobedience of orders and gross negligence. The judgment appealed from affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec ([2]), which reversed the judgment rendered at the trial and held that \"in order to free himself from civil responsibility in such a case, an employer should, either personally or through his overseer or foreman, not only give orders to his employees to discontinue work when considered dangerous, but that he should also, either personally or through the overseer or foreman, see that such orders were respected and carried out and that, if he failed to do so, he would be liable for damages caused by accidents happening as the result of the non-observance of the orders. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nGibsone for the appellant.\nLane for the respondent.\n[1] Q.R.21S.C.99.\n[2] Q.

In the Exchequer Court the decision was, in effect, that as the lands at the time of the expropriation had a prospective value for residential and other purposes beyond that which then attached to them as lands used for agricultural and other similar purposes, such prospective value should be taken into consideration in the assessment of the sufficient and just compensation that ought to be paid by the Crown upon the expropriations for public purposes to be used in such a manner as would, in various ways, affect the lands injuriously and diminish their prospective values. In assessing the increased compensation awarded the Exchequer Court Judge looked at the assessed valuation of the lands as shewn upon the municipal assessment rolls, not as a determining consideration, but as affording some assistance in arriving at a fair valuation of the property taken.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nPugsley K.C. and Alward K.C. for appellants, The Turnbull Real Estate Company.\nPugsley K.C. for the appellants, Corkery et al.\nCoster K.C. for the appellants, DeBury et al.\nMcAlpine K.C. for the respondent.\n[1] 8 Ex.

L.R. 127), and restoring that at the trial (32 O.R. 369), Girouard J. contra, that the renewal is not a new contract of insurance. Therefore, where the original policy was void for non-disclosure of prior insurance the renewal was likewise a nullity though the prior insurance had ceased to exist in the interval.\nHeld, per Girouard J. that the renewal was a new contract which was avoided by non-disclosure of the concealment in the application for the original policy.\nThe mortgage clause attached to a policy of insurance against fire, which provided that \u201cthe insurance as to the interest only of the mortgagees therein shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, &c,\u201d applies only to acts of the mortgagor after the policy comes into operation and cannot be invoked as against the concealment of material facts by the mortgagor in his application for the policy.\nQu\u0153re. Would the mortgage clause entitle the mortgagee to bring an action in his own name alone on the policy?\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of defendant company. The facts of the case are stated by Armour C.J.O. in the Court of Appeal as follows:\n\u201cBy a policy of the defendant company, under the hand and seal of one of its directors, it was witnessed that one Calvin Randolph Annott, Esq., of the Village of Watford, having paid to the defendant company the sum of $26.25 for the insurance against loss or damage by fire (subject to the conditions and stipulations indorsed thereon which constituted the basis of the insurance) of the property thereinafter described to the amount thereinafter mentioned, not exceeding upon any one article the sum specified on such article, namely:\u2014\u2018$300 on the building only of his brick galvanized iron roofed building, 24 x 45, occupied by the assured as a cold storage building, situate and being on a part of lot No. 27, west side of Main street, Village of Watford, Ont., marked No. 1 on diagram, indorsed on assured\u2019s application No. 140312, which form part hereof and are his warranty;\u2019 \u2018$1,200 on his machinery and fixtures therein attached and affixed thereto;\u2019 \u2018$1,500. Fifteen hundred dollars. Loss, if any, under this policy payable to Agricultural Savings and Loan Company, London, Ont.\u2019 \u2018Other concurrent insurance $600 on first item and $700 on second item on Alliance,\u2019 \u2018Subject to mortgage clause hereto attached.\u2019 And the defendant company did thereby agree that from the 9th day of May, 1898, until 12 o\u2019clock noon on the 9th day of May, A.D. 1899, and for so long afterwards as the said insured, his or her or their heirs, executors or administrators, should from time to time pay or cause to be paid the sum of $26.25 to the defendant company or to the known agents thereof, on or before the commencement of each and every succeeding twelve months, and the board of directors should agree thereto by accepting the same, the funds and property of the defendant company should (subject to the conditions and stipulations indorsed thereon which constituted the basis of that insurance) be subject and liable to pay, reinstate or make good to the said insured, his or her or their heirs, executors or administrators, such loss or damage as should be occasioned by fire to the property therein above mentioned and thereby insured, not exceeding in each case respectively the sum or sums thereinbefore severally specified and stated against each property.\n\u201cThe \u2018conditions and stipulations\u2019 indorsed on the policy were not the conditions prescribed by the statute, and this policy must be held to be subject not to the conditions and stipulations indorsed thereon, but to the statutory conditions.\n\u201cThe mortgage clause to which this policy was made subject was as follows:\u2014\u2018It is hereby provided and agreed that this insurance as to the interest of the mortgagees only therein shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by this policy. It is further provided and agreed that the mortgagees shall at once notify said company of non-occupation or vacancy for over thirty days, or of any change of ownership or increased hazard that shall come to their knowledge, and that every increase of hazard not permitted by the policy to the mortgagor or owner shall be paid for by the mortgagees on reasonable demand from the date such hazard existed, according to the established scale of rates for the use of such increased hazard during the continuance of this insurance. It is also further provided and agreed that whenever the company shall pay the mortgagees any sum for loss under this policy and shall claim that as to the mortgagor or owner no liability therefor existed, it shall at once be legally subrogated to all rights of the mortgagees under all the securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt, to the extent of such payment, or at its option the company may pay to the mortgagees the whole principal due or to grow due on the mortgage with interest, and shall thereupon receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all other securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt, but no such subrogation shall impair the rights of the mortgagees to recover the full amount of their claim. It is also further provided and agreed that in the event of this property being further insured with this or any other office on behalf of the owner or mortgagee, the company, except such other insurance when made by the mortgagor or owner shall prove invalid, shall only be liable for a ratable proportion of any loss or damage sustained. At the request of the assured the loss, if any, under this policy is hereby made payable to the Agricultural Saving and Loan Company as their interest may appear, subject to the conditions of the above mortgage clause.\u2019\n\u201cThe plaintiffs were the mortgagees of the insured property by virtue of a mortgage bearing date the 7th day of May, 1898, made by Calvin Randolph Annott and one James Annott, who executed the same as surety for the payment of the mortgage money in pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of mortgages, securing payment to them of the sum of $3,000 and interest as therein set forth, which said mortgage contained the following covenant: \u2018And that the said mortgagors will insure the buildings on the said lands to the amount of not less than three thousand dollars currency.\u2019\n\u201cC.R. Annott in his application for this policy in answer to the question, \u2018What other insurance and where? Name companies and amounts?\u2019 said \u2018$1,500 on above property just being taken to-day in the Alliance Assurance Company.\u2019 And by this application the applicant agreed with the defendant company \u2018that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk, and agrees and consents that the same be held to form the basis of the liability of the said company, and shall form a part and be a condition of this insurance contract,\u2019 and on the margin of the application appeared these words: \u2018Loss, if any, payable to the Agricultural Savings & Loan Co., London, Ont., as their interest may appear.\u2019\n\u201cPrior to the date of this policy and on the 25th day of April, 1898, C.R. Annott had insured the property covered by this policy in the Perth Mutual Fire Insurance Company for three years from that date in the sum of $4,000, which insurance was on the 14th April, 1899, cancelled by that company.\n\u201cThe insurance effected by this policy was renewed by the following renewal receipt:\n\u2018THE LIVERPOOL AND LONDON AND GLOBE INSURANCE COMPANY.\n\u2018Receipt No. 160389. Renewing Policy, No. 3732312\nSum insured, $1,500. Premium, $26.25.\nReceived the 9th day of May, 1899, from C.R. Annott, Esq., the sum of twenty-six 25\u2011100 dollars, being the premium for the renewal of policy above named to the ninth day of May, nineteen hundred.\nNot valid until countersigned by the company\u2019s authorized agent. at Watford.\nCountersigned at Watford, this\n8th day of May, 1899. G.F.C. SMITH,\nW.E. FITZGERALD, Resident Secretary,\nAgent. Canada Branch.\u201d\nOn February 20th, 1900, the insured premises were destroyed by fire. The insurance company refused to pay the policy on several grounds which they pleaded in the action, namely, that the mortgagees could not sue in their own names; that the non-disclosure of the insurance in the Perth Mutual avoided the policy; that the policy had been cancelled before the fire; and that there had been a material increase of the risk by a change in the use of the premises. The mortgagees met these objections by contending that the policy being a deed poll in which they were named as having an interest entitled them to sue; that the policy in the Perth Mutual was cancelled before the renewal sued on which was a new contract and not affected by the non-disclosure; that the alleged cancellation of the policy in suit was made without authority; and that there was no increase of risk. They also contended that the mortgage clause protected them against the concealment of the original action.\nThe Court of Appeal held against this last contention but decided in favour or the plaintiffs on the other grounds reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose at the trial by which the action was dismissed. The insurance company appealed.\nRiddell K.C. and Hoskin for the appellants. The policy was void for non-disclosure under the statutory conditions[3].\nIrrespective of these conditions the policy was void at its inception. See Clarkson v. Macmaster & Co.[4]; McCrea v. Waterloo Co. Mut. Ins. Co.[5]; Venner v. Sun Life Ins. Co.[6]; Thomson v. Weems[7].\nThe policy being void the renewal had no effect. Howard v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[8]; London West v. London Guarantee & Acc. Ins. Co.[9]; New England Ins. Co., v. Wetmore[10]. The contract of insurance was not with the mortgagees, and they have no right to sue. May on Insurance (4 ed.) vol. 2 sec. 424; Tweddle v. Atkinson[11]; Ex parte Richardson[12]; In re Rotherham A. & C. Co.[13]; Livingstone v. Western Assurance Co.[14]\nThe mortgage clause does not protect the mortgagee against defects in the application but only applies to acts of the mortgagor after the policy is issued. Omnium Securities Co. v. Canada Fire Ins. Co.[15]; Davis v. German-American Ins. Co.[16]\nThe risk was materially increased by the premises being left vacant. McKay v. Norwich Union Ins. Co.[17]; Hervey v. Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[18]; Kuntz v. Niagara District Fire Ins. Co.[19]; Sovereign Fire Ins. Co. v. Moir[20]; Guerin v. Manchester Fire Assurance Co.[21]\nThe respondents surrendered the policy so far as their interest was concerned, and it is immaterial in this action whether the rights of the mortgagor remain or not. Marrin v. Stadacona Ins. Co.[22]; Schwarzchild v. Ph\u00e6nix Ins. Co.[23]\nIt is claimed that the 19th statutory condition was not complied with. But that only provides for one mode of cancelling a policy and does not prevent the parties from adopting another. Schwarzchild v. Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.23\nBayley K.C. and Aylesworth K.C. for the respondents. The mortgagees had a right to sue, the policy being a deed poll and mentioning them as parties entitled to payment. Green v. Home[24]; Mitchell v. City of London Fire Ins. Co.[25]; Bower v. Hodges[26]; Gandy v. Gandy[27].\nAs to concealment of a prior insurance we contend that the renewal is a new contract the risk being a \u201cmercantile\u201d risk which the statute only allows to continue for one year. See May on Insurance (4 ed.) sec. 70a; Holt on Insurance, sec. 95.\nA fire policy differs from a life policy which is a continuing insurance so long as the premiums are paid. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Statham[28]; Long v. Ancient Order United Workmen[29].\nThe plaintiffs had no power to cancel the policy. See Caldwell v. Stadacona Fire & Life Ins. Co.[30]; Morrow v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[31]\nThere was no material increase of risk. The use of the premises was changed from cold storage to ordinary storage, the insurance rate being the same for both. See Ardill v. Citizens Ins. Co.[32]; Johnston v. Dominion Grange Mut. Fire Ins. Co.[33]\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal and restore the original judgment which dismissed the respondents\u2019 action.\nThere never was in law a contract by the appellants to insure this property, and the policy dated the 9th of May, 1898, was vitiated by fraud ab initio. The essential allegations of the respondents\u2019 statement of claim are not proved. The expressions \u201ccontinued insurance\u201d and \u201crenewed insurance,\u201d as I view the case, are therefore inaccurate, to use an euphemism. It seems to me inconsistent and illogical, after determining that the first policy was invalid, to assume that it could be in law continued or renewed, without waiver or estoppel which are not, in the least, contended for here.\nThere was by the respondents, in their argument at bar, a misapplication of the Ontario Insurance Act. The insurance of a mercantile risk, it is true, sec. 167, cannot be for more than one year, and may be renewed by renewal receipt instead of a policy. But clearly what can be renewed is a valid contract, a prior valid policy. There is no insurance of a mercantile risk if there is no insurance at all.. And the statute does not say and cannot be construed as intending to say that a contract that never existed can be renewed; it has no application whatever when there has been no prior insurance.\nThen the so-called renewal receipt is not a new contract, since there had been no prior one. It is the only contract, if any, that had existed between the appellants and the insured. Now the insured obtained the appellants\u2019 assent to this contract by his concealing from them that he had previously deceived them. By applying for a renewal, instead of a new policy, he impliedly represented to them that he had previously a valid contract with them, which he knew was a false representation. He induced them by his conduct to believe in a state of facts which, to his knowledge, was not true. By the very form and terms of the receipt, he knew that they contracted with him on the assumption that he had been insured with them previously, and he, knowing the contrary, suppressed the truth from them, and that, under the circumstances, was in law equivalent to a fraudulent misrepresentation.\nAs to the respondents\u2019 contention that they are protected by the mortgage clause we disposed of that at the hearing. That clause, as held in The Omnium Securities Co. v. The Canada Fire and Mutual Insurance Co.[34], applies only to the subsequent acts of the insured.\nThe United States decisions to the contrary cannot be followed.\nIt is moreover doubtful, in this case, if this mortgage clause can be read into the contract between the appellants and the insured.\nThe first contract being invalid the mortgage clause should share its fate. However, this is immaterial in the view I take that the clause, assuming it to form part of the contract, affords no protection to the respondents in this case.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The action arose out of a policy of fire insurance issued in the City of Montreal by the appellants in favour of one Calvin Randolph Annott on the ninth of May, 1898, for $1,500, for one year, and renewed at the end of that year, on property situated in the Village of Watford, in Ontario. The respondents held a mortgage on that property made on the seventh of May, 1898, and the loss, if any, under the policy was made payable to the respondents.\nThe appellants contend, among other things:\n1. Prior insurance with the Perth Mutual not disclosed, and even misrepresentations in this respect in the written application for the policy;\n2. The respondents are not the proper parties to sue upon the said policy; and\n3. Material facts and circumstances in the risk omitted at the time of the contract of insurance set forth in the statement of defence. The trial judge, (Rose J.,) dismissed the action upon the first ground. But, on appeal, this judgment was reversed upon both the first and the second grounds. Without expressing any opinion upon these two points, which present serious difficulties, I think the appellants are entitled to judgment upon the third ground, namely that, at the time of the renewal, the insured had not disclosed material facts and circumstances in the risk, whether requested to do so or not.\nThe conditions under which the policy was issued are the \u201cstatutory conditions\u201d contained in chapter 203 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897.\nSection 167, paragraph (1) provides that contracts of fire insurance of \u201cmercantile and manufacturing risks shall, if on the cash system,\u201d as this risk certainly was, \u201cbe for terms not exceeding one year.\u201d At the time of the renewal, therefore, a new contract of insurance was entered into, the renewal receipt being evidence of it instead of a policy. Section 167, paragraph (2), provides for renewal \u201cby renewal receipt instead of a policy,\u201d and section 168 adds that this renewed contract shall be subject to the same statutory conditions.\nSection 168, paragraph 1, under the heading \u201cstatutory conditions,\u201d declares that\nif any person or persons insures his or their buildings or goods, and * * * * misrepresents or omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the company in order to enable it to judge of the risk it undertakes, such insurance shall be of no force in respect to the property in regard to which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nThe present case comes within this section of the Ontario statute. The insured obtained his policy, notwithstanding the misrepresentation in his written application that there was only one prior insurance with the Alliance for $1500, whereas there was another one for $4,000 with the Perth Mutual, which was \u201cunknown to the appellants. True, he allowed this prior policy to drop during the currency of the first year, not being able to pay the premium for the same, and at the time of the second contract this objection did not exist. Probably the company cannot plead prior insurance, but can they not allege misrepresentation and omission of material facts at the time of the renewal? I think that, at that time, the insured was bound to disclose his false representation with regard to the prior insurance and also the circumstances of its surrender. These facts and circumstances, in my humble opinion, were material and should have been made known to the company at the time of the renewal in order to enable it to judge of the risk it undertook especially, as the renewal, under the statute of Ontario, is equivalent to a new and separate contract, as held by the Court of Appeal, and correctly held it seems to me. Applying, therefore, par. 1 of section 168 of the Ontario Insurance Act, I have come to the conclusion that the contract of insurance sued upon is of no force, null and void.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the mortgagees, the above named respondents, against the insurance company (appellants), to recover the amount of a policy issued by the latter for $1,500 on a building and machinery and fixtures therein, used as a cold storage building. The insurance had been effected on the application of the owner and mortgagor, one C.R. Annott, and pursuant to a general covenant to insure contained in his mortgage. In his application, Annott had answered in reply to the questions,\nWhat other insurance and where? Name companies and amounts? $1,500 on above property just being taken to-day in the Alliance Assurance Co. In answer to the further question:\nState fully the applicant\u2019s interest in the property, whether owner, mortgagee or lessee?\nhe had answered that he was \u201cthe owner in fee simple,\u201d and that\nthe property insured was mortgaged to the Agricultural Savings and Loan Co. of London (the respondents), for $3,000.\nHe also stated the cash value of the property to be $7,000. At the foot of the questions answered by the applicant and forming part of his application was the following covenant or agreement which was signed by him.\nAnd the said applicant hereby covenants and agrees to and with the said company that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant and are material to the risk, and agrees and consents that the same shall be held to form the basis of the liability of the said company, and shall form part and be a condition of this insurance contract. It is further agreed between the contracting parties that if the agent of the company fill up the application he will, in that case, be the agent of the applicant and not the agent of the company.\nThe application also provided that loss, if any, should be made payable to the Agricultural Savings and Loan Co., of London, as their interest might appear.\nThe policy issued pursuant to this application was what was known as a \u201cmercantile risk\u201d on the cash system and by the terms of the Ontario statute governing such contracts, section 167, c. 203, was obliged to be for a term not exceeding one year.\nSub-sec. 2 of the above section provides that;\nAny contract that may be made for one year or any shorter period on the premium note system, or for three years or any shorter period on the cash system may be renewed at the discretion of the board of directors by renewal receipt instead of policy on the insured paying the required premium, etc. The policy issued to Annott pursuant to his application made the loss, if any, under it payable to the mortgagees the respondents, and declared, following the application, that other concurrent insurance was $1,500 in the Alliance Insurance Co. The policy was, on its face, made subject to \u201cmortgage clause thereto attached\u201d which clause amongst other things provided that\nthe insurance as to the interest only of the mortgagees therein should not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by this policy.\nAt the time this insurance was effected there was not only the concurrent insurance of $1,500 in the Alliance Insurance Company, as stated in the application of Annott, but there was also another policy of insurance on the same property outstanding in the Perth Mutual Fire Insurance Company for the sum of $4,000, and of which the applicant said nothing, which made a total of $7,000 existing insurance, if all the policies attached, or the full value of the properly, as given by Annott in his application.\nThis policy of the Perth Mutual, although in force at the time of the application for insurance to the appellant company, had ceased to exist, either by cancellation or by failure to pay the renewal premiums, some time before the 9th of May, 1899, on which date the receipt was issued by the appellant company to Annott in renewal of the contract and policy made and issued by them to him on the 9th of May, 1898. That receipt was as follows:\nRENEWAL RECEIPT.\nThe Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company.\nReceipt No. 160,389. Renewing Policy, No. 3732312.\nSum insured, $1,500. Premium, $26.25.\nReceived the 9th day of May, 1899, from Calvin Randolph Annott, Esq., the sum of twenty-six 25\/100 dollars, being the premium for the renewal of policy above named, to the 9th day of May, nineteen hundred. Not valid until countersigned by the company\u2019s authorized agent at Watford.\nCountersigned at Watford, this 8th day of May, 1899.\nW.E. FITZGERALD, G.F.C. SMITH,\nAgent. Resident Secretary, Canada Branch.\nAnnott, on whose application the policy issued, left the country after the renewal receipt was issued, and in February, 1899, the property insured was destroyed by fire, and this action was brought by the respondents, the mortgagees, to whom the policy, in case of loss, was made payable in their own name alone.\nThe late Mr. Justice Rose, before whom the action was tried, dismissed it on the ground of the non-disclosure by the applicant, Annott, at the time he made his application, of the existence of the $4,000 insurance in the Perth Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and held that the subsequent payment of the renewal premium could not operate to validate an invalid policy.\nMany other important questions were afterwards raised in the Appeal Court of Ontario, and amongst them was one challenging the right of the plaintiffs, as mortgagees, to sue in their own name on the insurance contract. The plaintiffs contended that their mortgage contained a general covenant by the mortgagor to insure for $3,000; that the policy sued on was one of those taken out by the mortgagor in compliance with his covenant and contained not only a provision making the loss, if any, under it payable to them as mortgagees, but was also issued expressly subject to what was known as the \u201cmortgage clause\u201d and which was attached to the policy. It was contended by them that under such a policy and mortgage clause they had a beneficial right and a beneficial interest, and that, without their consent, the insurance company and Annott could not have cancelled the policy before a loss or made accord and satis- faction with respect to it after a loss, and that the mortgage clause constituted a specific and independent agreement with them, apart from Annott, which entitled them to sue on the policy. On the other hand, the company submitted that the policy was under seal and the covenants and agreements to pay in it were with Annott, the applicant, and with him alone, and that, as there was no assignment of the policy, no action would lie against them on it unless Annott was, at any rate, one of the plaintiffs.\nThe question is one of some doubt and there are some observations made in cases already decided in this court which seem to support the appellant company\u2019s contention, but it is not necessary for us to decide the point on this appeal. The decisions upon the point in the courts in the United States do not seem to agree as to the reason of the rule permitting mortgagees to sue in their own names nor as to the precise extent of the rule, while in England there does not appear to be any decision upon this special point. It is difficult to understand why mortgagees desirous of securing themselves collaterally by insurance upon the mortgaged property should not either have the policy assigned to them or so framed as to exclude doubts of their right to sue in their own name and without joining the mortgagor. One of the learned judges who delivered the judgment appealed from, Mr. Justice Osler, and whose reasons are stated in a similar case heard at the same time and brought by the mortgagees (appellants) against the Alliance Assurance Company[35], stated that in the case at bar,\nThe policy contained what was known as the subrogation or mortgage clause which is a contract by the company directly with the mortgagees, and in terms expressly renounces the right of the com- pany to set up as a defence against the mortgagees any act or neglect of the mortgagor. There was, therefore, no difficulty in holding, in that case, that neither the omission of the insured to communicate to the insurance company the existence of the policy in the Perth Mutual Insurance Company, nor the alleged change of occupation, was any answer to the action on the policy at the suit of the mortgagees whose right to sue did not rest solely upon the \u201closs if any\u201d clause.\nI have already stated that it is not necessary on this appeal for us to determine, and we do not determine, whether such a mortgage clause as was inserted in this policy gave the mortgagees such a beneficial right and interest or constituted such a direct contract between the mortgagees and the insurance company as would enable the former to sue in their own name alone and irrespective of Annott. But we are all of the opinion that whether there was or was not such a direct contract, it did not cover or relate to the statements or omissions made by the applicant, Annott, in his application for insurance and which were expressly made\nthe basis of the liability of the company, and a part and a condition of this insurance contract.\nIn our opinion the provision in the mortgage clause already quoted in words by me to the effect that\nthe insurance should not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, etc.\nhad reference to the subsequent acts or neglects of the mortgagor only and did not apply to his application for insurance or his statements or omissions therein.\nThe question which was argued at great length and with great ability before us, and on the true solution of which this appeal depends, was whether there was any valid contract of insurance at all existing, at the time the fire took place, with the London and Liverpool and Globe Insurance Company, and we are of the opinion that there was not. The application on which the contract was first entered into contained the express covenant of the applicant which I have already set out, and which was declared to form the basis of the liability of the company and a part and to be a condition of the insurance contract.\nThat covenant was that the answers of the applicant immediately foregoing to the questions put to him were a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured so far as they were known to the applicant and material to the risk. It was admitted that Annott knew of the insurance policy for $4,000 in the Perth Mutual, that he concealed the fact of its existence from the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company to whom his application was being made, that the fact was a material one to be known to the insurance company to which he was applying, that its concealment sufficed to have avoided the policy issued on his application. In my judgment the truth of the representation made of these material facts was a condition precedent to the risk attaching at all. I am clearly of the opinion that there was not any binding insurance contract existing when the renewal premium was paid and the renewal receipt issued on the 9th of May, 1899. If the premises insured had been burnt during the term of the year for which the policy in this case was issued and whether before or after the Perth Mutual insurance policy was cancelled or expired, no action would have lain against the present appellants, the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, either in the name of the mortgagor, Annott, or the mortgagees, the Repondents, or in their joint names. The condition precedent to the existence of any contract on which an action could be brought had not been performed. Whether fraudulently or not makes no difference, the existence of the $4,000 of insurance had been suppressed. Mr. Aylesworth did not argue that any valid and binding contract existed before the renewal receipt, but simply that the contract was a voidable one and not a void one. Then, as already stated, I am of the opinion that the applicant\u2019s covenant, already set out, making the truth of his answers to the questions put to him on matters within his knowledge and material to the risk the basis of the liability of the company and a condition of the contract, settles the question. The truthfulness of the answers is a condition precedent to the liability of the company attaching.\nIf any doubt remained upon the point, it would seem to me to be removed by the first statutory condition which was admittedly binding on this contract and which expressly provides that the misrepresentation or suppression of circumstances material to the risk by the applicant renders the insurance of \u201cno force\u201d in respect of the property in regard to which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nThen, did the acceptance of the renewal premium and the issuance by the insurance company of the renewal receipt, in ignorance of the truth of the facts which Annott had suppressed or misrepresented constitute a renewal or a new contract? The statute already quoted only pretends to give to the renewal receipt efficacy so far as there was a prior valid contract existing. It does not give and was never intended to give to the renewal receipt the effect of reviving a void contract or one which was of \u201cno force.\u201d The Act assumes the existence of a valid policy and points out a simple mode by which it may be renewed. But, if there was not originally a valid policy of insurance there cannot be a renewal of it. Nor, apart from the statute, do I think that there was any new contract, and that for the reasons already-given. The original contract or policy was of \u201cno force\u201d and the condition necessary to liability attaching on the part of the company never existed.\nThe appellants\u2019 policy was subject to the statutory conditions[36].\nCondition36 already referred to, provides;\nIf any person or persons insures his or their buildings or goods, and causes the same to be described otherwise than as they really are, to the prejudice of the company, or misrepresents or omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the company, in order to enable it to judge of the risk it undertakes, such insurance shall be of no force in respect to the property in regard to which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nThere can be no question that the knowledge of the amount of insurance already on the properly was very material to the risk and necessary to be known to the appellants \u201cin order to enable it to judge of the risk\u201d it was undertaking, and being withheld and misrepresented in the answers made by the applicant to the questions put to him and which answers he agreed should form the basis of the liability of the company and be a condition of the insurance contract, the risk never attached. If the risk never attached before the issuance of the renewal receipt, what was there to renew? If the original contract had been voidable merely and not void, there might have been colour for the argument that the renewal receipt issued after the Perth Mutual policy had expired operated in some way as a renewed contract. But without passing upon that, I am of opinion that once it is established that the original contract either by virtue of statutory condition36 or of the express agreement of the applicant, or of both combined, was of \u201cno force,\u201d and that the risk never attached, the mere receipt of another and subsequent premium by the company in ignorance of the material facts could not operate to instil life into that which was lifeless or give virtue to that which was, otherwise, without it. It cannot be successfully argued that the renewal receipt created a new contract not dependent upon the policy, or of which the latter did not form part. Such an agreement would, of course, be fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to sue, which, if it exists at all, must only do so by virtue of the covenant to insure in their mortgage coupled with the mortgage clause in the policy. But on its face it is apparent that no new contract was intended to be made, but that the old contract as contained in the policy and application referred to in the receipt was intended to be renewed.\nThe money was paid and received and the receipt given on the assumption by both parties that there was a valid existing contract which could be renewed and continued in this way. The facts when proved established that no such contract did exist. It could not, therefore, be continued, nor can it be said to be renewed either under or outside of the statute, for the plain and simple reasons that the misrepresentation or non-representation of facts material to the risk which prevented the original policy from ever attaching, would operate to prevent the law creating out of the payment of the premium a new contract based upon the old one which in law did not exist.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMILLS J.\u2014I concur in the above judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hoskin, Ogden & Hoskin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bayly & Bayly.\n[1] 3 Ont.

The lessee paid all the premiums and, the property having been seized in execution of a judgment against the lessor, the lessee purchased at the sheriffs's sale and became owner in fee. He afterwards increased the insurance the insurer acknowledging, in the second policy the existence of the first in his favour. The property having been destroy by fire, payment of the amount of the first policy to the lessee was opposed by a judgment creditor of the lessor and the money attached in the possession of the company. Held that the lessee having had an insurable interest when the first policy issued and being, when he acquired the fee and when the loss occurred, the only person having such interest, he was entilled to the payment of the amount of the policy insured upon the application of the lessor.\nHeld also, that even if the lessor knew that his father was embarrassed at the time he took the lease and when he purchased the property at the sheriff's sale, that would not make the transaction fraudulent as against the father's creditors.\nA creditor who was a party to the action against the lessor in which the property was sold in execution subject to the lease and who did not oppose such sale could not, afterwards, contest payment of the amount of the policy on the ground of fraud.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the superior Court, District of Montreal, and declaring that the intervenant alone was entitled to the moneys deposited in court by the garnishee and further dismissing the contestation of the intervention \"with costs.\nIn March, 1900, the appellant, haying an unsatisfied judgment against Alphonse Charlebois, the defendant in the action attached moneys in the hands of the garnishees, as belonging to him The garnishees declared that in May, 1899, they had insured Alphonse Charlebois \"in trust\" to the amount of $3,500 for twelve months upon a property known as the \"Academy of Music Theatre,\" Quebec; that after the policy was so taken out, they were informed that the trust was in favour of his son A. A. Charlebois, the respondent; that said A. A.. Charlebois had paid the premium and that he had made a claim under the policy for loss by fire; and the sum of $3,500, admitted to be payable under said policy, was deposited in court. to be disposed of as the court might direct.\nThe respondent then fyled an intervention asking to have the garnishment set aside upon the ground that, when the policy was taken, he had leased the property insured for nine years at a rental of $700 per annum, payable in improvements; that he had commenced to make said improvements in May, 1899, when he took the insurance policy of $3500 through his father, the defendant, who was then acting as trustee for him; that on the 6th of February, 1900, he had purchased the said property at sheriff's sale under execution * that on the 16th March, 1900, he had applied to the insurance company for additional insurance upon the same property, and that in the policy issued upon said second application the insurance company had recognized him as the beneficiary under their previous policy; and moreover that his purchase of the property at sheriff's sale had the effect of transferring to him the legal right to the policy, in virtue of clause 4 therein declaring that a change of title to the insured property \" by succession, or by operation of law, or by reason of death\" should not have the effect of voiding said policy.\nThe appellant contested this intervention upon the ground that all these transactions between the defendant and his son the respondent had been made by the former when notoriously insolvent to the knowledge of the son, and with the object of defrauding his creditors; that the father had made no legal transfer of the policy or his interest therein to the intervenant; and consequently, that the amount payable thereunder was properly seizable by defendant's creditors\nThe trial judge maintained the plaintiff's contestation and dismissed the intervention This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from, Hall J. dissenting.\nBeaudin K. C. and Gouin K.C. for the appellant. The insertion of the words i in trust \" after the defendant's name in the policy of insurance could not have the effect of altering his rights in the property or under the policy in respect to third parties to whom he was indebted; Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny, ([1]). Trusts as known to the English law are not recognized in the Province of Quebec but may be declared merely in a donation or a will; art. 981a C.C.; and cannot be proved by parol testimony arts. 2570, 25710.0.\nThe agreement between respondent and his father with regard to the insurance policy was fraudulent and made with the sole intent of avoiding the payment of the defendant's debt to the appellant. The alleged lease is a contract of an onerous nature and was evidently made with a view of decreasing the value of the property in the event of a judicial or other sale. When it was signed on 7th August, 1899, the defendant was insolvent, and the respondent knew it. Under art. 1035 C. C. all contracts \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux, by an insolvent debtor with a party who knows of his insolvency, are presumed to be fraudulent. The respondent has not destroyed this presumption of the law, and it appears by his own testimony that the allegations of fraud contained in the contestation of his intervention were true\nThe only person named as beneficiary under the policy is the defendant, and the amount cannot be paid to anybody else in the absence of a formal assignment or transfer.\nThe impressions or understandings of agents of the insurance company, at variance with the terms of the policy, cannot avail to defeat the seizing creditor. Arts. 2483, 2576 C.C.; Forgie & at. v. Royal Insurance Co. ([2])\nBrodeur K.C. and Pelletier for the respondent. The insurance company was, at the time of the delivery of the policy made aware of the name of the real beneficiary, though it did not appear in the policy, by the declaration that the trust was in favour of the intervenant; May on Insurance (4 ed.) vol. 2, p. 1024, \u00a7 445; vol. 1, p. 179; also by his letter stating that he was the owner of the property insured. Intervenant had, at any rate, an incurable interest; art. 2271 C.C.; and the company received subsequent premiums from him with knowledge of the facts, after the purchase at sheriff's sale, at the same time admitting the validity of the former policy. At the time of these transactions, the appellant was not a creditor of the defendant and at the time of the fire defendant had no interest whatever in the property insured. A change of ownership took place under the sheriff's sale by operation of law and with the knowledge and consent of the company.\nThe company declared that they owed nothing to the defendant, that the policy was in trust for the respondent and that after the loss the claim was filed by the respondent for his own benefit and interest. Under the circumstances, the appellant was bound to contest that declaration and to allege and prove that the defendant was entitled to the money. Having failed to do so the intervention was rightly maintained. The deposit of the $3500 in court did not create a title of ownership in favour of the defendant or his creditors. The money so deposited is the absolute property of the respondent. We refer to Anchor Marine Insurance Go. v. Allan ([3]); Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny ([4]); Leipschitz v. The Montreal Street Railway Co, ([5]).\nThe transactions in regard to the lease of the theatre the character of the lease, the son's efforts to help his father through. his financial troubles which later on caused him great distress the public sale by the sheriff, made with the appellant's knowledge and unopposed by him, everything in connection with the case, as shewn in evidence, all go to prove absolute good faith and the entire absence of fraud on the part of the intervenant and his father the defendant. There was no prejudice to the creditors in the lease\u2014there is none by the sheriff's sale and still less in the con\u00b0 tract of insurance, which is completely independent of all the other transactions, and to which the defend0 ant was not a party, except as the respondent's agent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This seems to me a plain case. The sheriff's sale to the respondent on the 6th of February, 1900, incontrovertibly put an end to the lease. The respondent could not be a tenant of his own property. Now that sale is not and cannot be impugned in this case, were it only for the absence of the parties to it. So that when the building was burnt down on the eighteenth of March the defendant suffered no loss. The only sufferer was the respondent How then can the defendant claim an indemnity for a loss that he has not suffered? How could he have made proof of loss when suffered none?\nAssuming that at first the policy should be held to have been issued to the defendant, the respondent became the equitable owner of it, as against the defendant when he acquired the ownership of the property, and, with the company's assent to continue the insurance for him and as if a new policy were taken in his name he became the insured to all intents and purposes.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il ne s'agit ici que d'une question de faits d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans un sens par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et dans un autre par la cour d'appel, Hall J. diff\u00e9rant.\nIl est incontestable qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'incendie de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Musique, le d\u00e9fendeur, Charlebois, n'en \u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire, et il nous semble qu'en pr\u00e9sence de ce fait les deniers saisis en cette cause qui repr\u00e9sentaient cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par lui. Ce simple motif devrait suffire pour nous engager a renvoyer l'appel. Voil\u00e0 peut-\u00eatre pourquoi la cour d'appel, compos\u00e9e de W\u00fcrt\u00e8le, Hall, Blanchet, Ouimet et Tellier, ad hoc, J.J., a simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la somme de $3,500, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en cour par la compagnie d'assurance, 'The Commercial Union Assurance Company Limited, appartient \u00e0 Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Charlebois,l'intervenant, et que le d\u00e9fendeur Alphonse Charlebois n'y a aucun droit maintient l'appel, etc.\nLes notes des juges ne nous ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises, bien que demand\u00e9es. Nous avons cependant le jugement motive du juge Chaland, si\u00e9geant en la cour sup\u00e9rieure et le dissentement \u00e9labor\u00e9 de M. le Juge Hall.\nL'appelant soutient que ce moyen ne pourrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 que par la compagnie d'assurance Commercial Union, qui non seulement ne invoque pas, mais a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en cour le plein montant de la police pour \u00eatre remis a qui de droit, et qu'il ne peut l'\u00eatre par Charlebois fils qui n'\u00e9tait que le pr\u00eate nom de son p\u00e8re insol- vable, dans le but de soustraire cet immeuble aux poursuites de ses cr\u00e9anciers. Il est done pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable et dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties d'examiner cette partie de la cause qui a induit M. le juge Hall \u00e0 diff\u00e9rer de M. le juge Chaland.\nLa preuve au dossier justifie-t-elle la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant? Elle n'est pas volumineuse, consistant principalement dans le t\u00e9moignage de Charlebois fils et de ses ouvriers. Charlebois p\u00e8re ne fut pas t\u00e9moin. Les ouvriers attestent qu'ils n'ont eu affaires qu'avec le fils et qu'ils furent pay\u00e9s par lui. Le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier offert de sa part est long; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 des transquestions rigoureuses et serr\u00e9es. Ses r\u00e9ponses sont promptes, fermes et enti\u00e8res, sans \u00e9quivoque on h\u00e9sitation, et apr\u00e8s les avoir lues et relues, je suis rest\u00e9 convaincu qu'il dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il fait dispara\u00eetre enti\u00e8rement la pr\u00e9somption de fraude que la parent\u00e9 fait na\u00eetre tout d'abord. Il \u00e9tablit \u00e0 mon enti\u00e8re satisfaction du moins que les transactions et op\u00e9rations du fils \u00e9taient non seulement dans les limites de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 mais Qu'elles \u00e9taient marqu\u00e9es au coin d'un des plus nobles sentiments, la reconnaissance, malheureusement trop rare de nos jours.\nQue le fils ait connu le mauvais \u00e9tat des affaires de son p\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ii en obtenait le bail, le printemps de 1899, c'est certain; il l'admet lui-m\u00eame, sans pouvoir dire s'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement insolvable car il ne connaissait pas ses affaires et il l'avait toujours cru riche. Aucune demande de cession pour b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Ii savait, cependant, que plusieurs jugements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment rendus contre lui, et que des saisies avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9es sur ses biens. C'est alors qu'il r\u00e9solut de venir \u00e0 son secours et de l'aider, m\u00eame a supporter le fardeau journalier de la vie par tous les moyens que ses propres ressources p6cuniaires mettaient \u00e0 sa disposition. Il consid4rait \u00e9videmment que la reconnaissance demandait sa protection en faveur de celui qui, plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 le p\u00e8re 4tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reput\u00e9 riche et m\u00eame cotte comme valant $300,000, lui avait fait don de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s fonci\u00e8res valant une trentaine de mille piastres qui \u00e9taient encore \u00e0 son avoir soit en nature ou en argent. Il n'y a pas un mot de preuve et ii n'est pas m\u00eame all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le p\u00e8re fut insolvable lorsqu'il fit ces dons et d'ailleurs l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. ([6]) L'insolvabilit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne remonte pas plus loin que la date du bail. Enfin depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, le fils avait fait des affaires prosp\u00e8res ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 le g\u00e9rant d'une fabrique importante aux Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, et ayant acquis d'autres immeubles. Bref, il n'eut aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser ou emprunter les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour acheter plusieurs jugements et propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de son p\u00e8re vendues par le sh\u00e9rif. Qui pr\u00e9tendaa que son but n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00eame louable? Mais ii y a plus.\nL'article 1033 du Code Civil dit que m\u00eame s'il y a intention de frauder ii faut en sus que l'acte dont on se plaint ait l'effet de nuire au cr\u00e9ancier. O\u00f9 pouvait \u00eatre le prejudice dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe savoir le bail de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Musique qui est la seule transaction attaqu\u00e9e par la contestation comme entach\u00e9e de fraude? Le p\u00e8re loue une propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'une grande valeur il est vrai que l'assur\u00e9 estima dans sa r\u00e9clamation contre la Commercial Union \u00e0 $25000 \u2022 mais n'\u00e9tait pas lou\u00e9e ni louable vu qu'elle avait besoin de reparations urgentes et consid\u00e9rables. Le p\u00e8re ne la vend pas pour argent comptant qu'il aurait Pu empocher; il la loue pour neuf ans, non pas pour un loyer en argent qu'il aurait peut-\u00eatre pu transporter, mais moyennant des r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires et durables que le fils locataire s'engage de faire, en sus du paiement des taxes municipales, \u00e0 raison de $700 par ann\u00e9e, le . montant total ne devant pas d6passer celui du loyer, savoir $6,300. Il fut m\u00eame stipul\u00e9 au bail que\nAny sum over this amount which may be expended by the said Lessee to be at his own cost and risk, and for which he shall have no recourse against the lessor.\nLe locataire se mit de suite en frais de faire d'abord les r\u00e9parations urgentes, couvrir l'\u00e9difice \u00e0 neuf, puis il renouvela les boiseries la plomberie, les peintures et d\u00e9corations etc. et finalement d\u00e9pensa la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e une somme d'environ $10,000, sur laquelle $4,000, \u00e9taient encore dues aux ouvriers, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la saisie arr\u00eat de l'appelant. Cette somme de $10,000 est done venu augmenter la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le gage des cr\u00e9anciers loin do le diminuer Les r\u00e9parations \u00e9taient presque termin\u00e9es lorsque, le 3 janvier 1900, les h\u00e9ritiers d'un nomm\u00e9 Hough qui avait un jugement contre l'appelant firent saisir l'Acad\u00e9mie de Musique sur Charlebois p\u00e8re, comme d\u00e9biteur de ce dernier et le firent vendre par le sh\u00e9rif le 6 f\u00e9vrier suivant L'appelant ne se plaint pas que A proc\u00e9dure n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et que les avis n\u00e9cessaires n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s. Il n'a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 attaquer la validit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret. Naturellement, Charlebois fils se porta adjudicataire pour la somme de $6,000 qu'il paya an moyen d'un emprunt fait an Trust and Loan. Devenu propri\u00e9taire, il termina ses am\u00e9liorations et pris une nouvelle police d'assurance pour $2,250 et se fit reconnaitre par la m\u00eame compagnie comme \u00e9tant le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de celle qui existait avant pour $3,500, peu importe le nom de l'assur\u00e9, que ce fut Charlebois p\u00e8re on une autre personne. Charlebois fils avait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'incendie seul int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l'immeuble En supposant que le bail fut frauduleux la vente du sh\u00e9rif a n\u00e9cessairement mit fin \u00e0 toutes \"plaintes de ce chef L\u00e8s ce moment la compagnie d'assurance devait payer au fils qui solda de ses deniers toutes [les primes et qui seul peut la lib\u00e9rer. Il avait ces deux polices d'assurance lorsque l'incendie d\u00e9truisit tout l'\u00e9difice et son contenu, le 18 mars 1900, plus une autre police de la Royale, pour $4,500 et une quatri\u00e8me de l'Atlas pour $2,500, en tout $12,500. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en cour de la somme que la Commercial Union doit encore ne peut changer les relations et les droits des parties.\nEt puis Si le fils n'\u00e9tait que le pr\u00eate-nom du p\u00e8re, si tous ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient qu'une conspiration et un plan gigantesque pour frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers sous le manteau de la justice et les apparences de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 tram\u00e9s depuis des ann\u00e9es,\u2014 ce qui n'est ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni prouv\u00e9,\u2014non seulement A premi\u00e8re police pour $3,500 serait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du p\u00e8re, ainsi que l'appelant le pr\u00e9tend, mais aussi la derni\u00e8re pour $2,250, et les polices de la Royal et de l'Atlas. Il n'attaque cependant que la premi\u00e8re, et ii a laiss\u00e9 les compagnies payer le montant des trois autres polices \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Sa position n'est pas logique, ni soutenable.\nEnfin, s'il y a un cr\u00e9ancier qui ne peut attaquer le bail en question pour cause de fraude, c'est bien l'appelant. Il a laiss\u00e9 le sh\u00e9rif vendre l'immeuble sujet au bail en question. Il \u00e9tait partie dans la cause m\u00eame de Hough o\u00f9 il fut d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 11 na pas porte opposition ni fait d'objection, et le laissa adjuger \u00e0 Cnarlebois fils sujet au bail. Il ne peut maintenant se plaindre de ce bail et de ses consequences. L'appelant jure que la vente du sh\u00e9rif a en lieu hors sa connaissance. Mais c'est son malheur, sinon sa faute, sil n'a pas mieux surveill\u00e9 ses droits. Il avait d'autant plus raison d'\u00eatre vigilant qu'il avait ant\u00e9rieurement pratiqu\u00e9 une saisie sur le m\u00eame immeuble, qui n'eut pas de suite, parcequ'il demandait que l'immeuble fut vendu sans \u00eatre sujet au bail et que Chalebois fils s'y opposait. Lui qui est avocat, se rappelle sans doute la maxime: Vigilantibus et non dormientibus jura subveniunt. Pour ces raisons, nous sommes d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec\nDAVIES and NESBITT JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nKILLAM J.\u2014At the close of the arguments in this case, I was inclined to the views indicated by Mr. Justice Hall, in the Quebec Court of Appeal. To my mind the case turns upon the acceptance of the intervenants evidence as reliable proof of a real, bona fide lease to him of the theatre property and of a real agreement by the defendant to insure for the protection of the intervenants independent expenditure. Having reference to the strong opinion of my learned brothers that his evidence should be accepted I! do not now dissent from their conclusion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gouin, Lemieux & Brassard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

The vendor, defendant, in the agreement for sale, represented, that a block of buildings which he was selling to the plaintiff, had been constructed by him of solid stone and brick and so described them in formal deeds subsequently executed relating to the sale. The walls subsequently began to crack and it was discovered that a portion of the buildings had been improperly built of framed lumber filled in and encased with stone and brick in a manner to deceive the purchaser.\nHeld, that the contract was vitiated on account of error and fraud and should be set aside and that as the vendor knew of the faulty construction, he was liable not only for the return of the price, but also for damages.\nHeld also that the nature of the contract depended upon the intentions of the parties as disclosed by the last instrument signed by them in relation thereto,\nHeld, further, that the action quantum minoris and for damages does not apply to cases where contracts are voidable on the grounds of error or fraud, but only to cases of warranty against latent defects if the purchaser so elects ; the only recourse in cases of error and fraud being by rescission under art 1000 of the Civil Code\nIn the present case the sale was made in part in consideration of vacant city lots given in payment pro tanto, and. during the time the defendant was in possession of the lots he erected buildings upon them with his own materials.\nHeld, that even if the contract amounted to a contract of exchange, it was subject to be rescinded in the same manner and for reasons similar to those which would avoid a sale and if the contract be set aside for bad faith on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff has options similar to those mentioned in articles 417 418 1526 and 1527 of the Civll Code, that is to say, he may either retain the property built upon, on payment of the value of the improvements, or cause the defendant to remove them without injuring the property, or compel the defendant to retain the property built upon and to pay its value, besides having the right to recover damages according to the circumstances.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal (Lynch J.) dismissing the plaintiffs action, in so far as the demande for rescission of the contract of sale was concerned.\nThe action was for the rescission of a deed of sale of a block of buildings and reimbursement of moneys paid in consequence of the sale and for certain damages, including taxes and the cost of necessary repairs to the buildings occasioned on account of their faulty construction by the defendant himself. The reasons urged for the annulment of the contract were false and fraudulent representations made by the defendant to the plaintiff, at the time of the sale, that the buildings he was selling, which he had constructed himself, had been solidly constructed of stone and brick, whereas, to the knowledge of the defendant, they were partly constructed of wooden frames encased in brick and stone, hidden from view so as to mislead and deceive the plaintiff, and which hidden defects subsequently caused the walls of the buildings to crack.\nThe pleas denied misrepresentation or fraud, declared that there were no hidden defects but that the buildings were, as represented, first class buildings of their kind, that their quality and construction were visible and apparent, and all responsibility for the work done on repairs and for taxes paid was disclaimed.\nThe Superior Court, while sustaining the contentions of the plaintiff, granted him only partial relief as to the repairs he had been obliged to make, but dismissed the demande for the rescission of the sale on the ground that, in consequence of the buildings erected by the respondent on the vacant lots it had become impossible to replace the parties in their original positions. On appeals by both parties the Court of Review affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court with the addition of some special taxes paid by the plaintiff. From the latter judgment the present appeal is asserted by the plaintiff.\nThe questions raised upon the appeal are fully stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr.Justice Girouard.\nDuclos K.C. for the appellant. 1. The plaintiff appellant alleged two grounds of annulment namely: 1st, fraud ; 2ndly, hidden defects. We claim that he has established his pretensions on both grounds. Arts. 991, 992, 993, 1000, 1522, 1524, 1526, 1527, 1529 C. C. See also arts. 417 and 418 C.C. The appellant has clearly proved; (a.) That he purchased in error (b.) That he had been deceived; (c.) That the respondent secured the plaintiff's consent by means of fraud and trickery ; (d.) That, had it not been for that fraud, the appellant would not have purchased.\nWe refer to the authorities cited, under the articles above mentioned, by the codifiers of the Code Civil, vol. 7, de Lorimier, \" Biblioth\u00e8que du Civil Code,' Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations, has specially treated this subject in his 1st vol. at pp. 40, 41, 79 and 80. See also 6 Toullier, No. 95 ; Merlin, Rep. bis, Dol. et Escroqueries Bigot, Pr\u00e9ameneu, Expos\u00e9 des Motifs, No. 10 ; 6 Locr\u00e9 p. 150 ; Domat, Lois civiles, liv. 1, fit. 18, sect. 1, No. 6, p 140 ; 15 Laurent, Nos. 486 (dol, Nos. 522, 4, 6, 530) ; 24 Demolombe, Nos. 84, 8, 4\nThe contract in this case was a contract of sale, purely and simply ; Nouvelles And. Fr. \"Exchange' nn. 21, 206. If instead of an exchange reciprocal sales are made it is a sale. A confusion of matter in such a case as this cannot alter the contract. Article 1592 C. C. defines the dation en paiement. 'The giving of a thing in payment is equivalent to a sale of it and makes the party giving liable to the same warranty.\nThe defendant never actually owned the lands that he received from the plaintiff. If he improved them, he did so at his own risk. He was merely in possession and his rights are governed by the articles of the Civil Code making special dispositions on such questions. Arts. 417, 418, 1047, 1049, 1050, 1052 C. C-The courts below reserved to the plaintiff any recourse which he might have according to law. He has the option of exercising any of the actions without restriction or dictation of any kind from the defendant. Even if there had been an exchange, the principles are the same. The defendant cannot take advantage of his fraud or trickery, but he may be made to suffer the consequences. Barnard v. Riendeau ([1]) ; Greene v. Mappin ([2]).\nH. St. Louis K.C. for the respondent. There was no conventional warranty. The warranty is only legal as to latent defects, if any there be. There are no latent defects in the property transferred to the plaintiff, nor are there any defects of a nature to give rise to appellant's claim.\nNotwithstanding [the deed of sale given, the transaction was an exchange between the parties. The action was tardy and could not be entertained. The \"contract being one of exchange, appellant could not succeed unless he offered to restore and effectively did restore the defendant to the same position as he occupied prior to the contract. This he did not do, having allowed too long a time to elapse without attacking the contract. The plaintiff's redhibitory conclusions were, therefore, rightly dismissed.

Le 2 avril 1898, l'appelant acquiert par \u00e9change ou vente\u2014peu importe le mot pour le moment\u2014un p\u00e2t\u00e9 de cinq maisons que l'intim\u00e9, qui est entrepreneur, avait b\u00e2ties \u00e0 Westmount. L'appellant pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9 lui a c\u00e9d\u00e9 des maisons de premi\u00e8re classe, en pierre et brique, tandis que tous les arri\u00e8re murs et la moiti\u00e9 des pignons de trois de ces maisons sont en bois lambriss\u00e9 de briques et pierres. Ce n'est qu'en 1900 qu'il connut ce qu'il appelle ce d\u00e9faut cach\u00e9 ou son erreur produite par la fraude m\u00eame de l'intim\u00e9. Il proteste de suite et sans d4lai intente une action demandant la rescision du contrat.\nIl est vrai que dans le titre notari\u00e9 et d\u00e9finitif du 2 avril 1898, l'intim\u00e9 ne parait c\u00e9der que trois lots de terre a avec les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites\" . Mais cette vague description est susceptible d'explication entre les parties, et m\u00eame s'il n'y avait pas d'autre description \u00e9crite, pas m\u00eame de mention des b\u00e2tisses, l'acheteur peut toujours \u00e9tablir l'erreur et la fraude \u00e0 ce sujet par la preuve testimoniale.\nD'abord, dans la promesse de vente on d4changer, \u00e9crite de la main de l'intim\u00e9 et sign\u00e9e sous seing priv\u00e9 par les deux parties le 10 mars 1898, il c\u00e8de \u00e0 l'appelant \" un bloc de cinq maisons en pierre et brique\". Il faut bien remarquer que ces mots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s par lui-m\u00eame afin de mieux faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l'appelant la classe ou qualit\u00e9 de la construction. La preuve fait voir qu'en toutes occasions il repr\u00e9sentait ces maisons comme \u00e9tant de premi\u00e8re classe, en pierre et brique, ajoutant m\u00eame quelquefois le mot s solide \". Enfin, au milieu de nombreuses contradictions et h\u00e9sitations, press\u00e9 dans son examen comme t\u00e9moin, il s'avoue coupable;\n\" Q. J'aimerais bien \u00e0 avoir une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 des questions pr\u00e9cises, je vous demande si vous aviez l'habitude de repr\u00e9senter ces trois maisons-l\u00e0 comme \u00e9tant construites en pierre et brique?\n\" R. Je les ai repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es cette fois l\u00e0 ; quand j'ai vendu, le demandeur \"\nC'est toute sa r\u00e9ponse.\nEn face de cette preuve, il n'est pas surprenant que la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour de revision soient arrivees a la conclusion que l'intim\u00e9, dans le cours de cette transaction, a us4 de dol et fraude qui out induit le demandeur en erreur ; car invariablement le dol inspire l'erreur et c'est pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat que l'on y a recours. Le demandeur jure que s'il e\u00fbt connu le d4faut cach\u00e9 ou la fraude, il n'aurait pas achet\u00e9 ces maisons. Les t\u00e9moins ne manquent pas qui d\u00e9clarent qu'ils en auraient fait autant, s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame position. Ce n'\u00e9taient plus des misons de premi\u00e8re classe que l'intim\u00e9 c\u00e9dait, mais de seconde, bien moins durables et exigeant plus fr\u00e9quemment des r\u00e9parations grosses et ordinaires. Comme sources de revenu que recherchait l'appelant, elles \u00e9taient bien inf\u00e9rieures aux maisons de pierre et brique. Il y a donc en erreur sur la substance de l'objet du contrat, sur quelque chose qui fut une consid\u00e9ration principale capable d'engager l'appelant \u00e0 le faire. Cela suffit pour annuler le contrat, m\u00eame en l'absence de fraude ([3]). Ces articles du Code Civil suffiraient probablement pour tenir le vendeur garant des vices cach\u00e9s. Mais le Code a sauvegard\u00e9 la position de l'acheteur par des dispositions particuli\u00e8res.\nL'article 1522 d4clare '.\nLe vendeur est tenu de garantir l'acheteur \u00e0 raison des d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s de la chose vendue et de ses accessoires qui diminuent tel- tellement son utilit\u00e9 que l'acheteur ne l'aurait pas achet\u00e9e.\nC'est ce que jure l'appelant et son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point est corrobo4\u00e9 par plusieurs t4moins. Or quelle est alors la position du vendeur m\u00eame de bonne foi i C. C. Art. 1524. L'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pond qu'il doit subir une diminution du prix ; voil\u00e0 tout. Mais il oublie que ce n'est pas lui qui peut d\u00e9terminer la nature de l'action qui appartient \u00e0 l'acheteur. L'article 1526 est formel l\nL'acheteur a le choix de rendre la chose et de se faire restituer le prix on de garder la chose et se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation. Baudry-Lacantinerie, commentant l'article correspondant du code fran\u00e7ais en son Trait\u00e9 du Droit Civil, Vente et Echange ([4]) dit;\nL'acheteur est d'ailleurs ma\u00eetre absolu de son choix ; s'il exerce l'action redhibitoire, on ne peut pas l'obliger \u00e0 se contenter de l'action quantum minoris sous le pr\u00e9texte que la chose, malgr\u00e9 ses d\u00e9fauts, lui donnera une partie des utilit\u00e9s sur lesquelles il comptait.\nVoir aussi Guillouard, Vente et Echange. ([5])\nL'intim\u00e9 devait savoir que cet article du code s\u2019appliqiue \u00e0 une vente comme la sienne, m\u00eame faite de bonne foi. La jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec s'\u00e9tait prononc\u00e9e dans ce sens dans une cause d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en 1890, par le juge Loranger, confirm\u00e9e en appel par Dorion J. C. Baby Boss\u00e9 et Doherty JJ. ([6])\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, la position du vendeur est bien moins favorable. Il connaissait les vices cach\u00e9s il est lui-m\u00eame le constructeur de ces maisons ; ii est donc de mauvaise foi et coupable de fraude. Plac\u00e9 dans cette position, l'article 152l ajoute qu'il est tenu,\noutre de restituer le prix, de tous les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soufferts par l'acheteur.\nLe code civil apr\u00e8s avoir defini le dol en l'article 993 et nous avoir dit en l'article 991 qu'il est une cause de nullit\u00e9 des contrats, ajout\u00e9 en l'art. 1000, que la fraude et l'erreur ne sont pas cause de nullit4 absolue. Elles donnent seulement un droit d'action on une exception pour faire annuler on rescinder les contrats qui en sont entach\u00e9s. Il n'y a pas \u00e0 choisir. Ces articles imposent an juge le devoir d'annuler le contrat. Ici, les deux cours out constat\u00e9 la fraude bien qu'elles soient d'avis qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'appliquer les principes du code sur l'erreur on les d\u00e9fauts caches. Ils constatent cependant que ces maisons n'\u00e9taient pas de premi\u00e8re classe ainsi que l'intim\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 raison du genre de construction de certains murs. Elles avaient donc des d\u00e8fauts cach\u00e9s. Au reste ce point n'est pas d'une grande Importance. La fraude est ttab1ie par les deux cours ; alors le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame comme nous l'avons vu. Elles ne pouvaient refuser l'annulation. Voir Biret, Des Nullit\u00e9s, ([7]) et un arr\u00eat de la cour supr\u00eame du 4 vend\u00e9miaire, an Y, par lui cit4. Voici les consid\u00e9rations de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, Lynch J.;\nConsidering that plaintiff relies upon the agreement of the 10th of March, 1898, as forming part of the whole transaction between defendant and him, which he has a right to do ; and considering that defendant in that agreement described said five houses as being of stone and brick.\nConsidering that said representation of defendant was false to the knowledge of defendant, he himself having built said five houses; and considering that under the circumstances, no matter what may have been his motive in making it, such representation must be regarded as fraudulent and as an artifice to deceive plaintiff *\nConsidering that plaintiff alleges and has supported his allegation by his own evidence, that he would not have purchased said five houses, and certainly would not have paid $40,000 for them, had it not been for said representation of defendant that they were of stone and brick, etc.\nConsidering that it is practically impossible to restore the parties to the same position which they respectively occupied before the contract and this through no fault imputable to defendant; and considering that if the contract of the tenth March, 1898, is to be annulled as plaintiff asks it to be, it must be annulled in its entirety, the effect of which would be applicable to both parties.\nLe savant juge, apr\u00e8s avoir cite Larombi\u00e8re, ([8]) Pothier (Bugnet), ([9]) et quelques autorit\u00e9s anglaises, conclut;\nIn my opinion, if the demand of plaintiff be granted both parties must he restored to the position which they occupied before contracting ; and this has become impossible principally because defendant cannot restore to plaintiff *the two lots of land having built on them . I have arrived at this conclusion after much hesitation and after a good deal of anxious thought ; for I feel that defendant, whether with a fraudulent design or through stupidity is immaterial, has wronged plaintiff, and that the latter is entitled to some redress ; but I do not think it can or ought to be granted in the manner sought by the present action. I do not know that there is any occasion for my doing so ; but I shall reserve to plaintiff his recourse.\nLe recours r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par la cour est \u00e9videmment l'action en diminution du prix ou en dommages. Mais ce recours n'est donn\u00e9 que dans les cas de d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s ; il n'existe pas dans ceux d'erreur ou de fraude. L'art. 1000 C.C. est formel. Il ne donne que l'action en rescision. Le savant juge tout en r\u00e9servant le recours en dommages, lui accorde cependant une somme de $234.73 pour r\u00e9parations et pertes de loyer.\nLes deux parties port\u00e8rent la cause en revision, qui confirma le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, Taschereau, Loranger et Archibald JJ., mais le montant des dommages accod\u00e9ss fut augment\u00e9 de $113533 pour taxes sp\u00e9ciales, formant un total de $348.26. M. le juge Taschereau \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins d'avis que la premi\u00e8re somme de $234.73 devrait \u00eatre refus\u00e9e, vu le refus de la rescision.\nL'appelant appelle de ce jugement. L'intim\u00e9 le porta en cour d'appel o\u00f9 ii est encore pendant. Je ne puis comprendre le raisonnement fait par les savants juges Ils citent Larombi\u00e8re et Pothier qui comme tous les commentateurs traitant la question, posent le principe de droit commun que par le jugement en rescision les parties sont mises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'elles \u00e9taient auparavant. Ils invoquent aussi la jurisprudence anglaise qui probablement est la m\u00eame que la n\u00f4tre, quoique non fond\u00e9e sur des textes de loi et peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente dans ses effets et son application. D'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises, cette r\u00e8gle n'est absolue que pour le demandeur qui doit \u00eatre en \u00e9tat de rendre la chose ; encore faut-il qu'il n'en soit pas emp\u00each\u00e9 par le fait du d\u00e9fendeur. Pas un des jurisconsultes cit\u00e9s par le juge a quo ne dit que si le d\u00e9fendeur, par son fait, surtout par sa fraude, s'est mis hors d'\u00e9tat de faire la restitution, la rescision ne pourra \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e. Notre code sur cette mati\u00e8re est semblable an code Napol\u00e9on. Les. tribunaux et les commentateurs en ont si bien \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les dispositions qu'il nous suffira de r\u00e9sumer ici ce qu\u2019ils enseignent, sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s anglaises.\nObservons d'abord que Larombi\u00e8re et Pothier ne disent pas que toutes les choses restitu\u00e9es doivent \u00eatre identiquement les m\u00eames ; dans certains cas cette restitution est m\u00eame impossible, par exemple si l'une des choses est sortie du commerce, ou a p\u00e9ri, ou ne se trouve plus enti\u00e8re par le fait du vendeur. Ces auteurs ne disent pas qu'alors l'\u00e9quivalent ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 de la partie en faute.\nPersonne ne .pr\u00e9tendra que le contrat d'\u00e9change ne puisse \u00eatre annul\u00e9 comme le contrat de vente et pour les m\u00eames causes ([10]). Qu'arrive-t-il si la chose a p\u00e9ri par suite des vices cach\u00e9s? Est-ce que la rescision ne doit pas alors \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e parce que le demandeur, par le fait du d\u00e9fendeur ne peut plus rendre la chose? L'article 1529 indique le mode de proc\u00e9der qui varie selon que le vendeur est de bonne ou de mauvaise foi. M\u00eame si l\u2019immeuble \u00e9chang\u00e9 sort du commerce, comme un terrain sur lequel on aurait b\u00e2ti une \u00e9glise, un \u00e9difice national la restitution serait pareillement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e mais alors la partie en d\u00e9faut sera tenue d'en payer la valeur. Enfin chaque fois que la restitution ne peut se faire d'une mani\u00e8re enti\u00e8re et parfaite par le fait du d\u00e9fendeur, sans m\u00eame qu'il y ait faute ou fraude de sa part, il faut proc\u00e9der par estimation et ordonner le paiement de l'\u00e9quivalent ; et \u00e0 plus forte raison doit- Il en \u00eatre ainsi s'il est coupable de dol. Autrement, ii suffirait \u00e0 l'auteur de la fraude de se mettre dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de remettre cc qu'il a re\u00e7u, pour emp\u00eacher de rendre justice. Spoliatus, ante omnia estituendus. Que m'importe d'avoir une diminution du prix ou des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, Si je suis oblige de garder une chose que je n'ai jamais eu l'intention d'acqu\u00e9rir et qui ne m'est venue que par le dol et la fraude? Le code veut qu'alors le contrat soit r\u00e9sili\u00e9 et ii ne reconna\u00eet aucune excuse pour juger autrement. Il ne dit pas que Si les choses ne sont pas enti\u00e8res par la fraude on le simple fait de la partie en d\u00e9faut, la restitution n'aura pas lieu. Elle doit se faire en autant que les circonstances le permettent, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire justice \u00e0 qui de de droit. S'agit-il d'un \u00e9change d\u2019immeubles dont l'un vacant comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, a \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2ti par l'un des \u00e9changistes? Ce dernier n'est-il pas Un possesseur de mauvaise foi du jour m\u00eame de son acquisition? Il v a lieu alors d'appliquer les principes consacr\u00e9s aux articles 417 et 418 du code civil c'est-\u00e0-dire, Si l'autre partie le demande, de le condamner \u00e0 retenir le terrain en en payant la valeur suivant estimation et tous les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, car ii est de mauvaise foi et il ne peut profiter de sa propre fraude. Citons quelques autorit\u00e9s.\nLarombi\u00e8re, au tome cite par M. le juge Lynch, ([11]) suppose que l'un des immeubles a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par Un tiers d'une mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9vocable, par exemple par la prescription et ii aurait pu ajouter par autorit\u00e9 de justice observe ;\nIl peut arriver que les tiers-acqu\u00e9reurs ne puissent plus \u00eatre \u00e9vinc\u00e9s, parce que la prescription se sera accomplie en leur faveur. Cette circonstance n'emp\u00eache nullement la r\u00e9solution, pas plus lorsqu'il s'agit d'une condition r\u00e9solutoire tacite que d'une condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse. Il est vrai qu'alors celui qui a \u00e0 reprendre sa chose ali\u00e9n\u00e9e par l'autre partie, ne la reprend pas enti\u00e8re et est forc\u00e9 de respecter les droits acquis par la prescription.- Mais celui qui a consenti l'ali\u00e9nation doit, dans ce cas, en repr\u00e9sentation de la chose prescrite, tenir compte du prix de la vente seulement, comme doit faire quiconque a vendu la chose qu'il a re\u00e7ue de bonne foi, pourvu que la bonne foi soit bien \u00e9tablie, ce qui exclut toute faute, toute n\u00e9gligence dont la r\u00e9paration serait due. S'il n'y avait pas bonne foi cc serait l'estimation de la chose qui devrait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e.\nDomat, ([12]) parlant de celui qui obtient la rescision, dit\nqu'il ne profite de la rescision que le simple effet de rentrer dans les droits, sa partie rentrant aussi, de sa part dans les siens, autant que l'effet de la rescision pourra le permettre.\nB\u00e9darride, Du Dol et de la Fraude ([13]);\u2014\nLa partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e ayant seule action est, sans contredit le meilleur juge du mode de r\u00e9paration le plus convenable \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle peut donc choisir celui des deux auquel elle croit devoir s'arr\u00eater, et ce choix est obligatoire pour la justice comme pour son adversaire.\nLe d\u00e9biteur serait-il fond\u00e9 \u00e0 se plaindre de cette d\u00e9termination? Quel grief r\u00e9el lui cause-t-on en lui imposant le mode de r\u00e9paration poursuivi par celui qu'il a tromp\u00e9? C'est par son fait personnel qu'est n\u00e9e la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9paration quelconque, et l'on ne saurait h\u00e9siter entre celui qui a tromp\u00e9 et celui qui souffre Sans doute la rescision est le rem\u00e8de le plus h\u00e9roique, mais encore faut-il qu'elle entre dans les convenances de celui qui a le droit de s'en pr\u00e9valoir; et si, sur l'opinion du contraire, il se borne \u00e0 demander une r\u00e9paration p\u00e9cuniaire, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat oppos\u00e9 de celui qui est tenu de la fournir n'est, aux yeux de la morale et de la justice, ni une consid\u00e9ration ni un motif de refus. C'est \u00e0 celui qui craint ce r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 s'abstenir de se livrer \u00e0 des actes pouvant le d\u00e9terminer\nIl est une hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la rescision est l\u00e9galement impossible, lorsqu'il s'est agi, par exemple d'un transfert de rentes sur l'Etat La rescision prononc\u00e9e par justice serait insuffisante pour op\u00e9rer la restitution et faire rentrer ces rentes dans la possession du propri\u00e9taire qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 spolie. Le d\u00e9cret du 8 nivcse, an VI, d\u00e9clarant irr\u00e9vocable toute opposition au paiement du cr\u00e9ancier titulaire la r\u00e9trocession ordonn\u00e9e par justice ne pourrait produire aucun effet, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre volontairement consentie et r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par cc titulaire m\u00eame On devrait donc l'y contraindre par une condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire, engageant sa fortune sa libert\u00e9 m\u00eame\nFuzier-Herman. Vo. Echange n. 83;\u2014 Par suite la commune co\u00e9changiste, qui excipe de la pr\u00e9tendue impossibilit\u00e9, provenant de son fait, de restituer le terrain \u00e0 elle c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9change terrain par elle affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une \u00e9glise, est non redevable en se fondant sur l'annulation prononc\u00e9e par justice du contrat d'\u00e9change, \u00e0 revendiquer le terrain qu'elle a donn\u00e9 en contre-\u00e9change. Case. 2 juin 1886, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Dans] le m\u00eame sens, Case. 11 ao\u00fbt 1835, pr\u00e9fet de l'Ain. ([14])\nDalloz Vo. Vente n. 1427;\u2014\nVu l'art. 1652 et les art. 1245 et 1500 c. civ.; Attenduquela nul lit\u00e9 de la convention de vente entrainait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la restitution r\u00e9ciproque du prix, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et de la chose vendue de l'autre ; que les parties devant \u00eatre remises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'avant le contrat annul\u00e9 chacune des deux devenait d\u00e9bitrice envers l'autre l'une des sommes re\u00e7ues, l'autre de la chose vendue ; qu'ainsi l'acqu\u00e9reur devenait d\u00e9biteur envers son vendeur du corps certain qu'il devait restituer, et qu'il ne pouvait \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de cette remise qu'autant que les d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations v survenues ne seraient provenues ni de son fait xi de sa faute que dans le cas constat\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat m\u00eame, il y avait d\u00e9tournement enl\u00e8vement de portion des effets et marchandises faisant l'objet de la vente de la pharmacie ; que, dans cette situation respective des parties le d\u00e9fendeur avait le droit de retenir, sur le prix pay\u00e9 une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 la valeur des effets et marchandises disparus par le fait de l'acqu\u00e9reur que si la valeur ou la quotit\u00e9 de ces effets pouvait \u00eatre convenablement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par la cour, a defaut d'une instruction suffisante, la cour devait suspendre la restitution des 12,500 fr. jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une instruction ult\u00e9rieure e\u00fbt fait conna\u00eetre \u00e0 quelle concurrence devait s'\u00e9tendre la retenue du vendeur ; que, de plus dans l'esp\u00e8ce le vendeur se trouvant d\u00e9biteur dune partie du prix qu'il avait re\u00e7ue et cr\u00e9ancier de la valeur des effets et marchandises enlev\u00e9s on revendus ii s'op\u00e9rait en sa personne confusion jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence ; qu'il suit de l\u00e0 qu'en annulant la vente, l'arr\u00eat devait autoriser le vendeur \u00e0 retenir, sur la portion du prix par lui re\u00e7ue, la valeur des objets d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s ou revendus par l'acqu\u00e9reur ; qu'au lieu de cela le vendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 paver de suite et en entier les 12,500 fr. re\u00e7us par lui \u00e0 compte, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 pour le recouvrement de la somme qui lui sera due \u00e0 se pourvoir \u00e0 la faillite, et, par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 subir des r\u00e9ductions dont ii no peut \u00eatre tenu ; qu'en d\u00e9cidant ainsi, la cour de Rouen (arr\u00eat du 22 f\u00e9vrier 1851) a viol\u00e9 les articles pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s Par ces motifs casse etc.\nMais est-ce un \u00e9change que les parties ont jamais eu l'intention de faire, m\u00eame le 10 mars 1898, lorsqu'elles sign\u00e8rent l'\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9? Je ne le crois pas et si j'avais quelque doute \u00e0 ce sujet\u2014ce queje n'ai pas\u2014je serais dispose d'en donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 la victime de la fraude et non \u00e0 son auteur. Il est vrai qu'on trouve dans cet \u00e9crit qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l'in tim\u00e9, un simple ouvrier, les mots vendeur, \u00e9change, mais c'est c'est par l'intention des parties et le contenu de l'acte que par le nom qu'elles lui donnent, qu'on pourra en d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re- Il est incontestable qu'il ne s'agit aucunement d'un simple \u00e9change. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 est estim\u00e9e \u00e0 $40.000, et celle de l'appelant \u00e0 $16,500, plus de la moiti\u00e9 au-dessous. Comme il v avait une hypoth\u00e8que sur les lots vacants, ils n'entr\u00e8rent en paiement que pour $10,500, et par cons\u00e9quent, l'appelant se trouvait \u00e0 payer une somme de $29,500 en num\u00e9raire, qui n'est pas d'ailleurs mentionn\u00e9e comme formant une soulte. Cette somme repr\u00e9sente done les trois quarts de la valeur des immeubles de l'intim\u00e9 et d'apr\u00e8s l'opinion des meilleurs auteurs car le code est silencieux\u2014d\u00e9cide de la d\u00e9nomination du contrat * c'est alors une vente et non un \u00e9change.\nC'\u00e9tait le sentiment de Pothier cite par l'appelant, et ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par B\u00e9darride Du Dol et de la Fraude, T. 3, n. 9933; Duvergeir, T. 2, n. 406 ; Aubry et Rau, T. 4 par. 360 ; Laurent, T. 14, n. 617 ; Gruillouard, T. 2, n. 918 ; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente et Echange n. 975. Tous ces auteurs entrent dans des d\u00e9tails assez longs qui ne changent pas la proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que nous avons \u00e9nonc\u00e9e. Qu'il nous suffise de citer un court passage de Hue, une des lumi\u00e8res de la France judiciaire de nos jours ([15]).\nSi l'op\u00e9ration (dit-il), qualifi\u00e9e \u00e9change par les parties comporte une soulte relativement importante, on d\u00e9cide g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement qu'il y aura vente ou \u00e9change, suivant la pr\u00e9dominance de l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur l'autre, sauf \u00e0 tenir compte, en cas d'\u00e9quivalence approximative entre la chose la moins importante et la soulte, de l'intention des parties.\nPuis ii cite dans ce sens un arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation du 26 f\u00e9vrier 1883, S.V. 86. 1.66.\nNon seulement la soute est bien sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la valeur des lots vacants, mais les parties n'ont voulu faire que des ventes et non un \u00e9change. C'est ce qu'elles d\u00e9clarent toutes deux dans leurs t\u00e9moignages et l'intime l'admet en toutes lettres dans ses d\u00e9fenses \u00e0 l'action;\n2 o Il admet l'acte mentionn\u00e9 an paragraphe 2, (c'est-\u00e0-dire, l'acte de vente notari\u00e9 du 2 avril 1898, exhibit P-2), mais nie que cet acte n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 que la paraphrase authentique de l'\u00e9crit P-1 (l'\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 du 10 mars), dont il diff\u00e8re en certains points importants et qu'il remplace absolument, le premier \u00e9tant une simple pollicitation unilat\u00e9rale tandis que l acte P-2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement pour faire loi entre les parties d'apr\u00e8s les instructions du demandeur lui-m\u00eame et sign\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par les ordres du demandeur et sign\u00e9 par cc dernier.\nEt plus loin '.\n5o Le d\u00e9fendeur a simplement vendu au demandeur en vertu de l acte de vente P-2 certains lots de terre situ\u00e9s a Westmount et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au dit acte, avec b\u00e2tisses dessus construites et connues du demandeur.\nL'intim\u00e9 veut maintenant changer sa position. La transaction, dit-il dans sa plaidoirie orale, constitue un \u00e9change et non une vente. Je suis d'avis que l'admission faite an plaidoyer est irr4vocable, \u00e0 moins d'invoquer une erreur de fait. Aucune n'est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, ni prouv\u00e9e ; C. C. art 1245. En faisant cette admission, l'intim\u00e9 a cru pouvoir \u00e9chapper \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9, parce que l'acte notari\u00e9 ne donne aucune description des b\u00e2tisses, ajoutant simplement \u00e0 la suite de la description des immeubles, avec les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites. S'il n'y avait pas d'autre preuve au dossier, il aurait probablement r\u00e9ussi. Il s'est aper\u00e7u sans doute plus tard que, par son admission, ii mettait fin \u00e0 son autre pr\u00e9tention que, les lots vacants ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2tis, les parties ne pouvaient plus \u00eatre p1ac\u00e9es dans leur \u00e9tat primitif. Le juge a quo n'avait pas raison, \u00e0 mon s\u00e9ns, de d\u00e9cider que, puisque l'appelant invoquait l'\u00e9crit du 10 mars 1898 pour prouver que les maisons \u00e9taient en pierre et brique, il devait l'accepter pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re du contrat. L'appelant l'invoque comme ii aurait Pu invoquer une annonce de l'intim\u00e9, une lettre ou toute autre preuve tendant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les repr\u00e9sentations de l'intim\u00e9 au sujet de la classe ou qua1it\u00e9 des b\u00e2tisses. Voil\u00e0 tout. Cet 6crit ne peut d4terminer le caract\u00e8re du contrat, s'il appara\u00eet que subs\u00e9quemment, quant ii s'agit de donner une suite d\u00e9finitive aux n\u00e9gociations, ayant effet vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, les parties ont manifest\u00e9 clairement qu'elles entendaient faire une vente et non un \u00e9change.\nLe 2 avril les parties signent deux actes de vente s\u00e9par\u00e9s devant notaire. Un acte notari\u00e9 et enregistr\u00e9 \u00e9tait en effet n\u00e9cessaire vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers ce que les parties avaient n\u00e9cessairement en vue lorsqu'elles ont sign4 l'\u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9. Cet \u00e9crit n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00eame en double et ii \u00e9tait seulement en la possession de l'appelant. Les termes et conditions sont les m\u00eames dans les deux documents, except\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la description des b\u00e2tisses. Pas un mot d'\u00e9change ne se trouve dans l'acte notari\u00e9\u00bb\nLe prix est clairement fix\u00e9 dans l'acte qui transf\u00e9re les immeubles de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, car l'acte de vente des lots vacants n'est pas au dossier. Ce sont les actes que depuis leur passation les parties ont regard\u00e9s comme \u00e9tablissant leurs droits respectifs. Comment pouvons-nous dire que l'\u00e9crit du 10 mars, en supposant qu'il serait different, determine encore les droits des parties? La jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise\u2014car la question est nouvelle dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014 s'est prononc\u00e9e dans un sens contraire. Nous lisons aussi dans Fuzier-Herman, Vo. Echange p. 466.\nIl ne faut pas confondra l'\u00e9change avec la vente suives d'une dation en paiement ; ainsi on ne devrait pas consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9change le contrat par lequel une des parties s'engagerait d'abord \u00e0 payer le prix de ce quelle recevrait, et stipulerait qu'elle pourrait se lib\u00e9rer de la somme due en livrant une chose d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nTroplong. Echange, T. ler n. 9. No. 32;\u2014\nOn ne peut non plus consid\u00e9rer comme un \u00e9change la double op\u00e9ration qui consiste \u00e0 vendre un immeuble puis, par acte s\u00e9par\u00e9 quoique pass\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour, \u00e0 employer tout ou partie de son prix \u00e0 l'acquisition d'un autre immeuble.\nAgen 10 avril 1833 ; Rodier S. 34. 2. 535. chr.\n4o. Et le seul fait pour une des parties de se r\u00e9server dans un acte qualifi\u00e9 \u00e9change, le privil\u00e8ge du vendeur, ferait consid\u00e9rer cet acte comme une vente au point de vue de l'enregistrement\u2014Cassation, 20 mars 1830, Labigeois et Thuret. (Sirey, 39, 1, 346 ; 39, 1, 464.\nC'est d'ailleurs la doctrine que je trouve consign\u00e9e en toutes lettres dans le factum de l'intim\u00e9. Nous y lisons \u00e0 la page 7;\nAnd moreover these writings under private hand could not be the definite and culminating contract, as a notarial deed had to be passed. Such act was subsequently passed, and differed in several material points from the original writings.\nThe authority of Pothier is amply sufficient for this point.\nSee Pothier, Bugnet, No. 11, p. 10;\u2014\n\" Quoique le seul consentement des parties suffise pourla perfection des contrats consentuels. n\u00e9anmoins si les parties en consentant une vente, ou un louage, ou quelque autre esp\u00e8ce de march\u00e9 sont convenues d'en passer un acte par devant notaire, avec intention que le march\u00e9 ne serait parfait et conclu que lorsque l'acte aurait re\u00e7u sa forme enti\u00e8re, par la signature des parties ou du notaire, le contrat ne recevra effectivement sa perfection que lorsque l'acte du notaire aura re\u00e7u la sienne.\"\nSo that it is finally established that the contract between the parties must be held to be the deed of April 2nd 1898;\nThe notarial deed was essential to the perfection of the bargain and it materially differs from the terms of the private writings.\nJe suis d'avis avec l'intim\u00e9 que l'acte de vente du 2 avril 1898 doit d\u00e9terminer les droits des parties Que cet acte comporte une vente pure et simple, cela ne peut souffrir de doute, les immeubles c\u00e9d\u00e9s par l'appelant ne formant qu'une dation en paiement qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente ([16]) et le dit acte \u00e9tablissant d'ailleurs dune mani\u00e8re definitive ce qu'elles entendaient faire.\nJ'aurais \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 la rescision, m\u00eame si le contrat e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l'\u00e9change ; mais d\u00e8s lors que c'est une vente, ii n'existe plus aucune difficult\u00e9 au sujet de la pr\u00e9tendue impossibilit\u00e9 de remettre les parties dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient lorsque cet acte fut pass\u00e9. A mon humble avis nous n'avons pas de discr\u00e9tion a exercer. En pr\u00e9sence des d\u00e9fauts des murs des maisons, de l'erreur de l'appelant sur la substance de ces b\u00e2tisses et par dessus tout de la\nfraude commise par l'intim\u00e9 fraude qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e\npar le jugement des deux cours accept\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9\u00e9 nous n'avons qu'\u00e0 prononcer l'annulation de l'acte du 2 avril 1898 et en autant que besoin est de l'\u00e9crit du 10 mars.\nL'intim\u00e9 est condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 reprendre ses immeubles en remboursant \u00e0 l'appelant le prix de vente et toutes les sommes qu'il a pay\u00e9es depuis, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat du jour de chaque paiement, le tout avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nReste \u00e0 faire le compte des diverses sommes que les parties se doivent r\u00e9ciproquement. Elles se divisent en deux cat\u00e9gories ; 10 celles qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es et re\u00e7ues avant l'institution de l'action ; et 20 celles qui ne l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 que depuis.\nLes premieres, pay\u00e9es par l'appelant, sont admises dans la pi\u00e8ce du dossier qui se trouve \u00e0 la page 47 de la cause. Elles sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es aux paragraphes 21 et 22 de la d\u00e9claration, page 8 de la cause. Celles qu'il a re\u00e7ues consistent en loyers et ii d\u00e9clare dans son action qu'il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 en rendre compte,d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses d'entretien et d'administration\" En faisant le compte, le Registraire trouvera les chiffres n\u00e9cessaires dans ces paragraphes, auxquels le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats devra \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 compter de la date de chaque paiement,\nOutre ces sommes l'appelant a droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter $32.30 qu'il a pay\u00e9s au notaire St-Denis, pour l'acte de Vente, copie, enregistrement et prot\u00eat, et enfin la somme de $348266 et int\u00e9r\u00eat accord\u00e9 par le justement dout est appel.\nSur l'item de $10,500, \u00e9tant le prix de vente mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 21, ii sera cependant fait une r\u00e9duction d'une somme de $3000 qui a 4t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par l'appelant durant la plaidoirie. Il a avou\u00e9 devant nous que le prix convenu \u00e9tait quelque peu exag\u00e9r\u00e9, ce qui dans les circonstances ne tirait pas \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence. La preuve de la valeur des lots, quoique contradictoire comme elle est toujours dans de pareils cas, justifie cette r\u00e9duction. Cependant je dois ajouter que, sans le bon vouloir de l'appelant qui fait honneur \u00e0 son esprit de justice, j'aurais \u00e9t4 oblige d'ordonner la restitution de tout le montant stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte et reconnu dans une admission \u00e9crite durant le cours du proc\u00e8s la l\u00e9sion n'\u00e9tant pas admise sous l'empire de notre code.\nQuant \u00e0 la seconde cat\u00e9gorie des sommes pay\u00e9es par l'appelant, savoir depuis l'institution de l'action soit pour cause d'hypoth\u00e8que ou de transport d'hypoth\u00e8que ou pour assurance des b\u00e2tisses, r\u00e9parations, frais d'entretien et taxes municipales ou scolaires de quelque nature que ce soit, ou pour toute autre cause \u00e0 raison de la dite vente, le dit appelant en fournira au Registraire de cette cour un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 (avec pi\u00e8ces justificatives si possible), dont ii donnera copie \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai de deux mois, contenant en m\u00eame temps un \u00e9tat des loyers re\u00e7us par lui depuis la date de la lite vente (avec int\u00e9r\u00eat du jour de chaque paiement) et. aussi des d\u00e9penses de collection et d'administration\u00bb qui en seront d\u00e9duites ; et le dit Registraire, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins, proc\u00e9dera \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le montant total qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 l'appelant par l'intim\u00e9 pour toutes les causes, et finalement entrera jugement pour ce montant, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat de sa dates en faveur de l'appelant contre l'intim\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens du compte et d\u00e9bats de compte, s'il y a lieu, et aussi des frais de l'appelant devant toutes les cours, ainsi qu'il est porte plus haut. Nous sommes tous d'avis qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties d'arr\u00eater ce compte de suite au lieu de les renvoyer \u00e0 la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 que nous avons adopt\u00e9 fr\u00e9quemment dans d'autres causes analogues.\nL'appelant pourra retenir les dits immeubles et en faire assurer les b\u00e2tisses aux frais de l'intim\u00e9 jusqu'au paiement int\u00e9gral du dit jugement en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais ; plus l'intim\u00e9 sera tenu de garantir l'appelant \u00e0 raison de 1 acceptation personnelle du transport de bailleur de fonds fait \u00e0 Alfred Des\u00e8ve contre tons troubles, actions, on r\u00e9clamations qui pourraient en r\u00e9sulter. Sur quittance finale de l'appelant d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 devra rentrer dans la possession et propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des dits immeubles et de leurs d\u00e9pendances.

After notice of the final meeting the third arbitrator failed to attend, on account of personal inconvenience and private affairs, but both parties appeared at the time appointed and no objections were raised on account of the absence of the third arbitrator. The award was then made by the other two aibitrators present.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep. 48), that under the circumstances there was cast upon the two arbitrators present the jurisdiction to decide whether or not, in the exercise of judicial discretion, the proceedings should be further delayed or the award made by them alone in the absence of the third arbitrator, and it was not inconsistent with natural justice that they should decide upon making the award themselves.\nHeld, further, that although the third arbitrator had previously suggested some further audit of certain accounts that had already been examined by the arbitrators, there was nothing in this circumstance to impugn the good faith of the other two arbitrators in deciding that further delay was unnecessary.\nWhere it does not appear that an arbitrator is in a position with regard to the parties or the matter in dispute such as might cast suspicion upon his honour and impartiality, there must be proof of actual partiality or unfairness in order to justify the setting aside of the award.\nAPPEAL from the order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] dismissing an appeal from an order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Irving, setting aside an award of arbitrators.\nBy an agreement in writing dated 24th October, 1902, questions in dispute between the appellant and the respondent were submitted to arbitration, the agreement providing that the arbitrators or any two of them should make and publish their award on or before 15th December, 1902. By an order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Irving, dated 5th January, 1903, the time within which the arbitrators might make their award was extended for one month from the date of said order. Two of the arbitrators made and published their award in writing, dated 10th January, 1903, awarding the appellant $4,800.95 in respect of the matters referred to them. The respondent applied to set aside this award, and on the 25th of March, 1903, the Honourable Mr. Justice Irving set it aside with costs to be paid by the appellant. The appellant appealed from this order to the full court of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which, on the 22nd day of June, 1903, dismissed the appeal with costs. From this latter order the present appeal has been taken.\nSir C. Hibbert Tupper K.C. for appellant. No charge of misconduct can be considered established against an arbitrator in the absence of some evidence of acquiescence by him in improper communications by a party, and the authorities shew that the arbitrator's denial on such a question is conclusive. The authorities place an arbitrator in the same position as a judge against whom misconduct will not be inferred in the absence of positive evidence of the clearest character. See Crossley v. Clay[2] ; Wood v. Gold[3]; Falkingham v. Victorian Railways Commissioner[4], at p. 463 ; Russell on Arbitration, (7 ed.) 116; Redman on Awards, (3rd ed.) 109. As was said in Moseley v. Simpson[5], there must be clear evidence of a corrupt act and corruption\u2014mere suspicion is not sufficient. Whenever the conduct of arbitrators is sought to be impeached the court should look with a jealous and scrutinizing eye through the evidence adduced for that purpose. Brown v. Brown[6]. In re Maunder[7] ; Davy's Executors v. Faw[8].\nIn Dailing v. Matchelt[9], the very point is covered of an arbitrator being hindered by other engagements from being present. White v. Sharp[10] ; Russell (7th ed.) p. 666 : Redman, (3 ed.)111; Levick v. Epsom and Leather head Railway Co.[11]; In re Hotchkiss and Hall[12] , at page 427. In Ex parte Pratt[13], it is said that no one has a right so to conduct himself before a tribunal as if he accepted its jurisdiction and afterwards, when he finds that the decision is against him, to deny its jurisdiction. See also In re Elliott and South Devon Ry. Co.[14] ; Re Marsh[15]; Bright v. River Platte Construction Co.[16].\nDavis K. C. for the respondent. The partisan attitude of Smith, one of the arbitrators making the award, and his acceptance of notes on the disputed matters made by the appellant, shew misconduct and the power to remove for misconduct by sec. 12 of the Arbitration Act has been rightly exercised. The absent arbitrator, Buscombe, had insisted that the accounts of the Grand Forks business should be gone into before the award was made, but Ceperley peremptorily closed, the award. There was considerable correspondence, but Ceperley and Smith proceeded to Vernon on the 9th of January, knowing that it was impossible for Buscombe to be present, and made an award, giving Doberer a large sum of money. The good faith of both Smith and Ceperley is impeached. Smith, in the course of the conferences, acquired very great influence over the mind of Ceperley, which subsequently culminated in Ceperley taking the course which he did, and which, together with Smith's improper conduct, are the acts complained of and chiefly relied upon in the application to set aside the award.\nIt may be said that there are two points, viz.: 1. Whether the award should be set aside ; and, 2. Assuming that the evidence discloses sufficient material to set aside the'award, has the respondent waived his right ?\nUpon the first point, the correspondence clearly shows that the other two arbitrators knew that it would be almost impossible for Buscombe to attend on the final making of the award. They knew that Buscombe insisted upon going into the accounts between the parties before the award was made, and he never had any opportunity of doing this. The action of Ceperley and Smith prevented his doing so. The two arbitrators in fact insisted upon making the award without listening to the advice of their colleague, and refused to admit the evidence and do that which, in his opinion, Was necessary before an award should be made. Templeman v. Reid[17] ; Morgan v. Bolt[18]. The conduct of Smith and Geperley is highly reprehensible. With respect to waiver, a person willnot be deemed to have waived a right unless at the time of the alleged waiver he was fully cognizant of such rights and of the facts of the case, nor unless the acts relied upon as constituting a waiver were done under such circumstances that he may reasonably be presumed to have intended to waive the right. Darnley v. London Chatham & Dover Railway Co.[19], at page 57. It must be shewn that Megaw had assented to something amounting to a waiver after he had become aware of the irregularity or impropriety of the arbitrators' conduct. Hayward v. Phillips[20]. We refer also to Conmee v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co[21], at page 648 ; Harvey v. Shelton[22] ; Race v. Anderson[23]; Re Haigh's Estate[24]; Dobson v. Groves[25], at page 648; Smith v. Sparrow[26], at page 611.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nKILLAM J.\u2014We are all of opinion that there was no sufficient ground for setting aside the award in question upon this appeal.\nThere was no proof of actual misconduct on the part of any of the arbitrators. The utmost which the evidence can be taken to suggest is a partisan attitude of the arbitrator appointed by the appellant and an arrangement by him to take \" notes \" from the appellant, behind the backs of the other arbitrators, respecting the matters in question.. Both he and the appellant deny that he received any such \" notes.\" There is no proof that he did, or that he consulted with or received suggestions from the appellant separately, and the evidence does not appear to us to warrant the inference that he assented to the adoption of any such course. The only affidavit charging expressions of the arbitrator distinctly chowing partiality was directly contradicted and does not appear to have been relied on in the court below.\nUndoubtedly, an arbitrator should be careful to conduct himself not only with scrupulous fairness towards all parties, but also in such a manner as to cast no suspicion upon his honour and impartiality. But when he is not shown to have been so situated towards any of the parties, or the subject matter in dispute, or otherwise, as to render him unfitted to be an arbitrator in the matter, there should be some proof of actual partiality or unfair action.\nThe reference authorized the making of an award by two of the arbitrators. It is true that this would not have justified any two in proceeding without reference to the third ; but on the other hand, it would be unreasonable that one of three arbitrators should be allowed to prevent the other two from making an award under a reference authorizing the two to make it. Here the third had full notice of the final meeting and an opportunity to attend. His reason for not being present was personal inconvenience and personal business. The other arbitrators were notified that he proposed to go to a distance on business, and upon his own letters it would appear uncertain that he would return before the expiration of the time then fixed for the making of the award. He had refused to concur in fixing any date prior to his departure for a meeting of the arbitrators.\nAt the appointed time both parties appeared and an opportunity was given them by the arbitrators present to raise any point or objection. No objection was raised, and no request was made for delay to enable the third arbitrator to meet the others, although the respondent was fully advised of the situation.\nUnder such circumstances, there was cast upon the two arbitrators the jurisdiction to decide whether, in the exercise of a judicial discretion, the proceedings should be further delayed or the award made by themselves alone, and it does not appear that they acted in a manner inconsistent with natural justice in deciding to make their award.\nThe basis of the award had already been settled by the three arbitrators. The third arbitrator had indicated his view that there should be an audit of certain accounts of the respondent for the purpose of ascertaining whether further credits should be allowed to him.

The appellant filed a requ\u00eate civile to revoke the latter judgments within six months after it had been rendered, but without referring to the first judgment in the conclusions of the petition. It was objected that the first judgment had the effect of res judicata as to the matters in dispute and was a final judgment inter partes.\nHeld, that whether the first judgment was final or merely interlocutory, the petition in revocation must be taken as impeaching both former judgments relating to the accounts upon which it was based that it came in time as it had been filed within six months of the rendering of the said last judgment and that it virtually raised anew all the issues relating to the taking of the accounts affected by the two former judgments.\nA motion to amend the petition so as to include specifically any necessary conclusions against the judgment of 30th September, 1901 had been refused in the court below and was renewed on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that, as the facts set forth in the petition necessarily involved a contestation of the accountant's reports dealt with in the first judgment, the case was a proper one for the exercise of the discretion allowed by section 63 of the Supreme Court Act and that the amendment to the conclusions of the petition should be permitted nunc pro tune.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the petition in revocation of judgment upon which a new trial had been ordered in an action en reddition de compte et partage.\nOn 16th June, 1902, the appellant presented a petition in revocation of a judgment rendered 30th January 1902, based on the report of an accountant, dismissing her action as against the executor and condemning her to pay respondents $26,316.34, and declaring the remaining undivided assets of the estate in question to belong to the respondents, on the grounds that the final judgment had been rendered on false documents, which had only subsequently been discovered to be false, and also the discovery of new evidence. The Superior Court Archibald J. on 10th January, 1903, maintained the petition, revoked the final judgment and replaced the parties in the position they were occupying before the judgment. The respondent appealed to the Court of King's Bench, which on 28th April, 1903, by a judgment of a majority of judges reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the petition in revocation of judgment. The plaintiff now appeals.\nThe questions raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgment now reported.\nT. Chase Casgrain K.C. and Farquhar S. Maclennan K.C. for the appellants.\nThe plaintiff was not guilty of want of diligence in not having the new evidence at the original trial, but exercised reasonable diligence in procuring all known evidence pertinent to the issue. The law does not require extraordinary diligence. Wilson v. Clancy ([1]) ' Broadhead v. Marshall ([2]); Shields v. Boucher ([3]).\nThe word ' false' in art. 1177 0. P. Q. must be given its natural ordinary meaning of untrue or erroneous, which has been placed upon it by the Court of Review. and in the case of Durocher v. Durocher ([4]). Upon that construction, the judgment, without doubt, has been based upon false documents and should be set aside. 4 Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, Quest. 1759; 1 Pigeau, pp. 550, 555 * D. P. 54-2-182; 68-2-79; Dalloz Supplement vol. 15, to. Requ\u00eate Civile, nn. 74-77 : Labori, vol- 11, vo. Requ\u00eate Civile, n. 165; Laflamme v. St, Jacques ([5]). Even a slight irregularity in procedure may give rise to a requ\u00eate civile; Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan ([6]); Neil v. Champoux ([7]); Glazier v. Kotzan ([8]).\nThe judgment of 20th September, 1901, cannot beheld to be chose jug\u00e9e or res judicata with respect to the issues raised on the petition in revocation. The issues are not the same. In the judgment of September there is no dispositif of the issues which respondent now claims were finally decided in her favour. In the original case the plaintiff claimed to be discharged from the bon and draft because the advances on them were gifts under the will; but the contention in the petition was on the ground of payment and surrender of titles. In the original case, plaintiff claimed to be discharged from the Winning, Hill and Ware liability by a deed of composition and a judgment of discharge from court; but in the petition, that the liability had been extinguished by novation and entirely independent of the deed of composition to which he never became a party. The two issues in each proceeding were entirely distinct, and different evidence was applicable to each. The September judgment did not pass upon the issues presented in the petition and, therefore, the defence of chose jug\u00e9e must fail. The test of identity is found in the inquiry if the same evidence would support both proceedings. It is clear it would not. 24 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 2ed., 780, 781; Township of Stanstead v. Beach ([9]) per Hall J. at p. 282 of the Queen's Bench Reports; 7 Larombi\u00e8re art. 1351 sec. 18. The September judgment did not dispose of the entire controversy between the parties. It was necessary to have the accounts of the parties before the court in order that a further judgment should be rendered, dividing the property and finally disposing of the action on the demand for partition. The judgment appointing the accountant originally did not order the accounts of the parties to be made up. That order was given by the September judgment, and it was necessary, because the September judgment did not fix the amount of the share of each party nor how much was to be divided nor of what the property to be divided consisted, whether monies, bank shares, stocks or real estate, nor whether the property was such as could be conveniently divided in kind. All these details and particulars appear in the final judgment of 30th January, 1902, based upon the supplementary report filed in pursuance of the September judgment. Moreover, the plaintiff did not get the benefit of the reduction 6f interest made in his favour by the September judgment, as the accountant under took to reduce the overcharge of interest by a different amount. See Thompson v. Mylne ([10]). A preliminary decree, prescribing the manner of proceeding deemed necessary by the court to arrive at a final decision, cannot have the force of res judicata It remains under the control of the court, subject to its revision, until a final decision.\nIn so far as the September judgment can be held to determine the principle on which the supplementary report was to be made in order to arrive at the rights and shares of the parties, it was an interlocutory judgment contemplating further proceedings in court and subject to revision on the final judgment disposing of the prayer in the conclusions of the action asking for a partition of the property in question. See Tate v. Janes ([11]); Wardle v. Bethune ([12]); Lottinville v. McGreevy ([13]); Grane v. McBean ([14]); Budden v. Rochon ([15]); Bayard v. Dinelle ([16]).\nWhen the petition in revocation was presented, the contention of the plaintiff was that if the final judgment of 30th January, 1902, disposing of the action. and the judgment of 25th October, 1901, homologating the supplementary report were revoked and set aside, the whole case would be re-opened in such a manner that effect could be given to the new evidence and that the case could then be disposed of in the light of the whole evidence then before the court. The plaintiff, accordingly, did not pray for the revocation of the judgment of 20th September, regarding it as an interlocutory judgment. At the trial the plaintiff moved for leave to amend the prayer of the petition by including in the paragraph of the conclusions asking for the revocation of the judgments of January 80th, 1902, and October 25th, 1901, the interlocutory judgment of September 20th, 1901, and that application is now renewed before your lordships and under the provisions of arts. 513 to 526 C. P. Q. and sec. 63 of the Supreme Court Act. The plaintiff is entitled to the amendment if it is necessary to do justice between the parties.\nThe plaintiff asked to be permitted to plead as part of the contestation of the accountant's report the facts set out in the petition in revocation, which related not only to the supplementary report but also to portions of the original report, and would not in any manner change the nature of the demand, but merely allow the plaintiff to ask for the revocation of the September judgment as well as of the two subsequent judgments. Poulin v. Langlois ([17]) Walker v. St. Maurice ([18]); Seery v. St. Lawrence Grain Elevating Co. ([19]); Haight v. City of Montreal ([20]). In Voligny v. Corbeille ([21]), an amendment was allowed o a requ\u00eate civile. See also Dugas v. Marineau ([22]) Perrault v. Simard ([23]); Bressler v. Bell ([24]). The Privy Council in Kent.v. La Communaut\u00e9 des Saurs de Charit\u00e9 de la Providence ([25]), granted leave to amend the pleadings after refusal of the motion in the court below, and referred the case back to the Superior Court for judgment on the merits. We also refer to Lambe v. Armstrong ([26]); Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois ([27]); and City of Montreal v. Hogan ([28]).\nB\u00e9ique K.C. and Lighthall for the respondents. The judgment of 20th September, 1901, is chose jug\u00e9e between the parties and cannot now be annulled, reversed or modified; Art. 1241 C. C. It was a final judgment; Shaw v. St. Louis ([29]); Singster v. Lacroix ([30]) : FuzierHerman, Rep. vo. \"Jugement\" nn. 41, 134, 141, 150, 212 bis, 213, 232, 233, 235, 282 et seq., 406. See also Barry v. Rodier ([31]); Mercier v. Barrette ([32]); Forest v. Heathers ([33]); Budden v. 'Rochon ([34]); Plenderleath v. McGillivray ([35]); Benjamin v. Wilson ([36]). Conversely, the judgment of September 20th is not in any sense an interlocutory judgment of a nature subject to revision by the judgment of 30th January, 1902, and still less by that on the petition. It is not even mentioned in the petition.\nThe missing books and documents had been seen by the plaintiff and their non-production cannot correspond to the discovery of \"documents\" of a conclusive nature withheld owing to circumstances contemplated by the law. All the alleged \" new documents\" and \"new evidence \" are choses jug\u00e9es under the judgments of 20th September and 11th November, 1901. Hence even if petitioner were put back to the position of 25th October, 1901, the ultimate result would not be changed, for he would still be blocked by these judgments. Hence the provisions of art. 505 \u00a7 1 C. P. Q. are not complied with.\nIn short, to go back to the position before 25th October, 1901, would be useless and illegal.\nWere the alleged facts true the great lack of diligence alone works an estoppel after so many years of opportunity for a regular trial. The alleged excuse is only the neglect to make ordinary searches. Fairbanks v. Barlow ([37]); Benoit v. Salvas ([38]); Daoust v. Paquet ([39]).\nThe Supreme Court has settled the jurisprudence of this case in Shaw v. St, Louis ([40]) and we submit also that in a question of provincial procedure the decision of the-provincial court of appeal should be left undisturbed.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal at Montreal reversing a judgment of the Superior Court which had granted the conclusions of a \"petition in revocation of judgment filed by the present appellant. It arises from an unfortunate quarrel between brother and sister over the division of their father's estate.\nUpon an action en reddition de compte et partage, the accountant duly appointed by the court made a report by which he found the appellant to be indebted to the respondent in a very large amount. The parties both filed a contestation of that report. The case having gone to trial on these two contestations, the court by a judgment of the 20th September, 1901, adjudicated upon the various contentions of the parties, but referred the report back to the accountant to have it altered according to the said adjudication, with order to return it as so altered within ten days, costs of the whole case to be paid out of the estate. The said altered report having been duly filed, the court, upon motion by the respondent, homologated it on the 25th of October, 1901. By that report the appellant was found to be indebted to the respondent in a sum of $26,316; and upon inscription by the respondent for judgment accordingly, the court, on the 30th January, 1902, gave judgment for that amount in favour of the respondent against the appellant, as it could not but do.\nThe appellant subsequently, in June following, presented a petition in revocation judgment under article 1117 of the Code of Procedure, alleging that since the said condemnation against him he had discovered new evidence of which he had no prior knowledge whatever, which new evidence, as he alleges, would establish that instead of his being the respondent's debtor, he is her creditor in a substantial amount. His conclusions are:\n1. That the present petition in revocation of judgment be received by this court\n2. That an order be forthwith made and promulgated to suspend the execution of said judgment of 30 th January, 1902.\n3. That the said judgment of 30th January, 1902, and all proceedings had thereon, and the interlocutory judgment rendered on 25th October, 1901, homologating said supplementary report, be revoked, annulled, set aside, rescinded, cancelled, declared void and of no effect; and that said parties be restored and replaced in the same positions occupied by them respectively prior to the rendering of the said judgments.\n4. That the plaintiff petitioner be permitted to plead as part of his contestation of the said accountant's report the facts herein above set forth\nUpon issue joined by respondent upon the said petition the case went on to trial upon this new incident thereof, and ultimately judgment was given by the Superior Court granting the conclusions of the petition, the court finding that its essential allegations of fact had been proved. Upon an appeal by the respondent, the Court of Appeal reversed that judgment exclusively upon the ground that as the petition did not ask the revocation of the judgment dated the 20th September, 1901, the appellant's petition could not be allowed, the court holding that the judgment revoking only those of the 25th October, 1901, and of the 30th January, 1902, as prayed for, which were but the necessary consequence of that of September, 1901, and in execution thereof, without revoking this last one which to all intents and purposes was a final judgment, was inoperative and of no effect.\nThe findings of fact of the trial judge were not interfered with, and I may at once say that I cannot see that we would be justified in interfering with them here.\nThe case, under these circumstances, that is presented for our determination is, to me, a plain one. The petition has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal simply upon the ground that by inadvertence the petitioner has omitted in his conclusions to include with the other two judgments the one of the 20th September, 1901. Now all the allegations of the petitioner are directed against that judgment. That is the one by which he is aggrieved, assuming his allegations of fact to be well founded. His demand would be nonsensical if it did not attack that judgment as well as the others.\nThe contestation of the accountant's supplementary report that he specifically asks to be allowed to make upon the facts he has since discovered necessarily includes a contestation of his first rer>ort as the second is, of course, based entirely on the first. He asks that the accounts between him and the respondent be opened up de novo, and that could not be done without revoking the said judgment of September, 1901. It is patent that the omission to include it specifically in the conclusions of the petition is due to a clerical error and nothing else.\nNow, the Supreme Court Act decrees expressly section 63, that at any time during the pending of an appeal this court may, with or without any application,. make all such amendments as are necessary for the purpose of determining the real question or controversy between the parties as disclosed by the pleadings, evidence or proceedings.\nI am of opinion that here we should exercise the discretion that the statute so confess upon us and order that the necessary amendment nunc pro tunc be made in the conclusions of the said petition, by adding therein1 as if included in the petition as filed, the said judgment of the 20th September, and that the parties be restored, to the position they respectively occupied before the rendering of the said last judgment. If the appellant fails to prove the facts that he now says he is able to prove, the respondent will not suffer; the judgment in his favour will remain. If on the conrary, these facts are proved a gross injustice will have been prevented.\nThe respondent herself, I may add, in her plea to the appellant's petition renounced to the large sum of $15,679 and interest from the 30th of September, 1901, much more than half of the judgment that she had recovered against the appellant Now that sum had been taken by the court from the accountant's first report, antecedent to the judgment of September 1901, as item No. 57 thereof. This shews clearly, first, that, notwithstanding the respondent's reserves and without determining what may be the consequence of that retraxit, if the appellant had not asked for the revocation of these judgments against him, he would have been forced to pay the $15679 and interest from which that plea of the respondent purports to relieve him. And, secondly, that the respondent herself pleaded to the said petition as impugning the judgment of September, 1901, since it is by that judgment that the court determined the contestation as to that item 57.\nI do not think it necessary to consider the question argued at bar whether the said judgment of September, 1901, was a final or an interlocutory one. I must say that it seems to me, without determining it however, that the Court of Appeal was right in holding if to have been a final one The Queen v. Clark ([41]). But this is of no consequence as I view the case. The petition virtually attacked it, must be read as attacking it, and that petition was filed within the six months given to attack a final judgment.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court with the addition of the judgment of September, 1901, in the dispositif thereof.\nAs to the costs, under the circumstances, I would give none to either party in the Court of Appeal nor in this court.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Farquhar S.

J. and Sedgewick, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nContract\u2014Resolution by municipal corporation\u2014Acceptance of offer to purchase\u2014Evidence\u2014Written instruments\u2014Statute of frauds\u2014Estoppel.\nT. offered to purchase lands which the municipality had bid in at a tax sale, and to pay therefor the amount of the arrears of taxes and costs. The council resolved to accept \"the amount of taxes, costs and interest\" against the lands and authorized the reeve and clerk to issue a deed at that price.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that, even if communicated to T. as an acceptance of his offer, this resolution would have raised no contract, on account of the variation made by the addition of interest.\nAn instrument, which was never delivered to T, was executed by the reeve and clerk of the municipality, in the statutory form of conveyance upon a sale for taxes, reciting the above resolution but without a reference to any contract in pursuance of the resolution, and about two months after the passing of the resolution, upon receipt of another offer for the same lands, the council resolved to intimate to the person making the second offer \" that the lot had been sold to T.\"\nHeld, that these circumstances could not be relied upon as an admission of a prior contract of sale.\nHeld, also, that, even if it could be inferred that contractual relations had been established between T. and the municipality, it did not appear that there had been any written communications in respect thereto made on behalf of the municipality and, consequently, the alleged admissions of a contract did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds and could have no effect.\n[Page 133.]\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, en banc, reversing the judgment of the Honourable the Chief Justice of British Columbia, at the trial, and awarding the plaintiff such damages as should be settled, on a reference, by the registrar of the court.\nThe lands in question were advertised for sale for delinquent taxes under R. S. B. C. ch. 144, as amended by 61 Vict. ch. 35, sec. 6 (B.C.) and were bid in by the municipality, under the provisions of the statute. The Act permits the municipality to sell property so bid in and not redeemed within the prescribed time, by a resolution sanctioned by a two-thirds vote of the council, for such price as the resolution may specify. An order was obtained confirming the sale under the provisions of sec. 14 of the last mentioned statute, and by the 15th section, the owner was entitled within a year from the date of the order, i. e., from 3rd January, 1900, to redeem his land. There was no deed of the land executed to the municipality, nor was there any demand for such a deed made under secs. 15 and 16 of the Act. While affairs were in this position, the plaintiff wrote the following letter to the defendants : \" I understand that lot No. 1483 was sold for taxes at the last sale and is now held by the municipality. I would like to know the lowest cash price for it or, if you will accept the taxes and costs to date, I will pay that amount for the property.\"\nOn receipt of the letter the council passed a resolution, on 3rd September, 1902, as follows: \"Letter from Col. T. H. Tracy offering to purchase dist. lot number 1483, was received, and on motion of Councillor May, seconded by Councillor Erwin, it was resolved to accept for this property the amount of taxes, costs and interest to this date against it, amounting to $88, and the reeve and clerk were authorized to issue a deed for that price.\" About 15th November, 1902, the reeve and clerk signed and sealed an instrument dated 14th November, 1902, in the form of a conveyance at a tax sale to the plaintiff, but the instrument was never delivered and was indorsed \" not delivered.\" On the day of the execution of the instrument, the clerk received a letter from Tracy, dated 13th November, 1902, inclosing a certified cheque for $88, and asking for a deed of the land. On 14th November, 1902, the owner's agent wrote to the council stating that he wished to redeem the property and asking to be advised of the amount due. Thereupon the plaintiff's cheque was returned to him, on 17th November, 1902, and on the 20th of the same month the land was redeemed by the owner. On the 5th November, 1902, another offer had been received from another person proposing to purchase the land, and the council, on considering it, resolved \" to intimate to him that the lot had been sold to Col. Tracy.\"\nAt the trial the plaintiff's action was dismissed, and on appeal to the full court the trial court judgment was reversed, Irving J. dissenting, and judgment ordered to be entered for the plaintiff, the amount of damages to be settled before the registrar. The present appeal is taken by the defendant from the latter judgment.\nRiddell K.C. and Rose for the appellant. For want of a deed and of the demand required by the statute, the land, at the date of the resolutions, remained vested in the owner and the municipality had no power to make a sale of it. The resolution was not under seal (Municipal Clauses Act, R. S. B. C. ch. 144, sec. 26), and it does not purport to sell; it merely expresses a willingness to sell on terms differing from those on which the offer was made. No estoppel can arise in consequence of the resolution subsequently passed in regard to the second offer ; it merely shews that the council were in error as to the legal position of the matter Nor is any estoppel worked by the instrument executed by the reeve and clerk, more particularly as, in that document, the reeve and clerk are grantors, not the corporation. It had no validity outside of the statute and, it could not operate under the statute as the provisions of the statute had not been complied with and it was never delivered. McLaughlin v. Mayhew[1] ; Phillips v. Edwards[2], and authorities there cited. The receipt of the cheque was not made known to the council till 3rd December, 1902.\nThe resolution is not a contract but merely an expression of opinion of the council; Jennett v. Sinclair[3] ; and it is not equivalent to a contract under the seal of the company. Resolutions of a council will not bind the corporation. Lindley on Companies (6 ed.) vol. 1, p. 426 c. ; Dunston v. Imperial Gas Light & Coke Co.[4]. A corporation will not be compelled to execute a contract which it has been resolved shall be entered into by it,as it is only bound by contract under seal. Lindley on Companies, p. 270 (c), (d) and (e) ; Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton[5], at p. 823 ; Wilmot v. Corporation of Coventry[6] ; Taylor v. Dulwich Hospital[7] Carter v. Dean of Ely[8], at pp. 222 and 229 ; Mayor of Oxford v. Crow [9] ; Houck v. Town of Whitby [10]; Silsby v. Village of Dunnville[11].\nA contract of sale is not effective unless the name of the vendee be therein inserted as vendee, and none appears in this resolution. White v. Tomalin[12] ; McIntosh v. Moynihan[13], and cases therein cited. As no demand in writing was made the period of redemption had not elapsed and the resolution was ultra vires of the council: consequently the defendants are not liable. Dillon on Corporations (4 ed.) sec. 447 ; Brice on Ultra Vires (3 ed.) p. 145; The British Mutual Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Railway Co.[14], at p. 719. No corporate body can be bound by estoppel to do something beyond its corporate powers. See also Mayor of Kidderminster v. Hardwick[15], and the cases there considered, and Mayor of Oxford v. Crow[16].\nDavis K.C. for the respondent. The view taken by the Chief Justice at the trial, dismissing the action on the ground that an ordinary tax deed should have been given by the municipality, is entirely erroneous. The plaintiff was not entitled to a tax deed but to a deed of property owned by the municipality.\nThe municipality had authority to sell or to agree to sell the land in question to the plaintiff, because it was \" not redeemed within the specified time,\" the year referred to in section 15, which had elapsed. Even if \" specified time \" includes not only the year but the time-up to and until a demand in writing, then the latter provision was not intended to and does not apply in a case where the municipality has itself purchased at its own tax sale. This provision is merely to give the municipality notice that the purchaser at the tax sale intends to insist upon his purchase instead of abandoning it. The provision is not in any way for the benefit of the purchaser ; it is simply for the information of the municipality and to prevent conveyances to purchasers who may possibly have decided to abandon purchases. There is no particular form of demand in writing required, anything is sufficient which clearly intimates that the purchaser intends to insist upon his purchase and to acquire title. No notice could be clearer in this direction than the notice that the municipality has actually sold the land to a third person and has instructed the clerk to perfect the title.\nThe resolution of 3rd September was passed by virtue, not only of the statute, but also of the by-law passed authorizing the tax sale, which was under seal, and, as the council may act by resolution, this resolution has the same effect as if it was also under seal.\nThe offer of the plaintiff was, it is true, the amount of the taxes and costs, and the resolution refers to taxes, costs and interest, but interest is really part of the taxes and there can be no doubt that the resolution was intended as an acceptance of the offer. All parties understood taxes and costs to be the same as taxes, interest and costs. This is put beyond all question by the entry in the minute book of 5th November, which shews that the parties were ad idem and that the sale was made to the plaintiff.\nBut if this is not so, then the contract consists, on the part of the council, in the resolution of the 3rd September, which is in writing signed by the reeve and having the same effect by virtue of the bylaw as if it were itself under seal. The offer contained in this resolution was at once communicated to the plaintiff and accepted by him orally, and subsequently in writing by his letter of the 13th November containing a marked cheque for the amount of the purchase price. The deed drawn up by the clerk, though in a wrong form, has the corporate seal of the municipality attached. The effect of the resolution was to close the whole matter as if it were a bylaw duly passed and voted on by the people for the purpose of conveying land and instructing the reeve and clerk to carry out the deal by executing the deed ; it put it beyond the power of the municipality to further deal with this land, and all that remained for it to do was to see that the reeve and clerk did as they were instructed and executed the deed ;\nThis being so, there has clearly been on the part of the municipality a breach of contract, and one for which they must be responsible in damages. The vendor could have obtained a title but neglected or refused to do so, and by its own action was prevented from being able to carry out the contract; consequently ordinary damages should be given. Simons v. Patchett[17] ; Engell v. Fitch[18] ; Bain v. Fothergill[19] ; Rowe v. School Board for London[20]. The municipality are in the position of an individual who, having obtained the option, has entered into an agreement to sell property to a third person, but who, although perfectly able to acquire a good title and transmit same to his vendee, deliberately choose to refrain from taking advantage of the option and obtaining a title to the property. Under these circumstances damages should be awarded.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nKILLAM J.\u2014We are all of opinion that there was not sufficient proof of a contract of sale of the land in question by the defendant municipality.\nThe plaintiff made an offer to purchase the land for the taxes and costs.\nUpon that offer being laid before it, the council passed the following resolution :\nLetter from Col. T. H. Tracy offering to purchase district lot No. 1483, was received, and on motion of Councillor May, seconded by Councillor Erwin, it was resolved to accept for this property the amount of taxes, costs and interest to this date against it, amounting to $88, and the reeve and clerk were authorized to issue a deed for that price. Even if communicated as an acceptance of the offer made, this would have raised no contract on account of the addition of interest. It is not shown that, under this resolution, a counter offer in its terms was made to the plaintiff. So far as the evidence goes, it was a mere expression of the willingness of the council to accept the sum it named and an authority to the officers of the municipality to make the conveyance.\nThe provisions of the statutes and the by-law authorizing the municipal council to sell such property \" by a resolution sanctioned by a vote of two-thirds of the council\" can only be interpreted as specifying the method by which the enactment of the governing body giving authority for such a sale should be made. Until acted on the plaintiff acquired no rights under it. So far as he was concerned it could have been rescinded or modified at the pleasure of the council. It did not constitute an agreement, or even an offer the acceptance of which could create an agreement.\nAbout two months after the passing of the resolution just mentioned, upon receipt of an offer from a Mr. Diploch for the land, the council \" resolved to intimate to him that lot had been sold to Col. Tracy.\" This is relied on as an admission of a prior contract of sale. While it is impossible to say that it is not evidence which might be more or less cogent, according to circumstances, it does not appear to us that it should be relied on as sufficient proof that, as a matter of fact, the parties had really contracted with each other in the terms of the previous resolution. It seems difficult to believe that any communications constituting a contract would not have been formally proved if they had existed, and it would be unsafe to rely on the latter resolution as proving such communications as a court of law would have held to constitute a contract. The instrument executed by the reeve and clerk of the municipality recited the resolution authorizing a sale, but not a contract in pursuance of the resolution. It was in the statutory form of conveyance by the officers upon a sale for taxes. It did not purport to be the act or grant of the municipality. Admittedly it was not delivered. It was, no doubt, intended to take effect, upon payment of the purchase money, as the conveyance authorized by the resolution. But as a memorandum in the hands of the municipal officers, it did not evidence the existence of a prior binding contract between the municipality and the plaintiff\nThere is a further point which appears to me to be, if possible, even stronger against the plaintiff's right to enforce his alleged contract. Even if we could feel justified in inferring that, as a matter of fact, the contractual relation had been entered into, it is not shown that this was done by any written communication on behalf of the municipality, and the alleged admissions of a contract do not satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. The deed of the officers, as already stated, contains no admission of a prior existing contract, written or verbal, and the resolution to inform Mr. Diplock that the land had been sold to the plaintiff made no reference to the prior resolution or to the terms of sale and is not sufficiently connected with the previous resolution to involve an admission of a sale on those terms.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to any of the other points argued before us.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order dismissing the action restored, with costs here and in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhillips & Williams.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis, Marshall & Macneill.\n[1] 2 Ont.

At the trial, after the evidence was all in, counsel for the defendants moved to have the case withdrawn from the jury and the action dismissed, contending that the uncontradicted evidence prevented the plaintiff from recovering. This was refused and the case went to the jury who answered all the questions submitted in favour of the plaintiff and judgment was entered for her accordingly. Defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal asking for judgment or a new trial. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial and the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court for the greater relief previously demanded. Lucas (Wright with Kim) for the respondent, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not final and that the discretion of the Court of Appeal in granting one of the two remedies sought could not be reviewed.\nAylesworth K.C. contra, contended that the judgment was final as the case would be at an end if the appeal was successful. Also, that if the appeal was from the order for a new trial it was clearly given in the Act.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent moves to quash this appeal upon the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act Under section 24 of the said Act an appeal is given from final judgments only, and section 2, subsection \u201ce\u201d enacts that the expression \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nThe action is one brought by the respondent against the appellants to recover the sum of $2,000 on a policy of insurance.\nUpon the findings of the jury, the presiding judge having previously refused appellants\u2019 application for the dismissal of the action, judgment was directed to be entered for the respondent for the sum of $1,905.24.\nFrom that judgment the present appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and in their reasons of appeal reiterated their contention that there was no case for the jury, and that the action should be dismissed, and, in the alternative, that a new trial should be granted. The court ordered a new trial. The respondent, though she loses thereby the benefit of the verdict that she had recovered, does not appeal from that judgment, as she undoubtedly would have had the right to do since the amendment to the Supreme Court Act of 1891, 54 & 55 V. c. 25, sec. 2. But singular to say, it is the appellants who, though they obtained from the Court of Appeal one of the alternatives they prayed for, would now contend that they are aggrieved by that judgment, because, they argue, the court should have granted the other of their alternative demands, and should have dismissed the respondent\u2019s action. They, on the one hand, hold on to the judgment granting them their demand for a new trial, and, on the other hand, would ask us to set it aside, but upon condition that we should enter a judgment dismissing the action, and that should we dismiss their appeal, they retain the benefit of the order for a new trial.\nWe are of opinion that this is not an appeal from a final judgment within the meaning of that word under the Supreme Court Act. No appeal lies from a judgment simply refusing to dismiss or to nonsuit plaintiff. There is no final determination whatever in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the appellants complain of. See Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff[2]; Grant v. Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[3]; St. Louis Iron Mountain and Southern Rd. Co. v. The Southern Express Co.[4]; Ex parte Norton[5]; McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio Central Railway Co.[6]; Murphy v. Spaulding[7]; St. Clair County v. Lovingston[8]. They cannot and do not appeal from the judgment ordering a new trial.\nTrue, it is, that if we allowed the appeal and dismissed the motion, that would put an end to the litigation. But, as we said in Barrington v. The Scottish Union and National Ins. Co.[9], that is not the criterion of the jurisdiction of this court; that is mistaking the exit door for the entrance door of the court. Our jurisdiction does not depend upon the judgment that we might possibly give, but upon the judgment that has been given by the court appealed from.\nThe appeal is quashed; no costs, as the respondent should have moved in limine.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacMurchy, Denison & Henderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lucas, Wright & McArdle.\n[1] 5 Ont.

AT QUEBEC.\nContract\u2014Deceit and fraud\u2014Rescission \u2014 Evidence\u2014Concurrent findings of lower courts\u2014Duty of second court of appeal.\nA sale of timber limits to the plaintiff was effected through a broker for a price stated in the deed to be $112,500, but the vendor signed an acknowledgment that the true price, so far as he was concerned, was $75,000. At the time of the execution of the deed a statement was made shewing how the purchase money was to be paid and the vendor signed an agreement that out of the balance of the $112,500, viz. $46,502.02, the plaintiff was to get $37,500, i.e.. the amount of the difference between the true price and that mentioned in the deed. The vendor refused to pay over this $37500 on the ground that the plaintiff and the broker had conspired together to deceive him as to the actual price to be obtained for the limits and that the sale was not in fact to the plaintiff for $75,000 but to the plaintiff's principals, the grantees in the deed, for the full consideration of $1125000, and that the plaintiff and the broker were acting fraudulently and seeking by deceit and artifice to deprive him of the full price at which the sale had been effected In an action to recover the $37500 from the vendor :\u2014 Held, affirming the judgments appealed from, that the acknowledgements signed by the vendor settled the rights of the parties unless there was very strong evidence to the contrary and, as there was no such evidence and as the circumstances as found by the courts below tended to shew that plaintiff was entitled to the money in dispute as the natural result of the transactions between the parties the case was one in which a second court of appeal would not be justified in disturbing the concurrent findings at the trial and of the court appealed from.\nAPPEALS by the intervenant and the defendant from the judgments of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, affirming the judgments of the superior Court, District of Quebec, maintaining the plaintiffs action with costs and dismissing the intervention of the appellant, Price, with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case in respect to both appeals, are as follows : \u2014The defendant, Veilleux, was the owner of timber limits on the Portneuf river, having an approximate area of three hundred miles. These limits had been purchased at a Government sale by Veilleux, who found difficulty in paying for them, and ultimately borrowed money from a Mr. Amyot for that purpose. Amyot on making the loan took a title to the limits giving Veilleux a right to redeem them within a limited time. This time being about to expire, Veilleux applied to the Hon. L. P. Pelletier to assist him in finding a purchaser for his limits Mr. Pelletier saw Mr. Price who agreed to advanee one-half of $2,000, the necessary sum to obtain an extension of time from Amyot, if Pelletier would advance the other half and go into the transaction on joint account. This was agreed to, and on the 1st March, 1902, an agreement was entered into between Veilleux and Price represented by Pelletier to the effect that, in consideration of Price advancing $2,000 to obtain a six months' extension of time for redemption Veilleux transferred to him all right of property in the limits, and authorized a sale for not less than $200,000; and that in the event of sale, after payment of Amyot and all expenses the balance should be divided between Veilleux and Price. By memorandum at the bottom of the agreement signed by Pelletier and Price, it was stated that Price was acting in the joint interest of himself and Pelletier, Who was entitled to one-half of any profit which should be made out of the transaction. The $2,000 having been paid to Amyot, a subsequent agreement was entered into on 8th May, 1902, by which the People's Bank of Halifax, with the consent of Price, paid Amyot in full and took over the limits to secure the payment as well of $36,000 paid by the bank to Amyot, as of $11,660.33 previously due by Veilleux to the bank, also of $2,100, repaid to Price, and of the sums necessary to be paid to th3 Crown Lands Department to obtain the transfer of the limits to the bank, and it was agreed that until 1st November, then next, Veilleux might redeem the limits on paying the amount due to the bank otherwise the limits to remain the property of the bank and further that Veilleux should deal with the limits only with the written consent of Price.\nVeilleux had for a considerable time employed Boulanger, a broker at Quebec, in the effort to dispose of his limits and had given Boulanger reports, plans, etc. and, in fact, constituted him his agent for the sale giving him his entire confidence. On the 17th May, 1902 Boulanger made an offer to sell at $75,000, subject to a 5 per cent commission in his favour which was accepted by Veilleux on 19th May. The acceptance was made after considerable discussion with Boulanger in which Boulanger represented to both Veilleux and Pelletier that this was the largest sum obtainable and that asking $100 more would prevent the transaction being carried through. On the 2nd July 1902 Veilleux, Boulanger, Ordway, Webster, the local manager of the People's Bank of Halifax, and Pelletier, the solicitor for the People's Bank of Halifax met at the Quebec Bank in Quebec for the purpose of carrying out the transaction and a deed of sale by Veilleux to C. P. Easton & Co., (Ordway's principals,) of the limits in question, prepared by a notary named Sirois, under Ordway's instructions, was submitted and discussed the price of sale being stated in the deed as $112500 distributed as follows : to the People's Bank of Halifax $51,844.88, to the same bank in payment of advances $1,200; to Boulanger, for his commission $3750 to Price, $9203, and to Veilleux, the balance $46502.22. This deed was not finally executed that day but was discussed and settled as to its terms and signed as a draft by all the parties except the Quebec Bank and they then adjourned till next day, Ordway meanwhile obtaining from Veilleux the following acknowledgment : ' Quebec 2nd July, 1902. O. W. Ordway, Esq., Quebec. Dear Sir,\u2014Out of an amount of $46502.02 which I will receive from the Quebec Bank for my limits, in virtue of the deed before L. P.Sirois and signed by me today, it is understood that you get $37,500 and I keep the balance.\nOn the night of 2nd July, Pelletier was informed that the real price was not $75,000, as represented by Boulanger, but was in fact $112,500 and that the difference $37,500 was to be divided between Ordway, Boulanger and another person. Boulanger had represented that the purchaser desired to state in the deed a price higher than the real price paid, for the purpose of giving an apparently larger value to the limits, and that the $37,500 difference was for the purpose of acquiring additional limits in the vicinity.\nThe same parties met again on 3rd July when the deed was signed and the cheques paid to all parties except Veilleux, the amount of money, $46,502 02, coming to him, being placed to his credit in the books of the Quebec Bank. He then gave the bank a cheque for $16,025.81, his indebtedness to it, reducing the balance at his credit to $30,476.21. Ordway asked Veilleux for a cheque for the $37500 mentioned in the memorandum of the previous day, but Veilleux, to whom the above information had been communicated refused to pay Ordway any sum whatever. Ordway then took the action against Veilleux with an attachment of the moneys in the hands of the Quebec Bank.\nThe appellant, Price intervened in the action\u00bb alleging his agreement with Veilleux and the transactions which had taken place, claiming $18,500 as half of the $37500 in addition to what he had already received and contesting the plaintiff's claim.\nOn issues joined upon the merits, the parties went down to trial and on his appreciation of the evidence, the trial judge maintained the plaintiff's action, declared the attachment binding and dismissed the intervention with costs. Both defendant and intervenant inscribed in review, unsuccessfully, and they now appeal from the judgments of the Court of Review affirming the above mentioned judgments of the Superior Court.\nStuart K.C. and L. P. Pelletier K.C. for the appellant, Price.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. for the appellant Veilleux.\nB\u00e9dard K. C. and Alex, Taschereau K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal involves only questions of fact decided by two courts. There is undoubtedly contradictory evidence but two courts have found one way, although the reasons given by the judges do not all agree There is some oral evidence in support of the judgment appealed from, but the written evidence is still stronger. The notarial deed of sale of the 3rd July, 1902, which was actually signed by the parties the day previous, fully explains the price paid by C. P. Easton & Co. for the Veilleux timber limits namely $112,500, as follows:\nTo the People's Bank of Halifax, amount advanced\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$51,844 98\nTo the same for transfer bonus\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.......\n1,200 00\nTo Boulanger for his commission of 5 per cent\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n3,750 00\nTo Messrs.

Easton & Co. as $112,500 is only $750000 as far as Mr. Veilleux is concerned\u00bb\nPreviously, on the 17th May, Boulanger wrote Veilleux offering him $75,000 for his timber limits, which offer he accepted by letter on the 19th May, agreeing further to pay him 5 per cent commission on the amount of the sale. Messrs Price and Pelletier were only interested in this sale.\nFraud has been charged by the appellants against Boulanger and Ordway, but I must confess I fail to see it on the part of any one. Ordway had personal dealings with Boulanger only. The latter was not the agent of Veilleux, although he was to receive a commission from him. On the 13th June Mr. Pelletier, acting for Veilleux and Mr. Price, signified their consent to accept 75,000 for the Veilleux limits from Boulanger\" or his clients.\" The latter evidently were not Veilleux and his friends, but Ordway, and ultimately as it turns out C. P. Easton & Co., lumber merchants of Albany, who paid the money and got the title. It was only at that time that Ordway and Easton & Co. appeared on the scene. Boulanger told Veilleux and Pelletier that he could not get more than $75,000. That was perfectly true. Easton was unknown to them and of course Ordway wished to make his little pile and keep the name of the real purchasers a secret. I do not see anything fraudulent or wrong about this.\nBut even if all the transactions were not open and strictly honest Mr. Pelletier became aware of their nature on the evening of the 2nd July before the said deed was signed by the notary and the purchase money distributed; he admits it in his evidence, and notwithstanding this knowledge he allowed that distribution to take place in the presence of all parties in accordance with the stipulations of said deed, without any protest or objection on his part. The appellants, who were represented by Mr. Pelletier, are therefore estopped from alleging fraud. There was full acquiescement.\nI cannot understand that Mr. Pelletier did not know the full nature of the transactions, when the deed was signed by the parties on the 2nd July. On reading the following document which was prepared by him and signed by Veilleux immediately after, one would suppose that he knew or at least should have known the nature of the transactions.\nQUEBEC, 2nd July, 1902.\nO. W. ORDWAY, Esq., Quebec.\nDear Sir,\u2014Out of the amount of $465502.02 which I will receive from the Quebec Bank for my limits in virtue of deed before L. P. Sirois, and signed by me to-day, it is understood that you get $37,50C and I keep the balance\nCHARLES VEILLEUX. The deed shews that this amount of $46502 was the balance remaining as profits to be divided between Veilleux and Ordway, all other claims having been settled, especially the claim of Mr. Price which was to be divided between himself and Mr. Pelletier. It was always understood that Mr. Veilleux would get about an equal share of the profits and that is the reason why he, as depositor of the money in the bank, promised to pay to the respondent $37,500, he keeping $9,203 for his share of the profits.\nThe acknowledgment of Veilleux settles the rights of the parties and very strong evidence would be required to set it aside. Not only is there no such evidence but all the circumstances of the case tend to shew that it was the natural result of the dealings and transactions between the parties. It is therefore one of those cases, in my opinion, where a second court of appeal would not be justified in disturbing the findings of facts of the trial judge who had an opportunity of seeing the witnesses, approved as they were in very clear language by the judges in review. The appeals both of Veilleux and Price should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Price: Caron, Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the appellant Veilleux: Drouin, Pelletier & Baillargeon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fitzpatrick, Parent, Taschereau, Roy & Caron.\n"

On an appeal by the defendant, the Court of King's Bench varied the trial court judgment by adding $100 exemplary damages to the condemnation and giving full costs against the defendant.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that in the absence of any evidence of bad faith or wilful default on the part of the defendant, there was no justification for the addition of exemplary damages nor for interference with the judgment of the trial court.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, modifying the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by increasing the amount of the verdict against the defendant and ordering him to pay all the costs of the action, part of which costs had been imposed upon the plaintiffs by the trial court judgment.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment now reported.\nB\u00e8ique K.C. and Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nRenaud K.C. for the respondeuts. The judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a droit \u00e0 une somme additionnelle de $100 pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une vente de marchandises.\nVoici les faits en pen de mots. Durant l'hiver de 1899 l'intim\u00e9e donne deux commandes \u00e0 l'appelant l'une pour des dents de herse livrables dans un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9, et l'autre pour des pi\u00e8ces de fer et d'acier devant servir \u00e0 la fabrication de faucheuses, r\u00e2teaux machines agricoles, livrables sans qu'aucun d4lai ne f\u00fbt fix\u00e9. Il y a eu dit l'intim\u00e9e, retard dans la livraison et la qualit\u00e9 des dents de herse, et d\u00e9faut de livraison en temps opportun des pieces de fer et d'acier. De l\u00e0 deux actions; la premi\u00e8re intent\u00e9e par l'appelant contre l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce qu'il parait, en recouvrement du prix de vente, savoir $948.21, et l'autre celle que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9cider.\nJe dis \u00e0 ce qu'il para\u00eet; nous n'avons en effet que les dires des parties et l'affirmation des juges; nous n'avons pas la d\u00e9claration, ni les plaidoyers, pas m\u00eame les jugements qui furent rendus dans cette cause.\nUne longue enqu\u00eate s'en suivit, couvrant trois cents pages d'impression. L'action de Cogolin fut d\u00e9bout\u00e9e par les deux cours. Ce jugement \u00e9tait sans appel ult\u00e9rieur, le montant demand\u00e9 ne permettant pas d'aller plus loin.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, et sans attendre la fin de ce proc\u00e8s, l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clama $3,033.00 \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant du retard de la livraison et de la mauvaise qualit\u00e9 des dents de herse et du d\u00e9faut de livraison des pi\u00e8ces de fer et d'acier en temps opportun. La preuve faite dans la premi\u00e8re cause fut mise an dossier de consentement, et une preuve nouvelle, couvrant quatre-vingts pages imprim\u00e9es, fut ajout\u00e9e. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure (Fortin J.) a accord\u00e9 $122500 \u00e0 raison de la mauvaise qualit\u00e9 et de la livraison tardive des dents de herse et renvoya l'action quant au surplus, Enfin, comme le savant juge \u00e9tait d'opinion qu'au moins la moiti\u00e9 des frais d'enqu\u00eate avait \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9e par la tentative infructueuse de la demanderesse de prouver les items de dommages qui lui \u00e9taient refus\u00e9s elle fut condamn4e \u00e0 supporter la moiti\u00e9 des frais d'enqu\u00eate. L'intim\u00e9e seule en appella \u00e0 la cour d'appel qui lui accorda $100 de plus du chef des dommages rejet\u00e9s et partant tous les frais d'enqu\u00eate.\nVoici le texte du jugement:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appr\u00e9ciation du contrat fait entre les parties relativement a ces pi\u00e8ces de for et d'acier a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans une cause intent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelante pour le prix des dites pi\u00e8ces de fer et d'acier et que la cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'intime \u00e9tait en faute pour n'avoir pas livr\u00e9 les dites marchandises en temps opportun, et en cons\u00e9quence a refus\u00e9 le prix;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce jugement do la cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve faite dans la dite cause en recouvrement du prix a \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau soumise dans la pr\u00e9sente cause avec une prevue additionnelle; Consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'y a pas lieu dans l'appr\u00e9ciation que cette cour fait de la preuve do rendre une d\u00e9cision diff\u00e9rente do celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e dans la premi\u00e8re cause sur la question do responsabilit\u00e9;\nConsid\u00e9rant Que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait responsable do la nonivraison des dites pi\u00e8ces de for et d'acier en temps opportun, ii est en cons\u00e9quence passible des dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution do son obligation;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appelante a \u00e9tabli des dommages quo la cour \u00e9value \u00e0 cent piastres, etc.\nLa cour ne nous dit pas comment elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir ce montant de dommages. Nous avons cependant l'opinion de M. le juge Hall, la seule au dossier, qui est plus explicite '.\nWhile therefore it is evident that plaintiff did sustain a damage by defendants' delay in supplying the iron and steel for the mowing machines and rakes, yet the evidence in regard to it is too vague and irrelevant to serve as the basis of a judgment some of it pointing to alleged features of damage which are too remote and hypothetical to establish a legal liability, and the rest being indefinite as to quantity, identity and actual expenditure.\nUnder these circumstances, the learned trial judge came to the conclusion to dismiss altogether this branch of the claim, evidently feeling that the adjudication in the previous case did not control the present one, and apparently not sharing the views expressed in the previous judgments as to the defendants being in default. As above stated I think we must consider that there is a kind of chose jug\u00e9e between the parties on this point and that being the case and the evidence not warranting a specific condemnation for damages in connection with the iron and steel plates, I would be of opinion to recognise the latter claim in principle,\u2014by allowing a sum of say $100 as exemplary damage for these items; to maintain the appeal with costs and reform the judgment by increasing it to $222.50 with full costs in the Superior Court.\nL'appelant appelle de ce jugement \u00e0 cette cour, o\u00f9 ii se plaint uniquement de l'addition des $100 et des frais d'enqu\u00eate, n'ayant pas appel\u00e9 du jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance. Je ne puis comprendre comment la cour sup\u00e9rieure ou la cour d'appel, pouvait invoquer un jugement ayant presque l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, dit-on, lorsqu'il n'est pas au dossier. Si les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs ont Pu en constater le jug\u00e9, nous n'avons aucun moyen de le faire et nous devons rendre jugement sur les pi\u00e8ces et documents qui sont devant nous. M\u00eame si ce jugement \u00e9tait devant nos yeux, doit-on en conclure plus qu'il ne semble comporter, savoir que le prix de vente ne pouvait \u00eatre demand\u00e9.\nLe juge a quo est d'avis qu'aucun d\u00e9lai n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 dans le contrat intervenu pour la livraison des pi\u00e8ces de fer et d'acier et que l'appelant avait fait toute la diligence possible pour les livrer. La cour d'appel admet qu'un d\u00e9lai fixe n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9; elle ajoute qu'alors la livraison devait se faire en temps opportun, ce qui je suppose veut dire en temps utile ou raisonnable Cette raison \u00e9tait \"probablement suffisante pour refuser le prix de vente, point que nous n'avons pas \u00e0 examiner. L'intim\u00e9e avait besoin de ces articles \u00e0 temps pour profiter de la saison d'affaires de 1899 s'ils sont arriv\u00e9s trop tard pour en tirer profit, Il est peut \u00eatre raisonnable qu'elle ne soit pas tenue de les prendre et d'en payer le prix. Mais autre chose est l'action r\u00e9clamant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'appelant peut-il \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en faute s'il a fait toutes les diligences possibles pour les obtenir, car l'intim\u00e9e savait qu'il devait les faire fabriquer ailleurs? Le juge a quo n'a pas de doute sur ce point et la cour d'appel n'en dit rien; elle se contente de se retrancher dans son premier jugement qui ne decide rien au sujet de la responsabilit\u00e9 pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. S'il y a eu diligence\u2014ce qui me parait - prouv\u00e9\u2014il me semble qu'il ne peuty avoir faute donnant ouverture a des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais supposons m\u00eame que l'appelant n'ait pas fait diligence et qu'il f\u00fbt en faute, quels dommages doit-il payer? Il n'est pas de mauvaise foi i il n'est pas m\u00eame soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 de mauvais vouloir envers l'intim\u00e9e qui, dans sa d\u00e9claration, l\u2019invoque que la non-ex\u00e9cution de son contrat en temps opportun par sa faute ou n\u00e9gligence; rien dans sa conduite ne frise le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit o\u00f9 le tribunal a une grande latitude pour appr\u00e9cier et estimer les dommages. Tous les juges semblent d'accord sur ce point. Alors, il n'est pas passible \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement de dommages exemplaires qui paraissent cependant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s par la cour d'appel. Les seuls dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats que l'intim\u00e9e peut r4clamrr doivent \u00eatre existants, certains et sp\u00e9ciaux, et non douteux \u00e9ventuels ou vagues, ceux qu'on a pr\u00e9vus ou que l'on a Pu pr\u00e9voir et qui sont une suite imm\u00e9diate et directe de l'inex\u00e9cution de la convention ainsi qu'il est porte aux articles 1065, 1073, 1074 et 1075 du code civil. Comme tous les commentateurs l'enseignent le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir qu'il a souffert des dommages r\u00e9els en constatant le gain, dont ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 et la perte qu'il a subie. La d\u00e9termination du montant exact peut \u00eatre difficile ou m\u00eame impossible pour lui la cour peut alors le faire d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et accorder des dommages nominaux, ce qui n'est pas la m\u00eame chose que des dommages exemplaires. Mais ii faut alors que l'existence des dommages soit incontestable. C'est le principe qui fut consacr\u00e9 par cette cour, confirmant les deux cours provinciales dans The Corporation of the County of Ottawa v. Montreal, Ottawa & Western Railway Co. ([1]), particuli\u00e8rement aux pages 205, 207 et 211. Cette jurisprudence fut d'ailleurs suivie par plusieurs autres arr\u00eats de tous les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, entr'autres,Lepage v. Girard ([2]) confirm\u00e9 en revision et en appel ([3]).\nL'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 qu'elle a r\u00e9ellement souffert des dommages? La cour d'appel reconna\u00eet que cette preuve existe sans en avoir constat\u00e9 le montant. La cour l'a fix\u00e9 pour elle, ce qu'elle pouvait faire si des dommages sp\u00e9ciaux sont prouv\u00e9s. Quelle \u00e9tait la nature de ces dommages? C'est ce que la cour ne dit pas. Diapr\u00e9s quelle base, a-t-elle Pu en fixer le montant? C'est ce qui n'appara\u00eet pas non plus. M. le juge Hall nous en donne sans doute le secret, lorsqu'il d\u00e9clare que des dommages sp\u00e9ciaux n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s, mais qu'il y a lieu d'accorder des dommages exemplaires. Dans sa pens\u00e9e c'est probablement un dommage nominal qu'il avait en vue. Mais comment cette conclusion \u00e9tait-elle possible dans les circonstances. telles qu'il les appr\u00e9cie? S'il eut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il existait des dommages sp\u00e9ciaux ou appr\u00e9ciables, et que de ce chef la cour accordait un montant nominal soit $100, je crois que peut-\u00eatre ii aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de d4cider autrement. Jetais le savant juge nous dit qu'il n'existe aucun dommage appr\u00e9ciable en loi. m\u00eame si nous n'avions devant nous que le texte du jugement de la cour qui, en apparence du moins, ne viole aucun principe le r\u00e9sultat serait le m\u00eame.\nEn effet apr\u00e8s avoir lu attentivement le dossier nous sommes arrives \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y a pas de preuve qui puisse nous justifier d'accorder des dommages nominaux. Nous sommes donc d'avis de r\u00e9\u00e9tabli le \"jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure in toto. C'est un d\u00e9nouement bien ruineux pour l'intim\u00e9e, car enfin l'appelant 4tait en retard et m\u00eame en faute au sujet d'une des commandes. C'est son malheur d'avoir si gravement exag\u00e9r\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences de cette faute ou de ce retard. Ce r4su-tat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9 si elle s'\u00e9tait content\u00e9e de demander des dommages raisonnables. Elle poursuivit pour $3,033.50, et aujourd'hui elle se d\u00e9clare satisfaite avec $222.50, n'ayant pas appel\u00e9 du jugement qui lui accorde seulement cette somme. Ayant imprudemment ouvert les portes de toutes les jurisdictions du pays, elle n'a qu'\u00e0 s'imputer \u00e0 elle-m\u00e9me si elle a des frais consid\u00e9rables \u00e0 supporter.\nL'appel est accord\u00e9 et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens devant cette cour et la cour du banc du roi.\nAppeal allowed with costs,\nSolicitors for the appellant; B\u00e9ique, Turgeon, Robertson & B\u00e9ique\nSolicitors for the respondents; Renaud & Guibault.\n[1] 26 L.C.

Hence no set-off could take place and they do not come within the principles laid down in the cases cited. Compare White's Case[5] , per James L. J. at page 515, and Brett L. J. at pages 516, 517; Andress's Case[6] ; and Leeke's Case[7] , at pages 106 and 107. These cases teach that the contract with the company must be for cash payable at once, and the contract with the subscriber for cash payable to the company at once; that a mere form is of no avail, and that the cash payable by the company can only be set off against money payable to the company in the same capacity not, as here, where a several liability for shares is sought to be paid by a liability of three parties jointly. Counterclaim is not allowed by the British Columbia statute and rules.\nAgain, under authority of Fothergill's Case[8] , the respondents must shew, apart from the shares received for the partnership's assets, that they have paid the shares subscribed for in the memorandum of association. Shares cannot be set off against a money demand ; a joint contract cannot be set off against a separate contract. Middleton v. Pollock[9] ; Bowyear v. Pawson[10]. Davis K.C. for the respondents. The issue is whether or not there was a payment of shares for which the three defendants subscribed within the meaning of section 50 of the British Columbia Companies Act, which corresponds with section 25 of the English Act, 1862. At the time when the company was incorporated the three defendants became indebted to the company in the sum in question, and remained indebted to it in that sum up to the 27th day of July following, when the company in turn became indebted to the defendants in a similar amount, and the respective liabilities were adjusted between them without any formal transfer of cheques. In effect, each defendant gave a cheque for the amount of his indebtedness to the company for shares; the company received this amount, which was the amount owed in the aggregate by the company to the three defendants, and the cheques received by the company were indorsed, and handed back to the defendants in settlement of the amount due for the bill of sale which had been signed that day. It is not necessary at law that this procedure should be actually gone through with. See Spargo's Case[11] ; White's Case[12] , at page 515; Ferrao's Case[13] ; Larocque v. Beauchmin[14] ; North Sydney Investment & Tramway Co. v. Higgins[15] .\nThe sale of the assets was made for cash, not for shares; the defendants could have insisted upon payment in cash for their stock in trade and refused to take shares, or the company could, at any time prior to the 27th of July and the passing of the resolution, have insisted on payment in full of the shares in cash and refused to purchase the old partnership stock. The two transactions were, in law, absolutely independent and separate.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I acquiesce in the judgment prepared in this case by my brother Nesbitt allowing the appeal. I do so, however, with much doubt, as I have had great difficulty in distinguishing this case from that of Larocque v. Beauchemin[16] . This latter is a decision of the Privy Council and expressly approves of Spargo's Case[17] which had been somewhat discredited by having been twice disapproved of by the present Lord Chancellor. The reasoning of Lord Justice James in the latter case makes it difficult to appreciate the argument that there has been a mere evasion or trick to get rid of the 25th section of the Act in question. The present case may be distinguishable on the ground that the sale of the stock of goods in question was by the three partners to the incorporated company, and that the liability of the company was a liability to the partnership members jointly, while the liability of each of the three members of the partnership for the amounts of the stock severally subscribed by them was a separate liability. I do not, however, entertain so strong an opinion as to the binding authority of these cases as to justify my dissenting from the judgment agreed upon by my colleagues, more especially as but for these judgments I should have been in full accord with it. The section of the English Act corresponding to that of the British Columbia statute now under consideration has been repealed by 'The Companies' Act, 1900, sec. 33. NESBITT J.\u2014This is an action brought under sections 50 and 51 of the Companies Act, chapter 44 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1897, which sections read as follows:\u2014\n50. Every share in any company shall be deemed and taken to have been issued and to be held subject to the payment of the whole amount thereof in cash, unless the same shall have been otherwise determined by a contract duly made in writing and filed with the registrar at or before the issue of such shares.\n51. Each shareholder, until the whole amount of his shares, stock or other interest has been paid up, shall be individually liable to the creditors of the Company to an amount equal to that not paid up thereon, but shall not be liable to an action therefor by any creditor before an execution against the Company has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; and the amount due on such execution, but not beyond the amount so unpaid of his said shares, stock or other interest, shall be the amount so recoverable, with costs, against such shareholder;\n(a.) Any shareholder may plead by way of defence, in whole or in part, any set\u2014off which he could set up against the company except a claim for unpaid dividends, or a salary or allowance as a president or a director of the Company;\n(b.) The shareholders of the company shall not as such be held responsible for any act, default or liability whatsoever of the Company, or for any engagement, claim, payment, loss, injury, transaction, matter or thing whatsoever, relating to or connected with the Company, beyond the unpaid amount of their respective shares in the capital stock thereof.\nThe plaintiffs are creditors of a company named Cowan Holten Downs Company, Limited, which carried on a liquor and cigar business at Revelstoke, British Columbia for about a year. Prior to the incorporation of the Company, the defendants carried on the business (subsequently carried on by the Company) as a partnership called Cowan Holten Downs Company. The plaintiffs recovered two judgments against the company, and the executions issued thereon were returned nulla bona. The evidence is very short, and the pith of it is to my mind shown by the following in the examination of the solicitor of the partnership:\n106. Q. What took place before the incorporation and transfer of the Company?\nA. They wished the partnership thrown into a joint stock company, and Cowan or Braithwaite asked me how they could do it, and I told them the proper way would be to incorporate the company, and the company take over the partnership business and pay for it in stock.\n107. Q. Explain paying for it in stock?\nA. In shares. I told them they could sign a memorandum of association, that is each one of them, after Braithwaite had figured out how each one stood. Some had taken out capital from the business. Holten, I believe, had, and that is why the Company was to be formed, to prevent this.\nThe statute provides a very simple method to carry this out, and I think its provisions are to be strictly adhered to, unless the door is to be opened to the evils spoken of in Leeke's Case[18] .\nThe defendants subsbribed for shares as follows:\u2014\nWilliam Cowan\n800\nCharles Holten\n100\nT. Downs\n664\nand some months after, at a meeting of the Company, it was moved by J. S. Lawson, seconded by C. Holten, that the Company purchase the assets and good\u2014will, and assume the \"liabilities of the Cowan Holten Downs Company, for the sum of eight thousand one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and twenty-one cents ($8,187.21).\u2014Carried.\"\nAnd thereupon the following document was executed:\nEXHIBIT \"J.\"\nMemorandum of agreement made the 27th day of July, A.D. 1899, between William Cowan, Thomas Downs and Charles Holten, carrying on business in partnership under the firm name of the Cowan Holten Downs Company, hereinafter called the parties of the first part, and The Cowan Holten Downs Company, Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, with its head office in the city of Revelstoke, in the said Province of British Columbia.\nWitnesseth, that in consideration of the sum of $8,187.21 (eight thousand one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and twenty-one cents) of good and lawful money of Canada to them in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby by them acknowledged, they, the parties of the first part do, and each of them doth by these presents grant, bargain, sell and assign, transfer and set over under the party of the second part, its successors and assigns, all and singular, the goods, wares, chattels, effects and things, together with the stock-in-trade, and trade fixtures of or belonging to the said parties of the first part or any of them used in or pertaining to the business of the said parties of the first part as wholesale liquor merchants (said stock-in-trade consisting of a general stock of wines, liquors, cigars and aerated waters), now being in and about the building and premises now occupied and used by the said parties of the first part for the purposes of their said business in the said city of Revelstoke, said building and premises being situate on Front Street in the said city of Revelstoke : Also, all accounts, bank and other debts and securities which are now owing or payable to the parties of the first part or any of them in respect of or on account of or in connection with the said business. To have, hold, take, receive and enjoy the said goods, wares, chattels, effects, stock-in-trade, fixtures, accounts, debts and securities unto the party of the second part, its successors and assigns, to the only use and behoof of the party of the second part, its successors and assigns for ever.\nAnd this memorandum further witnesseth that in consideration of the premises the party of the second part for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants, promises and agrees to and with the said parties of the first part, their and each of their executors, administrators and assigns, that the party of the second part, its successors or assigns shall and will well and truly pay or cause to be paid all debts now due, owing or payable or hereafter to become due, owing or payable by the parties of the first part or any of them, their or any of their executors, administrators or assigns, in respect or on account of or in connection with the said business, and shall and will indemnify and save harmless and keep indemnified and saved harmless, the said parties of the first part, and each of them, their and each of their executors, administrators and assigns, from and against all actions, suits, claims and demands for or in respect or on account of the said debts, and free from and against all costs, charges, expenses and damages which they, the parties of the first part may suffer, sustain or be put to for or on account or in respect of the said debts or any of them. In witness whereof the parties of the first part have hereto set their hands and seals and the party of the second part has caused its corporate seal to be hereto affixed with all the formalities required by law, the day and year first above written.\nW. COWAN (L. S.)\nCHAS. HOLTEN (L. S.)\nT. DOWNS (L. S.)\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\nJAMES MURPHY.\nIt is to be observed that there is no debt created by the Company to each partner for a specific amount, nor is the document executed by the Company, and it seems to me to fall within the very language of the Lord Chancellor Selborne in Fothergill's case[19] .\nUpon the only principle of construction which I know of as applicable to such a case, it appears to me to be quite clear that there are here two independent agreements. No connection between them is expressed on the face of any one of the documents. They take effect at different times, in different events, on different conditions, and between different parties. By the subscription for the memorandum of association under sections 7, 11 and 23 of the Companies Act, 1862 (and according, if authority were needed, to Evan's case), Mr. Fothergill not merely agreed to take, but actually did take, and immediately on the registration of the Company became the actual and legal holder of 1,000 ordinary shares, in respect of which he was thenceforth liable absolutely and unconditionally to contribute to the funds of the Company the full sum of \u00a32,000. By agreement for the sale of the mine three persons jointly (of whom Mr. Fothergill was one), became entitled, not absolutely and immediately, but conditionally on certain events, which afterwards happened, to 5,000 shares, without liability to pay anything upon them, the land with which the vendors parted by the contract being agreed to be taken by the Company in lieu of the full amount of these shares. Shares cannot be set off against a money demand.\nAny stranger proposing to give credit to the Company, who might have gone to the Registrar or Joint Stock Company, and might have there seen those agreements, must have understood (supposing to simplify the case, that the whole purchase money for the mine had been payable in paid-up shares) that the Company would have to satisfy his claims, the mine itself, free from all liability to creditors, and also the \u00a32,000 either actually paid or legally payable on Mr. Fothergill's shares. The appellant says he ought, on the contrary, to have understood that one of the assets of the Company was in effect to be set off against the other. Even if the whole had been payable in money, the debt to the three could not, without more, have been set off against the liability of the one. And it appears to me to be a fallacy to speak of Mr. Fothergill's liability on his shares.\nThe Court below relied on Laroque v. Beauchemin[20] but that case turned on the particular facts. Lord MacNaghton says:\nThe learned counsel for the appellant then contended that the understanding between the parties was that the property should be sold for so much in cash and so much in shares. It was admitted that if this had been the real arrangement it would be in contravention of the statute. But the evidence is all the other way. According to the evidence, there was an independent agreement on the part of the promoters to take so many shares presently payble in cash, and an independent agreement by the Company to purchase the property for so much money down. There was not even an attempt in cross-examination to shake the testimony on this point.\nFinding here as I do that there never was any real intention to pay for the shares subscribed for in cash but to pay for them in stock, it seems quite clear that the statute has not been complied with, and I think the clearest case should always be proved before we apply the principle of the cases relied on in the court below, and dispense with the salutary provisions of the statute. I would allow the appeal with costs in all courts, and direct judgment to be entered for the amount of this subscription against each defendant.\nKILLAM J. concurred with Nesbitt J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harvey, McCarter & Pinkham.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lemaistre & Scott.\n[1] 9 B.

On the issue of the grant, about six months afterwards, the judgment creditor refused to accept $500 as full settlement at the latter date and he took proceedings to enforce execution for the full amount. The execution was opposed on behalf of the appellant, the respondent becoming surety for the costs and being also made a party to the proceedings.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep. 84) that the agreement to settle the outstanding judgment was not made unconditionally by the respondent, but was limited to settling it for $500, after the issue of the Crown grant for the land.\nHeld, also, Davies J. dissenting, that the costs incurred in unsuccessfully opposing the execution of the judgment, upon being paid by the respondent, were properly chargeable against the appellant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia en banc[1], reversing the trial court judgment and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs. On 13th January, 1900, an agreement was made between the plaintiff, of the first part, and the defendant, of the second part, for the sale to the defendant of the timber growing on a lot of land described for $1050. The agreement was made for the purpose of shewing in a formal manner, by a deed which might be registered, a former agreement by a letter signed by plaintiff for the sale of the timber to the defendant for $2000, the consideration mentioned as $1050 being the balance remaining on the price after deducting $250 for cost of survey, $200 for Crown dues, and $500 for the settlement of a judgment by one Manley against the plaintiff. See 8 B. C. Rep. p. 284.\nThe action was for the rectification of the agreement on the grounds that it did not represent the arrangement arrived at between the parties, because it made the consideration $1050 instead of stating that sum to be the balance of the purchase money, after the above mentioned deductions, and also because it wrongfully provided for the payment of the cost of survey and the Crown dues out of that balance, whereas they had already been deducted before that balance was established.\nThe plaintiff had not obtained his Crown grant at the time of the agreement and there was also the judgment for about $1000 in favour of Manly against him unsatisfied and registered against his interest in the land. An arrangement was made by the present defendant with Manly's solicitor under which it was understood that the judgment could be settled for $500, and the defendant agreed to settle it after the issue of the Crown grant.\nThe grant issued in July, 1900, in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant then tendered $500 in settlement of the judgment but the tender was refused, the full amount of the judgment demanded and proceedings were taken in execution for the sale of the land on which the timber was standing. These pro- ceedings were resisted on behalf of the present plaintiff, the payment of the costs being guaranteed by the present defendant, on the ground, among others, that Manly was bound by the agreement to accept $500 for the judgment and the present defendant was made a party to the proceedings. In the result, after an appeal, the decision in respect to this agreement was that Manley was not bound to accept $500 for the judgment and the decision was also against the present plaintiff on the other grounds. See 8 B. C. Rep. 280. The costs, for which Mackintosh had become liable amounted to $1086.54 and Manley took proceedings against him as garnishee, on the ground that he was owing a balance to O'Brien under the agreement. On the issue being tried, the decision was in favour of Mackintosh. See 10 B. C. Rep. 84.\nAt the trial of the present action the rectification of the agreement was decreed by Hunter C.J., but his judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nShepley K.C. for the appellant. There is no dispute, (except as to some costs for which respondent claims credit) regarding the payments made by respondent to appellant. On the day the agreement was signed $50 was paid to the appellant and $250 to the surveyor, making $300, and, subsequently, several sums were paid to appellant and $354.66 to the Crown (being $154.66 more than the estimated dues), making in all $845.31. Of these sums $250 and $200, i.e. $450, were amounts assumed by respondent making only $395.31 actually paid on account of the $1,050 and leaving a balance of $654.69 still due as found by the trial judge. The main dispute arises with regard to the assumption of the judgment which is not mentioned in the written agreement and the non-payment of which has given rise to this litigation. It will be noticed that the assumption of this judgment by the respondent was by parol and was not intended to be included in the writing. There is no evidence to justify the conclusions of the judgment below. The proof is that respondent believing he had bought the judgment, represented to appellant that he had done so and would settle it so that appellant would have no further concern with it. Appellant, relying upon these representations, assented to the deduction of $500 from the purchase money for this purpose and executed the agreement. Respondent's neglect of the ordinary business precaution of having his agreement in writing and disregarding warnings to settle at once brought about the whole trouble.\nIf respondent became responsible for the judgment by reason either of his agreement or representations, his claim to credit the costs incurred in opposing the sale proceedings cannot be allowed, as these were incurred by reason of his failure to carry out his agreement or make good his representations. If, on the other hand, the real purchase money was $2,000, and respondent assumed payment of surveyor's and Crown fees to the extent of $450, but is not obliged to pay the judgment, then the question arises : Is the respondent entitled to charge against appellant the sums for costs incurred in contesting Manly's application to sell? The appeal from the order on the second motion was solely at the instance of respondent and he alone was responsible for the costs. There being no evidence as to the amount of the costs of the appeal, the above payments may have been no more than sufficient to satisfy them. Therefore, as respondent was not concerned with the costs of the first motion and was not requested by O'Brien to guarantee or pay any costs of either of the sale proceedings, he cannot succeed in his claim to set-off these cases against purchase money.\nThe respondent was in no sense an equitable mortgagee but simply a purchaser. In any case the costs of the litigation arose by reason of his unfounded contention that he had bought the judgment.\nDavis K.C. for the respondent. The claim for rectification is based solely on the ground of mutual mistake in stating the price at $1050 in the agreement. In order to rectify an instrument on the ground of a mistake, there must be proof, not only that there has been a mistake, but the plaintiff must shew precisely the form to which the deed ought to be brought in order that it may be set right, according to what was really intended, and he must establish, in the clearest and most satisfactory manner, that the alleged intention of the parties to which he desires to make it conform continued concurrently in the minds of all parties down to the time of its execution. The evidence must be such as to leave no fair and reasonable doubt upon the mind that the deed does not embody the final intention of the parties. There can be no rectification if the mistake be not mutual or common to all parties or if one of the parties knew of the mistake at the time he executed the deed. Where one only has been under the mistake, while the other knew the character of the deed, the court cannot interfere by forcing a contract never entered into or depriving a party of a benefit bon\u00e2 fide acquired. A mistake on one side may be a ground for rescinding, but not for correcting or rectifying an agreement. Kerr, Fraud and Mistake (3 ed.) 461, 469. The court will not, under the name of rectification, add to the agreement a term which had not been determined upon nor agitated. There can be no rectification of an agreement executed in accordance with proposals nor, if it was the intention of the parties, on the ground that the written instrument did not comprise all the terms of the actual agreement. Townshend v. Stangroom[2] ; Harbidge v. Wogan[3] ; Seton on Decrees (5 ed.) p. 1914. The evidence does not satisfy the standard of proof required for rectification. Dominion Loan Society v. Darling[4] ; Ferguson v. Winsor[5] ; Darnley v. London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.[6] ; McNeill v. Haynes[7] .\nIn this action we have nothing to do with the question whether or not a bargain was made for the satisfying of the judgment, and the question whether. as between the solicitor and Mackintosh, the latter was right or wrong in insisting on payment after the Crown grant issued. This can not affect Mackintosh's arrangement with O'Brien under which it is clear that Mackintosh was not to pay until the Crown grant issued. The costs were not incurred by reason of any breach of Mackintosh's word, but because O'Brien desired to litigate and procured Mackintosh to guarantee his costs. Then, after the costs were incurred, he admitted the correctness of Mackintosh's accounts in which the payments made on the costs were charged up against him. The agreement to satisfy the judgment for $500 after issue of the Crown grant was a part of the contract and, as such agreement was always impossible of performance, the whole agreement was at an end. McKenna v. McNamee[8] ; Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton Edridge & Co.[9]; Blakeley v. Muller[10] ; Griffith v. Brymer[11] ; Elliott v. Crutchley[12] ; Krell v. Henry[13] . The full court in Manley v. O'Brien[14] , having held that there was no contract for the satisfaction of the judgment for $500, and the whole of the arrangement being based on the assumption that such a contract existed, the principle of the above cases is applicable.\nThe payments made by Mackintosh for costs are properly chargeable against O'Brien and should be added to his security even though it could be shewn that they were not paid under the guarantee given at O'Brien's request ; the respondent being an equilable mortgagee of the lands, would be entitled to charge O'Brien with the same as just allowances for the protection of his mortgage security. Ramsden v. Langley[15] ; Lomax v. Hide[16] ; Barry v. Stawell[17] ; Wilkes v. Saunion[18] ; Wells v. Trust & Loan Co.[19]. The respondent being an equitable mortgagee of the lands, is entitled to hold the title deeds deposited with him until all his advances are paid. (See 8 B. C. Rep. 280): Bank of New South Wales v. O'Connor[20] .\nSo much of the action as asks for rectification also fails for the additional reason that the plaintiff himself was a party to the proceedings reported in 8 B. C. Rep. 280, and succeeded there in having the court place a certain construction upon that agreement. Having allowed the court to assume that the agreement was in reality his agreement, he should not afterwards be allowed to be heard in the court to say that it was not his real agreement. The plaintiff's action also fails by reason of the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds, pleaded as a defence. Olley v. Fisher[21] ; Addison on Contracts (9 ed.) p. 120.\nOn the evidence it is abundantly clear that Mackintosh was never to pay more than $2,000; that he was not to pay more than $500 for the Manly judgment, and that he was not to pay this $500 until the Crown grant issued.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014While acquiescing, with much doubt, in the result that the appeal must be dismissed, I cannot help recording my decided opinion that the respondent is not entitled to charge, against the appellant, any part of the costs incurred in the protracted litigation carried on in British Columbia with the appellant's judgment creditor. These costs were incurred as the result of the respondent's own neglect and default and should be paid and borne by him.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I do not think anything can be usefully added to the judgment of Mr. 'Justice Irving in the court below. It seems clear that the defendant was not to satisfy the Manley judgment unconditionally, but only to pay $500 after the Crown grant issued. It is equally clear that the defendant was only to pay $2,000. After the Crown grant issued I think the proceedings taken to enforce the acceptance of $500 for the Manley judgment were taken for the benefit of O'Brien and the costs so incurred should, as between plaintiff and defendant, be chargeable to the plaintiff and the result of this is that the $2,000 so to be paid by Mackintosh has been exhausted, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Irving should be affirmed with costs.\nKILLAM J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.A.

Le Roi No. 2, Ltd., (1903) 34 S.C.R. 177\nDate: 1903-11-30\nCharles J. Hastings (Plaintiff) Appellant ;\nand\nLe Roi No. 2, Limited, (Defendants) Respondents.\n1903: October 26, 27; 1903: November 30.\nPresent: Sir Elzear Taschereau C.J, and Sedgewick, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nNegligence\u2014Mining operations\u2014Contract for special works\u2014Engagement by contractor\u2014Control and direction of mine owner\u2014Defective machinery\u2014Notice\u2014Failure to remedy defect\u2014Liability for injury sustained by miner.\nThe sinking of a winze in a mine belonging to the defendants was let to contractors who used the hoisting apparatus which the defendants maintained, and operated by their servants, in the excavation, raising and dumping of materials, in working the mine under the direction of their foreman. The winze was to be sunk according to directions from defendants' engineer and the contractors' employees were subject to the approval and direction of the defendants' superintendent, who also fixed the employees' wages and hours of labour. The plaintiff, a miner, was employed by the contractors under these conditions and was paid by them through the defendants. While at his work in the winze the plaintiff was injured by the fall of a hoisting bucket which happened in consequence of a defect in the hoisting gear, which had been reported to the defendants' master-mechanic and had not been remedied.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, (10 B. C. Rep. 9), Taschereau C. J. dissenting, that the plaintiff was in common employ with the defendants' servants engaged in the operation of the mine and that even if there was a neglect of the duty imposed by statute, in respect to inspection of the machinery, as the accident occurred in consequence of the negligence of one of his fellow-servants, the defendants were excused from liability on the ground of common employment. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia en banc[1], reversing the trial court judgment and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff is a miner, and the defendants are the owners of the \" Josie \" mine at Rossland, B.C. The defendants had entered into a contract with a firm of contractors for sinking a winze on special terms and conditions which are stated in the judgments now reported. While the contractors were at work in the winze the defendants carried on their mining operations in other parts of the mine in the usual manner. The contractors engaged the plaintiff to work in the winze. While at his work in the bottom of the winze he was injured by the fall of the bucket used for hoisting rock from the winze, and for such injuries this action was brought. The plaintiff, on the above facts, claimed that the defendants were negligent in their duty towards him and that they had not complied with certain provisions of the British Columbia Metaliferous Mines Inspection Act. The defendants denied all negligence and pleaded, in the alternative, that the injury was occasioned by the negligence of a fellowservant engaged in common employment with the plaintiff. Issue was joined on these defences. At the trial, before Irving J. with a jury, a general verdict was found for the plaintiff with $3,400 damages. The trial judge entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to the full court which reversed this judgment on the ground that the plaintiff was in fact in the service of the defendants and in common employment with those of their servants whose negligence caused the injury. From that judgment the plaintiff appeals to this court. The questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nShepley K. C. for the appellant. The question of common employment is purely one of fact to be decided by the jury. The jury by their general verdict having found this issue with all others against the defendants, and there being evidence on which the jury could have so found, the verdict is final and this court should not interfere. St. John Gas Light Co. v. Hatfield[2] ; Masters v. Jones[3] ; Cahalane v. North Metropolitan Railway Co.[4]. There is no ground for the defence of common employment as this is not an action on the written contract or between the parties to it and it was open to the plaintiff to shew that this writing was not the real contract and to shew by other evidence what was the relationship between the parties. The judges in the full court looked only at the terms of the written contract to determine whether the plaintiff was in common employment with those whose negligence caused the injury. The appellants submit that the whole of the evidence must be considered. And, on the evidence, the case of Johnson v. Lindsay[5] applies. The court should look at all the circumstances and the real agreement. Waldock v. Winfield[6] at page 602.\nIn cases cited in the judgments below the question of \" control\" over the injured and injuring party is considered the material question. It is submitted that \" direction\" in this contract is not the same as \" control.\" If the defendants could \" control\" the work of the plaintiff then they could put him to work in any part of their mine or could make him work fast or slowly as they pleased, and that without any refer- ence to the contractors. Anything short of that would not be control at all, and it can hardly be suggested that the defendants possessed such rights. If the men employed by the contractors were really the servants of the defendants, then the contractors had no servants at all, and as the contract was purely to perform manual labour by themselves or their servants, it really meant nothing; there was in effect no contract at all. The case of the defendants must go this length; that the contractors would not have been liable but that the defendants would have been liable to any person injured by the negligence of one of the contractors' men. Cameron v. Nystrom[7] ; Abraham v. Reynolds[8] . So far as the power to dismiss, assuming it to exist in this case, is concerned, it is of no effect. Reedie v. London & North Western Railway Co.[9] . The payment of wages, that must surely mean payment under a legal liability to pay. The plaintiff could only look to the contractors for his wages. Payments charged to the contractors would not be pavments by the defendants. Laugher v. Pointer[10] , at page 558 ; Quarman v. Burnett[11]; Union Steamship Co. v. Clardge[12] ; Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool[13] ; Warburton v. Great Western Railway Co.[14].\nAssuming that the plaintiff was in fact the servant of the defendants they are still liable in this action under the pleadings, evidence and finding of the jury. Smith v. Baker[15], at page 362, per Herschell L. J. ; Grant v. Acadia Coal Co. [16] ; Murphy v. Philips[17]; Clarke v. Holmes[18] , per Cockburn C. J. ; Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[19] ; Sault St. Marie Pulp and Paper Co. v. Myers[20] ; Pateson v. Wallace & Co.[21] ; McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[22].\nThe defendants are also liable by virtue of the Metalliferous Mines Inspection Act[23] . The direction to report and record the report applies to the daily as well as to the weekly examination. Scott v. Bould[24] . The provisions of this law were not complied with. If such an inspection had been made the defect in the hook would have been detected. The hoist would at once have been stopped, and all danger avoided. For the breach of this statutory duty imposed on the defendants, and the injury resulting to the plaintiff therefrom, prima facie, the plaintiff has a good cause of action. Groves v. Lord Wimbourne[25] , at p. 407 ; Baddeley v. Earl Granville[26] ; Kelly v. Glebe Sugar Refining Co.[27] ; Blamires v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co.[28]. The defence of common employment does not apply to an action arising out of a breach of a statutory duty.\nDavis K. C. for the respondents. The sole question in issue is whether or not the defence of common employment is open to the defendants. If the plaintiff was a servant of the defendants, so far as the circumstances connected with and surrounding the accident are concerned, then the defendants are not liable. Whether or not one man is the servant of another is a question of fact to be decided either by the jury upon disputed facts, or by the judge upon facts which are admitted. Here the facts in that connection are all admitted. The wages of plaintiff and other workmen under the contractors were, by arrangement, paid by the defendants and charged to the contractors. The principal test, however, as to whether or not one man is the servant of another, is whether or not the former is controlled by the latter. One of the results which in law follows the relationship of master and servant is that the master is responsible for the acts of the servant, and it would clearly be unreasonable that a man should be responsible for acts which he himself cannot control, and on the other hand it is clearly most reasonable that a man should be responsible for those acts of others which he does control. Here, the terms of the contract, taken with the evidence, shew clearly that the actions of the plaintiff were subject to the control of the defendants, and, therefore, he was their servant, and a fellow-servant with whichever one of the defendants' servants was responsible for the accident. If the plaintiff, himself, had been guilty of negligence in connection with his proper work, which resulted in injury to another workman in the mine, or to a stranger, the defendants could not have escaped liability on the ground that he was not their servant, and, therefore, that they were not responsible for his negligence.\nThe following authorities are refered to : Wigget v. Fox [29] ; Abraham v. Reynolds[30], at pp. 149, 150 ; Johnson v. Lindsay [31], at pp. 379, 381, 382 : Donovan v. Laing W. & D. Syndicate[32] ; Jones v. Scullard[33] ; Masters v. Jones[34] ; Cahalane v. North Metropolitan Railway Co.[35] ; Griffiths v. Gidlow[36] ; Dynen v. Leach[37] ; Murphy v. Phillips[38] ; Clarke v. Holmes [39], at page 943 ; Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reed[40] ; Wilson v. Merry[41].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal.\nI am of opinion that the trial judge was right in ruling that the appellant was not a servant of the company, respondent.\nHe was clearly engaged by Hand & Moriarity, the contractors. They alone were his masters. Against them alone was his recourse for his wages : he was paid by them through the company, acting for them and in their name for that purpose. There was nothing in their contract with the company of a nature to bind the appellant that prevents them from making any agreement with him about increasing or decreasing his wages : they alone could dismiss him : the very fact that by the contract with Hand & Moriarity the company could request his dismissal shows that be was not the company's servant, since they could not themselves dismiss him.\nThe learned judges of the full court seem to have been under the impression that the appellant was under the control of the company and its officers. But that is not so as I view the evidence. He received no orders directly from the officers of the company, for the good reason that the contractors, not the company, were his masters. It is not because the engineers and superintendent of the company had as between themselves by their contract with Hand & Moriarity the direction of the works to be done that the appellant was himself under the control of the company. He is not proved to ever have known of the terms of that contract, nor that there was such a contract in writing at all. He never knew that any one could ever pretend that he was not under the exclusive control of his masters, the contractors ; he never received orders but from them ; he never submitted himself to the control of any one else. They, not the company, directly controlled him. \"He was working for the contractors and not for the company\" says Kenty, the company's own foreman.\nAssuming, however, that there was a common master and a common employment as regards the appellant and the company's foreman or other employee whose fault might be said to have been the cause of the accident, that would not put an end to the appellant's claim.\nThe accident in question was caused by a defect in one of the permanent appliances for the working of this mine. A clevis had originally been provided by the company for the purpose of raising the bucket at the point in question ; that was a safe appliance, but later on, eight or ten days before this accident, the contractor, Hand, replaced this clevis with a hook, having a safety spring, supplied at his request by the company, thereby substituting an unsafe appliance for a safe one. Now it is incontrovertible law that the master is bound to provide for his employee proper and reasonably safe appliances and to keep them in a reasonably safe condition, so that the work be carried on without subjecting the employee to unnecessary risks. And if the master instead of discharging this duty himself, as a corporation must do, imposes it upon one of his employees, the negligence of this employee is, in that respect, the negligence of the master. The master's breach of such duty towards his servant cannot be absolved by the negligence of any one else. The doctrine of non-liability of the master on the ground of common employment has therefore no application in this case. It is, moreover, in evidence that before the accident the defect in question had been brought to the knowledge of the officers of the company. The evidence is contradictory as to this, but the jury have given credit to the appellant's witnesses. It is in evidence that immediately after the accident, Kenty, the company's foreman, said to Hand, the contractor, \" I told you that the hook was dangerous ; you had no business to have it on there.\" Then, Miller, the hoisting engineer, had told, two weeks before and since, to the master mechanic and to the foreman, that the hook was defective. The trial judge was clearly justified under the circumstances in telling the jury that if they believed the evidence they had to find for the appellant.\nIt is also clear that no prior knowledge of this defect in the hook in question can be imputed to the appellant.\nAt the close of the trial, the learned judge presiding charged the jury that:\nIf you find that the company took reasonable precautions for the protection of the men working in there, then you find for the company, and if you find that they did not, then you find for the plaintiff and assess the damages.\nThe jury returned their verdict as follows :\nWe, the undersigned jurors, impannelled on the case of Hastings v. Le Roi No. 2, in which it is attempted to show that the said defendant company did not take the proper precautions to safe-guard the lives of the workmen engaged in sinking the winze on the seven hundred foot level of said company's property, hereby find that the plaintiff is entitled to damages to the extent of $3,400.\nThat is clearly a finding that the company had not taken the proper precautions to safe-guard the lives of the men working in that mine at the time of this accident. And upon what grounds that verdict could be disregarded I entirely fail to see. The case of McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[42] is precisely in point. There the company's contention was that they were not liable on the ground of common employment, the accident, as they argued, being due to the carelessness of the engineer, a co-worker of the plaintiff. But the court held that as the master who employs a servant in a work of a dangerous character is bound to take all reasonable precautions for the servant's safety, the finding against the company could not be interfered with, though the carelessness of the engineer had undoubtedly contributed to the accident.\nI cannot distinguish this case from the present. Indeed, the evidence against the company in this case is stronger than in that one.\nApart from these considerations I would think that the appellant is entitled to succeed upon clauses 14 and 15 of his statement of claim which read as follows :\n14. It was the duty of the defendants to the plaintiff and those working in said winze to have inspected once at least in every twenty-four hours, the state of the head gear, working places, levels, inclines, ropes and other works of the said mine which were in actual use, including the said winze and its ropes, head-gear and appliances ; and once, at least, in every week to have inspected the state of the shaft and inclines by which persons ascend or descend, and the guides, timbers and ladder-ways therein, and to make a true report of the result of such examination and have such report recorded in a book to be kept at the mine for that purpose and to have such report signed by the person who made the same, and to remedy any defects found on such examination which were liable to be dangerous to those working in the said winze ; but the defendants neglected to observe and perform their said duty as above set forth.\n15. If the defendants had made or caused to be made the examinations and inspections in the preceding paragraph hereof and had caused the result of such examination to be recorded as aforesaid, the defective condition of said hook and appliances would have been discovered and remedied, and the injury to the plaintiff would have been prevented. Now section 25 of the Metalliferous Mines Inspection Act, R. S. B. C. ch. 134, enacts as follows :\n11. A competent person or persons who shall be appointed for the purpose shall, once at least, every twenty-four hours examine the state of the external parts of the machinery, and the state of the head-gear, working places, levels, inclines, ropes and other works of the mine which are in actual use, and once at least in every week shall examine the state of the shafts or inclines by which persons ascend or descend, and the guides, timbers and ladder-ways therein, shall make a true report of the result of such examination, and such report shall be recorded in a book to be kept at the mine for the purpose, and shall be signed by the person who made the same.\nIt appears that these provisions of the statute were not complied with. And, if they had been, the defect in question would bave been detected and the accident averted. Now, under the law laid down by this court in Sault St. Marie Pulp and Paper Co. v. Myers[43], the doctrine of common employment cannot, under these circumstances, be invoked successfully by the respondents. They cannot shift their responsibi ity for the non-performance of any of their statutory duties on the shoulders of any of their employees.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delevered by\nNESBITT J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the full Court of British Columbia should be affirmed. My opinion, after the very able argument of Mr. Shepley, was that the appeal should be allowed, but after examination of the evidence and all the authorities quoted, in addition to some others, I think that the Chief Justice in the court below has correctly stated the decisive test of whether or not the relation of fellow servant exists, namely, \"who has the control and direction of the negligent and injured persons.' The evidence in this case shews that in order to work the mine as a non-union mine, the form was gone through of letting a contract for work in this case to two men called Hand and Moriarity, the contract in question being for sinking a winze, Hand and Moriarity, with the men they purported to employ doing the excavating, the defendants owning the hoisting apparatus and operating same through their acknowledged servants, the whole of the men engaged in the operation of excavating and raising and dumping of material being under the directions of one Kenty. A contract in writing existed, the important parts of which are follows:\u2014\n(1) The parties of the second part agree to sink a winze, as aforesaid, to be at least ten feet long by six feet wide in the clear, direction and dip to be as given by engineers of the party of the first part.\n(3) The parties of the second part agree to work continuously in eight-hour shifts, and change shifts at the same hour as the men employed by the company: it is also agreed that all men employed in carrying out this contract shall be subject to the approval and direction of the superintendent of the party of the first part, and any men employed without the consent and approval of, or unsatisfactory to the superintendent, shall be dismissed on request.\n(4) The parties of the second part agree to bind themselves under this contract to pay the regulation wages of the mine to all the men under their employ and to work only the regulation and lawful number of hours for underground miners, and where any deviation therefrom is considered absolutely necessary, the consent of the superintendent of the mine shall be first obtained before any increase or decrease in the scale of pay or hours of employment shall be made.\nIt was argued that the word \"direction\" in the third paragraph was not to be given the meaning that the men were under the orders of the superintendent, but I think the reference in clause one shows that the word \"direction\" as used in that clause indicates that full effect is to be given to the word \"direction\" in the third clause, and the evidence seems to me to make it very plain that the excavating, raising and dumping of material was all looked upon as the one work. The plaintiff says:\u2014\nQ. You say you were employed by Hand. Did you see Kenty in the mine often?\u2014A. Every day I see him.\nQ. He directed the way the work was to go on, didn't he?\u2014A. Yes sir.\nQ. Hand and yourself followed the directions he gave?\u2014A. He gave direction to Hand, and Hand directed us. He never told me. I don't remember speaking to him, only as I was going out of the mine.\nQ. Hand was in charge of the mine?\u2014A. Yes sir.\nQ. And in your presence Kenty would come down and direct how the work was to go on?\nA.\u2014Yes, every day.\nThis, taken with the admitted facts that the man got his pay in an envelope from the company (although the form was gone through of the amount paid him being charged to Hand and Moriarity) with the written contract showing precisely the relations between the superintendent of the mine and all the men, namely, that no man could be employed except by the superintendent's consent; that the rate of wages was fixed by the company; that a man could be discharged at any moment by the superintendent by going through the form of instructing Hand or Moriarity to discharge the man; that he had complete control and direction of the men, could tell them in what part of the work for which they were employed they should work; gave orders to Hand just as any superintendent would give directions to a foreman in a factory which orders were by Hand communicated to the men. It is well known in all works of this character some one is foreman of the gang to whom directions are given, and such foreman transmits the orders to the men. I think that it is perfectly clear that the answer to the inquiry as to the control and direction of the negligent and injured persons must be that the company had such control. All the authorities establish clearly the proposition that A. may employ B. and pay him, and still B. being under the control of C. has a common employment with others engaged in the same work who are under the control of C. and who are directly hired by C. The discussions which have arisen in the cases have always been upon the facts as to the control of the workmen. I think that here the men engaged by Hand and Moriarity in this particular work knew that there was one common controlling mind in those engaged in the work of excavating and raising the material excavated to the surface, and I think clearly, on this evidence, that if a stranger had been injured by some negligent act done by the plaintiff while engaged in his work, that the company would have been liable, and I think that the appellant continuing in the employment runs the risks of the organization so controlled by Kenty.\nIt was also argued that under the statute there was a liability because of the failure to make a daily report of the condition of the machinery. I do not think anything turns upon this for the simple reason that the accident was not in any sense due to the failure to make such examination. The want of a proper hook, according to the evidence, was known to and reported to Burns who should have stayed the hoisting until the defect was remedied, so that the object for which the statute was passed, namely, discovery of the defect, was obtained, and the act of negligence from which the accident arose was Burn's failure to remedy the defect when it was discovered and reported to him.\nAppeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant; A.

The interim receipt contained a condition for non-liability in case of prior insurance unless with the company\u2019s written assent, but it did not in any way refer to the existing insurance with the Manitoba Assurance Co. Before receipt of a policy from the \u201c Royal \u201d and while the interim receipt was still in force, the property insured was destroyed by fire and B. had not in the meantime formally abandoned his policy with the Manitoba Assurance Co. The latter policy was conditioned to lapse in case of subsequent additional insurance without the consent of the company. B. filed claims with both companies which were resisted and he subsequently assigned his rights to the plaintiffs by whom actions were taken against both companies.\nHeld reversing both judgments appealed from, (14 Man. L. R. 90) that, as the Royal Insurance Company had been informed, through their agent, of the prior insurance by B. when effecting the substituted insurance, they must be assumed to have undertaken the risk notwithstanding that such prior insurance had not been formally abandoned and that the Manitoba Assurance Co. were relieved from liability by reason of such substituted insurance being taken without their consent.\nHeld, further, that, under the circumstances, the fact that B. had made claims upon both companies did not deprive him or his assignees of the right to recover against the company liable upon the risk.\nThe Chief Justice dissented from the opinion of the majority of the, court which held the Royal Insurance Company liable and considered that, under the circumstances, B. could not recover against either company.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, en banc, (1) affirming the judgments of the trial court, by which the action against the Manitoba Assurance Company was maintained with costs, and the action against the Royal Insurance Company was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances under which the actions were instituted and the questions at issue on the present appeals are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. Stewart Tupper K.C. and Phippen for the Manitoba Assurance Company, appellants. We submit that a subsequent insurance with the Royal Insurance Company was proved. This was subsequent insurance within the meaning of the 8th statutory condition, even if invalid. But a subsequent valid insurance with the Royal Insurance Company, to take effect on the 7th of January, 1901, when its interim receipt was issued, has been proved.\nEven if the insurance with the Manitoba Assurance Company was not abandoned by the issue of the interim receipt by the Royal Insurance Company and the omission to notify the appellants thereof, the insurance with the Royal Insurance Company was nevertheless a valid insurance, as its duly authorized agent had full knowledge of the prior insurance before they issued their interim receipt and accepted the premium which they never returned. Wing v. Harvey ([1]); \u0412awden v. London, Edinburgh & Glasgow Assurance Co. ([2]); Watteau v. Fenwick ([3]); Gore District Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Samo ([4]); Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Co. v. Wyld ([5]); Hastings Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Shannon ([6]); Naughter v. Ottawa Agricultural Insurance Co. ([7]); Hatton v. Beacon Insurance Co. ([8]). The validity of the appellants\u2019 contract does not depend on whether or not the subsequent insurance was to be adjudged valid or invalid. The court cannot decide on the validity of the subsequent insurance in this action to which the Royal Insurance Company is not a party Ramsay Cloth Co. v. Mutual Insurance Co. ([9]), per Robinson \u0421 J., at page 523. It is immaterial whether the subsequent insurance might be strictly a legally binding contract. It was an insurance in fact made. Mason v. Andes Ins. Co. (10); Jacobs v. Equitable Insurance Co. (11); Bruce v. Gore District Mutual Assurance Co. (12); Gauthier v. Waterloo Mutual Insurance Co. (13). Haggart K.C. for Whitla et al., respondents. If there was no complete contract with The Royal Ins. Co., no valid subsequent insurance existed; and the case is within the principle of Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Temple ([10]). The plaintiffs frankly admit that should this court reverse the judgment in the suit against the Royal Insurance Company and direct a verdict to be entered for the plaintiffs in that suit, then they could not successfully hold their verdict in this case to the extent of the $2,000 covering the stock in trade. There would then be a breach of the 8th statutory condition indorsed on the \u201c Manitoba \u201d policy as to the insurance on the stock in trade. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Temple; Western Assurance Co. v. Temple ([11]): The subsequent insurance referred to in the 8th statutory condition must be a valid insurance existing at the time of the fire. The same principle has been affirmed in Massachusetts in respect to policies containing similar conditions. The subsequent insurance being inoperative, the first policy remains in force and that subsequent insurance, void by its own terms, is no insurance within the meaning of the usual conditions against other insurance, although the subsequent insurance be in fact paid. Hardy v. Union Mutual Insurance Co. ([12]); Clark v. New England Mutual Fire Insurance Co. ([13]); Stacy v. Franklin Fire Insurance Co. ([14]); Philbrook v. New England Mut. Fire Insurance Co. ([15]); Germania Fire Insurance Co. v. Klewer ([16]).\nIf there is a valid contract with The Royal Ins. Co. then there is double insurance as to the stock in trade, but there is, however, no double insurance as to the household furniture, wearing apparel, jewellery and piano. The Royal Insurance Company\u2019s interim receipt does not cover these articles. The insurance, there, is \u201c on general stock.\u201d\nHaggart K.C. for Whitla et al., appellants. The contract with the Royal Insurance Company was a provisional agreement with the company\u2019s duly authorized agent for such purposes. It was made after full disclosure of all the circumstances and there was no condition exacted as to Bourque formally abandoning the prior insurance as a condition precedent to the substituted insurance attaching.

Travers Lewis for the Royal Insurance Company, respondents. There was not to be any contract of insurance until the prior insurance with the \u201c Manitoba \u201d Company had been abandoned. If the interim receipt be considered as having become effective, it became so merely as an executory contract, which could not be enforced until the prior insurance had been abandoned.\nThe interim receipt was not binding on the company, however, owing to the non-payment in cash of the whole of the premium. The agent\u2019s authority was dependent upon payment of the premium in cash, which is not proved. Canadian Fire Insurance Co. v. Robinson (1); London & Lancashire Life Ass. Co. v. Fleming (2); Acey v. Fernie (3). The appellants should, therefore, have pleaded and proved such payment, and having failed to do so, cannot succeed. In any event, the appellants cannot succeed on the interim receipt as under condition number eight, indorsed on it, the company is not liable for loss in case of prior insurance. If the respondents cannot rely upon this eighth condition, as indorsed on the interim receipt, they claim the benefit of it as one of the conditions indorsed on the policy, which was issued in pursuance of the interim receipt, because the right of action upon such a receipt still depends, as it did before the fusion of law and equity, upon the right to a specific performance of the agreement which it involves to issue a policy or other contract in binding form. In determining whether specific performance should be granted, the court will look at all the surrounding circumstances, and in the present case the trial judge has found that Bourque must be taken to have understood that Dumouchel expected the prior insurance to be abandoned This finding is approved of by Mr. Justice Bain, and would be sufficient in itself to disentitle the appellants to specific performance.\nWe refer also to Dominion Grange Mut.

WHITLA et al.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case appear at full length in the report of it in the Manitoba Court at page 90, vol. 14, of the Manitoba Reports.\nSome confusion may arise, and has perhaps arisen, from the course pursued in the full court where this case and one by the same plaintiffs against the Royal Insurance Company appear to have been heard together. They were not tried together by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, and were not heard together at our bar. This action was taken nearly four months after the other. It was tried after the other as a distinct and separate case. I think that this was the right course to pursue. The two cases have to be considered independently of each other. The result of one should not in any way influence the result of the other.\nWe are not concerned in this case with the ultimate determination of the respondents\u2019 action against the Royal Insurance Company which cannot even be ascertained from this record.\nIf the policy with the Royal Company had been obtained by Bourque upon false representations, for instance, making it voidable ab initio, and if that policy were not subject to the 8th condition against further insurance, it could not be contended that in such a case, Bourque could recover upon this policy with the appellants notwithstanding his double insurance, simply because he could not recover against the Royal.\nThere is only a question of fact before us upon this appeal, as I view it.\nWere there two policies valid on their face and actually subsisting at the same time on the same property in question ? Did Bourque as a matter of fact take a subsequent insurance with the Royal, without the knowledge and consent of the appellant company upon the property insured by them ? To these questions there is room for but one answer.\nNot only had Bourque applied for and obtained from the Royal a further insurance upon the property upon which he held an insurance in the appellant company, but after the fire he immediately notified the Royal and filed his claim with them, and subsequently through his assignees took an action against them for the amount of his interim receipt. Examined as a witness he says:\nQ. Then the insurance in the Royal was a further insurance on the same stock which you claim is covered by the Manitoba Company\u2019s policy ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you are claiming to-day that the Royal Company is liable to you under that interim receipt for insurance ?\u2014A. Yes, well I am claiming as a witness.\nQ. Liable to your assignees, the Messrs. Whitla & Company. You are claiming that the Royal Company issued the $3,000 policy called for by this interim receipt ?\u2014A. Yes. Q. After the fire you put in a proof of loss to the Royal Company, this document which I have in my hand ?\u2014A. Yes.\nNow whether that insurance was valid or not cannot be determined in this case so as to bind the Royal were it necessary to do so. And the question is not whether Bourque intended to doubly insure or not. Did he in fact doubly insure ? We have nothing to do with his intentions.\nThe statutory condition that governs this case, as varied in this policy, reads as follows:\n(8.) The company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company, unless the company\u2019s assent thereto appears herein or is indorsed hereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company, unless and until the company assents thereto or unless the company does not dissent in writing within two weeks after receiving written notice of the intention or desire to effect the subsequent insurance, or does not dissent in writing after that time and before the subsequent or further insurance is effected.\nThe appellants were therefore entitled to get from Bourque two weeks\u2019 previous written notice of his intention to further insure in the Royal, and they never got any. Neither before nor after taking the interim insurance with the Royal did Bourque give them any. Upon what principle the respondents can support their contention that Bourque was at liberty to so ignore at will a material condition of his contract with the appellants and his obligation thereunder, I entirely fail to see.\nThis condition does not say, it is true, that the policy is void if any subsequent insurance is effected without notice to a prior insurer; but it says clearly that in such a case the prior company is not liable for loss, that is to say, not bound in law to pay if they choose, as the appellants do here, to avail themselves of the fact that operates avoidance of their obligation to pay. I would dismiss their action with costs. The respondents\u2019 other contention that they are, in any event, entitled to succeed for the amount of $250, the insurance on household furniture, wearing apparel and jewellery, on which there is no double insurance as they are not covered by the Royal\u2019s interim receipt, cannot prevail. The contract of insurance with the appellants was entire and indivisible, and though there is no double insurance as to the articles so separately insured for $200 by the appellants, yet the whole policy is void. The Gore District Mutual v. Samo ([39]).\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action. Costs in all the courts against respondent.\nWHITLA et al. v. THE ROYAL INSURANCE CO.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case appear at length in the Manitoba Reports, page 90, of vol. 14.\nThis action was instituted nearly four months before the other one by the same plaintiffs against the Manitoba company in question in this record. It was tried and determined before that other one, and should be considered and disposed of as if tried and determined before the other one was instituted.\nI would dismiss this appeal. Bourque\u2019s policy with the Manitoba company was on their books a de facto subsisting policy when he insured with the respondents, and at the time of the fire. Had any return to be then made to the Government as required by the statute, the Manitoba company would have had to report Bourque as insured by them. Bourque had covenanted with the respondents that this policy with the Manitoba was to be put an end to by himself by some action on his part, and he never did it de facto. We have nothing to do with his intentions. They may have been very good, but he did not put them into execution. And what does he do after the fire? Far from himself treating the Manitoba policy as abandoned, he immediately furnished the required proofs of loss and filed his claim with them, and upon their refusal to pay has since instituted an action against them, and as proved in this case, actually recovered a judgment through his assignees for the amount of his insurance with them. Moreover, he swore, when giving his proof of loss to the respondents, that he had another insurance for $2,500 on the same property in the Manitoba Assurance Company. And he would now, forsooth, ask us to declare that he had sworn falsely and that this policy with the \u201c Manitoba \u201d had come to an end before the fire (at what time he, of course, cannot tell) and he never did anything in view of putting an end to it, though he holds his judgment against them upon that policy.\nHow could the court below come to any other conclusion but that his contentions are untenable ? And we have here to determine this case upon the very same facts as they existed and were presented to the court below.\nThe 8th condition varied in the Manitoba policy as proved in this case, reads as follows:\nThe company is not liable for loss * * * if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company unless and until the company assents thereto, or unless the company does not dissent in writing within two weeks after receiving written notice of the intention or desire to effect the subsequent insurance or does not dissent in writing after that time and before the subsequent or further insurance is effected.\nNow Bourque\u2019s \u201c Manitoba \u201d policy by this condition, it is clear, was not ipso facto void by his taking subsequently a further insurance with the respondents, but only voidable if the Manitoba company chose to invoke that subsequent insurance with the respondents in avoidance of their liability. Suppose that the Manitoba company\u2019s policy had not the double insurance clause and was issued in the Province of Quebec, for instance, where there are no statutory conditions, but that they, the Manitoba company, would have been able to defeat Bourque\u2019s claim against them upon any other ground, say, for false representations made by Bourque when applying for the insurance with them, could the appellants recover against the respondents notwithstanding the double insurance clause in the respondent\u2019s policy ? I do not think so. In that case, they would have lost their recourse against both companies, as, I think, they do in this case.\nThen the words \u2018Je vais abandonner\u2019 used by Bourque in his first letter to the respondents clearly import a representation that he, personally, was to do some act, something towards preventing a double insurance. And he never did anything, not even giving to the Manitoba the notice of his intention that his contract with them, as proved in this case, obliged him to give. Now having induced the respondents to contract with him upon such express condition that he would act and do something toward putting an end to his other policy, without which they would not have insured him and having entirely failed to conform to it, how his action against them can be maintained, I cannot see\nI remark further in this case, though it cannot affect the result, that, as I have already mentioned, it appears by this record that the appellants have recovered judgment against the Manitoba company for the amount of Bourque\u2019s policy with them.\nThey surely cannot themselves attack that judgment and contend that they were not entitled to it. Could any more cogent proof, as against them, be made of the double insurance pleaded by the respondents ? Can any better evidence be made by the respondents of the truth of their allegations ? Of course, if their action against the Manitoba company had been dismissed on the ground that the respondents\u2019 policy, not that of the \u201c Manitoba, \u201d was in force, that would be as to the respondents, res inter alios, and could not affect them in any way. But the fact that they have recovered judgment against the Manitoba company is, as against them, conclusive evidence of the fact that Bourque had a prior insurance at the time of the fire, though the event of the failure of his action against the Manitoba company could not have affected the result of this case. The appellants\u2019 reasoning on this point seems to me turning in a vicious circle, the inevitable result of not considering these two cases apart and independently of each other.\nCould the court of Manitoba, in face of the evidence that a judgment against the Manitoba company had so been obtained by the appellants, a judgment which the appellants could not and do not impeach in this case, give them a judgment against the respondents. I fail to see any error whatever in the judgment appealed from at the time it was rendered, and nothing that may have happened since between Bourque and the Manitoba company (specially if not of record in this case) can affect our determination of the appeal. In my opinion the judgment appealed from is unassailable and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nTHE MANITOBA ASSURANCE CO. V. WHITLA et al.\nWHITLA et al. v. THE ROYAL INSURANCE CO.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 12th July, 1900, one P. E. Bourque, residing at Altamont, Manitoba, insured his stock of goods in the Manitoba Assurance Co. for $2,500. The policy insuring the goods contained the usual statutory conditions together with a varied condition, should the assured desire, providing for its interim cancellation. That policy being then subsisting, on the 1st January, 1901, Bourque wrote to one J. T. Dumouchel, an agent of the Royal Insurance Co., a letter of which the following is a copy:\nALTAMONT, le ler Janvier 1901.\nM. J. DUMOUCHEL,\nMONSIEUR,\u2014Etant en train de me faire assur\u00e9 contre le feu sur mon stock, ici \u00e0 Altamont lorsque Mr Landry m\u2019a pri\u00e9 de vous \u00e9crire comme \u00e9tant assur\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame dans votre compagnie, j\u2019ai pris une petite assurance l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier lorsque j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 de M. Landry, dans la Manitoba Assurance Co. et comme il y a des gens qui pensent que c\u2019est une compagnie faible. je vais abandonn\u00e9. J\u2019avais $2,000 sur stock, meubles, piano, etc. J\u2019ai un stock audel\u00e0 de $5,000, et je d\u00e9sirais de mettre a peu pr\u00e8s $3,000 d\u2019assurance.\nAttendant votre retour, Je demeure votre, etc.,\nP. E. BOURQUE.\nDumouchel had\nfull power to receive proposals for insurance against loss or damage by fire, to sign interim and renewal receipts\u2014to receive moneys, and to do all lawful acts and business pertaining to such agency which might from time to time be given him in charge as said agent.\nDumouchel replied to this letter that he would be glad to have the insurance; that he knew nothing about the standing of the other company; but that his was a very strong one.\nOn the 5th January, 1901, Bourque wrote Dumouchel.\nIn answer to yours received yesterday, I beg to say I desire to insure the stock only and store fixtures included, dry goods, groceries, boots and shoes, furniture, for $3,000, I do not keep a stopping place.\nThen follows a description of the building.\nI think that this is the explanation necessary. If you desire anything further I will be pleased to furnish it to you.\nDumouchel thereupon wrote to Bourque that if he sent $75 for the premium he would \u201c put through the insurance \u201d for him. Bourque replied on the 6th of January that he could not pay the amount at once, but would do so later, in reply to which Dumouchel on the morning of the 7th of January sent him an interim receipt for insuring the stock in trade for $3,000 from that date, and a promissory note payable to Dumouche\u013es order for $51, requesting him to sign the note and return it with a cheque for $25. This was done and the note was subsequently paid and the amount of the premium, less commission, sent by Dumouchel to the Royal Insurance Company\u2019s head office in Montreal which retained it. The interim receipt was as follows:\nThe Royal Insurance Company, No. 32513, St. Boniface Agency, 7th January, 1901. Mr. P. E. Bourque having this day applied for insurance against loss or damage by fire to the extent of $3,000 on the property described in application of this date for twelve months, subject to the conditions as indorsed hereon of the company\u2019s policy, and having also paid the sum of $75 as the premium for the same, the property is hereby held insured for forty-five days from this date or until a policy is sooner delivered or notice given that the application is declined. If the application is declined the premium received will be refunded on this receipt being given up, less the proportion for the time the risk has been covered.\nN.B.\u2014If a policy be not received before the expiration of the period above mentioned and no intimation has been given that the application is declined, immediate notice thereof should be given to the manager of the company in Montreal.\nOn general stock, Altamont, premium $75.\n(Sgd.) JOS. DUMOUCHEL,\nSt. Boniface Agency.\nIndorsed on the back were the statutory conditions without alterations or additions the eighth being as follows:\nThe company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company, unless the company\u2019s assent thereto appears herein or is indorsed hereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company, unless and until the company assents thereto, or unless the company does not dissent in writing within two weeks after notice of the intention or desire to effect the subsequent insurance has been mailed to them and addressed to their principal office in Manitoba by registered letter, or does not dissent in writing after that time and before the subsequent or further insurance is effected. Before the time mentioned in the interim receipt expired the property insured was burnt. He made claim by proofs of loss from both companies, but intended to recover only from that one which should ultimately appear to be liable, if either was liable. Both companies disputed liability and both were sued by R. J. Whitla & Co., to whom the assured has assigned his claim.\nUpon trial of the two actions, Killam C. J. dismissed the action against the Royal Insurance Co. and gave judgment against The Manitoba Assurance Co. for the amount of the loss, which judgment was affirmed on appeal to the Court in Banc.\nAll parties against whom judgment was given appealed to this court, and the question to be determined is: Under the circumstances of this case, is either company liable and, if so, which ?\nI have, after some doubt, arrived at the conclusion that there is error in both the judgments of the court below, and that while the Manitoba Assurance Co. is not liable, the Royal Insurance Co. is.\nSo far as the Manitoba Assurance Co. is concerned it seems to me that there can be but little question as to its non-liability. The effecting of the new insurance in the Royal Co. without its assent gave it the right at its option to void it, and, as has been established by a long series of cases in Canadian courts, whether the new insurance was in the first event valid or invalid, if there was a new contract of insurance in fact, that de facto second insurance made void the first. Besides, for the reason presently to be pointed out, the company is discharged. The assured abandoned his claim under his contract in-consideration of the Royal re-assuring him.\nBefore discussing the further facts in this case let me call attention to two principles of law which I think m\u0430\u0443 be found to determine the controversy here. \u201c There is nothing, \u201d says a learned text writer,\nin the law to prevent parties, if they so think fit, from agreeing that, as between them, a certain fact, or state of facts, shall, for the purposes of a particular transaction, which it is competent for them to enter into, and into which they propose to enter, be taken to be true, whether it be in fact true or not, or although they know, or either of them knows, it to be untrue.\nThat is called estoppel by contract.\nThe meaning of estoppel, says Martin B. is this \u0e30 that the parties agree for the purpose of a particular transaction to state certain facts as true; and that so far as regards that transaction there shall be no question about them.\nIn Ashpitel v. Bryan ([40]), Pollock C. B. says:\nFor the purpose of the transaction in question the parties agreed that certain facts should be admitted to be facts, as the basis on which they would contract, and they cannot recede from that * * * We 11 agree with the court below that there may arise an estoppel by agreement, and that such an estoppel arises here.\nAnd in McCance v. London & North Western Railway Co. ([41]), Williams J. in delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber says:\nHere it appears in evidence that the contract declared on was to be regulated and governed by a state of facts understood by the parties * * * It is laid down in my brother Blackburn\u2019s Treatise on the Contract of Sale, p. 163, that \u2018 when parties have agreed to act upon an assumed state of facts, their rights between themselves are justly made to depend on the conventional state of facts, and not on the truth.\u2019 Applying that rule to the present case, we think that both parties are bound by the conventional state of facts agreed upon between them.\nThe other principle, that of election, which is perhaps a sub-class of the one just referred to, is to be found stated in the case Scharf v. Jardine ([42]) where Lord Blackburn makes reference to it as follows \u0e30 Now on that question there are a great many cases; they are collected in the notes to Dumpor\u2019s Case ([43]) and they are uniform in this respect, that where a man has an option to choose one or other of two inconsistent things, when once he has made his election it cannot be retracted, it is final and cannot be altered.\nLord Blackburn also refers to the case of Jones v. Carter ([44]) as most neatly stating the point.\nThe principle, I take it, running through all the cases as to what is an election is this, that where a party in his own mind has thought that he would choose one of two remedies, even though he has written it down on a memorandum or has indicated it in some other way, that alone will not bind him: but so soon as he has not only determined to follow one of these remedies but has communicated it to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made that choice, he has completed his election and can go no further; and whether he intended it or not, if he has done an unequivocal act\u2014I mean an act which would be justifiable if he had elected the other way\u2014the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the persons concerned is an election.\nThe case, it seems to me, very largely depends upon the phrase \u201c Je vais abandonner \u201d in Bourque\u2019s letter of the 1st of January, 1901, to the Royal Insurance Co\u2019s agent at St. Boniface. That that letter was incorporated in and formed part of the contract evidenced by the interim receipt there can be no question.\nNow, from a perusal of the correspondence and evidence and interim receipt, I draw several conclusions. The agent Dumouchel knew perfectly well of the then existing policy in the Manitoba Assurance Co. Both he and Bourque fully understood that there was no intention on Bourque\u2019s part to effect \u201c other \u201d or \u201c additional \u201d insurance in the Royal Insurance Co. There was no intention that there should be two existing insurances at the same time upon the property. Neither was it the intention that there should be any time when there should be no insurance upon it. The proposal in the letter of 1st January, in effect was this: \u201c I intend to abandon my insurance in the Manitoba Assurance Co. if I can obtain substituted insurance in the Royal Insurance Co. In other words \u2014you insure me and I undertake to abandon my insurance in the Manitoba Assurance Co. and not to make any claim against it if loss occurs to me after you have insured me, \u201d The acceptance of the money of the assured and the signing of the interim receipt carried out the intention of both parties, and its effect was, as between the assured and the \u201c Royal \u201d Co., to destroy the right of the assured under the first policy, that is to say to annihilate it and to substitute in its stead the new assurance. The assured used the word \u201c abandonner.\u201d As a matter of strict law it was impossible for him to abandon his contract with the \u201c Manitoba \u201d Co. without their assent. Under its special terms he might during its currency have cancelled it and claimed the unearned premium, but that would not be an act showing that he had abandoned the policy but living up to its terms and insisting upon the performance of its conditions in his favour, and Dumouchel must be presumed to have known this and that the acceptance by Bourque of the interim receipt and the payment of the premium in itself constituted the abandonment which both parties had in contemplation.\nThis is a suit that, before the modern practice, would have had to be brought in a Court of ,Equity and the relief sought for would have been a decree directing the company to issue a policy and as ancillary to that relief to pay the amount of the loss of the plaintiff. In that case the policy directed to issue would, in my judgment, contain a declaration that the insurance thereby effected was an insurance in substitution and in consequence of the abandonment by the assured of his rights under the \u201c Manitoba \u201d policy. Suppose \u2018a policy so ordered to be issued contained provision in words such as the following: \u201c Whereas the applicant is now insured in the \u2018Manitoba\u2019 Co. and has declared that upon the effecting of an insurance in this company he abandons his right under the first policy; and whereas this company has agreed to such abandonment and to the issue of this policy under the circumstances aforesaid the company hereby assures etc., etc.\u201d ; could it be contended that it nevertheless had a right to claim the \u201c Manitoba \u201d policy as an existing insurance upon the property ? The words \u201c other insurance \u201d in the statutory conditions in that case would clearly not apply to the \u201c Manitoba \u201d policy but to any other existing insurance not disclosed to Dumouchel. It therefore seems to me the more reasonable view to hold that under all the circumstances of this case, while the \u201c Manitoba \u201d Co. were relieved from liability by reason of the substituted insurance, the \u201c Royal \u201d Co. was not relieved from its liability.\nI am not disposed to place much reliance upon the fact that the assured proved a claim against both companies and sued both companies. He was on the horns of a dilemma. The proofs were made and the actions were commenced on the advice of his legal adviser. The very fact that there is now a difference of opinion as to which, if either, company is liable, or as to whether there is any liability at all, shews that perhaps the advice of the solicitor displayed good judgment. At the very most it is only evidence, not conclusive evidence, in proof of the allegation that he never did abandon his claim against the Manitoba Co. There is however no estoppel, and as I consider that the contract creating the second insurance was a valid contract effected for the purpose for which it was intended, and that there was not even a suspicion of fraud or of an intention to doubly insure, the subsequent conduct of the assured with regard to the proofs of loss cannot vary or in any way injuriously affect his rights.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that both appeals should be allowed and that judgment should be entered dismissing the action against the \u201c Manitoba \u201d Co. and that judgment should be entered against the \u201c Royal \u201d Co. Costs to the successful party in each case.\nGIROUARD J. concurred.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Both during the argument of this case and since I have entertained serious doubts of the right of the plaintiffs to recover and I confess that even now these doubts are not entirely removed.\nThe plaintiffs sue as assignees of one Bourque who at a time when he was insured in the Manitoba Ass. Co. became dissatisfied with the stability of the company and applied to the agent of the Royal Ins. Co. for insurance upon practically the same property. In his application which was written in French he stated with respect to his existing insurance in the Manitaba Ass. Co. that\nas there are people who think that it is a weak company I am going to abandon.\nA few days afterwards in response to a letter from the agent of the \u201c Royal \u201d he furnished the necessary particulars to effect insurance, and afterwards paid the insurance premium to the agent who remitted it to the head office of the company by which it has since been retained. The agent issued to Bourque an interim receipt with the statutory conditions indorsed thereon. The receipt says:\nMr. P. E. Bourque having this day applied for insurance against loss or damage by fire to extent of $3,000 on the property described in application of this date for 12 months, subject to the conditions as indorsed hereon of the company\u2019s policy and having also paid the sum of $75 as the premium, &c. In my opinion therefore, both Bourque\u2019s application and the indorsed conditions must be read into and form part of the contract. No question of fraud or of any attempt to insure doubly is raised. It is admitted that the intention was to substitute the insurance in the \u201c Royal \u201d for that in the \u201c Manitoba.\u201d In fact Bourque\u2019s application specifically set out the existence of the insurance in the \u201c Manitoba, \u201d and his intention to abandon it for that he was taking out in the \u201c Royal \u201d ; and it was with full knowledge, therefore, of all the material facts that the latter insurance issued. The intention of the parties was clear that there should not be a moment of time when Bourque was not actually insured. He was not obliged to complete the abandonment of his insurance in the \u201c Manitoba \u201d company as a condition precedent to that effected in the Royal attaching. The latter company was willing to insure knowing of the existence of the other insurance, and to accept Bourque\u2019s statement that the insurance he was effecting was not intended as additional, but as substituted insurance. They knew that under the statutory conditions binding alike on the \u201c Manitoba \u201d Company as on themselves, a subsequent insurance by Bourque relieved the \u201c Manitoba \u201d company of any further liability, and with this knowledge and Bourque\u2019s statement of his intention to abandon the prior insurance, they effected substituted insurance for him. The 8th statutory condition which they invoke to relieve themselves of liability says:\nThe company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company unless the company\u2019s assent thereto appears herein or is indorsed hereon, &c.\nI doubt whether the insurance in the \u201c Manitoba \u201d which the \u201c Royal \u201d Company was expressly informed about in Bourque\u2019s application and as to which he stated his intention to abandon, can be held as \u201c prior insurance \u201d within the meaning of those words in this condition. Those words evidently have reference to some prior insurance the existence of which the company effecting the second insurance might assent to. In other words, they refer either to an attempt to effect a second or double insurance without the company\u2019s knowledge, or to do so with their knowledge and assent, but in any case to some attempted or intended double assurance. Here was an honest attempt, not to obtain an assent to a declared prior insurance or to suppress the fact of a prior insurance existing, but to obtain substituted insurance in lieu of a declared prior insurance which was to be abandoned. If the true construction of the clause requires the assent even in the latter case which seems to me an illogical construction, I am still of the opinion that it does sufficiently appear in the interim receipt of which the application is made a part, and that it appears coupled with their acceptance of Bourque\u2019s promise to abandon, and that the failure of Bourque subsequently to carry out his intention of formally abandoning the \u201c Manitoba \u201d insurance cannot under the peculiar circumstances of this case defeat his claim against the \u201c Royal \u201d company.\nThe question, apart from the construction of the condition, seems to me to be whether this promise to abandon was a warranty or an antecedent condition to the policy attaching which would go to the root of the transaction or whether it is merely a collateral stipulation, the non-performance of which did not avoid the defendant company\u2019s obligation, but only gave it a cause of action in case of breach with damage. I am of opinion that it was the latter.\nIt has been contended that Bourque by asserting in his proofs of loss the existence of the insurance in the \u201c Manitoba \u201d company has prevented his recovery in this action. But the circumstances must be looked to. It was very doubtful which policy would be held to be effective or indeed whether either of them would be. The subsequent judicial differences of opinion shew how well founded the doubts were. There was no intention to deceive any one by these proofs in the form in which they were made out, nor did they deceive anyone. It is unfortunate that they were worded as they were and that the facts were not set forth correctly. But no doubt the difficulties were great and in the absence of any fraud or attempted fraud I am disposed to agree with the contention that this irregularity or incorrect statement in the proofs should not be held to destroy an otherwise valid insurance.\nNESBITT J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants, The Manitoba Assurance Co.: Tupper, Phippen & Tupper.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Whitla el al.: Macdonald, Haggart & Whitla.\nSolicitors for the appellants, Whitla et al.: Macdonald, Haggart & Whitla.\nSolicitors for the respondents, The Royal Insurance Co.: Munson & Allan.\n1 14 Man.

About three months after he had been placed in charge of the works he was killed by coming in contact with an incandescent lamp socket in the power house which had been there during the whole of the time he was in charge* but, at the time of the accident, was apparently insufficiently insulated.\nHeld, that there was no breach of duty on the part of the defendants towards deceased who had undertaken to remedy the very defects that had caused his death and the failure to discover them must be attributed to him.\nThe judgment appealed from (14 Man. L. R. 74) ordering a new trial was affirmed but for reasons different from those stated in the court below.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, en banc ([1]), reversing the judgment entered by Mr. Justice Richards upon the finding of the jury at the trial, and setting aside the verdict in favour of the plaintiff and ordering a new trial. The action was by the father, mother and three sisters of the late W. B. Davidson, deceased, for damages in consequence of his death which, it was alleged, had been caused through defendants\u2019 negligence. The circumstances of the case are as follows:\u2014\nA few months prior to the time of the occurrence which resulted in the death of W. B. Davidson, the defendants had purchased the electric lighting plant at the Town of Selkirk, in Manitoba, which at the time was not in good working condition. They were unacquainted with electrical matters and engaged the deceased, a skilled electrician, to manage the plant and put it in proper working order and, to enable him to do so, they arranged to have everything that he might require for that purpose furnished upon his orders by an electrical supply company at Winnipeg. Deceased inspected the plant both before and after his engagement, put the electrical works in operation and, from time to time, ordered such electrical supplies as he considered necessary for repairs, alterations and new installations and acted as manager from the month of June, 1900, until his death, on 11th September following. On the latter date, there being some trouble with an air pump at the works, he went into the pump pit to examine it before it was attended to by the engineman in charge of the power house, and while going down, grasped the brass socket of an incandescent electric lamp in his hand and received a shock which killed him.\nThe electric lamp was hanging from a wooden grating over the pump pit and, although it was not of the kind most approved for use in pits and damp places, he had allowed it to remain there when making the alterations he thought necessary on assuming the management of the works. There was an ordinary lantern provided for the use of any person having to examine the machinery in the pump pit, but deceased did not make use of it and the inference appeared to be that he had taken the electric lamp in his hand to make an examination of the machinery instead of using the lantern. A short time after the accident the power house lights went out gradually and it was afterwards discovered that the electrical transformer had burned out.\nThe action was taken under the Manitoba statute respecting compensation to families of persons killed by accidents ([2]), as amended by 61 Vict. c. 11 (Man.) and charged the defendants with negligence in failing to remedy defects in the electrical plant and machinery some of which might have caused the accident.\nThe jury found a general verdict in favour of the plaintiffs for $1,500 damages, upon which judgment was entered by the trial judge. On appeal, the full court directed that the verdict should be set aside and ordered a new trial ([3]), on the ground that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had suffered any damages that would entitle them to recover judgment under the statute. The plaintiffs now appeal.\nDavidson K.C. for the appellants. The deceased while engaged in the performance of his ordinary duty of running an electric plant was instantly killed through the negligence of the defendants by reason of defects in the condition of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings and premises used in the business; the particular defects alleged being: (1.) Transformer in power house defective; (2.) Absence of a primary ground detector; (3.) Insufficient lightning arresters; (4.) Defective pump in pump house; (5.) Wet floor in pump house; (6.) Main switch-boom not provided with necessary safeguards and instruments to run the same; all of which arose and were not remedied owing to the negligence of the defendants.\nThere was evidence from which inferences of a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit could be drawn and, upon this, there was justification for the general verdict. Duckworth v. Johnson ([4]). Anticipated benefit may be the subject matter of damages; Franklin v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([5]); Ricketts v. Village of Markdale ([6]); Grand Trunk Railway Co, v. Weegar ([7]); Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Moore ([8]); Hetherington v. North Eastern Railway Co. ([9]); Jones v. Hough ([10]); Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright ([11]); Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Moxley ([12]). The rule adopted by the court below as to evidence of \u201creasonable expectation \u201d is too narrow and vigorous; it is in contradiction of the leading decisions; see cases already cited, and St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett ([13]); Blake v. Midland Railway Co. ([14]); \u0420\u0443m v. Great Northern Railway Co. ([15]); Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Jennings ([16]); Condon v. Great Southern Railway Co. ([17]), per Pigott C.B. and an American case particularly in point, Kane v. Mitchell ([18]).\nAs to the remaining reasons assigned by defendants affecting contributory negligence, character of deceased, whether he was a workman or contractor, care or negligence of defendants, etc., they have been submitted to and passed upon the jury upon evidence which should support their finding, and this court will not reverse on questions of fact unless convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that the judgment appealed from is clearly erroneous. Arpin v. The Queen (1); Sewell v. British Columbia Towing Co. (2); Royal Electric Co. v. H\u00e9v\u00e9 (3). The defendants\u2019 evidence is wholly insufficient to establish absence of negligence on their part or remove liability from them. Keasby on Electric Wires, pages 259, 269. It is for those who control the wires to shew that the accident occurred from some cause beyond their control and not by reason of any want of care in the construction or maintenance of their dangerous appliances. Ennis v. Gray (4); Citizens Light & Power Co. v. Lepilre (5).\nCoutl\u00e9e K.C. and Phippen for the respondents. Although the Manitoba statute differs to a certain extent from Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, yet the principle upon which actions of this nature are given is the same and, to entitle the plaintiffs to succeed, they must shew a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuance of life of the deceased. There is no such proof in this case. Blake v. Midland Railway Co. (6); Chapman v. Rothwell (7); Franklin v. South Eastern Railway (8), at pp. 211, 213; Dalton v. South Eastern Railway Co. (9); St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett (10); Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Jennings (11); Mason v. Bertram (12); Rombough v. Balch and Peppard (13); Blackley v. Toronto Railway Co. (14); Ricketts v. Village of Markdale (15). For the reasons given for the judgments appealed from, and in the cases cited, the appellants have not established that reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuance of the life of the deceased necessary to entitle them to succeed. They have been unable to shew more than that the deceased was a dutiful son. There is no evidence of any actual assistance to the plaintiffs by him at any time.\nIf the action is based on common law rights, apart from The Employers Liability Act, then it must appear that the master knew of the defect, and that the deceased was ignorant of it, and the pleadings must so allege. Griffiths v. London and St. Katharine Docks Co. ([19]); Black v. Ontario Wheel Co. ([20]). Here these conditions have not been met. If the claim be under The Employers Liability Act (56 Vict. c. 39, Man.) it must be shewn that the employer knew of the defect, or was negligent in not discovering it. Nothing of the kind is pretended here.\nIt was the duty of the deceased, who had been employed for that specific purpose, to discover any defects in the works to put them right. He was the expert in charge of the plant There was no one higher in authority on whom any duty devolved. The owners had not only instructed the deceased to remedy defects should he find any, but they had also supplied him with ample means of doing so, and there is no evidence of knowledge by any of the defendants of any defects or of want of care on their part in discovering any defect. The deceased knew the state of the works and voluntarily accepted the risks and defendants are not liable. Thomas v. Quartermaine ([21]); Yarmouth v. France ([22]); Smith v. Baker ([23]).\nThe evidence does not show that death resulted from any defect in the appliances, and if any such defect caused the death it must have arisen eo instanti. Critical investigation by electrical experts failed to disclose any defect discoverable before the accident. There is no evidence inconsistent with deceased having been killed entirely independent of and without any defect in the works. None of the witnesses would attribute the death to any particular defect.\nThe deceased lost his life through his own negligence which was the proximate cause of his death. The pump pit was necessarily wet. Damp places are specially dangerous when dealing with light currents. It was unnecessary to touch the lamp. It was always kept burning. It was necessarily in a dangerous place. Others thought it dangerous to handle. A lantern had been provided for use in the pump pit. With high pressure currents a break may take place at any moment. The better connection you make with the ground the greater the strain on the system and the more liable to break. A careful electrician should always assume a possibility of breakage in insulation and yet deceased with knowledge of these facts unnecessarily handled the lamp in a dangerous place, thus throwing extra weight on the insulation, and death resulted. Davey v. London and South Western Railway Co. (1); Martin v. Connah\u2019s Quay Atkali Co. (2); Ruegg 171; Brunell v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (3).\nAll the experts examined agree that there was no defect visible or apparent which could have caused the accident and there can be no liability for latent defects. Ruegg, 37, 38; Stokes v. Eastern Counties Railway Co. (4); Readhead v. Midland Railway Co. (5) Richardson v. Great Eastern Railway Co. (6). The defendants were within their rights, operating an enterprise for public utility and had engaged a competent manager and discharged every duty incumbent upon them not only towards him but towards the public. Deceased was warned that the works were out of order, he visited and inspected the premises, engaged as manager and undertook to put them in proper order. After three months experience he acted most imprudently and his misfortune resulted from his own fault.\nWe refer generally to Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy ([24]); Messenger v. Bridgetown ([25]); Fawcett v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([26]); Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns ([27]); Headford v. McClary Mfg. Co. ([28]); Roberts v. Hawkins ([29]); Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co. ([30]); Tooke v. Bergeron ([31]).\nThe American cases cited by appellant are not in point as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act has not been enacted in the State of New York.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014The plaintiffs are the father, mother and three sisters of one W. B. Davidson, deceased, and the defendants are the proprietors of the electric light plant at the Town of Selkirk. The deceased took charge of the plant under arrangements to run same and with instructions to see what was required and put the plant in proper running order.\nThe evidence is clear that any requests for supplies were complied with, but unfortunately on the 11th September, 1900, the engineer in charge informed the deceased that something was wrong with the air pump at the works and the deceased went into the pump pit and apparently took hold of the nozzle of a small electric lamp suspended in the pit and, while grasping the nozzle, received an electric shock which killed him.\nSeveral theories as to the cause of the overcharge of electricity were advanced and the jury found a general verdict for the plaintiffs fixing the damages at $1,500. The trial judge entered judgment for this amount and the full court held that the judgment could not stand on the ground that no sufficient evidence of damage under the Act in Manitoba, similar to Lord Campbel\u013es Act, had been offered. In my opinion it is not necessary to deal with this question.\nI think the case may be disposed of on the short ground that no evidence was adduced of any breach of duty owing by the defendants to the deceased. The charge and control of the plant was with the deceased, and any of the defects complained of were the very matters which the deceased undertook to remedy if discovered, and the failure to discover such defects must be attributed to him. There was no evidence of negligence in the defendants, having in mind the duties of the deceased.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Robinson & Hull\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tupper, Pippen & Tupper.\n[1] 14 Man.

All the business of that company was afterwards assigned to the Canadian Mutual and L. paid the latter the amount borrowed with interest and $460.80 in addition, and asked to have the mortgage discharged. The company refused claiming that L. as a shareholder in the Standard Co. was liable for its debts and demanding $79.20 therefor by way of counterclaim. At the trial of an action by L. for a declaration that the mortgage was paid and for repayment of the said $460.80, such action was dismissed (1 Ont. L.R. 191) but on appeal the Court of Appeal ordered judgment to be entered for L. for $47.04 (5 Ont. L.R. 471). The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.\nHeld, that the appeal would not lie; that no title to lands or any interest therein was in question; that no future rights were involved within the meaning of subsec. (d) of 60 &61 Vict. ch. 34; and that all that was in dispute was a sum of money less than $1,000 and therefore not sufficient to give jurisdiction to the court.\nHeld, also that the time for bringing the appeal cannot be extended after expiration of the sixty days from the pronouncing or entry of the judgment appealed from.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed[2], and directing judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $47.04. The facts of the case necessary to understand the judgment of the Supreme Court are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nW.J. Clark for the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that only a sum of money less than $1,000 was in dispute, and citing Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9, &c. de la Nativit\u00e9[3]; Jermyn v. Tew[4].\nShepley K.C. (Macdonell with him) contra. The appeal involves the title to land or an interest in land. Purdom v. Pavey[5]; Stinson v. Dousman[6].\nMoreover the future rights of the appellants are affected and subsection (d) of the Act 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, gives a right of appeal.\nIf there is no appeal as of right I would ask for special leave under subsec. (e). The case is a very important one for loan companies.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We are all agreed that this appeal must be quashed. As the case comes before us, there is nothing in it but a controversy as to a pecuniary amount of less than $1,000, and therefore not sufficient to give us jurisdiction.\nThe contention that the case might be appealable under subsection (a) of the Act 60 & 61 Vict. c. 34, cannot prevail. There is no title to real estate or any interest therein in question, controverted or in controversy, upon this appeal. Compare Tintsman v. National Bank[7]; Stillwell B. & S.V. Co. v. Williamston Oil & F. Co.[8]; Carne v. Russ[9]; Farmers Bank of Alexandria v. Hooff[10]; Nicholls v. Voorhis[11]; Scully v. Sanders[12]. The effect or consequences of a judgment are not a test of our jurisdiction. Wineberg v. Hampson[13]; The Emerald Phosphate Co. v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works[14]; Jermyn v. Tew[15]; Frechette v. Simmonneau[16]; Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[17].\nNeither can the right of appeal be supported upon sec. 1, subsec. (d) of the Act. There is in the case no matter in question relating to the taking of an annual or other rent, customary or other duty or fee, or a like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights. These last words are governed by the preceding ones. A demand must be of a general and public nature besides affecting future rights. In re Marois[18]; Gilbert v. Gilman[19]; Wineberg v. Hampson[20]; Raphael v. MacLaren[21].\nThe appellant now asks that, failing his maintaining his appeal as of right, we should grant him special leave under subsec. (c). But that application is too late, assuming that it could be heard without notice to the respondent. More than sixty days have elapsed since the judgment he would now appeal from; sec. 40 Supreme Court Act; and under a constant jurisprudence, our power to grant special leave is gone, and the time cannot be extended for such a purpose either under sec. 42 which applies exclusively to appeals as of right, or under rule 70 which has always been construed as not applying to delays fixed by statute. Our jurisprudence on the subject under this Ontario Act is the same that we have followed as to leave to. appeal per saltum under section 26, subsec. 3. Barrett v. Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke[22], and cases therein cited, to which may be added In re Smart[23]; and Stewart v. Skulthorpe, referred to in the second edition of Cassels\u2019s Supreme Court Practice, at page 37. See Credit Company v. Arkansas Central Railway Co.[24]; Brooks v. Norris[25].\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Macdonell, McMaster & Geary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.J. Clark.\n[1] 5 Ont. L.R. 471.\n[2] 3 Ont.

The jury found in answer to a question by the judge that \" we believe there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment in appeal (9 B. C Rep. 303), Taschereau C. J. and Killam J. dissenting, that this finding did not establish the collatlral agreement but was, if anything, opposed to it and the real issue not having been passed upon there must be a new trial.\nIf a juror on the trial of a cause is allowed without challenge to act as such on a subsequent trial, that is not per se a ground for setting aside the verdict on the latter.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThe plaintiffs, whose action has been thrice tried, claimed from defendant their expenses and compensation for endeavouring to sell a coal mine for the latter who by a written agreement promised them five per cent commission. He failed to effect a sale but based his action on the ground that his failure was caused by defendant's interference. He obtained a verdict which was set aside and a new trial ordered on which the claim was amended by adding a claim on an alleged collateral and verbal contract to pay expenses in case of no sale. This second trial resulted in a nonsuit which was set aside by the full court and a third trial ordered[2] which the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed.[3]. The third trial resulted in a verdict for plaintiff which the full court sustained and the defendant appealed.\nThe principal questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies now reported.\nSir Charles Hibbert Tupper K.C. for the appellant. We contend that the fact that one of the jurors sat on a former trial is a good ground for challenge, and that this can be taken advantage of after verdict, because that ground of challenge was not known to the defendant at the time of the last trial. Archbold Q. B. Practice (ed. 1885) p. 619; 1 Coke, Littleton, p. 157b, \" challenge propter affectum;\" Blackstone (Lewis ed.) vol. 3, p. 363 ; Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, vol. 2, p. 577 ; Thompson on Trials, vol. 1, sec. 68 ; Argent v. Darrell[4] ; Bacon's Abridgement, vol. 9, p. 598. There can be no waiver where the party had no knowledge of the ground of challenge ; Thompson on Trials, sec. 114 (ed. 1399). Herbert v. Shaw[5] ; Earl of Falmouth v. Roberts[6] ; Peermain v. Mackay [7].\nThe finding of the jury upon the main point is really a finding in appellant's favour; or if that is too broad a statement, it is clear that the jury have dis- regarded what was the only evidence they could possibly have found upon. They expressly state that their verdict is founded upon evidence which did not and could not bear upon the issue found. They answered: \"In view of concessions made subsequently, we believe there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale.\" On this all-important point they find their verdict, not because they believed the only real evidence upon the point, but in consequence of \" subsequent concessions.\" The general verdict does not affect the question; the jury might have declined to answer questions, but they did not, and their answers are a part of the verdict. They find the general verdict because they have come to certain conclusions regardless of the evidence.\nThe special findings are incomplete, inconclusive and contradictory both to each other and to the verdict, and upon the findings, the defendant is entitled to have a verdict or judgment entered for her in spite of the added general verdict in plaintiffs' favour. The jury only give the plaintiffs compensation for expenses incurred by them and for nothing else, although they sued also for compensation for work and labour. The verdict must, therefore, be taken to negative the claim actually made by the plaintiff Harris in his evidence for work and services, although according to his evidence his whole claim depended on the one promise. Cobban Manufacturing Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[8] ; McQuay v. Eastwood[9], at page 406. They do not find as a fact that there was a distinct agreement by the defendant to pay compensation made \" some time in the middle of the year 1890.\" The jury did not credit the evidence of the plaintiff Harris, and a promise of \" fair treatment\" does not impose any legal responsibility upon the defendant. See the remarks of McColl C.J. in this case[10], at page 513 of the report on the trial, also Taylor v. Brewer[11] ; In re Vince[12] ; Croasdaile v. Hall[13] ; Briggs v. Newswander[14]. Moreover, there is no evidence whatever of any promise of fair treatment. The evidence of the plaintiff, Harris, was directed to proving a different contract entirely, and the jury have not seen fit to believe him ; nor is there any allegation in the pleadings of any such contract. The jury clearly ignore the evidence of Harris that he was promised compensation for his time spent in endeavouring to sell the mine. The special findings are not consistent with a general finding in plaintiffs' favour, and entitle the defendant at least to a new trial. Where, from their answers it can be seen that the jury proceeded wrongly in coming to their verdict, or have found without proper or sufficient evidence, the verdict cannot stand. Yorkshire Banking Co. v. Beatson & Mycock[15] , per Denman J., at p. 206, and in 5 C. P. D. 109, at pp. 126, 127 ; Hutchison v. Bowker[16] ; Gordon v. Denison[17].\nThe evidence is such that the jury, viewing the whole of it reasonably could not properly find a verdict for the plaintiffs, and a verdict for the defendant or judgment for her should have been entered by the trial judge; or at all events a new trial should be directed. Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[18] ; Webster v. Friedeberg[19] ; Ferrand v. Bingley Local Board[20] ; Allcock v. Hall[21] ; Hiddle v. National Fire &c. Ins. Co.[22] ; Campbell v. Cole[23] ; Grieve v. Molsons Bank[24]. The right to a new trial is not confined to cases where the jury have been \"perverse\" or have \"misconducted themseves.\" Per Morris L.J. in Jones v. Spencer[25] at p. 538. This right is not affected by the fact that two juries had found for plaintiff. Daun v. Simmins[26] .\nThe following cases are in point respecting a mistrial by reason of a juror having sat on a former trial. Barrett v. Long[27], at pp. 405, 414-415 ; Bailey v. Macaulay[28] at page 829.\nThe rule respecting the Privy Council interfering with verdicts said to be against the weight of evidence is referred to in Lambkin v. South Eastern Rway. Co.[29] ; Archambault v. Archambault[30] ; and shews that the two courts referred to are appellate courts, and not the finding of the trial court and one appellate court. Compare Black v. Walker[31] ; Headford v. McClary Mfg. Co.[32] ; North British Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Tourville[33] ; Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin[34] ; City of Montreal v. Cadieux[35] ; Russell v. Lefrancois[36] . It is the duty of the final court of appeal to review the decisions of the lower courts where they turn on proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence ; Arpin v. The Queen[37] ; Hunter v. Corbett[38] ; Sutherland v. Black[39] ; and Smith v. McKay[40] , at page 613.\nBodwell K.C. for the respondents. As to the juror who sat on the previous trial, the knowledge of his disqualification must be imputed to the defendant and we must assume that she waived the objection. Brown v. Sheppard[41] .\nThe question at issue was one for the jury altogether and rested entirelyupon the credibility of the witnesses. The jury has chosen to believe Harris, and they are the sole judges. Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slatter y[42] at pages 1201 and 1202 ; Commissioner of Railways v. Brown[43] ; Australian Newspaper Company v. Bennett[44] ; Dunsmuir v. Lowenberg, Harris & Co.[45]. The jury intended to give a general verdict; they answered the questions out of deference to the expressed opinion of the Judge that they should do so, but it is clear from all circumstances that they did not intend that these questions should constitute their verdict. To establish the contention by the other side that the questions are contradictory, and that the findings shew that the jury had gone upon the wrong principle, the appellant must shew that the answers are so framed as to be destructive of the verdict as a matter of law. All the authorities cited by the appellant when examined establish this. But the answers are entirely consistent with the general verdict. The answer to the first question is simply a statement of the process of reasoning by which the jury arrived at their conclusion, and is, in fact, an adoption by the verdict of the exact case made by the plaintiff on his evidence. The alleged written contract was merely a written instruction which contained a statement of the proposed price and terms, but was intended to be subject to variations by Harris using his best endeavors to effect a sale, should he be unable to find a purchaser on those terms. Even if the court should think that a different inference might have been properly drawn by the jury from the facts in evidence, it should refuse a new trial on the ground that so many trials have taken place and so many juries have pronounced in the plaintiff's favor. Wight v. Moody[46] at pp. 502 and 506; Pender v. War Eagle Con. M. & D. Co.[47]. New trials have been persistently refused against the opinions of the courts below. The latest of a long series of decisons in this direction being :\u2014 Rowan v. Toronto Ry. Co.[48] ; Fraser v. Drew[49]. The only cases where contrary rulings have been made are easily distinguishable. They are Hardman v. Putnam[50], where there was gross misdirection, the judge charging on the question of fraud which had not been raised in the pleadings; and Griffiths v. Boscowitz[51] also a case of misdirection and refusal to make a direction. In Cowans v. Marshall[52], there was also a misdirection and the jury failed to make any finding and no proof was made as to the particular act of negligence charged against the defendant. In Peters v. Hamilton[53] the court below was reversed on an order for a new trial and blamed for it.\nThis court has consistently held that reversals on mere questions of fact should not be made in the appellate courts unless there were findings so clearly erroneous as to shock a reasonable mind. Bellechase Election Case[54] ; Ryan v. Ryan[55] ; Arpin v. The Queen[56], approved in North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[57] at page 192 ; Titus v. Colville[58] ; Town of Levis v. The Queen[59] ; Black v. Walker[60] : The Queen v. Murphy[61] ; Paradis v. Corporation of Limoilou[62] ; Hamelin v. Bannerman[63] ; London Street Railway Co. v.Brown[64] ; D'Avignon v. Jones[65] ; McKelvey v. LeRoi Mining Co.[66]. Concurrent findings must not be disturbed: Warner v. Murray[67] ; Schwersenski v. Vineberg[68], approved in The North British Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Tourville[69], at page 192; Bickford v. Hawkins[70] ; Quebec, Montmorency & Charlevois Railway Co. v. Mathieu[71] ; Bowker v. Laumeister[72] ; Bickford v. Howard[73], and cases there cited by Taschereau J. Where there is conflicting testimony the findings of the trial judge are decisive: Grasett v. Carter[74]. In Parker v. Montreal City Passenger Ry. Co.[75], this court reversed the judgment appealed from and restored the findings of fact and the judgment of the trial court because such findings ought not to have been interfered with. This decision was affirmed by the Privy Council which refused leave to appeal precisely because the issues were upon the findings as to fact[76]. In The Santanderino v. VanVert[77], followed in The Reliance v. Conwell[78], it was held that even in doubtful cases findings of fact ought not to be interfered with. In the Village of Granby v. Menard[79], the evidence was contradictory, and Girouard J., with whom all the judges concurred, set out the jurisprudence very fully. The findings of fact by the trial judge were restored in the face of adverse holdings by two appellate courts. This case was followed in The Reliance v. Conwell[80]. In Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Weegar[81] , all the judges (see texts) held that findings of jury supported on a first appeal ought not to be disturbed, King J. going so far as to say that the findings bound this court (at p. 427), and Gwynne J. stating the same thing practically in his remarks. In Toronto Railway Co. v. Balfour[82] , this court refused to interfere in a matter of procedure as to whether a verdict was special or general and refused to disturb a verdict as against weight of evidence after affirmance by the first court of appeal.\nWe distinguish the following cases :\u2014 North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[83] , was a case of mixed law and fact depending on an inference of fraud to be drawn from evidence, but the rule as to finality on mere findings of fact is there specially approved, at page 191 by Taschereau J. Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin[84], depended upon the admissibility of evidence and its appreciation. In The City of Montreal v. Cadieux[85] an exorbitant rate of remuneration had been allowed based on a corrupt system previously in vogue and thus it appears a great injustice had been caused to the ratepayers. It was not a jury case. (See p. 623 of report.) Taschereau J. very strongly dissented, citing high authority at p 619. See also Bentley v. Peppard[86].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE dissented from the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial. SEDGEWICK J.\u2014I agree with the judgment prepared by my brother Davies, but I wish to add that in my view the evidence overwhelmingly preponderates in favour of the appellant, and that upon that ground also the judgment of the court below should be reversed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia refusing an application made by the appellant for a new trial. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Walkem and a special jury who returned a verdict for the respondents for $9,667.62. The case has been long before the courts and is now for the second time on appeal before us. This appeal has been twice argued, the second argument becoming necessary owing to the deaths of two of the judges who sat during the first hearing. The action was begun in 1894 and was originally brought to recover damages for the alleged prevention by the appellant of the sale of her colleries in British Columbia which she had entrusted to Harris, a member of the plaintiffs' firm to dispose of on certain terms. Large damages were awarded plaintiffs by the jury, but on appeal the full court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. At the second trial before the late Chief Justice McColl, and after the plaintiffs' claim as originally formulated had been amended by adding a claim on the alleged supplemental contract to pay all expenses in case no sale was effected, a non-suit was entered, but this was reversed by the full Court of British Columbia and a new trial ordered. . On appeal to this court by the present appellants it was held that there was legal and admissible evidence of a parol agreement supplemental to both the commissions to sell the colleries\u2014to that of the 18th of January, 1892, as well as that of the 18th September, 1890\u2014making provision for a case which the written agreement did not contemplate. The appeal, therefore, was dismissed and the order for a new trial confirmed, but upon this one ground alone. The then Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of this court expressed his own strong opinion that there was no evidence whatever of the original case made by the respondents, that of undue interference with them by the appellant in their efforts to make a sale, and stated that as the order for the new trial in the court below proceeded upon this ground exclusively, had there been nothing else in the case the appeal ought to have succeeded.\nAt the third trial a great mass of testimony was again given in support of the original case, but the verdict of the jury was limited to findings in plaintiffs' favour on the alleged collateral agreement. I am of the opinion that this is the only branch of his case on which under the evidence the plaintiffs could possibly succeed and I mention the fact because, if the cause is again tried before a jury, I think the evidence should be confined to that one branch of the case, and a large amount of irrelevant evidence bearing on the claim for damages for alleged undue interference with the respondents in their efforts to make a sale of the colleries eliminated.\nThe appellants seek to set aside the last verdict on several grounds. In the view I take of the case however it is unnecessary for me to do more than deal with one of them, though I am quite in accord with the judgment of the full Court of British Columbia in holding that the fact of one of the jurors at this hearing having also sat on one of the former trials, is not per se a ground for disturbing the verdict. Under the practice in British Columbia the appellant had a double opportunity of challenging this juror and not having exercised her right at the proper time or given satisfactory reasons for her neglect cannot now, when the verdict has gone against her, be heard upon the point.\nThe main questions in the appeal however, are, first: Was there any evidence to go to the jury of the collateral agreement to pay the respondent Harris his \"expenses\" or \"compensation and expenses\" in case there was no sale of the collieries ? And if so, have the jury found that there was such an agreement ? I agree that there was evidence on the point which it was the duty of the judge to submit to the jury and am unable to concur in the contention of the appellant's counsel that the weight of the evidence was so strongly against the plaintiff that the defendant was entitled to have judgment entered for her non obstante veredicto. It is not a question of the preponderance of the testimony, nor is it a question of how this court would find if the matter was open to them. The conduct and demeanour of the witnesses and the credibility and weight to be attached to their statements together with the correspondence and other written testimony, were matters peculiarly within the exclusive province of the jury, and if they had found one way or the other upon the issue this court would not, under the circumstances, have entered a judgment against their finding. But in my opinion there has not been any finding upon the only substantial issue open to the jury to find upon. The real dispute has not been tried, or, if tried, has not been passed upon by the jury. The learned judge told the jury that they could bring in a general verdict, but that he would leave certain specific questions to them in order the more clearly to determine the actual facts. The jury were not bound under the laws of British Columbia to answer these questions, but they acted upon the advice of the judge and did so. The first question was:\nDid the defendant, Mrs. Dunsmuir, authorize the plaintiff, say in the middle of 1890, to \"do his best\" to sell her mine, and if so, was any compensation mentioned at the time ?\nTheir answer was:\nIn view of concessions made subsequently, we believe there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale.\nThe question might possibly have been more definite and clear and have asked the jury to answer whether there was any verbal promise made by Mrs. Dunsmuir to Harris, on either of the occasions when the written commissions to sell the collieries were given or after the giving of either of such commissions to pay or allow Harris any and what compensation in case he failed to effect a sale. That was the vital point of the case on the answer to which the verdict depended. The onus of proving any such supplemental contract lay upon the plaintiff. He cannot recover unless the jury first find that such a supplemental promise or contract was in fact made. Now reading the answer the jury gave to the question put to them it will be seen that they carefully refrain from finding the existence of the alleged supplemental agreement or promise. All they find is a promise of fair treatment and that finding they base upon certain expressed reasons. Reasons for their finding they were not bound to give, and indeed it would have been better if they had not given any, because those they have given have been the subject of much pertinent criticism. But apart from their reasons which may appear more or less cogent or relevant, they failed to give either an affirmative or a negative answer to the question, or indeed any answer from which the court could properly infer the existence of the agreement or promise relied upon. The promise found of \" fair treatment in case of no sale \" has no evidence whatever to support it, and strictly speaking if it amounts to anything is a finding against the specific collateral agreement plaintiff alleged had been come to and which he had either to prove or in case of failure suffer defeat. Whether there was or was not a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale was not an issue between the parties at all. If it was, a serious question which was raised by appellant's counsel had to be answered, namely, whether such a promise is capable of being enforced or given effect to. What is fair treatment, and who is to determine it ? Such a question however need not be discussed now. The plaintiff did not claim, and no evidence whatever pointed to, any such promise. The plaintiff, Harris, said in one place he was promised his \" expenses and a fair remuneration \", and in another place \" his expenses \" in case no sale was effected by him. The plaintiff's evidence was the only evidence offered in support of the agreement. The defendant denied it Much collateral evidence was given to shew that such a promise was not and could not have been made. But the issue was plain and square and the jury were bound to find one way or the other. They did not do so but on the contrary found the promise was one of \" fair treatment \" only. As I have already said neither party contended this was the promise and no evidence supported it. In fact, in my opinion, the evidence as a whole strongly preponderated in defendant's favour on the point at issue. The jury's general verdict was a sympathetic one, but not one which could be upheld on such a special finding as they made. If the general verdict had stood alone it might be supported possibly on the ground that the jury had preferred to believe Harris rather than accept the evidence against him. But no such contention can prevail in the face of the specific finding they have come to.\nThe real issue not having therefore been passed upon or found one way or the other, the verdict cannot stand and there must be a new trial.\nIn view of the strong expressions of opinion that we have felt bound to give of the uselessness of the mass of evidence given with reference to the claim as originally framed, and of the fact that the issue is a simple and square one, was the promise made by the defendant to Harris as he alleges in case there was no sale, it is to be hoped that the evidence on the new trial can be materially lessened.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contended very strenuously that some evidence had been wrongfully admitted and some excluded, and also that sufficient proof had not been given by plaintiff of his actual expenditure. It is obvious however that these questions do not in view of our decision require treatment at our hands now. They may safely be left to the tribunal, which will now dispose, I hope finally, of this much litigated dispute.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs in this Court and in the full Court of British Columbia.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur with the judgment prepared by my brother Davies, with the additional observations by my brother Sedgewick.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nWhile a perusal of the printed report of the case naturally leads one to seriously doubt the correctness of the verdict, I do not think that the court should interfere with it. This court has already decided that, upon practically the same evidence for the plaintiff, there was a case for the jury. It was still so after the evidence for the defence was given.\nThe jury's finding that there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale is, of course, not a finding of a fact raising a liability by implication of law, but such a promise would warrant, I think, the inference of an agreement to remunerate, justifying a verdict for the plaintiff.\nIn this case, it was not a question of entering a judgment upon special findings, but there was a verdict involving the necessary inference.\nI am not prepared to say that the verdict is so clearly unreasonable as to warrant its being set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Peters & Griffin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bodwell & Duff.\n[1] 9 B.

R. 12 Q.

Baxter v. Phillips (23 Can. S. C. R. 317) and Leclere v. Beaudry (10 L, C. Jur. 20) referred to.\u2014Moreover, (affirming the judgment appealed from) in the present case, the controversy does not relate to the succession and, in any event, the assignor cannot exercise the droit de retrait successoral.\nSemble, however that the retention of a fractional interest in the property might have the effect of preserving the right to retrait suocessoraI.\n4\u00b0. That the laws relating to champerty were introduced into Lower Canada by the \"Quebec Act, 1774,\" as part of the criminal law of England and as a law of public order the principles of which and the reasons for which apply as well to the Province of Quebec as to England and the other provinces of the Dominion of Canada. Price v. Mercier (18 Can. S. C. R. 303) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal, by which the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, at the trial (Curran, J.) had been reversed and the plaintiffs' action maintained with costs.\nThe case is fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nBeaudin K.C. and Martin K.C. for the appellants. The contract sued upon is, on its face, champertous illegal and void under the laws of England prohibiting such contracts which laws became part of the criminal law of Quebec by force of the conquest and of \"The Quebec Act, 1774.\" Power v. Phelan ([2]) ; Hopkins v. Smith ([3]). Although in some special cases maintenance is now permitted, there is a distinction to be made when the transactions amount to champerty and are tainted with illegality as against the public policy. Bradlaugh v. Newdegate ([4]) ; Harris v. Brisco ([5]) ; Hutley v. Hutley ([6]) ; in re Cannon ([7]).\nThe respondents might not have been guilty of unlawful maintenace by simply paying out their money or giving security for the costs of the appeal, to enable their relatives to secure their rights. This is not what is charged. What made the contract illegal and champertous was bargaining for division of the spoils should the action in which respondents had no personal interest, prove successful. The appellants alone had an interest in these lands and were declared by the judgment of the Supreme Court to be the owners of the Dorval Islands ([8]).\nThis valuable property has buildings and other improvements upon it and the revenues ($3,250) claimed by the action are several times greater than the whole amount contributed by respondents in costs. Can it be urged that respondents' motive was only a desire to benefit the appellants, and not self-interest, when they stipulated for seventy-five per cent of this valuable property? They stipulated for a division of the field (campum partire) ; the lion's share for themselves. Their relationship does not prevent such a contract from being champertous. There is in Hutley v. Hutley ([9]) a full discussion of the question of collateral interest, Every contract or agreement into which champerty enters as a consideration is illegal and void and champerty is a good defence. Neither party can enforce it while it remains executory, but where it has been executed and money received in pursuance of it no action will lie to recover it 5 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law (2 ed.) p. 822 n. 3 ; Ritchot v. Cardinal ([10]) ; Dussault v. La Compagnie du Chemin de fer du Nord ([11]), and authorities there cited ; O'Connor v. Gemmill ([12]) ; Carr v. Tannahill ([13]); Brady v. Stewart ([14]) ; Cholmondeley v Clinton ([15]).\nIn order to render an agreement void on the ground that it is in the nature of champerty, it is not necessary that it should amount strictly to champerty as a punishable offence. Rees v. De Bernardy ([16]) ; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Birabin ([17]) ; arts. 889, 990, 1582, 1533 0. 0.\nThe appellants moreover are entitled to succeed on the plea invoking retrait successoral under the provisions of the Civil Code art. 710. The property in question was the only property which they acquired from the estate of their grandfather and they retained a fractional interest in the property under the alleged champertous agreement, and having such interest, they are entitled to invoke the provisions of article 710 C. C., and to exclude the respondents from participation in the division of this property. .Fuzier-Herman under article 841, C. N. nn 22-23-24-25-27-28-163-164-165-167-169; Baxter v. Phillips ([18]) ; 10 Laurent No, 857.\nThe contract does not give the right to exercise an action en partage. It contains no description of any immovable property, nor does it state that any immovable property or rights therein are conveyed. What the respondents sought to acquire under the agreement was an undivided interest in what came to appellants out of their lawsuit with the Simpsons and under that contract, even if valid, they acquired no proprietory rights to the immovables in dispute, nor can they exercise the action en partage in any event\u2014 their recourse, if any, being an action en reddition de compte.\nBeique K.C. and Robertson for the respondents. The defence of retrait litigieux was abandoned in the court below, and is clearly unfounded. Under article 1582 0. 0., such a defence is never open to any but the debtor of the litigious right (the Simpson estate), and not even to him when the right \" has been made clear by evidence and is ready for judgment,\" (Art. 1584 0. C. par. 4). When the agreement in question was entered into the right of the present appellants was apparent upon the record, it being merely necessary to apply the law to undisputed facts.\nThere is no retrait successoral. Art. 710 C. C. applies only to property which has devolved by succession. The appellants claim title by gift inter vivos. This gift divested the donor of the property, in his lifetime, and the first donee (whose succession appellants renounced) had only a life interest. Further, the retrait successoral is not open to the assignor but only to coheirs not parties to the assignment. 16 Demolombe, No. 48 ; 10 Laurent, Nos. 358, 386 388 ; 6 Aubry & Rau, p. 523, par. 621 ter. (text and note 27) : Dalloz, u Successions,\" No. 1860 ; Beaudry-Lacantinerie, 2 \" Successions No. 3386; 5 Huc, No. 330. Nor does it lie in respect of the assignment of specific property. 10 Laurent, No. 864 ; 16 Demolombe, No. 83 ; 2 Aubry & Rau, p. 567, note 15 ; Dalloz, 1870-1 422 ; Fuzier-Hermann, C. N., art. 841, Nos. 30, 32, 34.\nArt. 1025 C. C. removes all difficulty as to the form of the action. The subject matter of the contract was certainly a thing certain and determinate, being undivided shares of whatever might be awarded by the judgment in Meloche v. Simpson ([19]),which as the parties well knew could be nothing else than a lot of land in the Parish of Lachine. The mutual consent to alienate and acquire that lot, consequently, made the respondents owners and the ownership being undivided the action in partition lies.\nThe insufficiency of the description for purposes of registration is irrelevant. Registration does not affect rights of contracting parties inter Se. The only consequence of non-compliance with art. 2168 C. C. is that the registration does not affect the lands. Between the parties all that is necessary is that the thing be certain and determinate. Provided it be so, any description whatever will suffice\nThe plea of champerty is equally unfounded. The agreement sued upon was not opposed to but, on the contrary, was in furtherance of public policy. upon this point we refer to the dictum in Ram Coomar Coondoo v. Chunder Canto Mookerjee ([20]) at page 210. The claim against the Simpson estate was believed by both appellants and respondents to be just, and in fact was so. Although just it had been disallowed by the first two judgments, which, if allowed to stand, would have had the effect of oppressing appellants and as they had no sufficient means, apart from the property itself, they were compelled to ask for help to carry the case further. The agreement was not extortionate but fair.. There was no possibility of injuring or oppressing the adverse party, nor of misleading justice. The agreement was in aid of suitors who had a just title and no adequate means, apart from the property itself, whereby they could further prosecute their just claim, and being fair between the parties and not injurious or oppressive, was in furtherance of right and justice and necessary.\nThe judgment a quo must therefore be confirmed unless such an agreement is a criminal offence and there cannot be any pretence that it is forbidden by the civil law of the Province of Quebec where there is no such offence known as that of champerty under the laws of England. It was not specially introduced at the time of the conquest nor by any subsequent legislation. The English law was directed against evils of a local and political nature, has been long obsolete there and inapplicable to the altered state of society and property and it is unsuited to the special conditions of Quebec, inhabited by different races of people and where contracts are governed by local law.\nThe respondents are related to the appellants by consanguinity and by affinity, and a person who has no pecuniary interest in the result of a suit but is related to the suitor, may lawfully \"maintain\" such suit in a proper way. The legality or illegality of such a contract depends upon the circumstances of the individual case, the test being whether the contract viewed as a whole is consistent with justice and public policy. In this case the parties called upon to give assistance could lawfully maintain the suit taken by their relatives. Guy v. Churchill ([21]) ; Fischer v. Kamala Naicker ([22]) ; Dessault v. Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Nord ([23]) ; Hutley v. Hutley ([24]) ; Findon v. Parker ([25]) ; Harris y. Brisco ([26]) ; Bradlaugh v. Newdegate ([27]).\nThe purchase of litigious rights in Quebec has the sanction of the law except where certain specified persons become purchasers ; arts. 1484,1485,158215584 C. 0. The object of the champerty laws is the protection of the adverse party. The interests of the parties to the alleged champertous contract are not taken into account any further than in any other contract. In a contract of alleged champerty, the agreement to divide directly affects the contracting parties only, and only affects the adverse party indirectly by increasing the probability that the suit will be unlawfully maintained Therefore where unlawful maintenance is impossible, the agreement to divide does not affect the adverse party at all.\nThe authorities cited by appellants are neither in point nor binding upon this court. Hutley v. Hutley, already discussed, is favourable to respondents. In Power v. Phelan ([28]) the persons held to be champertors were perfect strangers to the persons whose rights they acquired and had no antecedent interest in their suit. In O'Connor v. Gemmill ([29]) the contract was made by a solicitor and in Quebec it would have been void under art. 1485 0. C. Brady v. Stuart ([30]) was not a case of champerty at all. We refer also to Attorney General v, Stewart ([31]) ; Mayor of Lyons v. East India Go. ([32]) ; and Jephson v. Riera ([33]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondents' action is one an p\u00e9titoire et en partage, claiming from the appellants the portions of certain property near Montreal which were ceded to them by the appellants, as they allege, by an agreement of the 19th of October, 1896, entered into between them by a notarial deed of that date under the following circumstances :\nThe appellants (defendants) were the plaintiffs in the case of Meloche v. Simpson, reported in this court at page 379, vol. 29. It appears from the evidence that after having been defeated twice in their action in that case (in the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal), the appellants were disheartened and had expressed their intention to give up the fight with Simpson and not to take any further appeal. Th\u00e9ophile Deguire (now one of the respondents) and one of the appellants co-plaintiffs in the action against Simpson, succeeded however in getting them to bring the case to the Supreme Court upon the respondents signing the agreement now sued upon. By that writing it is stipulated that the three appellants\nayant r\u00e9solu d'en appeler d'un certain jugement (viz. that rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench in the cause in question) ont sur la demande (of six of the respondents and of the mis-en-cause) c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 sans aucune garantie quelconque \u00e0 chacun de ces derniers, un dixi\u00e8me indivis de tout ce qu'il reviendra dans la dite poursuite an cas o\u00f9 ils obtiendraient jugement en leur faveur, c'est-\u00e0-dire que le jugement de la cour d'appel serait renvers\u00e9 par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir \u00e0 la cour supr\u00eame. The consideration was that each of the said transferees was to bear one-tenth of the costs and disbursements to be incurred by reason of the appeal, and that five of them should each be jointly and severally liable to the appellants for the payment of five-tenths of such costs and disbursements\nde plus C6s derniers seront tenus de contribuer aux d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qui pourront etre exig\u00e9s par leurs avocats.\nAlphonse Meloche by the same deed transferred one-half of his remaining one-tenth share to the respondent Lucien Deguire in consideration of the latter bearing the whole of his (Meloche's) share of the costs and disbursements. It was further agreed that if Antoine Meloche should be unable to contribute his share of the expenses, the other parties (except Alphonse Meloche) should bear it equally.\nThe respondent Th\u00e9ophile Deguire thereupon procured the required sureties and the appeal was taken resulting, as appears by the report, ubi supr\u00e2, in the reversal by this court of the judgment which had dismissed the appellants' action and the recovery against Simpson of the property in dispute. It is the performance of the aforesaid covenant entered into by the appellants that the respondents now ask by this action.\nTo the respondents' demand, the appellants pleaded, 1st. Champerty. 2ndly. A right to the retrat\u00e9 successoral under Art. 710 C. C. and the retrait de droits litigieux under Art. 1582 0. C. 3rdly. That as the agreement in question contained no description of the land ceded to the respondents their action as taken au p\u00e9titoire et en partage could not be maintained.\nThis last ground has not been given countenance to in any of the three courts through which this case has passed, and rightly so. Assuming that, as regards third parties, the description of the property ceded to respondents in the writing in question would not be sufficient in a case where the question of the respective rights of the parties came in conflict as to the ownership of the property, I do not see that, between the contracting parties themselves, there is the least room for any of them to doubt what was the property, or the undivided part thereof, that the appellents agreed to transfer to the respondents. Art. 1025 C. C. enacts that :\nA contract for the alienation of a thing certain and determinate makes the purchaser owner of the thing by the consent alone of the parties, although no delivery be made.\nAnd according to Art. 1087, when this obligation has been contracted under a suspensive condition, the, debtor is bound to deliver the thing which is the object of it, upon the fulfilment of the condition\u00bb Here upon the reversal by the Supreme Court of the judgement that had dismissed their action, the appellants were bound to fulfil the contract they had agreed to were it lawful. And this action is nothing but a demand by the respondents of the specific performance of that obligation. As to the partition, there is nothing objectionable in the respondents adding it to their conclusions an p\u00e9titoire. It could hardly be contended that the respondents were obliged to take two actions, first, one an p\u00e9titoire, and secondly, after succeeding an p\u00e9titoire, one en partage.\nAs to the plea of retrait de droits litigieux, the appellants do not reiterate their contentions in their factum and it might be taken as abandoned. Art. 1582 of the Code upon which it was based, has no application whatever. Assuming that it extends to anything else than to sales of debts and choses in action it is exclusively to the debtor, the party against whom the litigious right is claimed, that the right de retraire is given. Powell v. Watters ([34]). As to the retrait Successoral art. 710 of the Civil Code gives no right to it when the assignment or sale is as here of a specific share in an immoveable property. Baxter v. Phillips ([35]) ; Leclere v. Beaudry ([36]). Moreover as held in the Court of Review and. the Court of Appeal, there is no succession in controversy here. These courts add as another reason on this point against the appellants' contentions, that the assignor himself has not the right to the retrait successoral. It was, however, strenuously urged before us by counsel for the appellants that as they had retained a fractional interest in the property they are entitled to this right, citing 10 Laurent No. 357 and Fuzier Herman, C. C. under Art. 841 Nos. 22 et seq. 163 et seq. There would seem to be some foundation for their contention on this point. But assuming it to be well founded, the two first objections against the said plea cannot be got over.\nNow as to the appellants' plea of Champerty upon which the Superior Court (Curran J.) dismissed the respondents' action. The formal judgment of that court is as follows :\nConsidering that it appears on the face of the deed, upon which the present action is based, that the present plaintiffs undertook to furnish and become sureties for moneys to enable the said suit to be carried before the Supreme Court of Canada and that the considerations of such advances and surety were, that the lands and proceeds of revenues thereof should be divided in shares between the parties to said deed in the event of such anneal being? successful That such agreement was distinctly one of campum partire and being champertous was illegal and could not produce any civil effects, and cannot form the basis of an action at law for the enforcement of the provisions thereof.\nConsidering that in view of the champertous nature of such agreement, forming the basis of the present action, the same cannot be maintained, doth dismiss the present action as champertous with costs.\nThe Court of Review upon an appeal by the plaintiffs reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed the plea of champerty and granted the conclusions of the action for the following* reasons\nConsid\u00e9rant que ledit acte du 19 octobre 1896, n'est pas entach\u00e9 de champerty ; qu'il ne viole aucune loi d'ordre public ; qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti de part et d'autre de bonne foi et pour valeur et consideration licites entre membres d'une m\u00eame famille d\u00e9sireux de s'entr'aider de se prot\u00e9ger et de se r\u00e9unir dans le but de faire entrer dans le domaine familial un bien de famille venant de l'anc\u00eatre commun qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 ni dans un but de sp\u00e9culation malhonn\u00eate ni pour pers\u00e9cuter la partie adverse ni pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat injuste, mais qu'au contraire il n'a eu pour but et pour cons\u00e9quence que de faire reconna\u00eetre par la plus haute cour du pays des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 longtemps m\u00e9connus, gr\u00e2ce aux efforts r\u00e9unis et aux ressources combin\u00e9es des parties au dit acte, que sous l'empire du droit commun, tant criminel que civil de la Grande-Bretagne, tel qu'interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par la jurisprudence de cc royaume, un tel contrat n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme entach\u00e9 de vice et d\u00e9lit de champerty, qu'ainsi la dite premi\u00e8re d\u00e9fense des d\u00e9fendeurs aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au lieu d'\u00eatre maintenue, par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nUpon an appeal from that judgment by the defendants to the Court of King's Bench, the judgment of the Court of Review was affirmed. Hence the appeal to this Court by the same parties.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored. The judgment appealed from seems to have lost sight of the distinction between maintenance and champerty. That the contract in question is one by which the appellants agreed to cede to the respondents a part of the land in dispute between them and Simpson, in the event of their succeeding in recovering it from Simpson, upon condition that the respondents were to share with the appellants in the disbursements required for the appeal and pay seventenths of the costs of the appeal should it fail cannot be doubted. That is the agreement in unequivocal terms. Now this clearly was maintenance, striking out of it the stipulation of \u201c campum partire.\" Then, an agreement that if the suit in which the maintenance takes place succeeds the property in dispute shall be divided between the plaintiff and the maintainor, or in other words, to bargain with a plaintiff to pay the expenses of a suit wholly or in part on condition that the plaintiff will divide with the party who so shares in the expenses the land or other matter sued for, if successful in such suit, is undeniably champerty. Now it is as undeniable, I take it, that every contract into which champerty enters as a consideration is null and void, \u00e0 nullit\u00e9 d'ordre public and that an action founded upon such a contract cannot be maintained\nThe respondents contended that the interest they had in the suit against Simpson, remote as they had to admit it to be entitled them to the stipulation that they would \u201ccampum partir\u00e9 \" if the c campum \" was recovered. But that contention cannot prevail. That might have been sufficient to justify them in coming to the assistance of the appellants, without being guilty of maintenance, but did not entitle them to stipulate the \u201ccampum partir\u00e9 \" as the price of their assistance. Maintenance is lawful under certain circumstances but maintenance in consideration of an interest in the subject matter of the action to be maintained cannot receive the sanction of a court of justice. Any one for instance even not interested at all, may, if he acts only from philanthropic motives, lawfully give money to a poor man to enable him to carry on a suit ; but the stipulation on his part that if the poor man succeeds he will share in the proceeds is prohibited and illegal as champertous. The respondents here evidently did not think that their interest in the suit in question was alone large enough to induce them to share in the costs of the appeal. What prompted them was not the interest they would now invoke ; it was the expecation to \u201c \u201ccampum partire \" with the appellants. It was only upon the promise of getting seven-tenths of the field, if recovered, that they agreed to come to the appellants' rescue. Such an agreement cannot be enforced.\nIt was contended by the respondents at the argument as it had been in the courts below that champerty does not form part of the Criminal Law of the Province of Quebec as introduced therein by the Imperial .Act of 1774. I cannot treat that contention as a serious one. It has never been doubted anywhere that the law on this point is the same in that province as it is all over Canada, and the respondents have been obliged to concede that their contention was entirely a novel one. The valuable treatise on the criminal law of the province published as far back as 1842 by the learned Jacques Cr\u00e9mazie, includes maintenance and champerty as in force therein and the jurisprudence of the courts of the province is without a single exception in that sense. This court itself in Price v. Mercier ([37]) has considered that the law on the subject is the same in the Province of Quebec as in England. There are cases, no doubt, as argued by the respondents where it has been held that certain special civil and criminal laws of England did not extend to its subsequently acquired possessions. But the reasons upon which these decisions have been given have no more application to the Province of Quebec in relation to the law of champerty than they have to the rest of the Dominion The offence has always been considered as \" one against public justice, in that it tends to keep alive strife and contention,\" and the object of the law is to hinder the \" perverting\" of the remedial process of the law into an engine of oppression.\" It is a law of public order, the principles of which and the reasons for which, apply as well to Quebec as to England or the other parts of this Dominion.\nThe respondents seem to rely strongly on the fact that the appellants eventually succeeded (and this, they say, because of their assistance) in their suit against Simpson\u00bb But 1 fail to see that the result of the suit in any way justifies post hac what the law prohibited. They are asking to be rewarded for having committed a breach of the law instead of being made to suffer the consequences attached to that offence in the courts of civil law that is to say, the privation of the right to derive any benefit from their champertous contract. The respondents' contention on this point, if it prevailed, would lead to the result that when a plaintiff recovers, the champertous agreement was lawful and the champertor is entitled to the share covenanted for, but that it is only if the plaintiff fails in his action that the agreement to share with him was unlawful Or in other words that, where there is nothing to divide, the agreement to divide gives no right of action, but where there is something to divide, then the champertor would have an action. That cannot he so. The result of the case against Simpson does not affect the question.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action with costs in all the courts against the respondents.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting.)\u2014In this case I understand there is no difference of opinion amongst the members of this court as to the application to the Province of Quebec of the laws relating to Champerty and Maintenance. The majority of the court is however of the opinion that while the circumstances of the case and the relationship of the parties were such as might have justified the respondent in directly assisting the appellants in their lawsuit without incurring the penalties of maintenance, nevertheless the provision in the agreement for a division of the subject matter of the litigation amongst the parties renders the agreement a champertous one which the courts will not enforce.\nChamperty is defined to be a species of which maintenance is the genus. It is said to be a more odious \" form of maintenance'' but is only a form or species of that offence. The gist of the offence both in maintenance and champerty is that the intermeddling is unlawful \u00b0 that it is officious and in a suit which in no way belongs to the intermeddler, but it is the same in each the difference being only in the mode of compensation.\nAn interference or an intermeddling by a mere stranger which would amount to maintenance or champerty is excusable if it comes from persons who either have a real interest in the litigation maintained by them or who act in the bona fide belief that they have 5 A. & Eng. Enc. of Law, p. 819.\nIn this case the assistance given to the appellants in their lawsuit against the Simpson estate by the respondents would, it is conceded, have been perfectly legit\u00edmate but for the stipulation that the compensation they were to receive was to consist of part of the fruits of the litigation if successful. The parties were related to each other within the degrees of relationship which justify or excuse interference and assistance in the prosecution of litigation. They were either brothers-in-law or nephews of the plaintiff litigants, and their interest either through their wives or their mother in the subject matter of the litigation was a real interest and not an imaginary one. At any rate there cannot be any doubt, in my opinion, that they acted in a bon\u00e2 fids belief that they had such an interest. Apart from the amount of the share they were to receive if the litigation was successful, on which I express no opinion one way or the other, as the point was not argued, the agreement in the case so far from being an unlawful or officious intermeddling was a commendable interference. The agreement when viewed in the light of all the circumstances connected with the title to the lands being litigated and the relation of the Meloche family to these lands, was really a family arrangement. The sisters had a right to assume that under the power of appointment contained in the deed from their grandfather they would receive some substantial portion of the property and with this belief their interference and that of their husbands to assist in maintaining their brothers' claim to the property unless clearly contrary to law should be aided and not frustrated by the courts. I see nothing against good policy and justice, nothing tending to promote unnecessary litigation, nothing that could be called immoral or permeated with a bad motive either in the agreement to assist or in the stipulation that in the event of success the property gained should be divided amongst the family including the respondents.\nThe action had been already through two courts ; the highest court in the province had declared against the appellants' claim and it had either to be abandoned or carried to this court With the assistance of the pre-sent respondents it was so carried and was successful, and with their further assistance an application for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was successfully resisted. Having with the assistance of their sisters' husbands and their nephews successfully vindicated their rights to the property the appellants are now seeking the aid of the courts to repudiate their contract because it contains pro- visions for remunerating those who gave the necessary assistance, by assigning them a share in the property recovered.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Fischer v. Kamala Naicker ([38]), composed at the time as was said by Coleridge C. J. in the case of Bradlaugh v. Newdegate ([39]) of a\ncollection of perhaps as great lawyers as in the year 1860 could be brought together\nexpressed their opinion that the qualities attributed by English law to Champerty or Maintenance\nmust be something against good policy and justice : something tending to promote unnecessary litigation ; something that in a legal sense is immoral and to the constitution of which a bad motive in the same sense is necessary.\nThis definition of the law was entirely accepted as correct by the Lord Chief Justice in Bradlaugh's Case (2), and renders it therefore necessary in each case to look at the substance of the transaction.\nIn the case at bar, as I have already stated, I look upon the substance of the transaction namely the division of the fruits of the litigation, as a commendable family arrangement, the only point upon which I refrain from expressing any opinion being as to the fairness of the allotment of the shares a question not argued.\nIn Finden v. Parker ([40]) Abinger C. B. said :\nThe law of maintenance as I understand it upon the modern constructions is confined to cases where a man improperly and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife encourages others to bring actions or to make defences which they have no right to make.\nAnd in Bradlaugh v. Newdegate (2), Lord Coleridge C. J. speaking of the common interest in the result of litigation which would justify the interference and assistance of third persons, says at p. 11 :\nAs a general rule there is no doubt that such a common interest believed on reasonable grounds to exist will make justifiable that which would otherwise be maintenance.\nAnd after referring to this qualification \"upon the doctrine laid down in all the older authorities he goes on to say :\nBut then the instances they give show the sort of interest which is intended, a master for a servant, or a servant for a master ; an heir ; a brother ; a son-in-law ; a brother-in-law. &c.\nIn the case we are considering there is no doubt in my opinion, and I do not understand that in the judgment of this court there is any doubt that the relationship of the parties, their interest in the subject matter of the suit, and the peculiar circumstances of the case all fully justified the respondents in interfering and giving assurance to the present appellants in carrying on their former appeal. The sole ground upon which their agreement is to be declared void is because of the provision to divide the subject matter in litigation in case of success. The case of Hutley v. Hutley ([41]) is relied upon to support this conclusion. There are, it is true some strong observations in the reasons given by some of the learned judges in that case which can fairly be held to lend countenance to that contention, but they were mere obiter dicta and in no sense necessary for the decision of the case. In the subsequent case of Guy v. Churchill ([42]) Chitty J. reviews all the authorities and concludes that both maintenance and champerty are founded on the same principle or policy of law, namely, the tendency of the transactions to prevent the course of justice and concludes as follows:\nThe case of Hutley v. Hutley (1) forms no exception to what I have stated in reference to the parties having a common interest. The case was one of maintenance and champerty, and it was held that the existence of what was termed a collateral interest was not sufficient to justify the transaction. In that case these were two wills, and the plaintiff being himself interested under the first will, sought to enforce against the defendant, the heir and one of the next-of-kin, an agreement to assist the defendant in upsetting the second will on the terms of his giving the plaintiff an interest in the property which would pass to the defendant on an intestacy. The agreement was based on the assumption of the plaintiff having no interest, the first will being obviously treated as a nullity. I know of no case where, the actual interest of the parties being sufficient to justify maintenance, the transaction has been avoided merely because they agreed to divide the subject matter of the litigation among themselves in a manner not in accordance with their actual title.\nAfter a careful review of the authorities, and applying the rule to be deduced from them as I understand it to the facts of this case I have reached the conclusion that the agreement does not contravene the law of champerty as understood at the present day, and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Foster, Martin, Archibald & Mann.\nSolicitors for the respondents: B\u00e9ique, Turgeon, Robertson & Dessaulles.\n[1] Q.

J. and Sedgewick, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nMining plans and surveys\u2014Negligence of higher officials\u2014Duty of absent owners\u2014Operation of metalliferous mines\u2014Common law liability\u2014Employers liability Act\u2014R. S. B. C. ch. 69, s. 3.\nThe provisions of the third section of the \"Inspection of Metalliferous Mines Act, 1897,\" of British Columbia, do not impose upon an absent mine-owner the absolute duty of ascertaining that the plans for the working of the mine are accurate and sufficient and, unless the mine-owner is actually aware of inaccuracy or imperfections in such plans, he cannot be held responsible for the result of an accident occurring in consequence of the neglect of the proper officials to plat the plans up to date according to surveys. The defendant company acquired a mine which had been previously worked by another company and provided a proper system of surveys and operation and employed competent superintendents and surveyors for the efficient carrying out of their system. An accident occurred in consequence of neglect to plat the working plans according to surveys made up to date, the inaccurate plans misleading the superintendent so that he ordered works to be carried out without sufficient information as to the situation of openings made or taking the necessary precautions to secure the safety of the men in the working places. The engineers who had made the surveys and omitted platting the information on the plans had left the employ of the company prior to the engagement of the deceased who was killed in the accident.\nHeld, Taschereau C.J. contra, that the employers not being charged with knowledge of the neglect of their officers to carry out the efficient system provided for the operation of their mine, could not be held responsible for the consequences of failure to provide complete and accurate plans of the mine.\nHeld, also, that negligence of the superintendent would be negligence of a co\u2014employee of the person injured for which the employers would not be liable at common law, although there might be liability under the British Columbia \"Employers' Liability Act\" (R. S. B. C. ch. 69, sec. 3), for negligence on the part of the superintendent.\nJudgment appealed from reversed and a new trial ordered, Taschereau C.J. being of opinion that a judgment should be entered in favour of the plaintiffs.\nPer Taschereau C.J. An employee who has left the service of the common master cannot be regarded as a fellow workman of servants engaged subsequently.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in banco, affirming the judgment of the trial court which, upon the findings of the jury, directed judgment to be entered for the defendant and dismissed the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. Travers Lewis for the appellants. We cite the statutes of British Columbia, in point, and the decisions in Wilson v. Merry[1] ; Johnson v. Lindsay[2] ; Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[3] ; Swainson v. North Eastern Railway Co.[4] ; Charles v. Taylor[5] ; Wood v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6] ; Smith v. Baker & Sons[7] ; Choate v. Ontario Rolling Mill Co.[8]. The plaintiffs submit that the manager and mine superintendent were negligent as to the surveys and in failing to get accurate information before placing men to work in a dangerous situation. A case at common law has been made or, alternatively, under the Employers' Liability Act and there is evidence to justify a judg- ment for plaintiffs on the verdict. Again, if a judgment cannot be entered for plaintiffs, a new trial should be ordered for misdirection by the trial judge and mistrial.\nDavis K.C. for the respondents. There is no liability for the default of the mine officials in respecttothe plans. The accident was due to the negligence of the defendants' engineer and to that alone. The British Columbia Employers' Liability Act only applies to cases where personal injury is caused to a workman :\u2014(1) By reason of defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, intended for, or used in the business of the employer by reason of any defect in the construction of any stages, scaffolds, or other erections erected by or for the employer, or in the materials used in the construction thereof; or (2) By reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has any superintendence entrusted to him whilst in the exercise of such superintendence ; or (3) By reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer to whose orders or directions the workman at the time of the injury was bound to conform and did conform, where such injury resulted from his having so conformed ; or (4) By reason of the act or omission of any person in the service of the employer done or made in obedience to the rules or by-laws of the employer, or in obedience to particular instructions given by the employer or by any person delegated with the authority of the employer in that behalf; or (5) By reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has the charge or control of any signal, points, locomotive, engine, machine or train upon a railway, tramway or street railway.\nOf these, the second case is the only one that could possibly be suggested but it does not apply, inasmuch as the superintendence referred to, as is shewn by the English and Canadian authorities, and also by the interpretation clause of the Act itself (sec. 2, sub-sec. 1), is a superintendence over workmen, and the engineers were not persons exercising superintendence of that kind, nor indeed of any kind for that matter, and, moreover, neither of them is charged in the statement of claim with negligence in the exercise of any superintendence.\nAt common law, it is impossible for the plaintiff to recover inasmuch as the accident happened by reason of the negligence of a fellow-servant. The only duties cast upon an employer who does not personally superintend the work are to supply at the outset fit and proper premises, fit and proper appliances and machinery, a proper system and competent agents and officers. These things having been done the liability of the employer ceased. Wilson v. Merry[9] . Rajotte v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[10] ; Wood v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11] ; Rudd v. Bell[12] ; Matthews v. Hamilton Powder Co.[13] ; Howells v. Landore Steel Co.[14] ; Hedley v. Pinkney & Sons S. S. Co.[15].\nThe argument that the doctrine of common employment does not apply, because the so-called fellow-servants whose negligence caused the accident (that is, the engineers) were not in the defendants' employ at the time when the accident happened, or indeed while the person injured was working for the defendants, is of no force. That point is dealt with, though merely obiter, by Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[16] at page 332.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE :\u2014In this case the jury have found that the Company, acting without reasonable care and skill, have been the cause of the accident complained of by their failure to provide proper and accurate working plans of the shaft wherein the accident occured.\nThat there is ample evidence to support that verdict, which is conceded to be a finding of negligence at common law, is not denied by the court whose judgment in favour of the respondent, notwithstanding that verdict, is appealed from.\nThe ground upon which the court reached their conclusion against the action is that these plans were made either by one Stewart or one Turnbull who were competent employees and must be considered as fellow-workmen of the appellant, as the court holds, though they had ceased to be in the service of the company before the appellant entered their service, and had not been employed since.\nIn my opinion that view of the law on the subject, taken by the judgment appealed from, is erroneous.\nA fellow-servant in the common employment of a common master must be a co-worker, a collaborateur, and a collaborateur is one with whom a work is carried on, though it need not be in the same branch or department. An employee who has left the service of a company cannot be said to be a co-worker or a collaborateur of all its future employees. Yet, that is what the judgment appealed from necessarily imports. He has ceased to be a worker at all; therefore, he cannot, be a co-worker.\nIn entering its service, an employee impliedly covenants to take upon himself the risks of the negligence of those working with him, with whose habits, conduct and competence he may, in the course of his employment, become acquainted or hear of, and against whose carelessness, listlessness, bad habits or incompetency he has an opportunity to protect him- self as he may deem best. But he does not assume the consequences of all past negligent acts of his predecessors.\nThen under the finding of the jury and the evidence, the respondents have committed a breach of the common law obligation that they impliedly contracted towards the appellant when he entered their service, of providing the adequate materials and a reasonably safe place in which he was to work and a reasonably safe system for the carrying on of the works in which they agreed to employ him. I would not think the operating of a mine of this kind, without a plan, or with a defective and deceiving plan, which is worse, a reasonably safe system of carrying on the operations.\nAnd it is no defence to his claim for injuries received in the course of his employment, in consequence of their failure to fulfil such a positive duty, that the accident was the result of the negligence of some one else upon whom they relied for the performance of such duties that the law imposes upon them personally, whether they act, or have to act. in the matter through other persons or not.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and grant the appellants' motion for judgment on the verdict of the jury with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nNESBITT J.\u2014This action is brought under the Employers Liability Act, chapter 59 of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia (1897), and in the alternative at common law.\nIt is an action for damages resulting from the death of Charles Hosking which occurred on the 23rd day of August, in the metalliferous mine called the ' Josie,' at Rossland, B.C., owned and operated by the respondent company, it having acquired this property in July, 1901.\nThe deceased, with three others, was working in the bottom of the Josie shaft sinking it deeper, and was 565 feet directly below the point in the Josie shaft where the 300 foot level runs into the Josie shaft ; in the roof of this 300 foot level and directly under the Annie shaft (then not sunk down to the 300 foot level) were men working raising from the 300 foot level to the bottom of the Annie shaft.\nThe Annie shaft had been sunk by the respondents' predecessors in title and, as I read in the evidence, a certain amount of work had been done by the respondents ; but, however this is, it is quite plain that at the date of the accident the foot of the Annie shaft was about 141\/2 feet from the top of the level. I extract from the evidence of William Thompson, the general superintendent and general manager of the mine :\nQ. Now what was the distance between (producing exhibit 1) the foot of the Annie shaft and the top of the level marked on plan No. 1 as the 300 foot level ?\nA. Approximately about 14 1\/2 feet.\nQ. How many feet\u2014what would be the rock necessary to go through in making the upraise to connect with the Annie shaft ?\nA. About 12 feet.\nThompson, the general superintendent, gave Kenty, the mine superintendent, instructions to have the pumps repaired and put in this Annie shaft in order to pump water out which was in it while the work was proceeding in the up-raise from the 300 foot level ; and apparently Kenty gave these instructions to the machinist who was getting the pumps ready prepaatory to pumping in a proper manner. Thompson and Kenty thought that the bottom of the Annie shaft to which they were raising was about 75 feet above the roof of the 300 foot level and consequently supposed they would have plenty of time to pump the water out while the work in the upraise was being proceeded with. That the upraise was made to the extent of about 12 feet when the next blast allowed the water from the Annie shaft to escape into the 300 foot level along which it rushed and descended upon the deceased with great force, who was working at the bottom of the Josie shaft, killing him. The questions given to the jury and their answers read as follows :\n1. Q. Have the defen iants or their servants done anything which persons of ordinary care and skill under the circumstances would not have done, or have they or their servants omitted to do anything which persons of ordinary care and skill under the circumstances would have done ?\nA. Yes.\n2. Q. If yes, what was it ?\nA. Failure of the defendant company to provide proper and accurate working plans of the Annie shaft, showing the distance between the roof of the 300 foot level and the bottom of the Annie shaft.\n3. Q. Have the defendants or their servants by such act of commission or omission caused injury to the plaintiff?\nA. Yes.\n4. Q. If you find in answering the first question that the company or its servants was or were guilty of any act or omission, who was or were the persons, if any, who did such act or made such omission ?\nA. The defendant company.\n5. Q. Damages, if any ?\nA. Total $5,000, divided as follows : Elizabeth Jane Hosking (widow), $3,000 ; William John Hosking (son), $1,150 ; Stanley Hosking (son), $850.\nUpon this the trial judge, Mr. Justice Martin, gave judgment in favour of the defendants on the ground that the answers were answers solely referable to common law negligence, and that the negligence, if any, was the negligence of Turnbull in not properly platting the plan, and that this was negligence of a fellow employee.\nThis judgment was affirmed by the full Court of British Columbia. The system as to plans as it was adopted is described by Thompson as follows :\nQ. What method is usually adopted in large mines with respect to keeping track of work done in the mine ; that is, to keep track of levels, tunnels, winzes and all that sort of thing ?\nA. Usually, the employment of a competent engineer who is held responsible for the correctness of the work.\nQ. What are the duties of this competent engineer ?\nA. To make surveys ; make his notes and plat the results.\nQ. What was done in that regard in the Le Roi No. 2 from the time of the commencement of the work ?\nA. That was the method followed.\nThe previous owners had begun the sinking of the Annie shaft, and they had in their employ when they first began operations, a Mr. R. H. Stewart, then stated to be one of the best mine operators in the west, and he was succeeded by Mr. Turnbull (who is described as a competent man, a graduate of McGill University), and both of these gentlemen were subordinate and reported to Mr. Thompson. Their duties were to survey the mine and record the survey notes in books kept in the office for the purpose, and to plat and keep the plan up to date. At the time of the accident Mr. Thompson states that the notes were in existence in the office, and that these notes showed that the distance between the bottom of the Annie shaft and the top of the 300 foot level was 14 1\/2 feet. The survey engineers had neglected to plat these notes upon the plan and Mr. Thompson neglected to see that the vertical plan was up to date, and that his orders in that respect were complied with. He knew of the notes and that they were in existence, but he simply made a casual examination of an old report from which he gathered that there was a distance of 75 or more feet between the bottom of the Annie shaft and the 300 foot level, and so gave the negligent order to commence the upraise which I have described. On appeal to this court it was argued for the first time that there had been a breach of the Metalliferous and Mines Act of British Columbia (1897) ch. 27, s. 23, in this that no accurate plan had been kept in the office of the company. In my opinion an examination of the language in this section shows that this contention is not tenable. The provisions of that section, instead of imposing upon the mine-owner the absolute duty to have accurate and sufficient plans, seem rather to support the view that such is not the absolute duty of the mine-owner himself since he is not liable to the penalty if he can show ignorance of the imperfection or inaccuracy.\nThe company provided a proper system of surveying and plan making and employed men, apparently efficient, to carry out the system.\nAny inaccuracy or want of completeness in the plans would be due to the default of those so employed, of which an employer at a distance could not be expected to be aware. And it seems immaterial that there was a change of surveyor before the deceased came into the company's employ.\nBut even if there was negligence in the surveyor, the jury might well have found, also, negligence on the part of Thompson in not seeing that the system was properly carried out, as well as in giving the directions for the upraising, in the absence of accurate information respecting the Annie shaft, without having the water pumped out. This, at common law would be negligence of a co-employee for which the employer would not be responsible, but subsection (2) of section 3 of the \"Employers' Liability Act\" R. S. B. C. c. 69, imposes upon an employer responsibility for the negligence of any person who has any superintendence entrusted to him while in the exercise of such superintendence. And it is quite pos- sible to treat the answer of the jury to the 4th question as including the negligence of any person for whose acts or omissions the company is responsible.\nWhile the record of the case appears to justify the view of the court below, that the plaintiffs' case was directed mainly to establishing liability at common law, the learned judge who presided at the trial left it open to the jury to find for the plaintiffs under the Employers' Liability Act; and although the questions put to the jury did not distinctly point to any specific phase of the Act, the jury could have given answers clearly finding facts establishing liability under it. It does not appear that the plaintiffs have ever abandoned the alternative claim.\nAs there was not sufficient evidence to warrant judgment against the company upon the principles of the common law, and the damages assessed went beyond the limit allowed under the Employers' Liability Act, there could not well have been a judgment for the plaintiffs for any sum. But it appears to us that, as there was evidence warranting a verdict against the company under the statute, and as the findings of the jury do not negative the liability, the judgment should not stand.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs, and a new trial ordered, no costs of the appeal to the full court in British Columbia; costs of the former trial to abide the event.\nKILLAM J. concurred in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taylor and O'Shea.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.

He negotiated with a purchaser who was anxious to buy but wanted time to arrange for funds. D gave him time for which the purchaser agreed to pay $500. The sale was carried out and D. sued for his commission not having then received the $500.\nHeld reversing the judgment appealed from (14 Man. L. R. 233) that the consent of D. to accept the $500 was a breach of his duty as agent for the corporation which disentitled him from recovering the commission.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Manitoba ([1]), affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note and more fully in the judgment given on this appeal.\nAylesworth K.C. for the appellants. The plaintiff in obtaining a secret profit from the purchaser forfeited his commission. Andrew v. Ramsay & Co. ([2]); Clergue v. Murray ([3]).\nGeorge A. Elliott for the respondent cited Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Co. ([4]). The judgment of the court was delivered by\nNESBITT J.\u2014This is an action for the recovery of a commission for the sale of land. The defendants are a company incorporated in England for the purpose of holding and selling real estate in the Province of Manitoba, and one Fry was the manager at Winnipeg with full authority to make contracts with reference to the sale of the company\u2019s lands. It appears by the evidence that the plaintiff represented to Fry that he had been in St. Paul, in the United States, and in communication with parties for buying land in Canada, and contemplated going back there shortly to effect sales to them. Plaintiff says that on the 21st January, 1902, Fry reserved or set aside some eighteen thousand acres of land near Churchbridge giving the plaintiff the exclusive right to sell the land until the 6th February. This was necessary in order to enable plaintiff to see the parties he had in view and give them time to examine the land and make up their mind as to purchasing as otherwise they might have their trip from St. Paul to the lands and after inspection come back to Winnipeg to find them sold to some other parties. This was on a Tuesday. On Friday, 24th January, one Grant came to the company\u2019s office and wanted to buy some land and eventually purchased ten thou and acres and thereupon stated to Mr. Fry that he would like to secure the other eighteen thousand acres, but he was not then in a position to deal. Mr. Fry then informed him that he could not deal with him as he had reserved the eighteen thousand acres for Mr. Davidson to have the opportunity up to the 6th February to make sales to parties in St. Paul Grant inquired where Davidson was and Fry went to the telephone and found that he was in Winnipeg and had not gone to St. Paul, and stated to Grant that he would probably meet Davidson on the train going to St. Paul. On the evidence it was argued that this was in order to excite Grant to the belief that unless he closed at once the lots would be immediately put up to $4 per acre instead of $3.60, and as soon as the reservation to Davidson expired the instructions were to put up the price of the land to $4.00 per acre. On the following morning Davidson and Grant met in the Railway Securities Co\u2019s office and Fry, who happened into the room and immediately withdrew, stated that Davidson then informed him that the parties interested were the parties he had been in communication with in St. Paul, and gives this as a reason why he did not himself make the sale which was subsequently effected to Grant instead of stepping aside and allowing Davidson to take up the negotiations with Grant and complete the sale to Grant of the 18,000 acres. This is denied by Davidson, and the trial judge did not find that it was proven; and while the circumstances of the case would rather lead one to believe that Fry\u2019s conduct was otherwise unaccountable, I do not think it is necessary for the disposition of this appeal to deal with that phase of the question. Davidson stated that he ascertained in the Railway Securities office that Grant had already been buying real estate from Fry and that Grant wanted to buy 18,000 acres more; in fact he says \u2018I knew that he was very anxious to secure the 18,000 acres.\u2019 He says that Grant wanted time in which to make financial arrangements and to look over the lands, and Davidson then stated that he would not deal with any one else before the following Friday, 31st January, and what occurred is best said in Davidson\u2019s own language:\nQ. What did you get for giving him this time?\u2014A. From Mr. Grant?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. $200. I didn\u2019t get anything. Q. Which do you mean?\u2014A. You say what did I get?\nQ. Yes. You say you got $200?\u2014A. Yes. I didn\u2019t get anything.\nQ. You really mean you got a promise of $200?\u2014A. Put it in that way.\nQ. You asked for that $200 did you?\u2014A. Well I will give you the conversation if you wish.\nHis Lordship\u2014That will be the most satisfactory way.\nMr. Ewart\u2014What was it?\u2014A. When he spoke of the fact that they were not yet, or he was not yet, in a position to know definitely whether he could carry, it out or not, and requested a sufficient time in which to go south and complete his organization, I told him that that was cutting off a large portion of my time-limit on the option I had to sell these lands, and if at that time they did not purchase why I might possibly fail in carrying out my negotiations with other people, and lose my sale. It was cutting off part of my time, and for that reason I thought it was worth something.\nQ. The risk of losing a purchaser? A. The risk of granting that much of the time out of my time to negotiate with somebody else\u2019 And he said yes. He said yes it is, and he says I will just add $300 to that, and make it $500. I told him I thought it was worth $200. That was my suggestion, and he said, yes it is reasonable enough, I will just add $300 to that and make it $500. He said yes to my proposition of $200, that is reasonable enough; I will make it $300 more; that will make it $500 in all. He was very anxious to get the lands and secure them at that time.\nQ. What did you say to that ?\u2014A. I said well it is purely optional with you. If you wish to give me the $500 why it is all right.\nQ. Now you saw Mr. Fry the next day didn\u2019t you?\u2014\nMr. Wilson.\u2014The next day was Sunday.\nMr. Ewart.\u2014Did you see Mr. Fry the same day?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Where?\u2014A. At the office.\nQ. Did you tell him about this $200?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Thought better not?\u2014A. I did not consider the thing at all. I thought it was purely a matter between me and Mr. Grant.\nQ. You told him about giving Grant the time?\u2014A. Yes because he was interested in that feature of it.\nQ. But you think that he was not interested in the $200?\u2014A. No I could not see how he was.\nQ. You never told him anything at all about it until he found it out?\u2014A.\u055d I never told him, no.\nGrant bought the land and paid the price $3.60 per acre. Davidson did not ask for his commission at the time of the closing of the sale, and if he had Fry says that he would have paid it without demur. Fry was subsequently told by Mr. Grant about the $500 which had been referred to. I think that the non-receipt of the money makes no difference; the bargain was that he should get the money and it is that which would affect the mind of Davidson; he expected to get the money at the time and the question is: Does such a transaction as this disentitle him to the payment of his commission assuming that he is otherwise entitled to such a commission? I think the test is: Has the plaintiff by making such an undisclosed bargain in relation to his contract of service put himself in such a position that he has a temptation not faithfully to perform his duty to his employer? If he has, then the very consideration for the payment for his services is swept away. I think that the making of such a bargain necessarily put Davidson in a position where it was to his interest that Grant should become the purchaser, in which case he would receive not only the commission but $500 commission as a secret profit. It put him in a position where he was getting pay for the very time which the company were agreeing to pay him for while securing the purchaser, and his duty as agent was to get the highest price possible for his employer; and it is perfectly evident from his own statement that Grant was a person who was willing to pay at least $500 more for the property and probably a considerable advance on that. I cannot do better than quote the language of Lord Justice Cotton in Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Co. v. Ansell ([5]).\nIt is suggested that we should be laying down new rules of morality and equity if we were to so hold. In my opinion if people have got an idea that such transactions can be properly entered into by an agent, the sooner they are disabused of that idea the better. If a servant, or a managing director, or any person who is authorized to act, and is acting, for another in the matter of any contract, receives, as regards the contract, any sum, whether by way of percentage or other wise, from the person with whom he is dealing on behalf of his principal, he is committing a breach of duty. It is not an honest act, and, in my opinion, it is a sufficient act to show that he cannot be trusted to perform the duties which he has undertaken as servant or agent. He puts himself in such a position that he has a temptation not faithfully to perform his duty to his employer.\nAnd also in the same case Lord Justice Bowen says:\nNow, there can be no question that an agent employed by a principal or master to do business with another, who, unknown to that principal or master, takes from that other person a profit arising out of the business which he is employed to transact, is doing a wrongful act inconsistent with his duty towards his master, and the continuance of confidence between them. He does the wrongful act whether such profit be given to him in return for services which he actually performs for the third party, or whether it be given to him for his supposed influence, or whether it be given to him on any other ground at all; if it is a profit which arises out of the transaction it belongs to his master, and the agent or servant has no right to take it, or keep it, or bargain for it, or to receive it without bargain, unless his master knows it.\nAnd in a very recent case of Andrew v. Ramsay & Co. Lord Chief Justice Alverstone says:\nThis case turns on the broad principle that where a person was not entitled to say, \u201c I have been acting as your agent and doing the work you have employed me to do,\u201d he cannot recover the commission promised to him. I consider that a principal is entitled to have an honest agent and that only an honest agent is entitled to receive his commission. If it turned out that a man was not acting entirely as agent for his principal, but was directly or indirectly working for the other party to the contract, in such a way as possibly to sacrifice, in whole or in part, the interests of his principal, he is not entitled to his commission.\nI think that a person acting in a position of trust and confidence cannot too well understand that the above rules will be rigidly enforced.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in all courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: Bradshaw, Richards & Afleck.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George A.

[1897] c. 73, s. 10.\nIn an action by executors to recover money due from C. to the testator it was proved that the latter when ill in a hospital had sold a farm to C. and $1000 of the purchase money was deposited in a bank to testator\u2019s credit; that subsequently C. withdrew this money on an order from testator who died some weeks after when none was found on his person nor any record of its having been received by him. C. admitted having drawn out the money but swore that he had paid it over to testator but no other evidence of any kind was given of such payment.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that a prim\u00e2 facie case having been made out against C. and his evidence not having been corroborated as required by R.S.O. [1897] ch. 73, sec. 10, the executors were entitled to judgment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiffs the verdict for defendant at the trial having been set aside.\nThe action by the executors of J.D. Thewes was to recover money alleged to be retained by defendant under the circumstances mentioned in the above head-note. Though respondent\u2019s counsel on the appeal contended that there was not sufficient proof of defend- ant having drawn the money out of the bank, the only substantial question to be decided was as to whether or not he had paid it over to Thewes, as his evidence of such payment was an admission that he had received it and he had also admitted it in other ways.\nHodgins K.C. for the appellants. Coulter having admitted that he obtained the money from the bank, the onus is on him to shew that he paid it over and his own testimony to that effect must be corroborated Stoddart v. Stoddart[1]; In re Finch [2]; McKay v. McKay[3]; Tucker v. McMahon [4]; Rawlinson v. Scoles[5].\nAylesworth K.C. for the respondent. Plaintiffs only proved receipt of the money by defendant\u2019s admission and, if they take his evidence, they must accept it in full.\nThe conduct of Thewes in refraining from any inquiry about the money after he gave defendant the order is sufficient corroboration. Radford v. Mac Donald[6]; Green v. McLeod[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nKILLAM J.\u2014It was argued before as that there was not such evidence of the defendant\u2019s liability as to enable the plaintiffs to invoke the aid of the statute preventing the defendant from obtaining a verdict or decision in his favour upon his own uncorroborated evidence, but I am of opinion that there was.\nThe defendant\u2019s depositions admitted that he had withdrawn the money from the bank, though he stated that this had been done at the request of Thewes who had informed him that he wished to use it. There was no clear statement that he had paid it to Thewes His own subsequent conduct in setting up the payment to the bank, both in conversation with the plaintiff Thompson and in his correspondence with the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, without mentioning the withdrawal, and in failing to give any account or explanation when charged by the solicitor, over two months before action, with the withdrawal, was in my opinion clearly sufficient to enable the court to draw an inference against him.\nA prim\u00e2 facie case of liability for the money withdrawn was made out and the only direct evidence of its payment to Thewes was given by the defendant, who was not entitled to a decision in his favour without the corroboration which the statute requires.\nThe provision (R.S.O. [1897], c. 73, s. 10) is as follows:\nIn any action or proceeding by or against the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party to the action shall not obtain a verdict, judgment or decision therein, on his own evidence, in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.\nIn my opinion this enactment demands corroborative evidence of a material character supporting the case to be proved by such \u201copposite or interested party \u201d in order to entitle him to a \u201cverdict, judgment or decision.\u201d Unless it supports that case, it cannot properly be said to \u201ccorroborate.\u201d A mere scintilla is not sufficient. At the same time the corroborating evidence need not be sufficient in itself to establish the case.\nThe direct testimony of a second witness is unnecessary; the corroboration may be afforded by circumstances. McDonald v. McDonald[8].\nThe expressions used by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in In re Finch[9] appear to me applicable under this statute Jessel, M.R., there said, as I understand, corroboration is some testimony proving a material point in the testimony which is to be corroborated. It must not be testimony corroborating something else\u2014something not material.\nAnd Lindley L.J., said,\nevidence which is consistent with two views does not seem to me to be coroborative of either.\nIn the present case there does not seem to me to be any evidence which can properly be treated as corroborating the defendant on the only point on which the onus was upon him, that as to the payment of the money to Thewes.\nExcept for the defendant\u2019s Own testimony, all the evidence was consistent with the retention of the money by the defendant. The circumstances on which the Court of Appeal have relied as corroborative may possibly tend to make it seem improbable that the defendant took away and kept the money without Thewes\u2019 approval or consent, but they seem to me in no way inconsistent with the hypothesis that Thewes assented at the time to its retention by the defendant at his own request or for some purpose of Thewes.\nIn view of the course followed in this case, if anything had been presented on behalf of the defendant calculated to show that corroborative evidence could still be obtained, I think that he should have had a chance to produce it. This, however, has not been suggested, and I think that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Davis & Healy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.W.

(1900) c. 95 s. 17\u2014Procedure\u2014Charge to jury\u2014New trial.\nPersons engaged in the floating or transmission of logs down rivers and streams under the authority of R.S.N.S. (1900) ch. 95 sec. 17 are liable for all damage caused thereby whether by negligence or otherwise, and the owner of the logs is not relieved from liability because the damage was done while the logs were being transmitted by another person under contract with him.\nOne ground of a motion for a new trial was misdirection in the charge to the jury. The trial judge reported to the full court that he had not made the remarks claimed to be misdirection and stated what he actually did say.\nHeld, that this proceeding was not objectionable and moreover it was a matter to be dealt with by the court appealed from whose ruling was not open to review.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (36 N. S. Rep. 40) affirmed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] maintaining\" the judgment entered on a verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe plaintiffs are farmers residing and owning lands on the Stewiacke River, in the Municipality of Colchester, and the defendant is the owner of a mill lower down on the said river. The action was brought to recover damages from the defendant for injuries alleged to have been done to the plaintiffs' lands by logs of the defendant, on the drive in the Stewiacke River, floating on to the lands of the plaintiffs, and for injuries done to said lands in the removal of said logs.\nThe defendant by his pleadings denied specifically the acts alleged and set up that, in doing the several acts alleged, he was lawfully engaged in lumbering operations on the Stewiacke River, and that he was acting lawfully and did no damage,\u2014that, if any damage was done, it was the result of inevitable accident. He also justified his acts under the provisions of section 17 of chapter 95 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, and under regulations adopted by the municipal council for the Municipality of Colchester.\nSection 17, chapter 95, R. S. N. S., 1900, reads as follows:\u2014\n\"Persons engaged in the floating and transmission of saw-logs and timber of every kind, down rivers, lakes, creeks, and streams, shall be entitled to have the reasonable use of and access to the banks of such rivers, creeks and streams, during such floating or transmission, and for the purpose of enabling such saw logs and timber to be floated or transmitted, and shall also have the right to enter into and upon the banks of, and lands adjoining such rivers, streams or creeks for the purpose of taking therefrom any saw-logs or timber that have come upon such banks and lands during such floating or transmission, and they shall not be liable for any but actual damage done by the floating, transmission, or removal of such saw-logs and timber, nor for any discoloration or impurity of the water caused by the floating or transmission of such saw-logs or timber, nor for any discoloration or impurity of the water caused by the floating or transmission of such saw-logs or timber, unless the same is caused by their wilful act.\" On the findings of the jury, which are set out in the judgment of the court, a verdict was entered for plaintiffs for $135. Defendant moved the full court for a new trial which was refused and he then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHarris K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By section 17 of chap. 95 R. S. N. S. 1900, it is enacted that:\nPersons engaged in the floating and transmission of saw-logs and timber of every kind, down rivers, lakes, creeks and stream?, shall be entitled to have the reasonable use of and access to the banks of such rivers, creeks and streams, during such floating or transmission, and for the purpose of enabling such saw-logs and timber to be floated or transmitted, and shall also have the right to enter into and upon the banks of, and lands adjoining such rivers, streams or creeks for the purpose of taking therefrom any saw-logs or timber that have come upon such banks and lands during such floating or transmission, and they shall not be liable for any but actual damages done by the floating transmission or removal of such saw-logs and timber, nor for any discoloration or impurity of the water caused by the floating or transmission of such saw-logs or timber, unless the same is caused by their wilful act.\nThis action was brought by the respondents to recover damages from the appellant for damages caused to their lands, as they allege, in consequence of the appellant's doings in floating up and down the Stewiacke river logs belonging to the said appellant, and for damages done to respondents' lands by the removal of said logs.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Townshend with a jury.\nThe learned trial judge submitted certain questions to them, which they answered as follows:\n1. Did defendant's logs cause damage to the plaintiffs' lands by injuring and carrying away any portion of the banks of the river? Ans. They did.\nIf they did, what damages have plaintiffs suffered in consequence?\nAns. $100.\n2. Did defendant use reasonable care in having his logs brought down the river to prevent them causing injury to plaintiffs' lands on the river bank?\nAns. No.\n3. Did defendant use all proper care to keep his logs from going on the plaintiffs' lands?\nAns. No.\n4. Did defendant remove logs which went on plaintiffs' land with all reasonable expedition?\nAns. No.\n5. What damage was done to plaintiffs' land by the logs %\n(1.) In the month of April?\nAns. $15.\n(2.) In the month of May?\nAns. $20.\n(3.) In years previous to 1900?\nAns. No damages proven.\nUpon these findings judgment was subsequently entered in favour of the respondents for $1.35.\nThe appellant moved the court in banco to set aside the findings of the jury and for a new trial, but his motion was disallowed.\nHence the present appeal.\nThe first ground of the appellant's motion is on an alleged misdirection in the learned trial judge's charge to the jury. We disposed of that objection instanter at the hearing. It is based on a supposed charge by the learned judge, which he later reported to the full court not to have been made, sending at the same time the correct report of his charge. Now we do not see anything objectionable in this, as it appears on the record. Then this is a matter entirely within the province of the court appealed from, which cannot be reviewed by this court.\nAnother ground taken by the appellant is that damages were awarded against him for a period of five years and that during some portion of that time the conveyance and floating of these logs was not done by him but by contractors. That contention is, under the circumstances of this case, unfounded.\nThere are no doubt cases whereby it is held, and we may assume it to be the law as a general rule, that when any one employs an independent contractor to do a lawful work he is not responsible for damages caused by the collateral negligence of the contractor. But there is no question of negligence in this case. The statute imposes upon the appellant the liability to all the damages that follow his exercise of the right thereby given to him whether he exercised all the care and diligence possible to avoid such damages or not. He, it is in evidence, was aware of the risk that attended his operations, and was under the law bound to see that proper means were taken to prevent injurious consequences thereof, and could not discharge himself of that liability upon the shoulders of his contractors. It cannot be that any one who intends to carry on operations which, though lawful, are of a nature to cause damages for which the law makes him liable, could have it in his power to get rid of the risks of such damages and of his liability therefor by simply having the operations put into execution by a contractor.\nThere are a number of cases cited in the respondents' factum on this point to which I need not refer in detail. The following may be added to them: Maxwell v. British Thompson Houston Co.[2]; Hill v. Tottenham Urban Dist. Coun.[3]; Holliday v. The National Telephone Co.[4]; The Snark[5].\nAs to the ground of excess of damages, I do not believe it has been seriously taken. The jury under the evidence did not show great excess of generosity in allowing the respondents $135.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hugh Mackenzie.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.

The opposition was maintained and the city appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that there was nothing in controversy between the parties but the amount assessed on defendant's land and, that amount being less than $2,000, the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench. appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court ([1]) in favour of the defendants.\nThe company, together with other land owners, were taxed under a special assessment for municipal purposes in Montreal in the sum of $316888 and the sheriff was directed to lew for the amount of the assessment by the seizure and sale of certain of their lands. The total amount to be levied upon all the property affected by the special assessment roll for this tax exceeded $500000 and the value of the defendants' land seized, under the proceedings taken, exceeded $2,000.\nAn opposition to the seizure was filed by the company alleging that the city's claim was prescribed. This opposition was maintained by the Superior Court (Doherty J.) and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. The city then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nElliott, for the respondents, moved to quash the appeal, contending that the sum of $316888 only was in dispute and citing Gilbert v. Gilman ([2]) ; Dominion Salvage Co. v. Brown ([3]) ; Rodier v. Lapierre ([4]) ; Raphael v. Maclaren ([5]), and Macdonald v. Galivan ([6])\nAtwater K. C. contra. The validity of the whole assessment is involved in this appeal and future rights are bound by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench. See Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal ([7]); Turcotte v. Dansereau ([8]).\nThe judgement of the court was delivered by:.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE Motion to quash upon the ground that, under sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act the case is not appealable.\nThe proceedings in question originated under the enactments of sec. 396 et sea, of the charter of the City of Montreal, by a demand from the city, appellant calling upon the sheriff to seize in execution and sell certain of the respondents' lands upon which the city claimed the sum of $816888 for a special assessment thereon.\nThe total amount of the assessment roll upon all the properties affected thereby exceeds $50,000. The property seized by the sheriff at the appellants' said demand exceeds $2000 in value.\nThe respondents filed an opposition to the said seizure by which they alleged that the appellants' claim was prescribed, and could not be enforced, and asked that the sheriff's proceedings be therefore set aside.\nUpon issue joined, the Superior Court maintained the respondents' opposition, and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Kings Bench. The City have brought the present appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\nWe have no \"jurisdiction to entertain it. There has been and there is nothing more in controversy between the parties than a sum of $316. The whole amount of the roll is not in controversy. The roll itself is not controverted and the judgment in this case cannot affect in any way the other parties to it. The appellants invoke the rights of third parties or rather their own rights against third parties in support of their right to appeal, but those rights inter alios or contra alios cannot be looked at as a criterion of our jurisdiction., it is the amount in controversy between the parties to the record that governs in this case on the subject Flatt v. Ferland ([9]) ; Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Frets etc. ([10]) ; Gendron v. McDougall ([11]) as explained in Kinghorn v. Larue ([12]).

Judgment having been given against her by the Court of King's Bench, she sought an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld that the further payments to which she would have been entitled had she been successful in her suit were not \" future rights\"' which might be bound within the meaning of R. S. C, ch 135, sec. 29.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench. appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the plaintiff\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note, the only question between the parties being whether or not the plaintiff could enforce a decree obtained against her deceased husband for alimony against his executors and universal legatees, the annuity having been paid to her for several years and less than one year's payment being due when the suit was commenced. Lafleur K. C. for the respondents, moved to quash the appeal, citing La Banque du Peuple v Trottier ([1]) ; Rodier v. Lapierre ([2]) ; O' Dell v. Gregory ([3]) ; Raphael v. Maclaren ([4]).\nHibbard contra. If we succeed on this appeal we will be entitled to over $130 0 which is more than the Act requires to entitle us to an appeal. More over, future rights are bound by the judgment. See Donahue v. Donahue ([5]) Turcotte v. Dansereau ([6]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE : This is a motion by respondents to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe case is presented upon the following admitted facts\nIn June 1891 the late Thomas Davidson was condemned by a judgment of the Superior Court to pay to his wife, the present appellant, during her life time, an annuity of $1,500 in quarterly payments of $375. Davidson died in November 1901. The respondents are his universal legatees ; and the appellant claims the right to execute against them her said judgment against her late husband for the instalments of her annuity accrued since his death.\nA joint case to have her contentions judicially determined was agreed upon between the parties under secs. 509 et seq. of the Code of Procedure, and submitted to the Superior Court in February 1902. After hearing the parties, the Court, in October 1902,.upheld the appellant's contention, but the Court of King's Bench reversed that judgment and declared that the respondents were not liable for her said annuity. She now brings the present appeal from that judgment of the Court of King's Bench, The respondents move to quash it on two grounds : 1st. That no appeal lies from decisions or judgments rendered under the said sections of the Code of Procedure citing attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory ([7]) Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fleming ([8]) ; Union Colliery Jo. v. Attorney General of British Columbia ([9]). See also The City of Halifax v. Lithgow ([10]) :\u20142ndly. That, in this case, the amount originally demanded by the appellant from them, and then in controversy, was less than $2,000 and that therefore, the case is not appealable, though the amount for the instalments of the said annuity accrued since the date of the submission to the Superior Court would now exceed $2,000.\nThe motion to quash has to be allowed upon this last ground ; it is unnecessary, therefore, to pass upon the first ground.\nThe statute is clear that as to Quebec appeals when the right of appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute as in this case such amount must be understood to be the amount demanded and not the amount recovered and in controversy upon the appeal, if they are different It is not the amount involved that governs but the actual amount originally in controversy in the case between the parties\nSo that in a case where the amount originally demanded exceeded $2000 but where the amount recovered was but $100, as we had lately in the case of Coghlin v. La Fonderie de Joliette, ([11]) for instance, we have jurisdiction, though the amount in controversy on the appeal is but $100. And, a converso, in a case where the amount demanded was under $2000 but the amount in controversy on the appeal here is over that sum, say for accrued interest or, as in this case, for instalments accrued since the date of the action, the case is not appealable. In both cases it is the amount originally demauded that governs. Dufresne v. Guevremont ([12]); The Citizens' Light & Power Go. v. Parent ([13]).\nNow here, the pecuniarv amount of the appellant's claim at the date of the stated case or submission to the Superior Court, three months only after her husband's death Was less than $2,000 and the submission must be taken as an action of that date. Consequently, the amount originally demanded by her being less than $2,000, no appeal lies from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, though the amount of the instalments of her annuity accrued since her original demand now exceeds $2,000.\nThe appellant further contended at bar that her appeal lies on the ground that future rights are involved in the controversy, because, as argued in support of that contention, the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, irrespectively of amount, will in the future be res judicata against her claim. But the constant jurisprudence of the Court militates against that contention. An action claiming the right to an annuity is not appealable. In fact it is not the amount that is in controversy here. It is the abstract right to the annuity. The amount would be but the consequence of the judgment if the appellant succeeded in having her judgment against her late husband declared executory against the respondents. I refer to amongst others:\nChagnon v. Normand ([14]); Rodier v. Lapierre ([15]); O'Dell v. Gregory ([16]); Macdonald. Galivan ([17]); La Banque du Peuple v. Trottier ([18]); Talbot v. Guilmartin ([19]); Comp. Brown v. The Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Co. v. Brown ([20]); In re Marois ([21]).\nA case that is not appealable and a case appealable but not appealed from, are on the same footing as to res judicata. If the simple fact that a judgment is res judicata when any solvendum in futuro is affected by it, made it appealable, an appeal would lie in every such case even where the payments in future would amount to less than $2000. But that is not so where as in this case the amount in controversy, the debitum in pressenti is the criterion of our jurisdiction. And where rights in future are involved in support of the right of appeal they must not be. under the authorities above quoted, merely personal rights as the appellant's here. clearly are.\nThe motion to quash must be allowed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The defendants claimed that this line should be a line along bed-rock established where bed-rock rose three feet above the lowest general level of the opposite gulch.\nThe reasons for judgment of the trial judge established the defendants' claim and the judgment as drawn up contained the following paragraph:\n\"And it is also adjudged and declared, that the side boundaries of said defendants' gulch-claims, as against the plaintiffs, are lines three feet higher than the lowest general level of the gulch existing on the surface of said claims at the time of plaintiffs' staking.\" The application was to correct the certificate of judgment so that the date thereof might read the 5th day of August, 1901, instead of the 26th day of August, 1901, and by inserting the words \" along bed-rock \" between the words \" lines \" and \" three,\" in the above clause of said certificate\nAfter this judgment was entered, one Berry bought into the plaintiffs claim knowing, as he admitted at the trial, of the alleged defect in the judgment and wishing to take advantage of it. The Territorial Court refused the amendment as Berry was not before them. The plaintiffs appealed.\nJ. Travers Lewis for the appellants. As to the power of the court to amend, see Wilding. Sanderson ([1]); Norris v. Lord Dudley Stuart ([2]).\nBerry was not a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser and the amend\u00adment may be made in his absence. See In re Swire ([3]) Halton v. Harris ([4]); Stewart v. Rhodes. ([5]).\nRussell K.C. and Haydon for the respondents. This is purely a question of procedure with which this court will not interfere. Toronto Railway Go. v. Balfour ([6]); Attorney General of Ontario v. Scully. ([7]).\nMoreover, it was a matter for the exercise of dis\u00adcretion by the Territorial Court. Ryan v. Fish ([8]).\nThe amendment cannot be made in the absence of Berry. Hatton v. Harris ([9]); Gorton v. Hall ([10]).\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal (assuming that we have jurisdiction to entertain it), on the ground that a motion, like this one, to a court asking that court to vary, add to, or alter its judgment as entered so as to make it determine what the court intended to determine is particularly within the province of that court, and its ruling on such a motion should not be interfered with. I refrain from adding any other remark, as Berry is not a party to this record i and his contentions cannot be passed upon in his absence.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014In this case, involving a point of local practice, we feel that we cannot interfere, especially as that part of the judgment sought to be rectified cannot cause any injury to the appellants. By that judgment the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory has found that the appellants' claim was \"a gulch\" within the meaning of the regulations governing placer mining in the provisional district of the Yukon, approved by Order in Council of 18th January, 1898. Regulation 10 defines the nature, size and boundaries of such a gulch claim, which cannot be ignored by the court or the parties. There was not in our view any necessity for the motion to amend and it follows that third parties could not set up any claim involving a different interpretation in this case from that which would be applied as between the parties themselves, nor attempt to take possession of an area which, as the court below determined, was to be fixed by clause 10 of regulations. The appeal is dismissed, but under the special circumstances of the case and as the respondents opposed the motion to rectify and occasioned unnecessary costs, it is dismissed without costs in this court and in the court appealed from. Good faith demands such a conclusion even as to costs in the court below.\nSedgewick Nesbitt and Killam JJ. concurred for the reasons stated by Girouard J.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Woodworth & Black.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Herbert E.

The Attorney General for Quebec was permitted to intervene and take up the fait et cause of the plaintiffs without being formally summoned in warranty. The judgment appealed from was pronounced on the 25th of September, 1903. Notice of appeal on behalf of both the plaintiff and the intervenant was given on 3rd November and notice that securities would be put in no 10th November, 1903, on which latter date, the parties were heard on the applications for leave to appeal and for approval of securities before W\u00fcrt\u00e9le J. who reserved his decision until one day after the expiration of the sixty days immediately following the date of the judgment appealed from and, on the 25th of November, 1903, granted leave for the appeals and approved the securities filed\nHeld, that the appellants could not be prejudiced by the delay of the judge, in deciding upon the application, until after the expiration of the sixty days allowed for bringing the appeals and, following Couture v. Bouchard (21 Can. S. C. R. 281) that the judgment approving the securities and granting leave for the appeals must be treated as if it had been rendered within the time limited for appealing when the applications were made and taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nHeld also, that as the controversy between the parties related to a title to real estate both appeals would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada notwithstanding the fact that the liability of the intervenant might be merely for the reimbursement of a sum less than $2000.\nMOTION to quash appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, rendered on the 25th of September, 1903, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Ottawa, Curran J. ([1]), which dismissed the plaintiff's action and the intervention therein, with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are fully stated in the Superior Court judgment (1), and. summarized in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard which is now reported.\nAyien K.C. for the motion.\nBelcourt K.C contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal for two reasons : First, because the security was not put in within sixty days after the rendering of the judgment appealed from and; Secondly, because the judgment does not come within the provisions of the Supreme Court Act.\nAs to the first point, it is sufficient to say that notice of security was given on the 3rd November, 1903, to be put in on the 10th. Parties appeared on that day, but after hearing them, the judge took the application en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 till the 25th November, that is one day after the sixty days, when the security was allowed. We have already held in a case like this that parties cannot be prejudiced by the delay of the court in rendering judgment which should be treated as having been given on the day that the case was taken en deliber\u00e9 Couture v Bouchard ([2]). As to the second point we are also against the respondents. An action in the nature of a petitory action was taken against respondents claiming, under a grant from the Quebec Government of the 2nd April, 1902 a certain bed of a creek known as Brigham's or Brewery creek, in the City of Hull. The Attorney General of Quebec was allowed to intervene in the case and to take fait et cause for the City of Hull the plaintiffs, and thereby became plaintiff in the case without waiting till he was called in warranty.\nThe City of Hull has appealed and the respondents admit that this appeal exists but contend that the Attorney General has no such appeal. The authorities quoted by them have no application. There is nothing in dispute in this case between the Government and the respondents but a title to land. The fact that this land may possibly remain in the hands of the respondents which would render the Quebec Government liable only for the reimbursement of the purchase money namely, $1,000, and probably interest, is of no consequence, for this is not the point in dispute between the parties. The sole point in issue is the title to the bed of the creek. The motion therefore, is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General for Quebec, appellant: L. J. Cannon.\nSolicitors for the City of Hull, appellant: Foran & Champagne.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aylen & Duclos.\n[1] Q. R. 24 S. C. 59.\n[2] 21 Can. S. C R. 281\n"

The Queen v. Grenier, (30 Can. S. C. R. 42.;) followed.\nGirouard J. dissented on the ground that the negligence found by the ury was negligence of both the company and its employees.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal ([2]) in favour of the plaintiff, on the finding of the jury at the trial Actions were brought by the plaintiff, personally and as tutrix of her minor children, for damages sustained through the death of Richard Ramsden, her husband and the father of her children, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants. Deceased had been employed by the railway company, defendants, for a number of years and was killed while engaged in the performance of his duties as conductor of one of the company's freight trains at St. Henri Junction near Montreal. The causes were consolidated upon motion and tried before Doherty J. with a jury. The jury answered the questions submitted to them, and assessed the plaintiff's personal damages at $6000 and those of the children at $4,000.\nThe accident which resulted in Ramsden's death was caused by a local passenger train of the company failing to stop when the semaphore was against it and coming in collision with the rear of the freight train which was standing on the tracks.\nThe questions submitted to the jury and their answers so far as the issues on this appeal are concerned were as follows '.\u2014\n\"2 Was the death of the said late Richard Ramsden caused,\u2014\n\"(A.)\u2014By the fault of the company defendant and its employees ?\u2014Yes.\n\"(a.) In running the Lachine train which struck the train upon which the said Richard Ramsden was employed, at a highly imprudent and dangerous speed when approaching the train-yard and switch, where the train which was struck was standing ?\u2014\u2014No.\n\"(b.) In running the locomotive of the said Lachine train with the tender in front ?\u2014No.\n\"(c.) In displaying no head light upon the said loco motive ? No. \"(d.) In allowing the coal in the tender of the said. locomotive to be piled so high that the engine driver could not obtain an unobstructed view of the line in front of him ? Contributed to some extent.\n\" (e.) In approaching the distant semaphore inside of which Richard Ramsden's train was standing at a high rate of speed ?\u2014No,\n\" (f.) In neglecting to stop the said Lachine train before reaching said semaphore ?\u2014Yes.\n\" (g.) In allowing the locomotive of the said Lachine train to be used while in an unsafe and dangerous condition ?\u2014Yes.\n\"(h. ) In the fact of the sand-valves used in connection with the brakes of the said locomotive being out of order and useless ?\u2014Yes.\n\" (i) In failing to repair the defects in the said locomotive after the defects had been specially brought to the notice of the said company ?\u2014Yes.\n\" (J.) In not whistling and giving no warning whatever of the approach of the said Lachine train ?\u2014 No.\n\" Or,\u2014\n\" (B.)\u2014By the fault of the said Richard Ramsden:\u2014\n\" In failing to protect his train under and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the company defendant ? No.\n\" 3. Were the said rules and regulations well known to the said late Richard Ramsden and had his attention been specially directed thereto immediately before the accident ? Yes.\n\" 4. If not the determining cause of the accident, did said failure of said Richard Ramsden contribute to bring about said accident ?\u2014No.\n\"5. Was the said Richard Ramsden from the 30th of May 1885 up to the time of his death a member of the G. T. R. Insurance and Provident Society having made and signed the application for membership in the said society defendant's exhibit No. 3 on or about the 20th of April 1885 and received the certificate of membership defendant's exhibit No. 4 on the 30th of May, 1885 ?\u2014Yes.\n\" 6. Did defendant annually contribute a proportion, and what proportion, to the fund and society aforesaid?\u2014Yes. From 1885 to 1888 inclusive, $10,000; after 1888, $12,500 per annum, and for additional services contributed by company $10,000 to $15,000, as per evidence.\n\" 7 Is defendant's exhibit No 2. a true copy of the rules and regulations and by-laws of said society in force at the time of the death of the said Richard Ramsden and during the whole period of his employment by d\u00e9fendant?\u2014Yes,\"\nThe trial judge reserved the case for the consideration of the Court of Review and stated that :\u2014\n\"By their answers to questions 5, 6 and 7, the jury found that the late Richard Ramsden was at the time of his death a member of the G.T.R. Insurance and Provident Society, that defendant annually contributed to the said fund and society and that defendant's exhibit No 2 is a true copy of the rules and regulations of said Society.\n\" By the last-mentioned answers, the jury find substantially the facts alleged in defendant's second plea to have been established. By interlocutory judgment rendered on the 5th March, 1900, dismissing an inscription in law of plaintiff, said plea was declared well founded in law and if established by the evidence, a good answer to plaintiffs action.\n\" Under these circumstance, and in view of the importance of the question of law raised by said plea, to wit, as to the binding effect upon plaintiff \u00e9s nom et qualit\u00e9, of by-law No. 15 of the said society, which reads as follows '.\u2014' In consideration of the subscription of the Grand. Trunk Railway Company to the society, no member thereof or his representatives shall have any claim against the company for compensation on account of injury or death from accident,' as relieving the company, defendant, from all liability in consequence of the death of said late Richard Ramsden, and whether the amount contributed to the said society by defendant, as found by the jury, constitutes its proper proportionate contribution as required by law, and of the fact that the questions of the effect of said by-law, and in what proportion, if any, the company defendant is by law, in order to claim the benefit thereof bound to contribute to said society, are already under advisement before the Superior Court, sitting in Review, in this district, in a cause of Ferguson v. The Company, ([3]) defendant, I have reserved the case for the consideration of the Court of Review.\"\nIn the Court of Review the plaintiff moved for judgment for the damages assessed by the jury, and the defendants moved, on the findings, for dismissal of the action. The court dismissed the motion for dismissal and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff, personally and \u00e9s qualit\u00e9, with costs as of one action only ([4]). By the judgment appealed from ([5]) the judgment of the Court of Review was affirmed.\nLafleur K.C. and Beckett for the appellants. The jurisprudence settled by the case of The Queen v. Grenier ([6]) deprives the plaintiff of any right of action whatsoever against the said defendants. A workman may so contract with his employer, as to exonerate the latter from liability for negligence, and such renunciation is an answer to an action by his widow and her infant children to recover compensation in the event of his death. The Court of Review, at Montreal, in Ferguson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co, ([7]), and the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Holden v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([8]), applied the rule laid down in The (Queen v. Grenier (3) to the same by-law of the Grand Trunk Railway Insurance and Provident Society. The decision in Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([9]), merely related to the plea of prescription, but did not declare that indemnity could not be secured by special contract. In this case the by-law and regulations made for valuable consideration constitute a binding contract for indemnity against any action under arts. 1053 and 1056 C.C.\nThere is no finding by the jury that the company failed to provide the best known appliances for applying the brakes to the wheels as specified by sec. 243 of the Railway Act, 1888. They are silent on that point. The finding as to the defective sand-valves has nothing to do with the requirements of that section. The sand-valves do not form part of any a apparatus or arrangements \" for applying brakes to the wheels in any way whatever. This is not the kind of negligence contemplated by that section. Then if they were defective, it was the duty of the employees to have put these sand-valves in order upon notice given at the repair-shops. This is not a case where negligence can be attributed to the company as distinct from its employees and there is no prohibition against making a contract to relieve them from liability in such case.\nK. C. Smith K.C. and Montgomery for the respondent The provisions of art. 1056 C.C. are laws of public order and cannot be contravened or set aside by a private agreement ; art. 13 C. 0.\nThe society referred to is a continuation of the Grand Trunk Railway Superannuation and Provident Fund established by the Act of 37 Vict. ch. 65 in 1874. The portions of that Act relating to the fund are the preamble and sections 11 12 13 and 14. In 1878 by 41 Vict. ch. 25 sec. 2, et seq., the company was authorized to make, either separately or in connection with the Superannuation and Provident Fund, provision for insurance against accident to its employees, including insurance in case of death. Sec. 3 provides that the company shall contribute to such fund annually any amount not exceeding one hundred and fifty per cent of the amount which may be subscribed annually to such fund by the members thereof. By sec. 4. the provisions of the Act of 1874 are made applicable to the fund created by the Act of 1878. The Great Western Superannuation and Provident Fund Act of 1880 established a similar fund for the Great Western Railway, and in 1884, by 47 Vict. ch. 52, sec. 17, the provisions of the Acts of 1874 and 1878 are made applicable to the whole Grand Trunk system. A similar provision is found in the Act of 1888,51 Vict. CD. 58, par. 9. In none of these Acts is the slightest suggestion to be found of any such provision as is contained in bylaw 15 ; therefore this by-law is ultra vires and in excess of any powers, expressly or implied conferred upon the management. It is unreasonable and contravenes the civil laws of Quebec. See sec. 288 of the Railway Act, 1888, and arts. 13, 1053, 1056 C. C ; Roach v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([10]).\nIt is invalid as a contract, as appellants were not parties to it and no consideration was given. When the fund was formed, the appellants were ordered to contribute to it not less than one-half nor more than three-halves of the amount contributed by the employees. \"When subsequently they were authorized to make, either separately or in connection with the fund, provision for insurance against accident or death, they were authorized to contribute not more than 150 per cent of the amount contributed by the employees, but no minimum was fixed. They elected to make this provision for insurance in connection with the fund, and the amalgamated funds were thereafter known under their present name, viz., \" The 0-rand Trunk Insurance and Provident Society,\" so that since that time the appellants have been continually under a statutory duty to contribute to the funds of the society an amount representing at least one-half of the amount contributed by the employees to the superannuation and provident branch of the society, in addition to the contribution to the insurance fund.\nIt appears that the contribution of the appellants has been made generally without any distinction as to the different branches There is nothing to shew that this contribution would be even sufficient to cover the amount which the company is bound by law to contribute to the provident fund of the society ; on the contrary the contribution has not been increased since 1888, although great increases have been made, both in their system and in their number of employees since that time. The defence rests entirely upon this contribution, and the burden of proof was upon them to shew that they had at least contributed their proper proportion in order to bring the by-law into effect, which they have failed to do. The by-law creates an exception to the law and the evidence of the fulfillment of the conditions must be strictly scrutinized. The rules and. regulations submitted to Parliament provided for an entirely distinct consideration for the contribution of the company, vide, Rule 66 :\u2014\" The Grand Trunk Railway Company will, each half year, contribute, out of the revenues of the company, a sum in aid of the sick benefits and allowances of the Society and in consideration thereof these rules and all alterations which may be made in them shall be subject to the approval of the directors of the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\" From the absence of any such evidence, only one inference can be drawn, that is, that absolutely no new consideration was given. A contribution already ordered by statute to be subscribed could not form the consideration for an agreement with individual members. As a contract it is void abinitio for lack of a consideration. Such an agreement is contrary to public order, art. 13 C. C. ; because it permits the appellant to contract itself, by anticipation, out of the consequences of its own gross negligence and not merely that of its employees. As regards gross or personal negligence, the French law from which we derive our doctrine is clear and indisputable.

C. is not a representative one. That article is not merely an embodiment of Lord Campbell's Act but differs from it in several very material respects. The clause \" without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction,'' is added * the clause as to the right of action in the case of a duel is also added Tinder the civil law and under the French law the right of action of the relatives has always been distinct from that of deceased. Sourdat, vol. 1., Nos. 55 and 56. The same might be said of the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec at least up to the time of the ruling in the Grenier Case ([16]) See Ruest v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([17]) The point has been clearly decided in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific. Railway Co. ([18]). While it is true that the Judicial Committee had only to deal with the question of prescription, they laid down in the clearest possible terms the following principles :\u2014(1.) That the action given by art. 1056 C. C. is not merely an embodiment in the Civil Code of Lord Campbell's Act but that it differs substantially from it in its provisions ; (2.) That this right of action given to the persons mentioned in art. 1056 C. C. is an independent and not a representative right ; (3.) That the right of action given to the persons mentioned in that article is not barred by any conditions affecting the personal claim of the deceased other than those specified in the article viz. :\u2014(a) that the death was caused by the defendant * (b) that the deceased had not obtained indemnity or satisfaction Vide remarks of Lord Watson at p. 4877 of the report. The English decision in Griffiths v. Earl Dudley ([19]), on which, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Grenier Case ([20]) relies, was cited by counsel for respondent before the Judicial Committee. but was evidently regarded as inapplicable to our law, as it was distinctly overruled.\nThe indemnity or satisfaction referred to in art. 1056 C. C. must have been obtained by the person injured between the date of injury and the date of death. S.V. 74, 2, 285.\nEven if valid, the by-law does not exclude or affect the action of the wife personally. The by-law reads :\u2014\nIn consideration of the subscription no member thereof nor his representatives shall have any claim, etc.\" The respondents are not the representatives of the deceased, they did not succeed to his rights nor have the children even accepted his succession. The provision is an exceptional one derogating from the civil law, and must be interpreted with the greatest possible strictness\u2014exception est strictissimce interpretationis. The appellants are, moreover, the stipulating parties and, if any ambiguity exists as to the meaning of the word \" representatives,\" it must be interpreted against them. Art. 1019 C. C.\nEven if such a by-law could create an agreement barring any claim and binding not only upon the deceased, but also upon his widow and children, it must be disregarded in the present case, since the accident was the result of the company's failure to use the best appliances for stopping the train which brought about the collision. 51 Vict. CD. 29. sec. 243. The defective brakes and sand-valves were responsible for bringing about the accident, and it is to this cause that the jury attributed the accident in their verdict. The engine had originally been equipped with steam-brakes, but air-brakes had been substituted, the old cylinders, however, being retained. Consequently, the air-cylinders were in a leaky condition and incapable of exerting a sufficient pressure to apply the brakes properly. Furthermore, the sand-valves were not of an approved type and were continually clogged up so completely as to prevent any sand being thrown upon the rail for the purpose of bringing about a quick stop. Both of these defects had been frequently brought to the notice of the company but they had not been remedied.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The Court of Review's first considerant grounded upon section 243 of The Dominion Railwav Act of 1888 was sufficient by itself alone to solve the controversy between the parties and to support the court's judgment in favour of the respondent. And, had I been able to come to the same conclusion upon that point I would have refrained from considering the other questions raised in the case, the solution of which would then have been quite unnecessary for the determination of the appeal.\nBut I am unable to see that the sand-valves are or form part of\napparatus and arrangements as best afford means of applying by the power of the steam-engine or otherwise the brakes to the wheels of the locomotive or tender, or both, or of all or any cars or carriages comprising the trains,\nso as to bring the case under that section.\nI therefore have to consider the other points involved in the appeal.\nThe first one, as to the legality of the stipulation by the company that they would not be responsible for injuries or death resulting from accidents, is concluded by our decision in Glengoil v. Pilkington ([21]), and The Queen v. Grenier ([22]). The accident in question must necessarily have been caused by the carelessness or negligence of some of the employees of the company, assuming that would make a difference. The jury it is true found that the accident was caused by the fault of the company and their employees. But I take it that in doing so they merely assumed that the company were responsible for the acts and omissions of their employees. That is why as one of the causes of the accident they found \u201cin neglecting to stop the said train before reaching said semaphore.\" Had they intended to find as a fact that the company, otherwise than through their employees, were the cause of the accident, there would be no evidence to support such a finding.. The negligence of Broadhurst, the engineer of the train in question, is clearly the proximate cause of it. He knew the defects of his engine hut failed to act accordingly. Then, what the company really did was to limit their liability, not to stipulate non-liability. They admitted it, even in cases where in law their employee would have no claim against them by stipulating that the amount of the insurance would cover all the damages that he might suffer in case of accident even if that accident was due to his own fault or negligence. So that it is not merely the amount of insurance that the deceased agreed to accept as indemnity and satisfaction for any injury he might sustain in cases where the act of the company would have been the cause of the accident, but also, as part of that indemnity or satisfaction, the insurance against his own acts of negligence, where he would have had no claim at law against the company. The wife in such a case is entitled to the insurance even if her husband was exclusively the cause of his own death. The other material point argued before us presents some difficulty, as I view it.\nHas the deceased ever received indemnity or satisfaction for the injury in question in the sense to be given to those words in art. 1056 C. C. ? If so by the ratio decidendi and the opinion delivered by their Lord-ships of the Privy Council in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([23]), the respondent's action fails. It is no doubt singular that anyone can receive indemnity or satisfaction so as to bar an action which belongs to another. But that is the state of the law.\nHere, were I unfettered by authority I would be inclined to doubt if the deceased can be said to have received any indemnity or satisfaction, but I am bound by the authority of The Queen v. Grenier, ([24]) to hold that he has. The word renunciation used by the learned Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of the court in that case means nothing else, it is clear,. than release in consideration of the indemnity or satisfaction that an employee under such circumstances agrees to have received in lieu of any further claim against the company in the case of his meeting any injury in the course of his employment. It was argued there, as it was at bar in this case, that an employee cannot stipulate in advance with his employer so as to defeat, in case of his death the action of his wife and children ; and that such a stipulation was not the indemnity or satisfaction required by art. 1056. But that contention did not prevail. We were of opinion that the words \" without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction \" of the article of the Code would be meaningless if the construction contended for by the plaintiff in that case, as it is by the plaintiff here, prevailed, that an indemnity or satisfaction which would have barred an action by the deceased had he survived does not also bar the action by the consort and children. That cannot be. That would be reading out of the article the words \" without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction.\" In other words, by the decision of the Privy Council in the Robinson Case ([25]) the survivors have an action under the Code though the deceased, when he died, had lost his right of action except when it is because the deceased had obtained indemnity and satisfaction that he had lost his right of action. In such a case, by exception, the law is the same under the Code as it is in England under Lord Campbell's Act. However small the indemnity accepted by the deceased may have been, in whatever form or shape he may have accepted it, at what time he has accepted it makes no difference.\nIn that Robinson case the Privy Council held that the prescription of the action of the deceased was not an indemnity or satisfaction, and that in that case the wife had an action under the Code though the deceased when he died had none conceding however in unequivocal language that indemnity or satisfaction to the deceased is a bar to the survivor's action. And in the Grenier Case ([26]) we were bound I need hardly say by that decision and held in strict accordance with it, that there having been indemnity or satisfaction by the deceased in that case, the survivor's action did not lie though it did lie in the Robinson Case (3) because the deceased there had not in his lifetime received indemnity or satisfaction.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts against the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs. GIROUARD J. (dissenting) \u2014On the 29th January, 1900, respondent issued two actions against the appellants, one in her own name and the other in her quality as tutrix to her minor children, each action for $15000 damages for the death of her husband while in the service of the company at St. Henri, on the 2nd of January, 1900, through an accident which occurred on their line of railway, in consequence, it is alleged, of gross negligence on the part of the company and its servants and employees.\nOn motion of the respondent these actions were combined by a judgment of the Superior Court of the 2nd November, 1900, but the question of costs was reserved\nThe case was tried by a judge and a jury who found the following facts :\u2014\n2. Was the death of the said late Richard Ramsden caused.\n(a.) By the fault of the Company Defendant and its employees ?\u2014 Yes.\n(f) In neglecting to stop the said Lachine train before reaching said semaphore?\u2014Yes.\n(g.) In allowing the locomotive of the said Lachine train to be used while in an unsafe and dangerous condition?\u2014Yes.\n(h.) In the fact of the sand-valves used in connection with the brakes of the locomotive being out of order and useless ?\u2014Yes..\n(i.) In failing to repair the defects in the said locomotive after the defects had been specially brought to the notice of the said company? Yes.\nBoth parties moved for judgment upon the verdict, the respondent for the amount at which the damages were assessed, and the appellants' for the dismissal of the action. The unanimous judgment of the Court of Review dismissed appellants' motion and maintained respondent's with costs as in one action only, and this judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nThe Court of Review was composed of the Acting Chief Justice Sir Melbourne Tait Mr Justice Pagnuelo, and Mr. Justice Curran, who gave judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict, although they do not entirely agree as to the reasons of judgment.\nThe Acting Chief Justice held the company responsible under section 243 of The Dominion Railway Act, 1888 Mr. Justice Pagnuelo and Mr Justice Curran appear to have been against the company on all the points.\nAppellants submit that under the judgment rendered in the case of The Queen v. Grenier ([27]) plaintiffs have no right of action whatsoever against the said defendants. It has been submitted on the other hand that The Queen v. Grenier (1) conflicts with Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway, ([28]) decided by the Privy Council. I think that neither both contention is well founded.\nI fail in the first place to see any such contradiction In the Robinson Case (2), the point in issue was one of prescription under Articles 1056 and 2262 of the Civil Code. That prescription differs essentially from the prescription known to the French law, whether under the French code or the old law. It is not based upon a presumption of payment, but solely upon grounds of public policy, so much so that the judge in Quebec is bound to take notice of it ex officio. A judge in France never can do so.\nIt cannot be seriously pretended, it seems to me. that prescription is equivalent to the indemnity or satisfaction mentioned in article 1056 of the Civil Code This point is clearly settled by the Privy Council in the Robinson Case (2). Lord Watson said\nThat prescription is not. within the meaning of the Code equivalent to indemnity or satisfaction is made perfectly clear by a reference to art. 1338. (2) In The Queen v. Grenier ([29]) there was no question of prescription ; the point raised by the pleadings and decided by us \"was not whether the widow or children had a representative oran independent action\u2014which no doubt they always had but whether the deceased had obtained indemnity or satisfaction within the meaning of article 1056 of the Code and we held that he had by becoming a member of an insurance association, similar to the one now under consideration, which was composed of the employees on the Intercolonial Railway. As in this instance, they were all compelled, before entering the service, to join it and to make certain contributions to its funds in order to enable the association to provide certain pecuniary allowances to be paid to them or their families in cases of accident, in accordance with certain by-laws, rules conditions and regulations, signed by each of them. The railway proprietors had annually contributed to this insurance fund large sums of money in consideration of which it was made a rule or by-law of the association agreed to by all the members that the railway proprietors should be relieved of all claims for compensation for injuries and even death of a member. The respondent has quoted several French decisions to establish that such an arrangement cannot cover a case of negligence. But they have no application here, where the law in this respect is different Article 1056 of our Code cannot be found in the French Code France is only governed by the general principles laid down in articles 1382 1383 1384 and 1385 of the French Code corresponding to arts. 1053,1054 and 1055 of our Code. Art. 1056, as far as \"indemnity or satisfaction \" is concerned is new law not to be found in Lord Campbell's Act, as I presume these words under the common law of England were unnecessary, not even in the Canadian statutes, where probably the same impression prevailed in the legislature. The codifiers offer no explanation for art. 1056. It is not even alluded to in their reports and although it seems to me it was enacted with the view of making the jurisprudence of Quebec agree with that of Ontario, I do not see any change in the old French maxim which declares that no one can contract against his own negligence.\nWith regard to the railway insurance clause, the present case is the same as in The Queen v. Grenier ([30]) I am bound by that decision, and I am yet of opinion that it was correctly decided. The opinion of the learned judge who delivered the judgment of this court may contain some unnecessary statements which may be considered as obiter dicta. It cannot be denied that the only question raised in that case was whether indemnity or satisfaction had been obtained within the meaning of article 1056 of the Civil Code. Following Glengoil Steamship Co, v, Pilkington ([31]) we held that the deceased had contacted with his employer so as to exonerate the latter from liability for the negligence of his servants and employees, and that the payment of the large annual contributions by the employer to the insurance fund, and accepted by the deceased under the by-law, was indemnity and satisfaction as to all parties, within the meaning of the article of the Code. I think the language of the Code is clear and comprehensive enough to cover an arrangement such as the one made by the railway proprietors with their employees. So we held at all events.\nBut this case is very different from The Queen v. Grenier (1). The death was due not to the negligence of the employees and servants only, but as the jury found\u2014and their findings are not attacked\u2014to the negligence of both the company and the employees. I do not feel disposed to go behind these findings to ascertain the position of the company ; the language of the jury is plain enough; they give their reasons which are satisfactory to my mind at least. I do not intend to substitute. myself for the jury. I accept their verdict.\nIf the law of Quebec was like the law of England, I would not hesitate to apply The Queen v. Grenier ([32]) to a case of negligence of the employer like the present one. But in Quebec, although one can validly contract for exemption from liability for the negligence of his employees and servants, no one can free himself from responsibility for his own fault. This point we declined to decide in the Glengoil case. ([33]) It must be observed that the latter case was decided not upon English authorities, but upon what we considered to be now the jurisprudence of France. Taschereau J. delivering the opinion of the court said :\nThe jurisprudence in France, though perhaps formerly not uniform now sanctions the validity of such a contract (1).\nThe learned judge quoted a long array of arr\u00eats and commentators. But I venture to say that upon the other more difficult question, as he says, as to the validity of a similar stipulation for one's own fault, no authority can be quoted in its favour; I have not been able at least to find one, and in face of that well settled jurisprudence I cannot agree to the contrary doctrine. It is held as contrary to an elementary maxim of law and it is expressly condemned by all the authorities which will be found collected in the respondent's factum, as contrary to public morals and public order, whatever may be the law of England under similar circumstances. Our attention has been called to the last words of section 243 of The Railway Act 1888, which gives an action in certain cases of negligence \" notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary with regard to any such person.\" If I understand these words correctly, they simply mean that the company may protect itself against certain acts of negligence, not mentioned in the clause; in the provinces where such an agreement can be made. But they cannot possibly mean to legalize what would be contrary to law in any province. I have therefore come to the conclusion that the agreement to an indemnity or satisfaction such as alleged by the appellants is null and void at common law with regard to the company's own negligence. Arts. 13, 990 C.C\nTaking this view of the case, it may not be necessary to examine the effect of clause 243 of The Railway Act. Speaking for myself, I cannot conceive that the answers of the jury do not bring the case within the exceptions of section 243 of The Railway Act. Such is also the opinion of the other judges in the courts below. Upon this branch of the case I cannot do better than quote the remarks of Acting Chief Justice Tait, in which I fully concur :\nNow the defendants, as shown by the question put to the jury with their consent, evidently considered the sand-valves as part of the apparatus or arrangements, or of the good and sufficient means which the statute requires them to provide, and the question admits that they were used in connection with the brakes of the locomotive. The jury found, as already pointed out, that Ramsden's death was caused by the fault of the company defendant and its employees, in the fact of the sand-valves used in connection with the brakes of the said locomotive being out of order and useless, and in failing to repair the defects in the locomotive after such defects had been specially bought to the notice of the company.\nNow it seems to me that to give this section such interpretation as would best insure the attainment of its object regarding the stopping of trains, we are justified in saying that the company has failed to conform to its provisions, and that the accident in question resulted from such failure.\nI am of opinion therefore, that notwithstanding the agreement between Ramsden and the society, the defendants are responsible under this section of the Railway Act.\nMr. Justice Pagnuelo also concludes :\nL'obligation de placer et de maintenir des freins effectifs est impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie, quoiqu'elle n'agisse que par ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9faut d'accomplir cette obligation est une faute de la compagnie el1e-m\u00eame, et toute convention faite avec les passagers ou ses employ\u00e9s pour la soustraire \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9 civile est frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 absolue ; la compagnie sera responsable de sa faute prouv\u00e9e envers toute personne bless\u00e9e et ses repr\u00e9sentants, malgr\u00e9 toute convention contraire.\nJe ne vois donc pas comment la compagnie peut, avec un semblant de raison, invoquer l'article du r\u00e8glement de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour Be lib\u00e9rer de son obligation d'indemniser Ramsden, sa femme et ses enfants, suivant le cas. La cour supr\u00eame ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e sur cet article du statut, et la cause de Grenier (1) n'a rien qui ressemble \u00e0 celle-ci\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should, be dismissed with, costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This appeal seems tobe in same respects on all fours with the case of The Queen v. Grenier ([34]) in which this court held that an employee on the Intercolonial Railway who became a member of the Intercolonial Railway Relief & Assurance Association, and thereby assented to its rules and to the arrangement by which the Crown contributed $6,000 annually to the funds of the association, had by Virtue of one of these rules contracted that the Crown\nshould be relieved of all claims for compensation for injuries to or for the death of any member of the association.\nWe are bound by this decision so far as it goes and also by the decision of this court in the case of The Glengoil S. S. Co. v. Pilkington ([35]) where it is held that an express agreement between carriers and shippers that the former should not be liable for negligence on the part of the masters or mariners or their servants or agents is not contrary to public policy nor prohibited by law in the Province of Quebec.\nIt was not determined in this latter case whether such an agreement if made expressly exempting carriers from their own negligence would in the Province of Quebec be illegal, nor does the Grenier Case ([36]) decide that point. In the case at bar it was contended that the by-law in question relieving the defendants from liability must be construed as extending only to the negligence of employees and not to that of the company itself; and that the answers of the jury to the questions put to them amounted to a finding that the negligence which caused the death of Ramsden was that of the company itself. I am unable to place this construction upon these findings of the jury, and am therefore relieved of the duty of determining whether the true construction of the by-law exempted the company from the consequences of its own negligence, and if so, whether such a by-law would be legally effective in the Province of Quebec, The jury was asked, among other things :\nWas the death of the late Richard Ramsden caused (a) by the fault of the company defendants and its employees? to which they gave the general answer \"Yes.\"\nThen followed ten sub-questions of this main one pointing to some specific act of negligence, and among them the two following questions and answers :\nQ. (h). In the fact of the sand valves used in connection with the brakes of the said locomotive being out of order and useless?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. (i). In failing to repair the defects in the said locomotive after the defects had been specially brought to the notice of the company ?\u2014A. Yes. To each question the affirmative answer was given. But such affirmative answer does not by any means involve the finding of a neglect of duty on the part of the company as distinct from the neglect of its employees.\nNo question is raised here as to any failure of duty on the part of the company to provide and maintain proper and suitable plant works and machinery or suitable materials to repair daily defects, or competent servants to control and operate their railway. The question rather is whether having made proper provision for all of these things the company would be liable for the negligence of some of its employees in not repairing defects arising in the daily use of one of the engines and whether as to the latter their contract with Ramsden did not exempt them from liability.\nI am unable to discover in these answers of the jury to the questions put to them any finding which directly charges the company as distinct from its officials, with any breach of common law or statutory duty. All the findings are consistent with neglect or breaches of duty by officials as against liability for whose negligence the defendant company has contracted exemption. The evidence shows that the repairs to the locomotive were reported at the round house, and that it was the duty of the workmen there to attend to these repairs. There is no evidence of any special bringing of these defects to the notice of the company or its executive officers as implied in question (i) submitted to the jury as distinct from the ordinary reports of defects made daily with regard to engines and locomotives by the engineer in charge of them. I am unable, therefore, to attach the meaning and weight to that finding which the counsel for respondent contended for.\nIt was strongly Contended that the provisions of sec. 243 of The Railway Act, 1888, applied to the facts as found by the jury with regard to the sand-valves; and I confess I was at the argument impressed with the contention. But a critical examination of the section has convinced me that so far as the sand valves are concerned neither their presence nor their state of repair are covered by the section. Omitting those parts of the section which admittedly do not apply to the facts as proved herein, I think its true meaning is to oblige the company to provide and cause to he used on passenger trains such known apparatus and arrangements as best afford good and sufficient means of applying the brakes to the to wheels of the locomotive or tender or both. The sand-valves are not necessary and do not contribute in any way to this purpose and their presence or state of repair cannot be said to effect a breach of or a compliance with the section.\nHolding, as I do therefore, that the negligence found as the proximate cause of Ramsden's death was not that of the company as distinct from its officials and servants, and that as regards the latter the company had, under the authority of Grenier's Case ([37]), exempted itself from liability by its contract, and being also of the opinion that the negligence found was not within the 243rd section of The Railway Act I think the appeal must be allowed.\nI entertained doubts as to whether there was any such privity of contract between Ramsden and the Railway Company as would discharge the latter from liability in cases where that liability was found to exist. There was no express contract between Ramsden and the railway company. The contract between them must be gathered from the facts of Ramsden becoming a member of the insurance society one of whose by-laws provided for the exemption of the railway company from all claims by members of the society for damages caused by accident on the company's railway and the statutory annual payment by the railway company to the funds of the society. In the Grenier Case ([38]), however, the facts were precisely similar and that decision is binding on us.\nKILLAM J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Review of the Province of Quebec pronounced under art. 494 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a case which was tried by a jury and in which the trial judge reserved for the consideration of the court under art 491 of the Code of Civil Procedure the question of the judgment to be entered upon the answers to certain questions submitted to the jury. The circumstances of the case and the answers of the jury have, for the most part, been sufficiently stated by the other members of the court\nFor the purposes of this appeal, we must take the findings of the jury as absolutely correct. They establish that Richard Ramsden came to his death through such fault and negligence of the defendant and its employees as would have given him a cause of action for his injuries if he had lived, unless he was barred by the rules and regulations of the Grank Trunk Railway Insurance and Provident Society and his acceptance of them * and, under art. 1056 of the Civil Code of Quebec, the present plaintiffs have a similar right of action, unless it is barred in the same way.\nIn considering whether they are so barred I think that we should start upon the assumption that we are bound by the decision of this court in The Queen v. Grenier (1) in so far as it is based upon similar facts. I accept the conclusion in that case, without intending to indicate any opinion upon the questions involved.\nThe rules of this particular society and the position of its members were considered by the Court of Review in Quebec, in Ferguson v Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([39]) and held to be practically the same, for the purposes of the question now arising, as in the case of the association of which Grenier was a member. I deem it sufficient upon this point to refer to the reasoning in that case.\nBut the circumstances of the present case raise some further questions of importance, first, upon the construction and application of section 243 of The Railway Act of Canada 51 Vict. ch. 29 ; and, secondly, upon the special terms of the jury's findings.\nFor the purpose of applying the statute in the present instance, I would adopt the paraphrase indicated by the learned Chief Justice of the court below, thus:\nEvery railway company which, runs trains upon the railway, for the conveyance of passengers, shall provide and cause to be used in and upon said trains such known apparatus and arrangements as best afford * * * good and sufficient means of applying by the power of the steam engine or otherwise, at the will of the engine driver or other person appointed to such duty, the brakes to the wheels of the loco. motive or tender or both or of all or any cars or carriages composing the trains. * * * And every railway company which fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall * * * be liable to pay to all such persons as are injured by reason of noncompliance with this provision, or to their representatives, such damages as they are legally entitled to, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary with regard to any such person.\nBut with all respect, I am unable to agree with the learned Chief Justice as to the effect of the clause. So far as it is now important, it deals only with the means of applying the brakes to the wheels. Of course, this again is a method of stopping the train, as a speedy stopping of the train may be a means of ensuring the safety of passengers or others in certain contingencies. But it appears to me quite as fallacious to apply the clause to every means of stop-ping the train as to every means of ensuring safety. It is directed to certain specific devices and means expressly mentioned, and there is nothing to indicate a purpose to enact anything more than the words express.\nThere is no direct finding by the jury that the accident was due to any defect in the apparatus or arrangements affording means of applying the brakes to the wheels.\nThe use of the sand-pipes is given by the witness Broadhurst as being to\nput sand on the rail in order to Cause the wheels to grip the rail and stop the train.\nIt is evident that the object is to increase the friction along the rails and not in any way to assist the application of the brakes to the wheels or to increase the power of the brakes. In the light of the evidence, it is clear that the sand-valves are in no sense apparatus or arrangements affording means of applying the brakes to the wheels and that the jury's answer to the question referring to the sand valves as \"used in connection with the brakes \" does not involve finding that they are such apparatus or arrangements or any part thereof.\nThe case under the statute seems to me to fail entirely.\nIt is upon the other part of the case that 1 have found the greatest difficulty. In the 0-renier case the negligence was that of a co-employee of the injured man, and it is argued that the jury's answers in the present instance involve a finding that the accident was due to negligence personal to the company itself as distinguished from its employees, against liability for which, by the law of the Province of Quebec the company could not contract, In the Glengoil Steamship Co. v. Pilkington ([40]) this court held valid a stipulation relieving the company owning a steamship from liability for negligence of the master, and the master of a steamship would seem to stand as high in the representation of the company owning it as any superintendent or manager of a division of a railway in the representation of the railway company.\nLooking at the evidence in the case before us, it appears that any defaults were those of subordinate officials. At least they are not traced to any others. The evidence certainly did not warrant any finding of negligence on the part of the company, as distinguished from its employees.\nIn none of the particulars in which default is found is there clearly shown to have been a breach of any duty of the company as an employer to its employees. It is consistent with each that it was due to some official or officials. All are in matters ordinarily relegated to subordinate officials. Indeed, the neglect to stop the train, specified as one cause of the accident, could only be the neglect of those having actual control of it\nA finding of default by a person charged does not necessarily mean personal default ; it may be based solely on the default of one for whom he is responsible.\nI think then that there was not sufficient in the answers to warrant a judgment on the basis that the death was caused by gross negligence on the part of the company itself, as distinguished from its employees. For that purpose there should be a clear and unambiguous finding by the jury, just as in Brasell v. La Compagnie du Grand Tronc ([41]) it was pointed out by Pagnuelo J. that the burden is upon an employee who has agreed to assume the risks of the defaults of his co-employees to show that injury has come to him from the gross negligence of the employer himself.\nOn the ground, then, that the facts do not sufficiently raise a case for the purpose, I refrain from discussing the question of the company's power to contract itself out of liability for its own defaults.\nI would allow the appeal and direct the entry of \"judgment for the defendant with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellants : A.

Pounder v. North Eastern Railway Co. ([1892] 1 Q.B. 385) dissented from. Judgment of the Court of Appeal (5 Ont. L.R. 334) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment entered on the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case are stated by Moss C.J.O., in giving judgment for the Court of Appeal, as follows:\n\u201cThe plaintiff was a passenger on one of the defendants\u2019 trains as holder of a ticket issued by the defendants, entitling him to be carried as a first class passenger from the city of Toronto to the town of Brampton. While on the train in question, on the night of the 10th of October, 1901, he was thrice assaulted and beaten by a fellow passenger. The injuries inflicted were severe, permanently impairing his hearing, and otherwise affecting his health. The action is for the recovery of damages for the negligence of the defendants or their servants, in failing after due notice to properly guard and protect the plaintiff against the assaults of which he complains.\n\u201cThe defendants deny liability, allege that they did, through their servants and agents to the best of their ability preserve order on their train, and as far as they were able to do so, protected the plaintiff from being beaten or assaulted, and further, that if plaintiff suffered any damage by reason of the assaults of which he complained, such assaults were induced by his own conduct.\n\u201cThe last allegation may be disposed of at once by the observation that no evidence was given or tendered at the trial to show that there was anything in the plaintiff\u2019s conduct on the train, before or at the time of the several assaults, calculated to provoke them. He appears to have conducted himself throughout in a peaceable and lawful manner. He was guilty of no act, while at the station, or on the train, which could in any manner justify the assaults made upon him. The defendants did tender evidence with a view of showing that the relations between the plaintiff and his assailant were of a hostile and unfriendly nature, and they complain that this evidence was improperly rejected.\n\u201cAt the trial, it was shown that the plaintiff and his wife boarded the train at the Union Station, at Toronto, shortly before the hour of the night at which it was timed to depart; that amongst other passengers was one Anthony, by whom the assaults were committed; that Anthony was drunk and quarrelsome, and that before he first struck the plaintiff, he violently assaulted another passenger named Noble without any provocation whatever, seizing him by the throat and swearing he would choke him.\n\u201cVery soon after this he assaulted the plaintiff, striking him from behind so that he fell forward among the seats of the car, and repeating his blows until the plaintiff escaped. During the scuffle, Anthony struck Mrs. Clendenning, and another passenger a violent blow on the arm, and he also used violent and threatening language towards one Thorburn, another passenger.\n\u201cThe plaintiff left the car to seek a constable, and during his absence Anthony assaulted one Beatty, another passenger. Soon after the conductor entered the car and spoke to Anthony warning him against making a disturbance. The plaintiff having failed to find a constable, returned to the train just as it was about to move off, apparently after having been already started and drawn up again. Before getting upon the train again he told the conductor, in the presence of the brakesman and others, that he had been assaulted in the car, and that two or three others had also been assaulted, and that he wished the man arrested and put off the train. He told the conductor that he would not go on if the man was allowed to go on, that he was drunk and had assaulted him and two or three others. \u201cThe conductor said the man had a ticket, and had as much right as the plaintiff had to go on, but finally told the plaintiff to go on, that \u2018we will have a constable at Parkdale.\u2019 Plaintiff thereupon entered the train and it proceeded to Parkdale. At Parkdale the plaintiff renewed his request to the conductor to get a constable. He told him that he had been informed that the man intended to attack him again, to which the conductor replied that the plaintiff was the only man creating a row.\n\u201cThe plaintiff continued urging the conductor to get a constable, but the latter signalled the train to start and told the plaintiff to get on board or he would be left. His wife was in the car, he had no means of communicating with her, and he got on. Not long after he was again assaulted by Anthony, and received very serious injuries. He again complained to the conductor, who took the position that he could do nothing unless he saw the man strike the plaintiff, to which the plaintiff not unnaturally replied that it was very unfair if he was not to be believed until he was killed. The conductor refused to do anything and went away, and shortly after Anthony renewed the assault. In consequence of this and of his wife\u2019s fright, the plaintiff and his wife left the train at Streetsville and passed the remainder of the night there.\n\u201cThe conductor was not called as a witness at the trial, but portions of his depositions taken on examination for discovery were put in by the plaintiff. He would not deny that the plaintiff complained to him of Anthony at the Union Station and Parkdale. Asked how many passengers spoke to him that night about Anthony, he replied that he did not know, there might have been twenty, there might have been forty for all he knew. He admitted that after the second assault the plaintiff complained to him and wanted him to put Anthony off. He was told of the assault by a great many other people, but did not think it as bad as the plaintiff tried to make out. He told Anthony he would put him off. Asked, \u2018then you did think it was your duty to put the man off?\u2019 he answered \u2018No, I did not think it was my duty to put the man off. He was not in a fit state to be put off.\u2019\n\u2018Q. Then he was drunk? A. Yes.\nQ. He was too drunk to be put off? A. Yes, I think he was.\u2019\nAnd again question 135. \u2018And you were going to put him off? A. I told him I would put him off if he did not behave?\n\u2018Q. And he got hold of the seat and was hanging on to the seat and you let him go? A. Something like that, I would not be positive. I think when the train was stopped we were closing the switch.\u2019 He was then speaking of a time after the third assault and before the train reached Cooksville, a station just east of Streetsville.\u201d\nThe verdict of the jury was in favour of the plaintiff and the damages were assessed at $3,500. The Court of Appeal having sustained the verdict the defendant company appealed to this court.\nJohnson K.C. and Denison for the appellants. The duty of a carrier of passengers is not that of insurer as in the case of a carrier of goods; he is liable only for negligence. Christie v. Griggs[2]; Sutherland v. Great Western Railway Co.[3]\nA railway company owes no such duty to a passenger as is contended for in this case and decided by the judgment appealed from. Pounder v. North Eastern Railway Co.[4]; Cannon v. Midland Railway Co.[5] The American decisions are not founded on any rule of our common law but on a state of affairs not existing either in England or Canada. Putnam v. Broadway, & Seventh Ave. Railroad Co.[6]\nRiddell K.C. and D.O. Cameron for the respondent. Both the Criminal Code and the Railway Act empower a conductor to preserve the peace on his train.\nPounder v. North Eastern Railway Co.4, is not good law and was seriously questioned in Cobb v. Great Western Railway Co.[7]\nIt is the duty of a railway company to provide a sufficient staff to maintain order and to protect passengers from injury; Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson[8]; and this duty is strictly enforced in the United States. New Orleans, St. Louis & Chicago Railroad Co. v. Burke[9]; Lucy v. Chicago Great Western Railroad Co.[10]; Putnam v. Broadway & Seventh Ave. Railroad Co.[11]\nThe learned counsel referred to Smith v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[12]\nThe judgment of the court, Davies J. taking no part was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The learned Chief Justice has asked me to shortly express the grounds upon which our decision on this case is based. We are of opinion that the following statement in 5 Am. & Eng. Ency. 553, embodies the correct rule upon the question in controversy:\nWhenever a carrier through its agents or servants knows or has the opportunity to know of the threatened injury, or might reasonably have anticipated the happening of an injury, and fails or neglects to take the proper precautions or to use the proper means to prevent or mitigate such injury, the carrier is liable. It appears to us that this principle or rule of duty was violated by the appellant company\u2019s conductor in so far as the third assault upon the respondent is concerned. If the case of Pounder v. North Eastern Railway Co.[13], is in conflict with the doctrine now propounded we cannot assent to it, and in that view we are to a large extent supported by the doubt which was thrown upon it in the case of Cobb v. Great Western Railway Co.[14], where Lord Selborne and Lord McNaughton doubted that that case was properly decided, and the other learned law Lords refrained in terms from expressing any opinion in regard to it.\nAttention may be called to an admirable article by a learned text writer in 18 Law Magazine and Law Review, 449.\nThen upon the measure of damages. It seems clear from the evidence that the jury in assessing these at the sum of $3,500 took into consideration the second assault. It does not appear to us that the appellant company is liable for any injury caused to the respondent on that occasion. Neither he nor the conductor anticipated that attack. They both thought there was no necessity then to eject the passenger who was the cause of the trouble. But after the second assault it was the conductor\u2019s duty to eject him. The damages caused by the third assault were comparatively slight and we think justice will be done by directing that the appeal be allowed and a new trial ordered, unless the plaintiff agrees to accept $1,000, together with costs, in full of his claim against the company. There will be no costs in the court below nor in this court.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Angus MacMurchy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.O. Cameron.\n[1] 5 Ont.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal (5 Ont. L.R. 313) reversed, Girouard J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], maintaining the judgment entered on the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis was an action brought by the respondent against the appellants for damages sustained owing to the negligence of the appellants, causing the death of the wife and two children of the respondent, serious personal injury to the respondent, the killing of his horse and the destruction of his buggy.\nThe accident out of which these injuries arose occurred on the evening of the 9th day of October, 1901, at Main Street in the town of Forest, in the county of Lambton, at the point where the said street or highway is crossed by the appellants\u2019 railway. The statement of claim charged statutory negligence in running the trains faster than six miles an hour without proper fencing and common law negligence in proceeding at a reckless rate of speed without warning or precautions against injury to the public.\nThe action was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice McMahon and a jury at Sarnia on the 2nd and 3rd days of April, 1902, when the learned trial judge submitted certain questions to the jury, which with the answers are as follows:\n1st. Was the whistle blown before reaching the Main Street crossing, and if so, at what distance from the crossing was it first sounded?\nYes. At the whistling post.\n2nd. If the bell was rung, where did it first commence to ring, and was it ringing continuously or at short intervals until the engine crossed the street where the accident happened?\nBell started to ring east of Main Street eight or ten rods, and rang continuously.\n3rd. Is the Main Street crossing at Forest in a thickly peopled portion of the village?\nYes.\n4th. At what rate of speed was the engine running at the time it crossed Main Street?\nAbout twenty miles an hour.\n5th. Was such a rate of speed, in your opinion, a dangerous rate of speed for such locality?\nYes.\n6th. Was the death of Mrs. McKay and the injury to Joseph McKay caused in consequence of any neglect or omission of the company? If so, what was the neglect or omission, in your opinion, which caused the accident?\n(a) Yes. (b) Neglect in running too fast and for the neglect of a flagman or gates. 6a. Was any warning given by Hallisey to Mrs. McKay of the approach of the engine?\nNot sufficient.\n7th. Could Joseph McKay, had he used ordinary care, have seen the engine in time to have avoided the collision?\nNo.\n8th. \u201cWas the plaintiff, in your opinion, guilty of any want of ordinary care and diligence which contributed to the accident? If so, state in what respect?\nNo.\n9th. If you find the plaintiff is entitled to recover, at what do you assess the damages?\n(a) By reason of the death of his wife?\nEight hundred dollars.\n(b) By reason of the injuries suffered by himself?\nFour hundred dollars.\n(c) For the horse and buggy?\nOne hundred dollars.\nNo negligence was attributed by the jury from failure to whistle or ring the bell so that nothing turned on the first two findings. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $1,300, which was maintained by the Court of Appeal. The company then appealed to this court.\nRiddell K.C. and Rose for the appellants. The plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in not looking out for the train. The rule of \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d which prevails in the United States, Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Weber[2] should be adopted in Canada.\nThere is no common law obligation on a railway company to fence its road; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. James[3]; and the requirements of the Act having been complied with there was no restriction as to the rate of speed in this case. Hellmuth K.C. and Hanna for the respondent. The negligence of the defendants was established to the satisfaction of the jury and contributory negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part negatived. A second Court of Appeal will not set these findings aside. Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[4].\nEven if defendants complied with the statutory requirements then common law obligation to exercise due care and caution remained. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fleming[5]; Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway Co. v. Barclay[6].\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in my brother Davies\u2019 reasoning and agree that the appeal should be allowed and the respondent\u2019s action dismissed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant company run a railway through the Town of Forest, in the County of Lambton, Ontario. Its line runs practically east and west, and at a certain point is crossed by Main Street, a public highway running north and south. To the east of this crossing the line is straight for several miles and a clear view can be had towards the east down the track for at least a mile from a distance north of the track of more than 60 feet.\nAt the point in question there are three lines of rails, the middle one being the main track, and it was upon this main track that the accident took place.\nOn the 9th of October, 1901, at about half past six o\u2019clock in the evening, the plaintiff, with his wife and two children, were in a buggy driving southward on Main Street, towards the railway crossing. A collision took place between the buggy and a locomotive engine of the defendants going west drawing their regular train, the result of which was the death of his wife, some personal injury to the plaintiff himself and the killing of his horse and destruction of his buggy. Suit was brought and the trial came on before Mr. Justice McMahon and a jury at Sarnia on the 2nd April, 1902. Questions were submitted to the jury which, with the answers, are as follows:\n1st. Was the whistle blown before reaching the Main Street crossing, and if so, at what distance from the crossing was it first sounded? A. Yes at the whistling post.\n2nd. If the bell was rung, where did it first commence to ring, and was it ringing continuously or at short intervals until the engine crossed the street where the accident happened? A. Bell started to ring east of Main Street eight or ten rods and rang continuously.\n3rd. Is the Main Street crossing at Forest in a thickly peopled portion of the village? A. Yes.\n4th. At what rate of speed was the engine running at the time it crossed Main Street? A. About twenty miles an hour.\n5th. Was such rate of speed, in your opinion, a dangerous rate of speed for such locality? A. Yes.\n6th. Was the death of Mrs. McKay and the injury to Joseph McKay caused in consequence of any neglect or omission of the company? If so, what was the neglect or omission, in your opinion, which caused the accident? A. (a) Yes; (b) Neglect in running too fast and for the want of a flag-man or gates.\n6a. Was any warning given by Hallisey to McKay of the approach of the engine? A. Not sufficient.\n7th. Could Joseph McKay, had he used ordinary care, have seen the engine in time to have avoided the collision? A. No.\n8th. Was the plaintiff, in your opinion, guilty of any want of ordinary care and diligence which contributed to the accident? If so, state in what respect? A. No.\n9th. If you find the plaintiff is entitled to recover, at what do you assess the damages? (a) By reason of the death of his wife? A. Eight hundred dollars. (b) By reason of the injuries suffered by himself? A. Four hundred dollars. (c) For the horse and buggy? A. One hundred dollars.\nIn order to understand these questions and answers it may be mentioned that Hallisey, therein named, was not a servant of the company but was employed by the corporation of Forest as a watchman, and was stationed at the crossing on the day in question. He saw the plaintiff coming and warned him of his danger but without effect.\nJudgment was entered for the plaintiff upon the finding of the jury for $1,300, and an appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Hence this appeal.\nIt will be observed that the first answer is not in favour of the company; that the second is against the company, but that is immaterial, as, assuming the answer to be correct, the failure in starting to ring the bell was not found to be the cause of, or to contribute to, the accident, and besides, the evidence, in my judgment, proves to a demonstration that the bell rang continuously from the time the train left Toronto until after the accident. It may also be stated that the railway all through the Town of Forest was properly fenced on both sides as required by the Railway Act; that there was no guard (i.e. a gate) at the crossing, and that the train was running on schedule time. The case therefore rests upon the consideration of the answers to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th questions. This clearly raised two questions: First, as to whether the railway company is limited as to the speed of its trains, and, secondly, as to the necessity for fencing by gate or otherwise across the highway. As to the speed, in my view one of the chief objects of a railway system is to attain a high speed of travel; the interests of the public in saving time and the increase of productive power form reasons for holding as it has been held that\nrailway companies are permitted to establish their undertakings for the express purpose of running trains at high speed along their lines, (per Halsbury, L.C.[7]) The legislature has permitted railways to cross highways on the level provided\nthat no locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is properly fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act,\nand this plainly refers us to the Act itself as to the \u201cmanner prescribed.\u201d The provisions are to be found in sections 194 and 197. Section 194 deals with the case of a railway running through a township; section 197 is as follows:\nAt every public road crossing at rail level of the railway the fence on both sides of the crossing and on both sides of the track shall be turned into the cattle guards so as to allow the safe passage of trains.\nThis seems to me to make it plain that the fencing in the manner prescribed by the Act must be fencing as described in section 197. The Act also creates a tribunal which shall have the right to regulate the speed of the trains. By section 10 the Railway Committee may,\n(a) Regulate and limit the rate of speed at which trains and locomotives may be run in any city, town or village, or in any class of cities, towns or villages described in any regulation; limiting, if the said Railway Committee thinks fit, the rate of speed within certain described portions of any city, town or village, and allowing another rate of speed in other portions thereof,\u2014which rate of speed shall not in any case exceed six miles an hour, unless the track is properly fenced.\nI am of opinion that the track should be properly fenced according to the regulations laid down in the Railway Act, which regulations are contained, so far as this case is concerned, in section 197, viz., fenced at the crossing at right angles to the railway fence prescribed by section 194.\nIn my view the right of a railway upon the highway itself depends entirely upon legislation. The position of a railway company in respect of a highway is quite different from its position as regards other lands belonging to individuals, over which it passes. In the latter case the land may be expropriated, and is expropriated, and becomes the absolute property of the railway; but as regards the highway, the fee or right of ownership in any part of the highway is not required by the railway company, nor acquired by it, nor does the railway company ask or expect to acquire the exclusive right to use any part of it, but merely to use it in common with the public generally.\nIt is the right of all His Majesty\u2019s subjects to go upon any part of the highway, so long as it is not occupied by other passengers or occupants. While, of course, no person has the right to be along the line of the railway upon the highway during the time that the train of the railway company is passing, every person has a right upon such place at any other time, and every person has a right upon any other part of the highway at all times, except so much as is actually occupied by the passing train. No person has a right to prevent any other person from driving his horse or from himself going up to within a foot of a passing train; and certainly no one has the right to prevent any one going upon that part of the highway which is opposite to the unoccupied portion of the railway grounds. If the railway company without express statutory authority were to erect gates opposite to its side fences, and lower those gates at any time, any person prevented from driving or walking towards the line of rails by such gates would be interfered with in his legal common law rights. It must be apparent then, that there must be some authority given to a railway company before it can assume to erect gates upon a highway. This authority is to be found in the Railway Act, 51 Vict. c. 29, s. 187; and it will be seen that it was in the view of the Parliament of Canada necessary to give express authority, when we look at the wording of the section:\nAnd the Railway Committee, if it appears to it expedient or necessary for the public safety, may, from time to time, with the sanction of the Governor in Council, authorize or require the company to which such railway belongs, within such time as the said committee directs, to protect such street or highway by a watchman or by a watchman and gates or other protection.\nThis is made apparent as well by looking at the English statute. In the year 1845 was passed the first of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts, and this is still in force, being 8 & 9 Vict. c. 20.\nSection 47 provided as follows:\nIf the railway cross any turnpike or road or public carriage road on a level, the company shall erect and at all times maintain good and sufficient gates across such road, on each side of the railway where the same shall communicate therewith and shall employ proper persons to open and shut such gates.\nThe legislature in passing the General Railway Act had before it not only the General Railway Acts previously passed but also the Imperial Railway Clauses Consolidation Act I have referred to, and I have no doubt that the different policy which has been adopted as to railways in this country was adopted in view of the different conditions of the two countries, and the consideration that if a gate watchman were required at every level crossing throughout the country it would impose altogether too heavy a burden on a young and only partially developed territory. This is more apparent when the previous legislation is considered because the language \u201cunless the track is fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act\u201d followed by way of amendment some opinions which indicated that it was necessary for a railway company to fence at each highway crossing. I think, therefore, there is no limitation to speed unless it is prescribed by the Railway Committee. The same observations, I think, apply to a flagman. I think the legislature has fixed a tribunal to determine not only the rate of speed, but when and where watchmen shall be placed. I adopt the language of Allen J. in Weber v. New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Co.[8]\nA railroad company must so operate its trains and use and occupy its railway, in the enjoyment of the right of way which it has in common with the ordinary traveller, as not to injure others in the exercise of their right of way, provided the latter are guilty of no want of care on their part. But the rule which imposes the obligation of care and prudence upon a railway corporation, and measures its liability to others liable to receive injury from moving cars or locomotives, does not call for any act outside of or disconnected with its actual operations and the use of the railway. The duty of posting flagmen or having servants and agents, or placing gates or other obstructions, or of giving special or personal notice to travellers at railway crossings, can only be imposed by the legislature.\nRailroads are authorized by statute to construct their road, and run their trains across streets and highways. The same statute provides that they shall give certain signals for the purpose of warning travellers of their approach and presence; such signals being, in the judgment of the legislature, sufficient to protect the public from injury in the use of the crossings. Keeping a flagman at the crossings, or any of them, is not required by statute; nor does the statute require the company to give warning to travellers otherwise than as therein provided. The question is, whether the common law requires the company to warn travellers of approaching trains by other and more effective means than those the statute requires. The claim that it does is based on the maxim that every one must so use his own as not to injure another. In applying the maxim to the present case, it must be borne in mind that the traveller and railroad company have each an equal right of way in the crossings, derived from the same authority; the former for the purpose of travel, and the latter for running its trains. A collision is somewhat dangerous to the trains, but vastly more so to the traveller. The law imposes upon both the duty of observing care to avoid them. But the care imposed upon the company is in operating its trains; in so transacting its business, in the exercise of its right of way, as not to injure others in the exercise of their similar right, provided the latter exercise due care on their part. This relates to the mode of operating the trains, and all other things done by the company in the transaction of its business. It does not require the company to employ men to keep travellers off the track, nor to serve notices upon them that trains were approaching. Should the company do this, it would relieve the traveller from all necessity of exercising care in this respect; and it would, indeed, be safe for him to go upon the track, having received no express warning. If the exertions of the flagmen were, in any particular case inadequate to prevent injury to a traveller, upon the same principle it might be submitted to a jury whether ordinary prudence did not require gates to be closed at certain crossings, while trains were passing, or something else done to protect the traveller; and, if, in their judgment, it did, to instruct them that such omission was negligence.\nInstead of the power of giving directions as to the management and running of the railway being in the hands of the Parliament of Canada or the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, it would be in the hands of a jury. The jury would have higher power in that regard than even the Provincial Legislatures.\nUpon the powers even of a Provincial Legislature see Madden v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co.[9] The Provincial Legislature have pointed out by their preamble that in their view, the Dominion Parliament has neglected proper precautions, and that they are going to supplement the provisions which, in the view of the Provincial Legislature, the Dominion Parliament ought to have made; and they thereupon proceed to do that which they recite the Dominion Parliament has omitted to do. It would have been impossible, as it appears to their Lordships, to maintain the authority of the Dominion Parliament if the Provincial Parliament were to be permitted to enter into such a field of legislation.\nCompare Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[10].\nThe rules and decisions of the Railway Committee have the force of law and can be so enforced (The Railway Act, 1888, ss. 17, 25, 289). Is or can there be any other body which may override or differ from such decisions or orders, or give additional, supplementary, or perhaps contradictory orders?\nIt is to be observed that the speed was the usual schedule speed fixed by the company in its statutory powers, Railway Act, 1888[11].\nI am of opinion that the negligence found by the jury was conduct authorized by the statute in the lawful running of the company\u2019s trains, and the neglect of duties were duties which could only be imposed by the proper tribunal created by the statute. I refer to various sections which indicate that an examination of the Railway Act will show that it intended to deal with the whole subject of the management and operation of railways. Sections 10, 11, 173, 177, 189, 190, 194, 199, 214, 256, 260, 271, 274. These are merely cited as showing some of the matters dealt with by the legislature. In view of the opinion now expressed it is unnecessary to discuss the other positions advanced by Mr. Riddle and elaborated in the voluminous and very able factum of the appellants.\nThe result is the appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed, the whole with costs.\nGIROUARD J (dissenting)\u2014In my opinion this appeal involves a simple question. Sec. 259 of the Railway Act, as amended in 1892 by 55 & 56 Vict. c. 27, sec. 8, says:\nNo locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act.\nThe respondent contends that the Railway Act nowhere requires that public highways should be fenced, and that consequently railway trains may be run at full speed \u201cthrough any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village,\u201d as Forest, an incorporated town, certainly was. I cannot accept this interpretation of sec. 259. If the alternative of fencing be impossible, if, in fact, the Act has no provision upon the matter, then the rule laid down in the first part of the clause as to slow speed must be enforced. But is it correct to say that the statute does not provide for the fencing of streets through these localities? \u201cFencing\u201d here cannot have the meaning it has in clauses dealing with rural districts where the fencing or closing of the highways is not intended. Sec. 194. Sec. 259 provides for a special case, that of thickly populated towns or villages, and fencing, within the meaning of that clause, is something besides the fencing of the tracks outside of streets. It means the closing of the streets or highways also. This can be done under sec. 187 The Railway Committee may authorize the company to protect such streets or highways by a watchman, or by a watchman and gates, or other protection, for instance a flagman, and no doubt the jury had this clause in view when, being asked whether the death of the wife of the respondent and the injury to his son were caused by any neglect or omission of the company, answered: \u201cYes, negligence in running too fast, and for the want of a flagman or gates.\u201d\nThe company did not deem it necessary to take advantage of this section and to provide for any protection in the Town of Forest; they made no application to the Railway Committee, and they continued to run their trains as if they were in townships, at a rate prohibited by the statute. They are therefore guilty of negligence and must take the consequences. This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The questions for decision in this appeal are important involving the rights of the travelling public on the one hand and those of the Chartered Railway Companies of Canada on the other. They depend for their solution mainly, if not entirely, upon the proper construction to be given to the clauses of \u201cThe Railway Act,\u201d 1888, and its amendments.\nThe action was for negligence by the defendants in the operation of one of their trains while crossing over one of the streets of the Town of Forest on the evening of October 9th, 1901. The learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, now under consideration, states the material facts of the accident as follows:\nOn the evening in question, about 6 o\u2019clock, the plaintiff, a farmer, with his wife and two very young children, were driving home from an agricultural fair at the Town of Forest which they had been attending. The evening was inclined to be wet and the plaintiff had in consequence put up the sides of the covered buggy in which he and his family were driving, which interfered to some extent with his seeing and hearing. He left the hotel on King Street, drove to Main Street, and then along Main Street to the crossing in question where the collision took place by which the plaintiff himself was severely injured, his wife and two children were killed, and his horse and buggy destroyed. The track crosses Main Street, a leading street in the town, on the level and is not protected by any gate or by a watchman; although on the day in question one Hallisey, employed by the town corporation, was stationed at this crossing as watchman owing to the number of people who would likely cross to attend the fair.\nThe jury found in answer to questions put to them that the whistle was sounded at the whistling post; that the bell commenced to ring eight or ten rods east of the crossing and rang continuously; that Main Street crossing is in a thickly peopled portion of the village; that the train was running at the rate of twenty miles an hour when it crossed Main Street; that such rate of speed was a dangerous rate for such locality; that the neglect or omission of the company which caused the accident was \u201cneglect in running too fast and for the want of a flagman or gates\u201d; that the warning given by Hallisey (the watchman stationed on that particular day at that crossing by the town authorities) was not sufficient; and that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe question of contributory negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s part does not, in the view I take of the case, require consideration, and the finding as to the time when the bell began to ring, even if sustained by the evidence, which I do not stop to inquire, is not material as it is not found by the jury to have led or contributed to the accident. The negligence which did cause or lead to the accident was found by the jury to be the speed at which the train was running over the street crossing and the absence at such crossing of a flagman or gates.\nThe contention of the plaintiff is that the speed at which the train was running was a violation of the statutory provision of the Railway Act because it was of greater speed than six miles an hour through a thickly peopled portion of the town of Forest, the railway track at the crossing of the street not being fenced as he contended in the manner required by the Act. The plaintiff further says that even if the Act has been complied with as regards fencing, the rate of speed in the absence of gates or watchman at the crossing was a matter at common law open to the jury to pass upon, and if they found it, under the circumstances, a dangerous rate and a cause of the accident the defendant company would be liable.\nThe Court of Appeal reached the conclusion that the proper construction of the statutory provisions with regard to the fencing prescribed at the crossings and the rate of speed at which a train could run though a thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, requires either a fencing across the highway at the crossing, so retaining the travelling public in a place of safety while the train is passing or the stationing of a watchman or the maintenance of a reasonable fence sufficient for the purpose, or the reduction of the speed of the train to the permitted maximum of six miles an hour. As the company had not adopted any of these precautions which the court decided were obligatory by statute they held it liable under the findings of the jury and dismissed the appeal.\nA careful reading and consideration of the whole Railway Act and its general scheme and purpose has led me to the conclusion that the construction placed upon these sections by the Court of Appeal in this case was not the proper one and that the sections relied upon by that court in its judgment do not either require or authorize railway companies, without the previous order of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, to fence highways or place gates across them where they are crossed at the level by the railway, or compel them to place flagmen at these crossings to warn the public when trains are crossing.\nIn my judgment Parliament has by the 187th section of the Railway Act vested in the Railway Committee of the Privy Council the exclusive power and duty of determining the character and extent of the protection which should be given to the public at places where the railway track crosses a highway at rail level. The exercise of such important powers and duties requires the careful consideration of many possible conflicting interests and the fullest powers to enable this committee to bring all such interests before them and determine all necessary facts, are given by the Act in question. Similar powers to enable this tribunal effectively to enforce any order it may make in the premises are vested in the committee. It is quite open to any municipality through which a railway runs at any time it thinks proper, or to any interested person or corporation, or, indeed, to any one of the travelling public to invoke the exercise of this jurisdiction. The composition of the tribunal, the simplicity and ease with which its powers can be invoked, and the completeness with which it can carry out the intentions of Parliament and the scope and extent of its powers, all combine to convince me that Parliament designed to establish and has established a tribunal which while fairly guarding the interests of the railway corporations would at the same time provide the fullest necessary protection to the travelling public. I cannot think that these powers, so full, so complete, and so capable of being made effective, can if exercised be subject to review either as to their adequacy or otherwise by a jury, nor do I think that failure to invoke the exercise of the powers is of itself sufficient to take the matter away from the jurisdiction to which Parliament has committed it and vest it in a jury. If no such statutory powers had been given by Parliament a jury must ex necessitate determine in each case as a question of fact whether with regard to level foot crossings or highway crossings the proper precautions with regard to speed and warnings had been adopted and followed. In a thickly settled country like Great Britain, Parliament has thought fit explicitly to provide that wherever a railroad crosses a highway on a level it shall maintain good and sufficient gates across the road on each side of the railway and employ proper persons to open and shut them. In a country such as Canada such a provision would seriously impede railway development and Parliament instead of adopting it has provided instead that certain signals and warnings such as the blowing of whistles and the ringing of bells should be given before the trains cross the level highways, and has constituted a tribunal specially qualified and equipped for determining what additional safeguards shall be provided for the public protection and safety at these crossings. In some cases such protection is deemed to be sufficiently secured by a watchman alone, in others by a watchman and gates or other suitable protection deemed necessary by the tribunal, while in other cases the highway is required to be carried over or under the railway by means of a bridge or arch instead of crossing the same at rail level. The determination is to be reached after thorough inquiry, and ample powers are conferred upon the tribunal effectively to enforce its conclusions and orders\nI think the proper construction to be placed upon these sections of the Act is that the powers therein given are exclusive and intended to vest in the tribunal selected plenary statutory powers the exercise of which, excepting as otherwise provided, is final. The exceptions embrace the power of reviewing its own decisions from time to time by the tribunal as circumstances may change and the power of appeal to the Governor General in Council, as provided by section 21.\nThe main question decided by the Court of Appeal, namely, the meaning of the sections relating to fencing and speed at level crossings in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village, has yet to be considered. An elaborate factum giving the history of Canadian legislation on the subject was submitted to us by the defendants, but I do not think it necessary for me to do more than refer to the Consolidated Railway Act of 1888 and its amendments. The 197th. section of that Act as amended by the Act of 1892 chapter 27, reads as follows:\nAt every public road crossing at rail level of the railway the fence on both sides of the crossing and on both sides of the track shall be turned into the cattle guards so as to allow of the safe passage of trains.\nThen the 259th section of the Act of 1888 as amended by the Act of 1892, reads as follows:\nNo locomotive or railway engine shall pass in or through any thickly peopled portion of any city, town or village at a speed greater than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced in the manner prescribed by this Act.\nWhatever doubts there may have been as to the meaning of those two sections as they were originally framed in the Act of 1888 have been removed since their amendment by the Act of 1892 as 1 have set them out above. The manner of \u201cfencing prescribed by the Act\u201d is by turning in \u201cthe fences on both sides of the crossing and on both sides of the track to the cattle guards.\u201d Unless and until this is done the limitation upon the speed at which the trains are to cross the highway, namely, six miles an hour, prevails. When it is done the limitation no longer exists. As I have already said these sections neither authorize nor empower the railway to place fences or gates across the highway, and their object was not to provide for the protection of the public travelling along the highway, which was provided for by the 187th section of the Act, but for the \u201csafe passage of trains\u201d and to secure that safe passage as far as possible by the exclusion of animals from the track either by way of the highway or from the adjoining lands.\nThen the 10th section of the Railway Act which authorizes the Railway Committee\nto regulate and limit the rate of speed at which trains may be run in any city, town or village\nwas invoked, and it was pointed out that this power given to the committee was clogged with a limitation that\nthe rate of speed shall not in any case exceed six miles an hour unless the track is properly fenced.\nBut I again point out that this language cannot be held to cover or authorize the fencing of the highways but only the fencing of the track along the lands of the railway company. It is to be regretted that the language had not been changed by Parliament at the time the 259th section was amended and the words \u201cproperly fenced\u2019\u2019 changed to \u201cfenced in the manner prescribed by this Act\u201d as was done in that section. But the words as they stand can mean that and nothing more. They cannot, in my opinion, be construed to take away from the Railway Committee the power of sanctioning a greater speed than six miles an hour unless the track is fenced as a jury may think proper. The Act must be construed with the substituted sections 197 and 259 read into it and the phrase \u201cunless the track is properly fenced\u201d still retained in the 10th section construed as meaning fenced as prescribed by the Act and especially by the 197th section, at the highway crossings. No negligence was found or proved with regard to the fencing and if my construction of the Act is correct there was none, it being admitted that on this construction the fences were all right. That being so the rate of speed at which the train could run across the level highway crossing was a matter solely for the determination of the Railway Committee, as was also the determination of the kind, character and extent of the protection which either by gates, watchman or otherwise, should be provided for the travelling public. As a matter of fact it was proved and found by the jury that the rate of speed of the train in question at this highway was considerably below the schedule rate.\nSuch being the law, as I construe it, I do not think the plaintiff entitled under the findings of the jury to have judgment entered for him.\n\u201cWe were pressed with the decision of this court in the case of Lake Erie and Detroit River Ry. Co. v. Barclay[12], but there is little analogy between the two cases. The learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court in that case expressly disclaimed any intention of deciding the broad questions which we have been called upon here to determine and the judgment went upon the special facts of that case. It by no means follows from the present judgment of this court that railway companies might not be properly adjudged guilty of actionable negligence in cases arising out of shunting cars across highway crossings apart altogether from questions relating to the speed of trains and the legality of their fencing at highway crossings. These cases must be dealt with on their merits as they arise. The appeal should be allowed.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I concur in the above opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hanna & McCarthy.\n[1] 5 Ont.
