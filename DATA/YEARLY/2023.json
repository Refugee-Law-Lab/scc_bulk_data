C\u20115.3, ss. 5, 10.\nIn June 2018, Parliament passed the Cannabis Act (\u201cfederal Act\u201d), which decriminalized the recreational use of cannabis. This Act prohibits the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes, but it exempts the possession and cultivation of no more than four plants from these prohibitions. At the same time, the Quebec legislature introduced its own scheme to regulate cannabis by passing a bill that, among other things, created the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis (\u201cSQDC\u201d), which has a monopoly on the sale of cannabis in Quebec. It also enacted the Cannabis Regulation Act (\u201cprovincial Act\u201d), ss. 5 and 10 of which completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes in a dwelling\u2011house. These prohibitions are accompanied by fines.\nIn October 2018, M brought an action in the Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons who, in Quebec, are liable to be prosecuted for possession of a cannabis plant in their dwelling\u2011house. He argued that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and outside the heads of power assigned to the provinces. He sought a declaration from the Superior Court that these provisions are ultra vires or, in the alternative, that they are of no force or effect pursuant to the doctrine of federal paramountcy. The Superior Court declared ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid. The Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment and affirmed the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 on the basis that they are within the powers conferred on the provinces by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . It also found that the impugned provisions are operative.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Further, the provisions do not frustrate the purpose of the federal legislation and are therefore operative.\nTo decide whether a law or some of its provisions are constitutionally valid under the division of powers, courts must first characterize the law or provisions and then, on that basis, classify them by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\nAt the characterization stage, the pith and substance of the law must be determined by looking at its purpose and effects. To analyze purpose, courts rely on intrinsic evidence, that is, the actual text of the law, as well as extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates. In looking at the effects of the law, courts consider both its legal effects (those related directly to the provisions of the law itself) and its practical effects (the side effects arising from its application). Where very specific provisions of a law that are alleged to be an integral part of a regulatory scheme are being challenged, courts begin by characterizing the provisions rather than considering the validity of the law as a whole. However, this does not mean that the provisions must be read in isolation. Reading and analyzing the impugned provisions in the context of the regulatory scheme into which they are integrated is crucial in distinguishing the purpose of the law from the means chosen to achieve it.\nIn this case, it is essential to analyze ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act in light of their context and not just their wording. With regard to the intrinsic evidence for analyzing purpose, an overview of the provincial Act reveals a broad regulatory scheme that includes the creation of a state monopoly, granted to the SQDC, to oversee each step leading up to the purchase of cannabis by citizens in order to protect the health and security of the public. Sections 5 and 10 do not have the separate and independent objective of prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants for personal purposes. The prohibitions themselves are one means, among a broad range of measures, for achieving the provincial Act\u2019s public health and security objectives, since they act as strong incentives for the integration of consumers into the legal cannabis market. With regard to extrinsic evidence, the remarks made by the members of the Quebec legislature confirm that the prohibitions help to ensure that consumers will buy from the SQDC. The impugned provisions do not represent a colourable attempt to re\u2011enact the prohibitions against possessing and cultivating cannabis repealed by Parliament, given the complete lack of evidence of any \u201cimproper\u201d legislative purpose. As for the effects of the impugned provisions, their practical consequence is to prevent citizens from possessing and cultivating cannabis plants for personal purposes and to force consumers to buy from the SQDC. With regard to legal consequences, the provisions prohibit the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants and impose penal sanctions for any violation. Together, the legal and practical effects confirm the conclusion reached from analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence: the pith and substance of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from the harm caused by this substance.\nAt the classification stage, what must be determined is whether the impugned provisions fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 or within the powers conferred on the provinces over property and civil rights and matters of a merely local or private nature by s. 92(13) and (16), respectively. In this case, even though ss. 5 and 10 seemingly have the characteristics of criminal law, since they contain prohibitions accompanied by penalties and are backed by a valid criminal law purpose, they should still not be classified under s. 91(27). The partial decriminalization of cannabis by Parliament opened the door to provincial legislative action. In prohibiting the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants, the Quebec legislature exercised the power conferred on it by s. 92(15) to enact penal measures in order to enforce an otherwise valid law. Sections 5 and 10, which help to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly and thus to protect the health and security of the public, are clearly related to provincial heads of power, because provincial legislative action in the field of public health is grounded primarily in broad and plenary jurisdiction over property and civil rights (s. 92(13)) and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or private nature in the province (s. 92(16)). The intent behind the Quebec legislature\u2019s action in the field of health in this case was to regulate, not to suppress a threat or an evil. This is important because health, as a matter not assigned in the Constitution Act, 1867 , is an area of overlapping jurisdiction. According to the double aspect doctrine, Parliament and the provincial legislatures may make laws in relation to matters that, by their very nature, have both a federal aspect and a provincial aspect. The regulation of cannabis use has a double aspect, since it may be addressed from the perspective of the criminal law (under s. 91(27)), by suppressing some evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public, and from the perspective of health or trade (under s. 92(13) and (16)), by regulating, among other things, the conditions of production, distribution and sale of the substance. Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which regulate cannabis use from this second, normative perspective, are therefore intra vires the Quebec legislature.\nProvisions of a provincial law that are declared constitutionally valid may nonetheless be declared to be of no force or effect under the doctrine of federal paramountcy when (1) there is an operational conflict or (2) the purpose of a federal law is frustrated. In this case, the only question to be answered is whether there is a conflict of purposes, which involves first establishing the purpose of the federal Act and then determining whether the provisions of the provincial Act are incompatible with that purpose.\nThe purpose of the federal Act is not to create \u2014 with a view to reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis \u2014 positive rights to possess and cultivate up to four cannabis plants for personal purposes. Such an interpretation does not reflect the essentially prohibitory nature of the criminal law power and is not supported by the wording of the federal Act. The prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act directly address several of the objectives of the federal Act set out in s. 7 of that Act. Moreover, even though Parliament and the provincial legislature have taken different approaches to the self\u2011cultivation of cannabis, the provincial Act reflects a concern with combating organized crime, just as the federal Act does. The provincial Act\u2019s public health and security objectives and its prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 are therefore in harmony with the objectives of the federal Act, and there is no basis for finding a conflict of purposes.\nCases Cited\nApplied: Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. v.

Under that legislation, it is prohibited for an individual to possess or cultivate more than four cannabis plants in the individual\u2019s home. The provinces and territories subsequently passed their own legislation to regulate such practical matters as the manner in which cannabis was to be sold and stored. Through a broad legislative initiative that included the creation of a monopoly on the sale of cannabis, the Quebec legislature, for its part, enacted provisions that completely prohibit the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants at home, regardless of the number of plants. What must be determined in this appeal is whether the Quebec provisions are constitutionally valid in light of the division of powers and, if so, whether they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the impugned provisions are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . I also conclude that the impugned provisions do not frustrate the purpose of the federal legislation and are therefore operative.\n[2] In these reasons, I express no opinion on the appropriateness or merits of the approaches adopted by Parliament and the Quebec legislature, respectively. I focus on explaining why two approaches to the self\u2011cultivation of cannabis \u2014 the more \u201cpermissive\u201d federal approach and the more \u201crestrictive\u201d Quebec approach \u2014 can coexist from a legal standpoint within the Canadian federation.\nI. Background\n[3] In 2018, Canada became the second country in the world, after Uruguay, and the very first G7 country to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis. The decriminalization of this psychoactive substance, also called marijuana, marked a real change in the approach that had been taken in this country for nearly a century. The consumption, possession and sale of cannabis had first been criminalized in 1923, when this substance was added to the list of narcotics banned by the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, S.C. 1923, c. 22. Many decades later, cannabis was included in the list of controlled substances in Sch. II of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c. 19 (\u201cCDSA \u201d).\n[4] On June 19, 2018, Parliament passed Bill C\u201145, An Act respecting cannabis and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Criminal Code and other Acts, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl. On October 17, 2018, that statute came into force as the Cannabis Act , S.C. 2018, c. 16 (\u201cfederal Act\u201d). Decriminalizing the recreational use of cannabis is the central feature of this legislation, which excludes this substance from the application of the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 4 to 7.1 of the CDSA . The federal Act prohibits the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes, but it exempts the possession and cultivation of no more than four plants from these prohibitions. The provisions creating the prohibitions read as follows:\nPossession 8 (1) Unless authorized under this Act, it is prohibited . . . (e) for an individual to possess more than four cannabis plants that are not budding or flowering; . . . . . . Production 12 . . . . . . Cultivation, propagation and harvesting \u2014 18 years of age or older (4) Unless authorized under this Act, it is prohibited for an individual who is 18 years of age or older to cultivate, propagate or harvest, or to offer to cultivate, propagate or harvest, . . . (b) more than four cannabis plants at any one time in their dwelling\u2011house.\n[5] The enactment of the federal Act represents a paradigm shift in the Canadian legal landscape. Canada has moved from a suppression\u2011based approach to a scheme that gives the provinces responsibility for determining the framework for the sale and distribution of cannabis within their borders. In other words, the provinces are being called upon to make laws, within their fields of jurisdiction, concerning a substance that was previously subject to criminal prohibitions for nearly a century. The statutes and regulations passed by the provinces in parallel with the federal Act primarily establish rules governing the sale of the substance, for example with regard to the location, operation and staff of the stores where the various cannabis products are sold. Much of the provincial legislation also sets out additional restrictions that supplement the federal legislative framework, including with respect to the minimum age required to purchase cannabis, the applicable limit on the possession of this substance and the places where it may be consumed in public.\n[6] On June 12, 2018, the Quebec legislature introduced its own scheme to regulate cannabis when it passed Bill 157, An Act to constitute the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis, to enact the Cannabis Regulation Act and to amend various highway safety\u2011related provisions, 1st Sess., 41st Leg. The creation of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis (\u201cSQDC\u201d), a subsidiary of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec with a monopoly on the sale of cannabis in Quebec, was one of the most important measures. The enactment of the Cannabis Regulation Act, CQLR, c. C\u20115.3 (\u201cprovincial Act\u201d), was another. The provincial Act contains a broad range of provisions concerning the possession, cultivation, use, transportation, storage, sale and promotion of cannabis in Quebec. The specific provisions of the provincial Act being challenged in this case are ss. 5 and 10, which completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes in a dwelling\u2011house. These prohibitions are accompanied by fines of between $250 and $750, which are doubled for a subsequent offence:\n5. It is prohibited to possess a cannabis plant. Anyone who contravenes the first paragraph commits an offence and is liable to a fine of $250 to $750. Those amounts are doubled for a subsequent offence.\n10. It is prohibited to cultivate cannabis for personal purposes. That prohibition against cultivating cannabis applies, in particular, to the planting of seeds and plants, the propagation of plants from cuttings, the cultivation of plants and the harvesting of their production. Anyone who contravenes the first paragraph by cultivating four cannabis plants or less in their dwelling\u2011house commits an offence and is liable to a fine of $250 to $750. Those amounts are doubled for a subsequent offence. For the purposes of the third paragraph, \u201cdwelling\u2011house\u201d has the meaning assigned by subsection 8 of section 12 of the Cannabis Act (S.C. 2018, c. 16 ).\n[7] Therefore, under ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants are subject to penal sanctions in Quebec \u2014 just as in Manitoba, which has adopted an approach similar to Quebec\u2019s in The Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Control Act, C.C.S.M., c. L153, ss. 101.13(1) and 101.15.\n[8] On October 25, 2018, the appellant in this Court, Janick Murray\u2011Hall, brought an action in the Quebec Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons who, in Quebec, are liable to be prosecuted for possession of a cannabis plant in their dwelling\u2011house and who may thus face the penal consequences arising from the provincial Act. He argued that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and outside the heads of power assigned to the provinces. He sought a declaration from the Superior Court that these provisions are ultra vires or, in the alternative, that they are of no force or effect pursuant to the doctrine of federal paramountcy.\nII. Judicial History\nA. Quebec Superior Court, 2019 QCCS 3664\n[9] On September 3, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in favour of Mr. Murray\u2011Hall and declared ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid.\n[10] To make that finding of invalidity, the court began by characterizing the pith and substance of the impugned provisions as being [translation] \u201cto completely prohibit the personal cultivation of cannabis because it harms the health and security of the public\u201d (para. 51 (CanLII)). In the court\u2019s view, the absolute nature of the prohibitions and the sense of [translation] \u201cgeneral disapproval\u201d (para. 46) of cannabis use revealed by the legislative debates pointed to the conclusion that the impugned provisions are not simply intended to protect the health and security of the public. Rather, their purpose is to [translation] \u201csuppress the personal production of cannabis\u201d (ibid.), as the former provisions of the CDSA did. This led the court to find that the impugned provisions are [translation] \u201ccolourable\u201d. With regard to the argument that the prohibitions established by ss. 5 and 10 are means of achieving the public health and security objectives set out in the provincial Act, the court held that this argument was not supported by the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence or by an examination of the effects of the provisions. In its opinion, [translation] \u201cthe prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 are not means, but rather the very purpose of these provisions\u201d (para. 76).\n[11] The Superior Court continued its analysis of constitutional validity and held that the impugned provisions fall under the federal criminal law power. At the classification stage, the court found that the three prerequisites for valid criminal law are met and that the impugned provisions are similar to the provisions of the CDSA that formerly prohibited the possession and cultivation of cannabis. The court added that the double aspect doctrine does not apply in this case because, given the absolute nature of the prohibitions they contain, ss. 5 and 10 are related solely to the federal criminal law power. Referring to the possibility of limiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes to one, two or three plants, the court noted that [translation] \u201c[i]t is clear that, other than zero plants, the province could have legislated, either for health or for security\u201d (para. 87).\n[12] Finally, the court held that the provisions found to be invalid cannot be saved under the ancillary powers doctrine. They cannot be regarded as sufficiently integrated into the provincial Act, otherwise considered valid as a whole, because the total prohibitions imposed by them were [translation] \u201cnot absolutely necessary\u201d (para. 99). In the court\u2019s view, the provincial legislature could have achieved its objectives by imposing a stricter limit on the number of plants than the federal Act does rather than by imposing absolute prohibitions.\n[13] Having found ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid, the court held that it was not necessary to consider whether the provisions are operative. It also denied the request to suspend the declaration of invalidity on the ground that no legal vacuum or chaos would result from its decision.\nB. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 1325\n[14] In a unanimous decision, the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment and consequently affirmed the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act on the basis that they are within the powers conferred on the provinces by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 .\n[15] At the characterization stage, the court found that the pith and substance of the impugned provisions is to [translation] \u201cput in place one of the means chosen to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly granted to the SQDC\u201d (para. 82 (CanLII)), a monopoly created to prevent and reduce cannabis harm and to protect the health and security of the public. The purpose of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which prohibit possession and cultivation at home, is therefore to steer consumers to the only source of supply trusted by the Quebec legislature. Contrary to what the Superior Court found, the impugned provisions do not have the [translation] \u201cseparate and independent objective of prohibiting the personal cultivation of cannabis\u201d (para. 81). In its reasoning, the Court of Appeal stressed the need to consider the provincial Act as a whole rather than reading ss. 5 and 10 in isolation. It also urged caution in analyzing the legislative debates, which in this case did not demonstrate the existence of colourable legislation aimed at morally suppressing the possession and personal cultivation of cannabis as such.\n[16] At the classification stage, the Court of Appeal found that the impugned provisions are related to the provincial powers conferred by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . It held that this is a proper case for the application of the double aspect doctrine, because the two levels of government are pursuing parallel objectives within their respective fields of jurisdiction. Parliament, it noted, [translation] \u201cis seeking to better control the intrusion of criminal organizations\u201d into the cannabis market by replacing a measure it considers ineffective (total prohibition against possession) with a measure it views as more likely to minimize the role of organized crime (decriminalization of the possession of a limited amount) (para. 93). The provincial legislature, for its part, is trying to ensure effective control over access to cannabis by creating a state monopoly on distribution.\n[17] Having upheld the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions, the Court of Appeal also found that they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. Addressing the possibility that the purpose of the federal Act is being frustrated, the court rejected Mr. Murray\u2011Hall\u2019s argument that Parliament not only decriminalized home cultivation but actually authorized it for the purpose of reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis. The court noted that the text of the federal Act does not expressly confer any positive right to possess or cultivate cannabis plants at home for personal purposes. It added that Mr. Murray\u2011Hall\u2019s argument was particularly troubling because it was based on the idea that Parliament\u2019s criminal law jurisdiction gives it not only the power to prohibit conduct but also the power to formally authorize it. Finally, the Court of Appeal again emphasized the complementarity of the two statutes in issue, which reflect the same concern with combating the harm associated with cannabis consumption. It is therefore possible, in its view, to interpret the federal Act in a manner consistent with the principle of cooperative federalism and to find that it [translation] \u201chas not limited the National Assembly\u2019s power to prohibit the private cultivation of cannabis in implementing means by which to achieve its objectives\u201d (para. 139).\nIII. Issues\n[18] This appeal raises the following two questions:\nA. Did the Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in holding that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally valid?\nB. Did the Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in holding that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally operative?\n[19] Although Mr. Murray\u2011Hall specifically refers only to the first question in his written submissions, I am of the opinion that this Court should also address the second one. A number of Mr. Murray\u2011Hall\u2019s arguments relate to an alleged conflict of purposes between the federal Act and ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. The Court of Appeal also devoted a good part of its reasons to the question of whether the application of the impugned provisions frustrates or undermines the purpose of the federal Act. In these circumstances, I think it wise to address this question, providing all necessary clarifications.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Did the Quebec Court of Appeal Err in Law in Holding That Sections 5 and 10 of the Provincial Act Are Constitutionally Valid?\n[20] As I will explain below, I am of the view that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and that the Court of Appeal therefore made no error in its analysis of the validity of the impugned provisions. I will begin by setting out the analytical framework that I apply to reach this conclusion.\n(1) Analytical Framework\n[21] The analytical framework for determining the constitutional validity of laws is well established and is not the subject of any particular controversy in this case, so a brief review will suffice.\n[22] To decide whether a law or some of its provisions are constitutionally valid under the division of powers, courts must first characterize the law or provisions and then, on that basis, classify them by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 26, citing Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at para. 15).\n[23] At the characterization stage, what must be determined is the pith and substance of the law (Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, at para. 28, citing Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 26). In its jurisprudence, the Court has described the aim of this exercise as being to identify the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the law (RJR\u2011MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 29), its \u201cdominant or most important characteristic\u201d (Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 62\u201163) or its \u201cleading feature or true character\u201d (R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at pp. 481\u201182). At the classification stage, in turn, what must be determined is whether the pith and substance thereby defined comes within one of the heads of power of the enacting legislature (Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25).\n[24] To ascertain the pith and substance of a law, courts look at its purpose and effects (Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 16). This essentially interpretative exercise is meant to be neither technical nor formalistic, to use the words of the late Professor Peter W. Hogg (Constitutional Law of Canada (loose\u2011leaf ed.), vol. 1, at p. 15\u201112, cited in Ward v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 17, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 569, at para. 18). Indeed, in addition to the words used in the law itself, courts may consider the circumstances surrounding its enactment (Ward, at para. 17, citing Reference re Firearms Act, at paras. 17\u201118, and Morgentaler, at p. 483).\n[25] To analyze the purpose of a law, courts rely on intrinsic evidence, that is, the actual text of the law, including its preamble and purpose clauses, as well as extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates and minutes of parliamentary committees (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 27; Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture), 2002 SCC 31, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146, at paras. 53\u201154; Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457 (\u201cReference re AHRA\u201d), at paras. 22 and 184). In looking at the effects of the law, courts consider both its legal effects, namely those related directly to the provisions of the law itself, and its practical effects, that is, the \u201cside\u201d effects arising from its application (Kitkatla Band, at para. 54, citing Morgentaler, at pp. 482\u201183).\n[26] That being said, I would nonetheless emphasize that textual analysis is the focus of the characterization exercise. As Kasirer J. noted in Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, \u201c[i]n the final analysis, it is the substance of the legislation that needs to be characterized, not speeches in Parliament or utterances in the press\u201d (para. 165).\n[27] I will devote the next few sections to these two stages of the analysis \u2014 characterization and classification \u2014 in order to determine whether the Court of Appeal correctly held that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally valid.\n(2) Characterization of the Impugned Provisions\n[28] In my view, the pith and substance of the impugned provisions is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from cannabis harm. It follows that the prohibitions against the possession of cannabis plants and their cultivation at home set out in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a means of serving the public health and security objectives pursued by that Act. With a few slight differences, my conclusion at the characterization stage is the same as that of the Court of Appeal.\n[29] Before embarking on the analysis, I will provide a brief overview of the principles that apply in characterizing provisions that are alleged to be an integral part of a regulatory scheme. It is helpful to clarify the extent to which courts should analyze a law as a whole in order to characterize some of its provisions. The question is relevant in this case because the parties\u2019 disagreement at the characterization stage essentially stems from the emphasis they place, respectively, on the impugned provisions and on the provincial Act considered in its entirety. Mr. Murray\u2011Hall focuses on the provisions themselves and criticizes the Court of Appeal for not truly considering the possibility that their purpose differs from that of the Act as a whole. The Attorney General of Quebec instead stresses the role played by the provisions in the scheme, endorsing the Court of Appeal\u2019s statement that [translation] \u201ctheir real purpose emerges only when they are analyzed in the overall context of the [provincial Act]\u201d (para. 43).\n[30] Where, as in this case, only very specific provisions are being challenged and not the entire law, certain principles apply. A court should begin by characterizing the provisions rather than considering the validity of the law as a whole, a principle articulated by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Attorney General of Canada v. Canadian National Transportation, Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206. However, Dickson J. added, this does not mean that the provisions must be read in isolation. A contextual analysis of the provisions is necessary when they are part of a regulatory scheme. Dickson J.\u2019s remarks in this regard are as follows:\nIt is obvious at the outset that a constitutionally invalid provision will not be saved by being put into an otherwise valid statute, even if the statute comprises a regulatory scheme under the general trade and commerce branch of s. 91(2). The correct approach, where there is some doubt that the impugned provision has the same constitutional characterization as the Act in which it is found, is to start with the challenged section rather than with a demonstration of the validity of the statute as a whole. I do not think, however, this means that the section in question must be read in isolation. If the claim to constitutional validity is based on the contention that the impugned provision is part of a regulatory scheme it would seem necessary to read it in its context. If it can in fact be seen as part of such a scheme, attention will then shift to the constitutionality of the scheme as a whole. [Emphasis added; p. 270.]\n[31] This Court has repeatedly emphasized the need to consider the impugned provisions in light of their interaction with the scheme to which they belong. In Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 14, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 693 (\u201cQuebec (Attorney General) 2015\u201d), one of the issues was whether a provision requiring the destruction of long\u2011gun registration data related to the same matter \u2014 public safety \u2014 as the legislation repealing the registration scheme. Writing for the majority, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. stated the following: \u201c. . . the \u2018matter\u2019 of the provision must be considered in the context of the larger scheme, as its relationship to that scheme may be an important consideration in determining its pith and substance . . .\u201d (para. 30).\n[32] The principle enunciated by McLachlin C.J. in Ward, where the issue was whether a section of federal fisheries regulations prohibiting the sale of young seals was constitutionally valid, is also relevant: \u201cThe question is not whether the Regulations prohibit the sale so much as why it is prohibited\u201d (para. 19 (emphasis in original)). In that case, therefore, the Court could not simply focus on the fact that the impugned provision imposed a prohibition on sale, trade or barter, which could have suggested that it fell within provincial jurisdiction over property or trade. When the why of the prohibition and its interaction with the rest of the scheme were considered, it became apparent that the purpose of the prohibition was to curtail commercial hunting and that Parliament was validly exercising its fisheries power.\n[33] I would also note that reading the impugned provisions in the context of the scheme into which they are integrated is crucial in distinguishing the purpose of the law from the means chosen to achieve it. Indeed, in Ward, McLachlin C.J. cautioned against \u201cconfus[ing] the purpose of the legislation with the means used to carry out that purpose\u201d (para. 25).\n[34] Bearing in mind the principles laid down in National Transportation and the note of caution sounded in Ward, I will now characterize ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. I will consider the purpose of these provisions first and then their effects.\n(a) Purpose of the Impugned Provisions\n(i) Intrinsic Evidence\n[35] Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act set out absolute prohibitions against, respectively, the possession and the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling\u2011house, accompanied by fines of $250 to $750. If we simply focused on the wording of these provisions, as the appellant urges us to do, the concept of prohibition is what would stand out.\n[36] However, it is essential to analyze ss. 5 and 10 in light of their context and not just their wording, because it is the Attorney General of Quebec\u2019s contention that they are an integral part of the regulatory scheme established by the provincial Act. To echo the words of McLachlin C.J. in Ward, it is not just a matter of finding that the prohibitions against possession and cultivation exist; it is important to look at why they are incorporated into the provincial Act\u2019s very specific regulatory scheme.\n[37] It is also my view that the impugned provisions must not be read \u201cseparately\u201d or \u201cindividually\u201d on the pretext that they may relate to a very different matter than the rest of the provisions. As the Court of Appeal said, [translation] \u201c[t]he constitutionality of sections 5 and 10 of the [provincial Act] cannot properly be analyzed in isolation, separately from the [Act] as a whole\u201d (para. 41). Of course, it is quite possible that some provisions of a law may be of \u201ca completely different order\u201d than its other provisions (Westendorp v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43, at p. 51). But such a conclusion cannot be reached without a contextual analysis of the impugned provisions. Logically, it cannot be determined whether there is a marked difference between the purpose of ss. 5 and 10 and that of the rest of the provincial Act\u2019s provisions, as Mr. Murray\u2011Hall alleges, without having considered the Act as a whole.\n[38] An overview of the provincial Act reveals the scope of the regulatory scheme introduced by the Quebec legislature. Like the Court of Appeal, I see this undertaking as involving the creation of a state monopoly that oversees each step leading up to the purchase of cannabis by citizens in order to protect the health and security of the public. The prohibitions set out in ss. 5 and 10, along with the other controls put in place by the Act, are the machinery of this undertaking. Specifically, prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants contributes to the effectiveness of the state monopoly by steering consumers to the only legally authorized source of supply, that is, the state\u2011owned enterprise.\n[39] It is helpful to recall that, at the same time the provincial Act was enacted, the Quebec legislature amended the Act respecting the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec, CQLR, c. S\u201113, to create the SQDC, a subsidiary of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec that would ensure the sale of cannabis \u201cfrom a health protection perspective, in order to integrate consumers into, and maintain them in, the legal market without encouraging cannabis consumption\u201d (s. 16.1 para. 1; see also s. 3 of Bill 157).\n[40] The provincial Act sets out the various aspects governing the exercise of the SQDC\u2019s monopoly on the sale of cannabis (s. 25), including control over the location of retail outlets (ss. 27 and 33), control of the quality of the products offered (ss. 29, 44 and 45), a prohibition against selling to persons under 21 years of age (ss. 34 to 39), education of consumers on the health risks of cannabis (ss. 30, 31 para. 2, 41 and 57 para. 2), and compliance with display, signage and packaging standards (ss. 40 to 42, 56 and 57). In my view, the prohibitions and control mechanisms provided for by the provincial Act must be regarded as means chosen to achieve the purposes stated in the first paragraph of s. 1, that is, \u201cto prevent and reduce cannabis harm in order to protect the health and security of the public and of young persons in particular\u201d and \u201cto ensure the preservation of the cannabis market\u2019s integrity\u201d. These prohibitions and control mechanisms follow logically from the stated purposes because they make it possible, as the second paragraph of the same section says, to regulate \u201cthe possession, cultivation, use, sale and promotion of cannabis\u201d.\n[41] Like the provisions just mentioned, ss. 5 and 10 are part of the monopolistic logic intended by the Quebec legislature, and the prohibitions they impose are a means of achieving the objectives of public health and security.\n[42] In reality, the impossibility of possessing and cultivating cannabis plants at home without risking penal sanctions has the effect of steering Quebec consumers to the safe source of supply that is the SQDC. As a result, they receive quality\u2011controlled products and advice from sales employees who have been trained on the risks associated with cannabis consumption (on the first point, see ss. 29, 44 and 45 of the provincial Act and the Regulation to determine other classes of cannabis that may be sold by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis and certain standards respecting the composition and characteristics of cannabis, CQLR, c. C\u20115.3, r. 0.1; on the second point, see s. 1 and Sch. I of the Regulation respecting training on the retail sale of cannabis and information to be communicated to a purchaser in the course of a cannabis sale, CQLR, c. C\u20115.3, r. 1). The fact that consumers buy from the SQDC also means that they are subject to a series of requirements, the most important of which seems to me to be the one setting a minimum age of 21 years for purchasing cannabis from the SQDC.\n[43] The essence of the position advanced by the appellant in this Court is that the purpose of the provincial Act could have been achieved by regulating \u2014 rather than completely prohibiting \u2014 home cannabis cultivation, for example by allowing the possession and cultivation for personal purposes of one, two or three cannabis plants. He argues that, by choosing absolute prohibitions instead, the provincial legislature interfered unduly in the exercise of the federal criminal law power. I note that the absolute nature of the prohibitions was also raised by the trial judge, who saw it as an indication that the Quebec legislature [translation] \u201cin fact sought to mitigate the repeal of the former provisions criminalizing the personal cultivation and possession of cannabis plants\u201d (para. 45).\n[44] In my opinion, however, this distinction between the absolute prohibitions being challenged and the more flexible prohibitions mentioned with respect to the permitted number of plants is of no assistance to the appellant. Even if it is accepted that the objective of protecting the health and security of the public could have been achieved by regulating home cannabis cultivation less strictly and not only by completely prohibiting it, this argument is far from being determinative in identifying the pith and substance of the impugned provisions. When two approaches are considered to be potentially effective, it falls to legislative bodies to choose the one that is most likely to further the intended objectives. Indeed, this Court has pointed out on several occasions that considerations relating to the efficacy or wisdom of the means chosen are not helpful at the characterization stage (Ward, at paras. 18 and 22; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 18, citing Morgentaler, at pp. 487\u201188; Reference re Securities Act, 2011 SCC 66, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 837, at para. 90; Reference re Anti\u2011Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, at p. 425).\n[45] In short, when viewed together with the other provisions of the provincial Act, ss. 5 and 10 do not have the separate and independent objective of prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants for personal purposes. The prohibitions themselves must be seen as one means among a broad range of measures that the Quebec legislature has deemed necessary in order to achieve the provincial Act\u2019s public health and security objectives. In particular, the prohibitions act as strong incentives for the integration of \u201cconsumers into . . . the legal market\u201d that ensures, among other things, control of the quality of the products offered, education on the risks of cannabis consumption and compliance with rules on the minimum age for purchasing cannabis (see s. 16.1 para. 1 of the Act respecting the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec; see also R.F., at para. 12).\n(ii) Extrinsic Evidence\n[46] In my view, the usefulness of the legislative debates in this appeal is relative. I adopt the Court of Appeal\u2019s observation that [translation] \u201c[r]eading them tends . . . to show that the remarks made about the impugned provisions are consistent with the purpose identified earlier in analyzing the intrinsic evidence\u201d (para. 72). The remarks made by the members of the Quebec legislature thus serve to confirm what was already apparent from the interaction between the impugned provisions and the rest of the prohibitions and control mechanisms provided for by the provincial Act, namely that the prohibitions against possession and cultivation at home help to ensure that consumers will buy from the SQDC.\n[47] It can be seen from the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Health and Social Services that the members of the Quebec legislature considered two approaches to home cultivation: one relying on an absolute prohibition against the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants to ensure that consumers would buy from the state, and the other relying on tolerance of these practices as a lever in the fight against organized crime and the \u201cempowerment\u201d of low\u2011income consumers (see National Assembly, Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, vol. 44, No. 189, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., March 21, 2018, at pp. 22 (S. Jolin\u2011Barrette) and 35 (M. Mass\u00e9); National Assembly, Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, vol. 44, No. 191, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., March 27, 2018, at p. 3 (S. Pag\u00e9)). The Quebec legislature clearly chose the first of these two approaches.\n[48] A comment made by a member of the opposition, which the Minister responsible for Public Health later endorsed, is revealing: [translation] \u201cOut of a concern for public security, out of a concern for public health, out of a concern for proceeding gradually, we make the choice, as a state, not to allow home cultivation, and for purposes of public health and security, we want to guide consumers to the stores of a subsidiary of the state\u2011owned enterprise to make sure that cannabis is consumed responsibly\u201d (Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, March 21, 2018, at p. 22 (S. Jolin\u2011Barrette)). The legislature\u2019s intention was to promote responsible consumption of the substance by establishing a scheme in which individuals, denied the option of cultivating their own cannabis, would be steered to SQDC outlets.\n[49] That being said, I acknowledge that the discussion concerning the extrinsic evidence in the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal related mainly to the question of whether the impugned provisions were a form of \u201ccolourable legislation\u201d. For this reason, the following remarks are in order.\n[50] The concept of \u201ccolourable legislation\u201d refers to legislation that seemingly deals with a matter within the jurisdiction of the enacting level of government but that is actually addressed to a matter outside that jurisdiction (Morgentaler, at p. 496). It has long been accepted that recourse may be had to extrinsic evidence, insofar as it reflects the legislative intent, in order to determine the alleged \u201ccolourability\u201d of legislation (Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, at pp. 318\u201119).\n[51] The appellant submits that the members of the Quebec legislature demonstrated on a number of occasions that their intent was to thwart Parliament\u2019s chosen approach to home cultivation and thus to enact, in \u201ccolourable\u201d form, the provisions of the CDSA that formerly prohibited the possession and cultivation of cannabis. This argument cannot be accepted.\n[52] It is true that some uneasiness was expressed within the walls of the National Assembly over the decriminalization bill, which was introduced on the sole initiative of the federal government. The members of the Quebec legislature also deemed it appropriate to reiterate the dangerousness of cannabis because of the risk \u2014 perceived or recognized \u2014 that this substance would be normalized by the passage of the federal Act. The appellant refers us to the speech made by the Minister responsible for Public Health during the last stages leading to the passage of the final version of Bill 157:\n[translation] This bill positions and prepares Quebec for the imminent legalization of cannabis, unilaterally imposed, let us be honest, Madam President, by the federal government. I want citizens to clearly understand that neither the Quebec government nor the members of the opposition nor anyone here in Quebec requested this. It ended up on our agenda following a decision of the federal government. So, we had to work with extremely tight deadlines and a high degree of uncertainty with respect to federal intentions. To say that it was a real challenge is an understatement, Madam President. Our ultimate goal, the same from the outset, was to offer the best possible regulation of this substance on our territory, given the stakes. And, I would like to repeat, Madam President, that cannabis is not a benign, harmless substance. I say to young persons: It is not a great idea to smoke cannabis. [Emphasis added.]\n(National Assembly, Journal des d\u00e9bats, vol. 44, No. 346, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., June 6, 2018, at pp. 21972\u201173 (L. Charlebois))\n[53] Statements like these are, however, far from sufficient for a finding of colourability. As Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. noted in Quebec (Attorney General) 2015, \u201c[c]ourts are, for good reasons, reluctant to find legislation to be colourable\u201d (para. 31). If the colourability doctrine were applied less narrowly, there would be a danger that courts would overstep their judicial role and make decisions based on policy considerations, thereby expressing \u201cdisapproval of either the policy of the statute or the means by which the legislation seeks to carry it out\u201d (ibid.).\n[54] In my view, the Minister\u2019s statements do not show an intent to recriminalize what Parliament sought to decriminalize. Rather, they reflect a general concern about the risks arising from cannabis consumption, particularly for younger individuals. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, this concern was expressed repeatedly in the House of Commons when Bill C\u201145 was being examined (para. 102). Quite a few members of Parliament noted that \u201cCanadians, including children and youth\u201d, have some of the highest rates of cannabis use in the world and that the effects of cannabis may be particularly dangerous for young people who use it (ibid., quoting House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 183, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 30, 2017, at p. 11706 (M. Mendicino)). Viewed in such a context, the Minister\u2019s statements simply show that concerns about the harmful effects of cannabis on health did not disappear merely because this substance was decriminalized. In other words, the concerns expressed by members of Parliament while debating Bill C\u201145 were echoed in the National Assembly of Quebec.\n[55] A parallel was drawn by the trial judge between the circumstances of this case and those of Morgentaler, in which the pith and substance of a Nova Scotia statute that prohibited abortion, other than in a hospital, was not control over private health care institutions but rather the restriction of abortion as a socially undesirable practice that should be suppressed or punished. Among other things, Morgentaler reiterated \u201c[t]he guiding principle . . . that the provinces may not invade the criminal field by attempting to stiffen, supplement or replace the criminal law . . . or to fill perceived defects or gaps therein\u201d (p. 498). In the present case, the appellant argues that this principle is undermined by ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which are designed to remedy the repeal of the provisions that once criminalized the personal production of cannabis.\n[56] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the circumstances of this case differ from those of Morgentaler. The statements made by the members of the provincial legislature in Morgentaler showed direct opposition to freestanding abortion clinics as a \u201cpublic evil\u201d to be eliminated and left no ambiguity regarding the intent behind the impugned legislation (p. 503). Moreover, many important concerns relating to the stated purpose of the statute \u2014 for example, health care costs or objections to a two\u2011tier system of access to medical services \u2014 had not been mentioned during the legislative debates. The same cannot be said of the conduct of the debates that led to the enactment of the provincial Act and the provisions challenged in this case. When the prohibitions against the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants were debated by the members of the Quebec legislature, they were clearly viewed from the perspective of the stated purposes of the Act, that is, preserving the cannabis market\u2019s integrity and protecting the health and security of the public.\n[57] Given the complete lack of evidence of any \u201cimproper\u201d legislative purpose, and exercising the caution with which this Court has always dealt with allegations of colourability, I cannot accept the appellant\u2019s argument. The impugned provisions do not represent a colourable attempt to re\u2011enact the criminal law prohibitions repealed by Parliament.\n(b) Effects of the Impugned Provisions\n[58] The effects of the impugned provisions are clear, and I agree with the manner in which the Superior Court described them in its reasons:\n[translation] . . . the practical consequence of applying ss. 5 and 10 is one, to prevent citizens from possessing and cultivating cannabis plants for personal purposes and two, to force consumers to purchase cannabis from the SQDC.\nThe legal consequences of the provincial provisions are one, to prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the personal cultivation of cannabis and two, to impose penal sanctions for any violation. They also result in penal consequences for acts that were formerly criminal under federal legislation, the CDSA . [paras. 49\u201150]\n[59] I would add, however, that while the impugned provisions do bring otherwise decriminalized conduct into the sphere of penal law, the consequences flowing from a contravention are very different from those arising under the provisions of the CDSA . Persons who contravene ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are liable to fines that could be said to be relatively modest, since they range from $250 to $750.\n[60] Together, the legal and practical effects described above confirm the conclusion I reached earlier after analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. The purpose of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act is not to suppress possession and cultivation at home as such, but rather to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public from cannabis harm.\n[61] One final point concerning the effects of the impugned provisions warrants further comment. The intervener the Canadian Association for Progress in Justice submits that the colourability of the impugned provisions may be revealed by considering their effects, in addition to looking at the legislative debates. Specifically, it argues that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act and a series of criminal offences set out in the federal Act have the combined effect of recriminalizing conduct that has nonetheless been decriminalized. The provincial prohibitions allegedly transform cannabis plants possessed or cultivated by individuals in Quebec into a form of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d within the meaning of s. 2 of the federal Act, which defines this term as follows: \u201c. . . cannabis that is or was sold, produced or distributed by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act or any provincial Act . . . .\u201d The possession, distribution, cultivation and production of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d are the subject of criminal offences under ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1), respectively, of the federal Act. According to the intervener, the impugned provisions of the provincial Act therefore create not only regulatory offences but also criminal offences because of the \u201cillicit\u201d nature of the plants cultivated in Quebec dwelling\u2011houses.\n[62] I accept the premise that considering the legislative debates and analyzing effects may be helpful in establishing the colourability of a law. The Court stated this itself in Reference re Firearms Act, noting that \u201cthe effects of the law may suggest a purpose other than that which is stated in the law\u201d and that a law \u201cis sometimes said to be \u2018colourable\u2019\u201d where its effects diverge substantially from its stated aim (para. 18). That being said, however, I cannot accept the argument that the recriminalization of conduct that has been decriminalized in this case is an effect of the provincial provisions, when their interaction with the federal Act is taken into account. Parliament drafted the definition of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d by reference to provincial legislation and in such a way that conduct for which penal sanctions are imposed by the provinces is subject to the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1) of the federal Act. The possibility that the possession or cultivation of one to four cannabis plants at home could be recriminalized therefore arises solely from the decision made by Parliament to contemplate provincial regulatory action in s. 2 of the federal Act. To put it simply, any possible recriminalization results not from the provincial provisions but only from the federal provisions.\n[63] To accept the intervener\u2019s argument would mean that the enactment by a province of any prohibition against cannabis for regulatory purposes would be ultra vires because it would already be covered by the definition of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d and by the possible application of the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1) of the federal Act. In practical terms, this would negate the provinces\u2019 power to regulate the use of this substance. Such a result would be contrary to the view of federalism espoused by this Court and to the clear intention of Parliament. On this last point, Parliament obviously assumed that the provinces would be able to legislate with respect to cannabis within their fields of jurisdiction \u2014 hence the reference to provincial legislation in the definition of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d.\n(c) Conclusion on Pith and Substance\n[64] For the reasons given above, I conclude that the pith and substance of ss. 5 and 10 is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from the harm caused by this substance. Prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants is not in itself the purpose of the impugned provisions, but rather a means of steering consumers to the only source of supply considered to be reliable and safe.\n(3) Classification of the Impugned Provisions\n[65] In this case, the question before us at the classification stage is whether the impugned provisions fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 or within the powers conferred on the provinces over property and civil rights and matters of a merely local or private nature by s. 92(13) and (16), respectively. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are related to the provinces\u2019 powers and are therefore intra vires the Quebec legislature.\n[66] To begin with, I cannot accept the trial judge\u2019s reasoning, which the appellant urges us to adopt, to the effect that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act have the three essential elements of valid criminal law and thus fall within federal jurisdiction. With regard to the first two elements, it seems to me to be beyond doubt that the impugned provisions contain prohibitions that are accompanied by penalties (Reference as to the Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1 (\u201cMargarine Reference\u201d), at pp. 49\u201150). As for the third element, this Court has already recognized that protecting vulnerable groups from the health risks associated with cannabis is a valid criminal law purpose (R. v. Malmo\u2011Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at paras. 76\u201178). That being said, it should be noted that, in this context, the Quebec legislature was seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public.\n[67] In my view, even though ss. 5 and 10 seemingly have all the characteristics of criminal law, they should still not be classified under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 . For the reasons that follow, I believe that the classification of the provisions challenged in this case cannot be determined simply on the basis of the correspondence between the three requirements set out in the Margarine Reference on the one hand and these provisions on the other.\n[68] First, Parliament\u2019s decision to decriminalize conduct leaves the field clear for the provinces to enact their own prohibitions accompanied by penalties in relation to that conduct, as long as the prohibitions serve to enforce laws relating to matters within provincial jurisdiction (s. 92(15) of the Constitution Act, 1867 ). It follows that penal regulatory measures adopted by the provinces with regard to decriminalized activities are not necessarily attempts to legislate in criminal matters. This is why Major J. wrote in Siemens v. Manitoba (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 3, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 6, that \u201c[t]he mere presence of a prohibition and a penalty does not invalidate an otherwise acceptable use of provincial legislative power\u201d (para. 25).\n[69] Second, it is recognized that the provinces have jurisdiction to make laws in relation to several matters that touch on purposes that otherwise constitute valid criminal law purposes. In the Margarine Reference, Rand J. referred to \u201c[p]ublic peace, order, security, health, morality\u201d as the ordinary though not exclusive \u201cends\u201d served by criminal law (p. 50). Although public peace, order, security, health and morality are classic criminal law purposes, the provinces may consider such imperatives in designing their own regulatory schemes. As explained in Siemens, \u201c[t]he fact that some of th[e] considerations [taken into account by the provincial legislature] have a moral aspect does not invalidate an otherwise legitimate provincial law\u201d (para. 30). Here, the mere fact that the Quebec legislature considered the real risk that cannabis consumption poses for certain vulnerable populations when it enacted legislation is not in itself an indication of encroachment on the field of criminal law.\n[70] Rather than taking the analytical framework developed in the Margarine Reference as a starting point, as the trial judge did, I will characterize the impugned provisions by considering the constitutional bases for provincial legislative action in the field of public health.\n[71] In this case, the partial decriminalization by Parliament of the possession, sale and distribution of cannabis and the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants opened the door to provincial legislative action. In prohibiting the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants, the Quebec legislature exercised the power conferred on it by s. 92(15) to enact penal measures in order to enforce an otherwise valid law. I found above that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act create a scheme that ensures the effectiveness of the state monopoly and that they in fact advance the objectives of public health and security. Characterized in this way, the impugned provisions are clearly related to the provincial heads of power in s. 92(13) and (16). This is because provincial legislative action in the field of public health is grounded primarily in broad and plenary jurisdiction over property and civil rights (s. 92(13)) and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or private nature in the province (s. 92(16)) (Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 18).\n[72] A word about these two heads of power as distinct bases for the validity of ss. 5 and 10. In Dupond v. City of Montreal, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 770, Beetz J. wrote that the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the provincial legislatures a general power to \u201cmake laws in relation to all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province\u201d, the various heads of power enumerated in s. 92 being only \u201cillustrative\u201d and s. 92(16) establishing a residual power (p. 792). In this case, similarly to what was found in Dupond, the impugned provisions derive constitutional validity not only from s. 92(16) but also from s. 92(13). The power conferred by s. 92(13) relates to private law, that is, the law pertaining to interpersonal relationships (H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at p. 495, para. VI\u20112.109).\n[73] With this clarified, I must now explain how the intent behind the Quebec legislature\u2019s action in the field of health in this case was to regulate, not to suppress a threat or an evil. This is important because health, as a matter not assigned in the Constitution Act, 1867 , is an area of overlapping jurisdiction (RJR\u2011MacDonald, at para. 32; Schneider v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 112, at p. 142; Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, at para. 68). In Reference re Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act, Karakatsanis J. described the overlap of powers in this field as follows: \u201cHealth is an \u2018amorphous\u2019 field of jurisdiction, featuring overlap between valid exercises of the provinces\u2019 general power to regulate health and Parliament\u2019s criminal law power to respond to threats to health . . .\u201d (para. 93). It is also well established that both levels of government have authority to make laws in relation to the production, distribution and sale of products that present a danger to public health, including tobacco and alcohol (RJR\u2011MacDonald, at paras. 36\u201138; R. v. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213, at para. 131; Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at pp. 63 and 67\u201168).\n[74] Here, the Quebec legislature saw the possession and personal cultivation of cannabis not as a social evil to be suppressed, but rather as a practice that should be prohibited in order to steer consumers to a controlled source of supply. It is helpful to draw an analogy with this Court\u2019s conclusions in Schneider, in which British Columbia\u2019s Heroin Treatment Act, S.B.C. 1978, c. 24, was found to be intra vires the provincial legislature under s. 92(16). In the Court\u2019s view, the purpose of the legislation was not to punish persons with a drug addiction, but rather to regulate their medical treatment and ensure their safety (Schneider, at pp. 132\u201133). In the instant case, and in a spirit similar to that of the legislation challenged in Schneider, the prohibitions set out in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act do not have punitive purposes as such, but instead reflect an approach based on regulating and supervising access to the substance.\n[75] In light of the foregoing, ss. 5 and 10 therefore fall not within the sphere of the criminal law but rather within the provinces\u2019 general power to regulate health.\n[76] While it is true that prohibitions similar to those set out in ss. 5 and 10 have been enacted by Parliament in the past under the federal criminal law power, this can be explained by the double aspect doctrine. This doctrine reflects the contemporary view of federalism and constitutional interpretation, which recognizes that overlapping powers are unavoidable (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 42). According to the double aspect doctrine, Parliament and the provincial legislatures may make laws in relation to matters that, by their very nature, have both a federal aspect and a provincial aspect (Desgagn\u00e9s Transport Inc. v. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Canada Inc., 2019 SCC 58, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 228, at para. 84). It will therefore be possible to apply the double aspect doctrine where each level of government has a \u201ccompelling\u201d interest in enacting legislation on different aspects of the same activity or matter (para. 85). In practice, without creating concurrent jurisdiction over a matter, the double aspect doctrine \u201callows for the concurrent application of both federal and provincial legislation\u201d (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 66 (emphasis deleted)).\n[77] This appeal is a textbook case for the application of the double aspect doctrine. The regulation of the use of drugs, including cannabis, has both federal and provincial aspects, which makes it conceivable that laws enacted by both levels of government will apply concurrently. This matter has a double aspect, since it may be addressed from two different perspectives: (1) that of the criminal law (under s. 91(27)), by suppressing some \u201cevil\u201d or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public; and (2) that of health or trade (under s. 92(13) and (16)), by regulating, among other things, the conditions of production, distribution and sale of the substance. Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act regulate cannabis use from this second, normative perspective and are therefore within provincial jurisdiction.\n[78] I conclude this section by emphasizing that the impugned provisions do not encroach on the federal criminal law power merely because they create absolute prohibitions. The trial judge expressed the contrary view, explaining that [translation] \u201cthe province has lost its jurisdiction by deciding to completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes\u201d (para. 86). That inference has no support in law and disregards the fact that many regulatory prohibitions are absolute in nature without being considered criminal law prohibitions. I need only refer, by way of example, to the prohibition against selling tobacco to minors set out, in Quebec law, in ss. 13 and 14.4 of the Tobacco Control Act, CQLR, c. L\u20116.2.\n(4) Conclusion on the Constitutional Validity of the Impugned Provisions\n[79] The presumption of constitutional validity of legislation remains a cardinal principle of our division of powers jurisprudence (Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R. 198, at p. 255; Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 662, at pp. 687\u201188; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 162; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25). According to this presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be intra vires the level of government that enacted it.\n[80] Here, the onus was on the appellant to show that, in pith and substance, ss. 5 and 10 are not related to one of the classes of subjects under provincial jurisdiction. He failed to do so. The matter of the impugned provisions is not the moral suppression of personal cannabis production. Rather, their pith and substance is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public from the harm caused by this substance.\n[81] For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and that the Court of Appeal therefore made no error in its review of the validity of the impugned provisions.\n[82] Although this is not a determining factor, I note that the Attorney General of Canada did not intervene in this case to contest the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. My conclusion on the validity of these provisions is very much in keeping with the spirit of caution that guides courts when the federal government forgoes any participation in the proceedings: \u201c. . . the Court should be particularly cautious about invalidating a provincial law when the federal government does not contest its validity . . .\u201d (OPSEU v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 19).\nB. Did the Quebec Court of Appeal Err in Law in Holding That Sections 5 and 10 of the Provincial Act Are Constitutionally Operative?\n[83] In this second part, I will address whether the doctrine of federal paramountcy applies in this case, which would mean that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act would be declared to be of no force or effect only to the extent of their inconsistency with the federal Act. Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that the impugned provisions are operative. The application of the absolute prohibitions set out in the provincial Act does not frustrate the federal purpose identified by the appellant. Contrary to what he argues, the purpose of the federal Act is not to create \u2014 with a view to reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis \u2014 positive rights to possess and cultivate up to four cannabis plants for personal purposes. Such an interpretation of the purpose of the federal Act does not reflect the essentially prohibitory nature of the criminal law power and is not supported by the wording of that Act.\n[84] By way of introduction, I will outline the circumstances in which the doctrine of federal paramountcy applies. There is an inconsistency that justifies giving precedence to a federal law over a valid provincial law when there is an operational conflict or when the purpose of the federal law is frustrated. In the former case, the operational conflict means that it is impossible to comply with both laws simultaneously, such as \u201cwhere one enactment says \u2018yes\u2019 and the other says \u2018no\u2019\u201d, as it was put in Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, at p. 191. In the latter case, \u201cimposing an obligation to comply with provincial legislation would in effect frustrate the purpose of a federal law\u201d (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 73). As Major J. noted in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2005 SCC 13, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 188, at paras. 14\u201115, the existence of either of these situations is enough to trigger the application of the federal paramountcy doctrine, but this does not mean that proving their existence is easy.\n[85] Indeed, the burden of proof that rests on the party alleging an operational conflict or a conflict of purposes is a high one (Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 27; Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Lemare Lake Logging Ltd., 2015 SCC 53, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 419, at paras. 21\u201123). This requirement arises from the cardinal rule of constitutional interpretation that \u201c[w]hen a federal statute can be properly interpreted so as not to interfere with a provincial statute, such an interpretation is to be applied in preference to another applicable construction which would bring about a conflict between the two statutes\u201d (Attorney General of Canada v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 307, at p. 356). I am also of the view that the need for the greatest possible precision in the analysis of operability takes on particular importance in circumstances such as those in this case, where the legislative subject matter has a double aspect. It is essential \u201cto avoid eroding the importance attached to provincial autonomy\u201d, a concern I expressed in, among other cases, References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, at para. 128.\n[86] For the reasons that follow, and in light of the \u201crestrained\u201d approach to paramountcy that guides the Court, I am of the view that the appellant has not met his burden of proof.\n[87] I want to dispel at once any notion that there is an operational conflict between the impugned provisions and the federal Act. When questioned by the Court on this point, the appellant in fact conceded that it is possible to obey both laws, which suggests that there is no operational conflict. By not possessing or cultivating cannabis plants in their homes, individuals in Quebec can thus easily comply with both the federal Act, which exempts the possession and cultivation of up to four cannabis plants from the application of its scheme of criminal offences, and the provincial Act, which prohibits the possession and cultivation of any cannabis plant in a dwelling\u2011house.\n[88] Therefore, the only question to be answered is rather whether a federal purpose is being frustrated, which in this case involves first establishing the purpose of the federal Act and then determining whether the provisions of the provincial Act are incompatible with that purpose (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 SCC 39, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 66).\n[89] The appellant\u2019s position on the frustration of the federal Act\u2019s purpose can be briefly summarized. He alleges that the incompatibility results from the fact that the provincial Act does not merely limit what the federal Act allows, namely the cultivation and possession of up to four cannabis plants in a dwelling\u2011house, but instead prohibits it completely. In making such an argument, the appellant assumes that ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) of the federal Act have in fact created a positive right to self\u2011cultivate cannabis. According to the appellant, positively and expressly authorizing the home cultivation of a maximum of four cannabis plants is the purpose of the federal provisions. In its more refined form, this argument amounts to suggesting that granting Canadians a positive right to possess or cultivate up to four cannabis plants is the specific purpose of ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b). Such a purpose is allegedly being pursued in order to achieve other more general purposes of the federal Act set out in s. 7 of that Act, including eliminating or reducing the illicit cannabis market (s. 7(c)) (see the distinction drawn between a specific purpose and a general purpose in Rothmans, at para. 25).\n[90] In my opinion, the appellant\u2019s position cannot be accepted. The purpose of the federal Act\u2019s provisions is not to create a positive right to self\u2011cultivate cannabis as part of a broader objective of limiting the influence of organized crime. Such a purpose would be inconsistent with the fact that \u201cthe criminal law power is essentially prohibitory in character\u201d (Rothmans, at para. 19), a fact that has been recognized in Canadian law since the leading case of Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310 (P.C.). As McLachlin C.J. noted in Reference re AHRA, \u201c[t]he federal criminal law power may only be used to prohibit conduct\u201d (para. 38). It follows that when exceptions are carved out for practices that Parliament does not wish to prohibit, this \u201conly means that a particular practice is not prohibited, not that the practice is positively allowed by the federal law\u201d (ibid. (emphasis deleted)).\n[91] It is true that, in everyday language and even in the speeches of some parliamentarians, the creation of exceptions or exemptions under a scheme of criminal offences is often described as a \u201clegalization\u201d effort. However, this way of speaking is incorrect and falsely suggests that positive rights authorizing particular conduct have been granted to the public. In this case, the statement by the federal Minister of Health that \u201climited home growing should be allowed\u201d therefore cannot be seen as a clear expression of Parliament\u2019s intent to confer a positive right to self\u2011cultivation (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 314, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 13, 2018, at p. 20875). I would also point out that courts must be careful when relying on parliamentary debates as an expression of legislative intent. The use of this type of extrinsic evidence must be approached \u201cwith caution\u201d given the fact that \u201cstatements by members of Parliament can be poor indicators of parliamentary purpose\u201d (R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 89).\n[92] Furthermore, I note that nothing in the language of ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) indicates that Parliament\u2019s intention was to authorize the self\u2011cultivation of cannabis. On the contrary, these provisions read as classic criminal law: they contain a prohibition and a penalty, and they are directed at an evil relating to public health and safety. They include exemptions for the cultivation and possession of one to four cannabis plants. Their wording leaves no ambiguity regarding the fact that the possession and cultivation of one to four cannabis plants were simply excluded from the scope of the criminal offences provided for in the federal Act. Pointing to the absence of provisions conferring an express right to cultivate cannabis for personal purposes, the Court of Appeal correctly found that [translation] \u201cit seems more accurate to say not that the [federal Act] legalized certain aspects related to the use of this substance, but rather that it decriminalized them\u201d (para. 117).\n[93] The appellant attaches great importance to the fact that s. 7(c) of the federal Act is framed in much more positive or permissive terms, since it states that one of the purposes of the Act is to \u201cprovide for the licit production of cannabis to reduce illicit activities in relation to cannabis\u201d. He sees this as an indication that Parliament truly intended to confer a positive right to self\u2011cultivate. Once again, I cannot accept the appellant\u2019s contentions.\n[94] First, it is not clear that Parliament, through the term \u201clicit production\u201d in s. 7(c), was referring specifically to the home production of cannabis. Rather, I believe that this term conveys a general intention to allow production within the legal framework established by the federal Act. The concept of \u201clicit production\u201d could also be seen, a contrario, as the converse of the concept of \u201cillicit cannabis\u201d, which s. 2 of the federal Act defines as any \u201ccannabis that is or was sold, produced or distributed by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act or any provincial Act or that was imported by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act.\u201d\n[95] Second, even if it is accepted that the concept of \u201clicit production\u201d may refer to home production, the words \u201cprovide for\u201d in s. 7(c) cannot be read as indicating that Parliament granted authorization or permission that created positive rights. They cannot be read in this way because, as I noted above, the creation of positive rights is not a valid exercise of the criminal law power and because the federal Act must be presumed to be constitutionally valid in our review of the operability of the provincial provisions.\n[96] The guidance provided in Rothmans is relevant for the purposes of this appeal. In my view, the principles arising from that case are determinative of the issue of the operability of the impugned provisions. The question in Rothmans was whether provincial legislation that prohibited the promotion of tobacco products in any place accessible to young persons frustrated the purpose of federal legislation that prohibited the promotion of tobacco products except in retail businesses. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had found that the provincial legislation negated the authorization otherwise afforded by the federal legislation for the promotion of tobacco in retail businesses. This Court came to a different conclusion, stating that \u201cParliament did not grant, and could not have granted, retailers a positive entitlement to display tobacco products\u201d (para. 18 (emphasis added)). In addition, statutes enacted pursuant to the criminal law power \u201cdo not ordinarily create freestanding rights that limit the ability of the provinces to legislate in the area more strictly than Parliament\u201d (para. 19 (emphasis added)).\n[97] The principle to be drawn from these excerpts is that the making of exceptions or exemptions under a criminal law scheme cannot serve to confer positive rights to engage in the activities covered by those exceptions or exemptions. This is an important point in a case like the one before us. The provinces can legitimately undertake regulatory initiatives to provide a framework for decriminalized activities without thereby frustrating a purpose \u2014 the creation of positive rights \u2014 that by definition is outside the scope of the federal criminal law power.\n[98] I acknowledge that the circumstances of Rothmans differed from those of this case in one important respect. In Rothmans, the exemption for the retail display of tobacco products did not seem closely related to the achievement of the criminal law purpose of the legislation as a whole, which was to address a national public health problem. As the Court stated in that case, even if it were to be accepted that the federal legislation granted retailers a positive right to display tobacco products, it would be difficult to imagine that such a right could actually help combat a public health evil (para. 20). In the instant case, on the other hand, it could be argued that the exemptions for the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants at home play a direct part in achieving a criminal law purpose, namely discouraging the illicit trade of cannabis. By this logic, the recognition of a positive right to self\u2011cultivate could thus assist in limiting the demand for cannabis from illicit sources or criminal organizations, a purpose that would be undermined by the application of the absolute prohibitions enacted by the Quebec legislature.\n[99] However, I cannot accept that exceptions or exemptions made under a scheme of criminal offences may give rise to positive rights, even where the exceptions or exemptions are closely related to the achievement of criminal law purposes. In recent years, the Court has circumscribed the scope of the federal criminal law power. In Reference re AHRA, for example, McLachlin C.J. cautioned that \u201ca limitless definition [of what constitutes a valid criminal law purpose], combined with the doctrine of paramountcy, has the potential to upset the constitutional balance of federal\u2011provincial powers\u201d (para. 43). In my opinion, modifying the principles from Rothmans would present a similar risk to the constitutional balance of the federal system. The recognition of positive rights created out of exceptions or exemptions closely related to a valid criminal law purpose would improperly extend the scope of the federal criminal law power.\n[100] The principles that emerge from Rothmans are relevant without having to be modified in any way and are applicable to this appeal. This means that the exemptions set out in ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) of the federal Act are not sources of positive rights, despite the fact that they appear to be closely related to the criminal law purpose of combating illicit activities.\n[101] Although this is not in itself determinative in deciding the question of operability, I would observe that the objectives pursued by Parliament and the provincial legislature are consistent. Protecting the health and security of the public and of young persons in particular, combating organized crime and ensuring access to quality\u2011controlled products are all considerations that clearly motivated the enactment of the federal Act and the provincial Act.\n[102] I note in this regard that the provincial prohibitions directly address several of the objectives set out in s. 7 of the federal Act. The provincial Act\u2019s absolute prohibitions against possession and cultivation presumably protect the health of young persons by restricting access to cannabis (s. 7(a)), since home cultivation by persons of full age could make this substance more accessible to minors living under the same roof. The prohibitions also prevent inducements to use cannabis (s. 7(b)), since the presence of cannabis plants in the home may de facto be considered an inducement. They assist in controlling the quality of the products offered (s. 7(f)), since home\u2011cultivated cannabis is not subject to quality standards, such as the maximum concentration of the main active compound in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d). They clearly contribute to public awareness of the health risks associated with cannabis consumption (s. 7(g)), since consumers can be provided with information more easily if they are within a regulated selling framework.\n[103] Finally, I would add that even though Parliament and the provincial legislature have taken different approaches to self\u2011cultivation, the provincial Act reflects a concern with combating organized crime, just as the federal Act does (s. 7(c) and (d)). The provincial legislature was of the view that, by contributing to the creation of a single market, the absolute prohibitions against possession and cultivation at home would serve to limit trafficking in cannabis from unauthorized sources. Furthermore, it is not this Court\u2019s role to decide which of the two approaches \u2014 prohibiting personal production or tolerating it \u2014 is most likely to reduce illicit activities in relation to cannabis. It is sufficient to note that this objective is what guided the legislative action of both levels of government in this case.\n[104] Accordingly, I conclude that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act do not frustrate the purposes stated in the federal Act, including that of reducing the presence of criminal organizations in the cannabis market, and that they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. The provincial Act\u2019s public health and security objectives and its prohibitions are, to a large degree, in harmony with the objectives of the federal Act, and there is no basis for finding a conflict of purposes.\nV. Conclusion\n[105] Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are valid and operative. I would dismiss the appeal.\n[106] The Attorney General of Quebec has requested that costs be awarded to him. In my view, granting that request would not be justified. This Court has the discretion to depart from the usual rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. The fact that a public interest is at stake is one factor in the exercise of this discretion, which is why \u201ca losing party that raises a serious legal issue of public importance will not necessarily bear the other party\u2019s costs\u201d (Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Commissioner of Customs and Revenue), 2007 SCC 2, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 38, at para. 35, citing as an example Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 69). In this case, the appellant is a citizen who has raised important questions of constitutional law relating to an issue of general interest, namely the decriminalization of the recreational use of cannabis and its consequences. In my view, such circumstances weigh in favour of exercising our discretion and, for this reason, the parties will each bear their own costs in this Court and in the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sara\u00eflis Avocats, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lavoie, Rousseau (Justice\u2011Qu\u00e9bec), Qu\u00e9bec; Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario \u2014 Constitutional Law Branch, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Manitoba: Attorney General of Manitoba, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Legal Services Branch \u2014 Ministry of Attorney General, Victoria.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Constitutional Law Branch \u2014 Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Regina.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Attorney General of Alberta \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association for Progress in Justice: IMK, Montr\u00e9al; Dalziel Law Corporation, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Cancer Society: Canadian Cancer Society, Ottawa; Langlois Lawyers, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitors for the intervener Cannabis Amnesty: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto; Ruby Shiller Enenajor DiGiuseppe, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the interveners the Cannabis Council of Canada and the Quebec Cannabis Industry Association: McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n"

Before convictions were entered, H and J applied for stays of proceedings for abuse of process. They claimed that systemic police misconduct and the inhumane conditions of confinement they experienced while on remand caused prejudice to their rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity of the justice system. Amici curiae, who were appointed to represent the interests of the accused and to provide an adversarial context for the court, also put forward an additional ground of police misconduct based on confidential information.\nBefore the stay applications brought by H and J proceeded to a voir dire, the Crown brought a motion for summary dismissal of the applications on the basis that neither application disclosed a sufficient foundation to establish that a voir dire was necessary or would assist the court in determining the merits of the applications. Although the written record on the summary dismissal motion was extensive, there was no opportunity to adduce viva voce evidence or to cross-examine key witnesses in either the open or the in camera portion of the hearing.\nThe trial judge concluded that, even if the applications were taken at their highest, the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings, and, as such, an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) on the merits would not assist the court. She summarily dismissed the applications and ordered the convictions entered. On appeal by H and J, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and remitted the stay applications to the trial court for a voir dire. It held that the trial judge imposed too high a standard to permit the applications to proceed to an evidentiary hearing and that the applications should have been fully addressed and decided at a voir dire on their merits.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAn application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accused\u2019s right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. It is a rigorous standard that allows trial judges to weed out the sort of applications that the summary dismissal power is designed to exclude, but permits most applications to be decided on their merits in proportionate proceedings. In the instant case, the stay applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not have been summarily dismissed.\nTrial judges have the power to summarily dismiss applications made in the criminal law context in certain circumstances. The standard selected for summary dismissal must be based on the two sets of underlying values at play in such proceedings: trial efficiency and trial fairness. These values coexist and both must be pursued in order for each to be realised. In the criminal context, the need for efficient trials to reduce undue delay is manifest. Dismissing unmeritorious applications helps ensure that trials occur within a reasonable time, which is an essential part of the criminal justice system\u2019s commitment to treating presumptively innocent accused persons in a manner that protects their interests in liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial. As for trial fairness, it is more than a policy goal: it is a constitutional imperative. A criminal trial involves allegations made by the state against an accused whose liberty is often at stake. The summary dismissal of criminal applications can curtail the accused\u2019s right to full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter by stopping the accused from fully making arguments and eliciting evidence on their application.\nThe underlying values of trial fairness and trial efficiency mandate the conclusion that a rigorous threshold should be applied to summary dismissal motions in criminal trials. A summary procedure is, as its name suggests, intended to be summary: preliminary, brief, and more in the nature of an overview than a deep dive. Summary dismissal is built upon allegations and supported by the artifice of assuming that the facts asserted are true. By contrast, a hearing on the merits involves a final determination of the facts, and of whether, after a full review, the proven facts support the allegations and ground the requested remedy. A rigorous threshold is also supported by the particular characteristics of criminal trials, including how the trial judge\u2019s broad case management powers can help ensure the efficient, effective and proportionate use of court resources as well as the accused\u2019s fair trial rights. Judges perform a gatekeeping function, and the goal is that only those applications that should be caught by the summary dismissal power are in fact summarily dismissed. Trial judges should err on the side of caution when asked to summarily dismiss an application.\nThe correct threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold promotes both trial efficiency and trial fairness. The \u201cfrivolous\u201d part of the standard weeds out those applications that will necessarily fail, and \u201cmanifestly\u201d captures the idea that the frivolous nature of the application should be obvious. If the frivolous nature of the application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed on its merits. This rigorous standard will allow judges to weed out those applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste court time. It also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those applications which might succeed, including novel claims, are decided on their merits. This standard does not apply to summary dismissal motions that are otherwise subject to a legislated or judicial threshold.\nThe moving party, on a motion for summary dismissal, bears the burden of convincing the judge that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. When applying the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard, the judge should not engage in even a limited weighing of the evidence to ascertain if it is reasonably capable of supporting an inference, nor should the judge decide which among competing inferences they prefer. Any such weighing should be left to the voir dire. The judge must assume the facts alleged by the applicant to be true and must take the applicant\u2019s arguments at their highest. The applicant\u2019s underlying application should explain its factual foundation and point towards anticipated evidence that could establish their alleged facts. Where the applicant cannot point towards any anticipated evidence that could establish a necessary fact, the judge can reject the factual allegation as manifestly frivolous. The judge ought to generally assume the inferences suggested by the applicant are true, even if competing inferences are proffered. The judge should only reject an inference if it is manifestly frivolous, meaning that there is no reasoning path to the proposed inference. A similar approach is taken to the overall application. Because the truth of the facts alleged is assumed, an application will only be manifestly frivolous where fundamental flaws are apparent on the face of the record. Finally, the trial judge\u2019s power to summarily dismiss an application is ongoing. Even if the judge permits the application to proceed to a voir dire, the judge retains the ability to summarily dismiss the application during the voir dire if and when it becomes apparent that the application is manifestly frivolous.\nThe record on a summary dismissal motion should normally be minimal and of a summary nature because extensive evidence often demands the type of time, effort and delay which works to defeat the very purpose of the motion. While both parties are expected to put their best foot forward, there is no need to set firm rules about what type of record ought to be filed. The party who has brought the underlying application bears the minimal burden of providing the judge with the following specifics, through oral or written submissions: (1) what legal principles, Charter provisions, or statutory provisions are being relied on and how those principles or provisions have been infringed; (2) the anticipated evidence to be relied on and how it may be adduced; (3) the proposed argument; and (4) the remedy requested. Deciding whether something more is required and how the summary dismissal motion is to proceed is then within the judge\u2019s case management powers.\nIn the case at bar, the judge erred by failing to take the alleged facts and inferences as true, applying a more merits-based threshold for summary dismissal which was not sufficiently rigorous, and by focussing on the merits and on the ultimate outcome rather than on whether the applications were manifestly frivolous.\nCases Cited\nDistinguished: R. v.

Overview\n[1] In this appeal the Court addresses the standard to be applied in criminal cases when judges are asked to summarily dismiss an application without hearing it on its merits. Specifically, when is it appropriate to summarily dismiss an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process?\n[2] There is a clear consensus in courts across Canada that trial judges have the power to summarily dismiss applications made in the criminal law context in certain circumstances. However, the national case law is divided about the proper threshold to be applied. It is time for this Court to provide guidance on this important issue, which is linked to concepts as fundamental to our criminal justice system as trial fairness and trial efficiency. The chosen standard must protect the accused\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial and full answer and defence while avoiding undue delay and the disproportionate or wasteful use of court resources. It should also discourage decision makers from determining the merits of the underlying application without all the evidence, as this risks unfairness for an efficiency which may be more apparent than real.\n[3] As a result, an application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accused\u2019s right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. It is a rigorous standard that allows trial judges to weed out the sort of applications that the summary dismissal power is designed to exclude, but permits most applications to be decided on their merits in proportionate proceedings.\n[4] In the case at bar, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer applied for stays of proceedings based on abuse of process; the Crown, in turn, asked for and was granted summary dismissal of the stay applications. Based on the trial judge\u2019s own findings, Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s applications for a stay of proceedings were not manifestly frivolous. I agree with the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that it was an error to summarily dismiss them. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. Mr. Haevischer\u2019s stay application will be remitted to the trial court for a voir dire. As requested by Mr. Johnston\u2019s counsel, I make no order in relation to Mr. Johnston, who passed away in prison after this appeal was argued before this Court.\nII. Background\nA. The Surrey Six Murders\n[5] Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were tried and found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Committed on October 19, 2007, what became known as the \u201cSurrey Six murders\u201d were precipitated by a dispute over the drug trade in Surrey, British Columbia, between Corey Lal, the intended victim, and James (Jamie) Bacon, one of the leaders of a criminal organization called the \u201cRed Scorpions\u201d. Pursuant to a conspiracy to kill Mr. Lal, three members of the Red Scorpions \u2014 Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and \u201cPerson X\u201d \u2014 went to Mr. Lal\u2019s drug \u201cstash house\u201d, a suite in a residential apartment building in Surrey, to murder him.\n[6] When Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and Person X arrived at the apartment, they came into contact with Mr. Lal, three of his associates, a gas fitter who was servicing fireplaces in the complex, and a young man who lived across the hall. The latter two victims had no connection to Mr. Lal. Though Mr. Lal was the intended target, the five other victims were also killed to avoid detection. The murders were committed execution-style. The forensic evidence discloses that all six men were shot multiple times at close range while lying on the floor of the apartment and that two different guns were used to kill them.\nB. The E-Peseta Investigation and the Charges\n[7] These horrific high-profile murders led to a multi-year, large-scale Royal Canadian Mounted Police (\u201cRCMP\u201d) investigation, known as \u201cProject E-Peseta\u201d, which eventually resulted in multiple charges against numerous individuals.\n[8] Some five years later, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were each charged with six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. They were ultimately tried together.\n[9] Person X, the third participant in the murders, was unindicted, but pleaded guilty to second degree murder of three of the victims and conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. The Crown had intended to call Person X as a witness at Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s trial, but Person X was ultimately precluded from testifying after an in camera proceeding conducted in the absence of Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer.\n[10] Quang Vinh Thang (Michael) Le and Mr. Bacon, leaders of the Red Scorpions, were charged with the murder of Mr. Lal and with conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. Mr. Le pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in December 2013 and testified in the trial against Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer. Mr. Bacon pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after the Court of Appeal overturned a stay of proceedings that had been entered in his case (R. v. Bacon, 2020 BCCA 140, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 256).\n[11] Person Y, a Red Scorpions member, was another co-conspirator. He acted as a police agent during the investigation in exchange for immunity from prosecution for the Surrey Six murders. However, he subsequently pleaded guilty to two unrelated first degree murders.\n[12] The E-Peseta investigation was complex and plagued by difficulties. While the RCMP believed that the Red Scorpions were responsible for the Surrey Six murders, they were of the view that the only persons who could provide reliable evidence about what happened would be the participants themselves or their close associates, all of whom were \u201chostile\u201d to police. The investigators decided that they needed to cultivate informers who would be willing to testify against those who committed this crime.\n[13] According to the material filed in the record, the investigators developed the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy to \u201cmove criminals and their associates from loyalty to their group to loyalty to the RCMP\u201d (A.R., vol. XIV, at p. 36). Focusing on vulnerable members of the Red Scorpions and girlfriends of Red Scorpions members, the RCMP attempted to \u201cdismantle the inner relationships within the Red Scorpions\u201d and \u201creplace those relationships by building ties between the potential witnesses and themselves\u201d (p. 37). The strategy called for \u201cmaximizing\u201d or \u201ccreating\u201d events in the targeted individual\u2019s world, \u201c[w]ith the goal of putting them in a position where they need to or want to turn to the \u2018decent cop\u2019 for help\u201d (p. 32). By gaining witnesses\u2019 loyalty, the RCMP hoped to obtain their cooperation to solve the murders.\nC. The Trial\n[14] Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s trial, held before Wedge J., was complex and lengthy, due in part to dozens of pre-trial and mid-trial applications and the high number of witnesses. Both were found guilty of all counts.\n[15] One pre-trial application \u2014 Application No. 65 (2013 BCSC 1526) \u2014 bears specific mention. Application No. 65 challenged the Crown\u2019s assertion of informer privilege over certain information. To respect the sensitive nature of informer privilege issues, the hearing in Application No. 65 was held in the absence of both the accused and the public, and amici curiae were appointed to represent the interests of the accused and to provide an adversarial context for the court. The same amici were also appointed for the stay of proceedings applications. The information disclosed to them on Application No. 65 formed the basis of the amici\u2019s sealed submissions on the stay applications.\nD. Applications for a Stay of Proceedings for Abuse of Process\n[16] Before convictions were entered, both defence counsel applied for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process based on the test set out by this Court in R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 32.\n[17] A stay is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (Babos, at para. 31). The defence claimed that egregious police conduct caused prejudice to Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity of the justice system. The allegations fall into three basic categories. The first two, which were raised by defence counsel, are (1) systemic police misconduct; and (2) the inhumane conditions of confinement Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer experienced while on remand. The third category contains the sealed arguments made by the amici.\n[18] The first category contained multifaceted allegations of police misconduct. Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer challenged the investigation\u2019s use of the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy, characterizing it as \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d (2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192, at para. 29). Additionally, they alleged criminal and other misconduct by officers involved in the E-Peseta investigation. In particular, Sgt. Brassington, S\/Sgt. Attew, and two other officers engaged in exploitative sexual relationships with two female protected witnesses. Notably, Sgt. Brassington and S\/Sgt. Attew were lead E-Peseta investigators who were \u201clynchpins\u201d in the efforts to develop and handle witnesses as part of the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy. Finally, they alleged that the police mishandled funds, evidence, witnesses, agents and informants. Among the most egregious allegations were that the four officers who committed misconduct lost evidence and that S\/Sgt. Attew and Sgt. Brassington endangered the safety of two female witnesses by improperly revealing their whereabouts.\n[19] The second category of allegations related to Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s post-arrest conditions of confinement. Defence counsel submitted that Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were deliberately and punitively kept in solitary confinement for 14 months, in harsh and inhumane conditions, contrary to ss. 7 and 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to international human rights obligations. Mr. Haevischer\u2019s cell was cold and filthy, smeared with mucus, feces and blood. Mr. Johnston\u2019s cell, for months, had no natural light. Both were confined to their cells, alone, for 22 or 23 hours per day, with extremely limited opportunities for visits or contact. In effect, they were cut off from all contact. These conditions caused physical deterioration and significant adverse mental health effects \u2014 both feared for their sanity. Defence counsel alleged this illegal treatment was part of the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy and was designed to create the need for the inmates to seek out police help to change their desperate circumstances.\n[20] Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were only released from solitary confinement after Mr. Bacon, who was kept in similarly horrendous conditions pending trial for the Surrey Six murders, successfully brought an application for habeas corpus seeking release into the general prison population (see Bacon v. Surrey Pretrial Services Centre, 2010 BCSC 805, 11 Admin. L.R. (5th) 1, at para. 292). McEwan J., who granted Mr. Bacon\u2019s application, strongly condemned these conditions and found the treatment of Mr. Bacon contrary to both ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter .\n[21] The third category of allegations was put forward by the amici, who argued an additional ground of police misconduct based on confidential information disclosed during Application No. 65. Their submissions were made in camera and ex parte.\nE. The Crown\u2019s Request for a Vukelich Hearing\n[22] In the normal course, these stay applications would be heard in a separate hearing within the trial called a \u201cvoir dire\u201d (R. v. Sadikov, 2014 ONCA 72, 305 C.C.C. (3d) 421, at paras. 30-31; Erven v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, at pp. 931\u201132).[1] At the end of the voir dire, the judge would decide whether the applications succeed or fail on their merits, answering the ultimate question, which is \u201chave the applicants met the applicable burden of proof by establishing facts that fulfill each of the legal requirements of the requested remedy?\u201d In the case at bar, the judge would need to decide whether the applicants have met all three parts of the Babos test such that stays of proceedings are warranted in the circumstances.\n[23] This ultimate question was never answered because the Crown requested that the judge instead first hold the type of hearing described in the British Columbia jurisprudence in R. v. Vukelich (1996), 78 B.C.A.C. 113. Other provinces have similar procedures under different names. A Vukelich hearing occurs before the court hears the merits of the underlying application and is directed to a very different question: Should the underlying application be summarily dismissed or should it be allowed to proceed to a voir dire? The appropriate standard to be applied for this preliminary question about summary dismissal lies at the heart of this appeal.\n[24] In this case, the Crown\u2019s basis for requesting summary dismissal at a Vukelich hearing was that neither defence application disclosed \u201ca sufficient foundation to establish that an evidentiary hearing is necessary or will assist the Court in determining the merits of the application\u201d (A.R., vol. XIV, at p. 22). Even if the allegations were true, the Crown contended that either they would not meet the standard for an abuse of process or they would not amount to the clearest of cases justifying the imposition of a stay.\nF. The Vukelich Hearing Procedure\n[25] Wedge J. agreed to conduct the Vukelich hearing requested by the Crown. The summary dismissal motion was heard over six days and was divided into an open portion and an in camera portion. Defence counsel made submissions and tendered exhibits for the open portion. Only the amici made sealed submissions and filed sealed exhibits during the in camera portion. (Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and defence counsel did not, and still do not, have access to the sealed material.) In neither the open nor the in camera portion of the hearing was there the opportunity to adduce viva voce evidence or to cross-examine key witnesses.\n[26] The written record on the summary dismissal motion was extensive. Multiple exhibits were filed for the open portion of the hearing, including various police documents outlining the RCMP investigative strategy for the E-Peseta investigation and numerous documents regarding Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s confinement. The sealed exhibits filed for the in camera portion of the hearing were significant and augmented the overall record.\n[27] While the open record was large, it did not represent the full range of evidence the defence wanted to place before Wedge J. Defence counsel indicated they wished to elicit additional evidence, should the judge decide to hold a voir dire. They intended to call certain RCMP officers for cross-examination, including those involved in the police misconduct, those who had helped develop the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy, and those involved in decisions to place Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer in solitary confinement. They also intended to call correctional officers for cross-examination regarding the use of solitary confinement and experts to testify as to the impact of solitary confinement on Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s mental health and physical well-being. Finally, they intended to tender other documents that they thought would materialize once they received full disclosure.\nG. The Vukelich Hearing Decision: British Columbia Supreme Court, 2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192 (Open Reasons); 2014 BCSC 2194 (Sealed Reasons)\n[28] Based on this lengthy yet limited written record, Wedge J. summarily dismissed the underlying stay applications.\n[29] Wedge J. stated the test for summary dismissal was whether an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) would assist in deciding if the alleged abuses could entitle Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer to a stay. She referred to R. v. Wilder, 2004 BCSC 304, and R. v. Hamill (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 338 (B.C.C.A.), and concluded that the applications could be summarily dismissed \u201cif . . . the grounds advanced by the applicants could not support a stay of proceedings\u201d (para. 9).\n[30] Wedge J. considered whether the defence could satisfy the Babos test for a stay of proceedings based on an abuse of process. This test requires an applicant to demonstrate (1) that there is \u201cprejudice to the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that \u2018will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome\u2019\u201d; (2) that there is \u201cno alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice\u201d; and (3) that, \u201c[w]here there is still uncertainty over whether a stay is warranted after [stages] (1) and (2) . . . the interests in favour of granting a stay [outweigh] \u2018the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits\u2019\u201d (Babos, at para. 32, quoting R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at paras. 54 and 57).\n[31] At stage one of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. accepted, for the purposes of the Vukelich hearing, that certain conduct could amount to an abuse of process and that entering convictions in light of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system. Certain misconduct of the four officers \u2014 engaging in exploitative sexual relationships, endangering the safety of protected witnesses, lying to superiors, and manipulating overtime and expense claims \u2014 could constitute an abuse of process. However, she rejected the allegation that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy and the other impugned investigative practices amounted to an abuse of process. Wedge J. also accepted that Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s conditions of confinement violated their ss. 7 and 12 Charter rights and could amount to an abuse of process. Finally, Wedge J. accepted certain allegations of abuse raised by the amici, but rejected certain inferences they put forward that were favourable to Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer. Instead, she preferred inferences favourable to the Crown\u2019s position. She determined that the materials available on the Vukelich hearing did not support the amici\u2019s theory.\n[32] At stage two of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. accepted, for the purposes of the Vukelich hearing, that there were no alternate remedies for the breaches she identified.\n[33] At stage three of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. determined that this was not one of the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d where a stay was warranted (para. 153). On one side of the scale, the misconduct by the four officers was extremely serious. However, the misconduct was not ongoing: the officers were suspended and removed from the investigation. Further, the affected female witnesses were not called at trial, tempering the seriousness of the misconduct. Though the conditions of confinement amounted to serious, prolonged and systemic misconduct that had an immediate and significant impact on Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s mental and physical health, Wedge J. noted that the conditions were not ongoing, and the state conduct had been judicially criticized by McEwan J. She also accorded weight to the misconduct alleged by the amici (though not the inferences that she had rejected). On the other side of the scale, the crimes were incredibly serious: the circumstances of the offences were shocking, there were six victims, and the motivation behind the murders was a desire to demonstrate the Red Scorpions\u2019 strength, instill fear in rival gangs, and expand the Red Scorpions\u2019 drug business. Both society and the family members of the deceased had an interest in seeing convictions entered. For Wedge J., these considerations weighed more heavily in the balance.\n[34] Wedge J. concluded that, even if the applications were taken at their highest, the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings. As such, an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) on the merits would not assist the court. For these reasons, she summarily dismissed the applications and ordered the convictions entered.\nH. Appeal of the Vukelich Ruling: British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2021 BCCA 34, 487 C.R.R. (2d) 48 (Tysoe, MacKenzie and Willcock JJ.A.)\n[35] The Court of Appeal for British Columbia concluded that Wedge J. should not have summarily dismissed the stay applications at the Vukelich hearing. They ought to have been fully addressed and decided at a voir dire on their merits. The court allowed the appeals, quashed the convictions, affirmed the verdicts of guilt, and remitted the stay applications to the trial court for a voir dire.\n[36] The court acknowledged that a judge\u2019s decision on whether to hold a voir dire or evidentiary hearing is discretionary and owed deference. Nevertheless, Wedge J. had erred respecting the amici\u2019s sealed submissions by weighing the evidence, drawing inferences and finding facts on an incomplete record. She failed to take the amici\u2019s submissions at their highest and did not assume the truth of the facts alleged. The amici had identified sufficiently reasonable interpretations and plausible inferences such that a full evidentiary hearing was warranted.\n[37] In addition, Wedge J. imposed too high a standard to permit an evidentiary hearing. The threshold is meant to be low, and it was met in this case. When the judge found that stages one and two of Babos were satisfied, it was clear that the applications were not frivolous. However, the judge\u2019s balancing at stage three purported to determine the ultimate issue without all the evidence.\n[38] In addition, the court admitted some of the fresh evidence that the amici tendered. The court determined that it showed there was conflicting evidence on the facts relevant to the amici\u2019s argument and that it could be open to a judge to make different findings about the extent of the misconduct.\n[39] As well, the court remarked that, as a matter of law, no category of offence \u2014 no matter how serious \u2014 can be beyond the ambit of the abuse of process doctrine. The court always retains the ability to dissociate itself from misconduct through a stay.\nIII. Analysis\n[40] The key question on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in summarily dismissing the stay applications for abuse of process. Answering this question requires this Court to determine the appropriate threshold for the summary dismissal of an application in the criminal law context.\n[41] I begin with a review of the genesis of the Vukelich hearing and the values of trial efficiency and trial fairness. I then identify and explain the proper threshold: an application can only be summarily dismissed without a hearing where the application is manifestly frivolous. I also remark on the framework for summary dismissal motions, including who bears the burden of proof and what should be included in the record.\n[42] In the final section, I apply the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard to the case at bar. Like the Court of Appeal, I find that the applications were not manifestly frivolous and should have been heard and decided on their merits.\nA. Summary Dismissal in the Criminal Law Context\n(1) The Genesis of the Vukelich Hearing\n[43] The Vukelich hearing has its genesis in a 1996 decision which upheld the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hold a voir dire on the constitutionality of a search warrant (Vukelich, at para. 8). McEachern C.J., writing for the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, relied heavily on the earlier Ontario case of R. v. Kutynec (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), which acknowledged that a \u201ctrial judge can weed out the applications which have no basis in fact or law, and can decide how and when those with potential merit should be resolved\u201d (p. 302). McEachern C.J. also noted that trial judges must \u201ccontrol the course of the proceedings\u201d (para. 26). Procedurally, he endorsed a \u201cflexible approach . . . rather than [a] formal procedure\u201d to determine whether or not to embark on a voir dire and how a voir dire should be conducted (para. 23). The same approach had been taken in Kutynec. McEachern C.J. felt that both questions could be answered based on the statements of counsel, possibly supported by an affidavit.\n[44] Because of the nature of the underlying application, McEachern C.J. did not need to articulate a general standard for when an application in a criminal trial should be summarily dismissed. The defence application advanced in Vukelich challenged a search warrant and relied upon R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421. In Garofoli, the Court held that successfully challenged portions of an information to obtain (\u201cITO\u201d) are to be excised, after which the trial judge must determine if the remainder of the ITO supports the issuance of the warrant. In Vukelich, the trial judge applied the Garofoli framework to conclude on the face of the record, accepting all of the defence\u2019s allegations as true and excising the impugned information, that there was still sufficient information to issue the warrant. Given the nature of the defence application and the principles from Garofoli, McEachern C.J. found that holding a voir dire would \u201cnot assist the proper trial of the real issues\u201d (para. 26).\n[45] Since 1996, Vukelich hearings have been extended well beyond search warrant cases and are frequently used in criminal trials in British Columbia. While it is more common for the Crown to request a Vukelich hearing to summarily dismiss a defence application, the trial judge\u2019s screening function applies equally to Crown applications, and defence counsel do sometimes request Vukelich hearings (see R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 38; R. v. Biring, 2021 BCSC 2678, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Kuntz-Angel, 2020 BCSC 1777, at para. 71 (CanLII)).\n(2) Underlying Values: Trial Efficiency and Trial Fairness\n[46] The standard selected for summary dismissal on a Vukelich-type hearing will be based on the two sets of underlying values at play in such proceedings: trial efficiency and trial fairness. These values coexist and \u201cboth must be pursued in order for each to be realised: they are, in practice, interdependent\u201d (R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 27, quoting B.C. Justice Reform Initiative, A Criminal Justice System for the 21st Century (2012), at p. 75).\n(a) Trial Efficiency\n[47] In both the civil and criminal contexts, trial judges play a gatekeeping role and can summarily dismiss certain applications without a hearing on the merits.\n[48] A civil claim will be struck \u201cif it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d or, alternatively phrased, if the claim has no reasonable prospect of success (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 17). Striking such claims \u201cunclutters the proceedings\u201d, \u201cpromotes litigation efficiency, reducing time and cost\u201d, and allows litigants to focus on serious claims (paras. 19-20). Relatedly, the civil rules for summary judgment, which is generally available when there is no genuine issue for trial, are \u201cinterpreted broadly, favouring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely and just adjudication of claims\u201d (Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 5; see also para. 34).\n[49] The same purposes are important in the criminal context, where the need for efficient trials to reduce undue delay is manifest (see R. v. Glegg, 2021 ONCA 100, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 276, at para. 36; Jordan, at paras. 114 and 139; Cody, at paras. 36-39). Dismissing unmeritorious applications made in the criminal law context helps ensure that trials occur within a reasonable time, which is an \u201cessential part of our criminal justice system\u2019s commitment to treating presumptively innocent accused persons in a manner that protects their interests in liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial\u201d (Jordan, at para. 20). \u201cTimely trials impact other people who play a role in and are affected by criminal trials, as well as the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice\u201d (para. 22).\n[50] Indeed, the time limits set in Jordan for the completion of most criminal trials should encourage those bringing underlying applications or seeking their summary dismissal to carefully consider whether such steps are necessary and to assess their impact on the trial timelines. All participants in the criminal justice system share a responsibility to take a \u201cproactive approach . . . that prevents unnecessary delay by targeting its root causes\u201d (Cody, at para. 36, citing Jordan, at para. 137). According a high degree of deference to summary dismissal decisions encourages trial judges to take on that responsibility and to exercise this discretionary power where appropriate (see R. v. Samaniego, 2022 SCC 9, at para. 25; R. v. Edwardsen, 2019 BCCA 259, at para. 75 (CanLII); R. v. Orr, 2021 BCCA 42, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 441, at paras. 53-54).\n[51] The allure of efficiency is not, however, to advance simplicity or speed as ends in themselves. Complexity in criminal trials is sometimes unavoidable, and the goal is to avoid disproportionate or undue delay, which impairs the interests of justice (see Jordan, at para. 43). Trials, and the applications taken in respect of them, should take a proportionate amount of time. What is required to fairly and justly address any particular application will depend on the nature of the application and the context of the broader trial. Trial judges should guard against any \u201cprocedural step or motion that is improperly taken, or takes longer than it should\u201d as they would \u201cdepriv[e] other worthy litigants of timely access to the courts\u201d (para. 43). Those steps do not increase the quality of justice in that particular trial. Similarly, trial judges should scrutinize decisions taken in the name of efficiency to ensure they actually save court time and judicial resources. Anticipated savings should be both real and required. This is an important factor when considering protracted and merits-oriented summary dismissal motions, which often create other forms of costs and delays (in the civil context, see Hryniak, at para. 6).\n[52] Unfortunately, a review of the jurisprudence reveals that, as Vukelich hearings proliferated, becoming almost routine, their animating goal of increasing trial efficiency has not been realized in practice. In many cases, they are unnecessarily lengthy and veer towards the merits of the underlying application. A Vukelich hearing \u201cinsisted upon by the Crown\u201d may devolve into a \u201cprotracted pre-hearing examination of the minutiae of the accused\u2019s application\u201d and result in the repetition of arguments on the ultimate voir dire (R. v. Tse, 2008 BCSC 867, at para. 21 (CanLII); see also para. 23). In the result, the hearing \u201cconsumes, unnecessarily, the very scarce resources that the hearing itself was designed to avoid wasting\u201d (R. v. Ali-Kashani, 2017 BCPC 358, at para. 52 (CanLII)).\n[53] That Vukelich\u2019s initial goal has not always materialized is exemplified by the case at bar. Here, the six-day Vukelich hearing involved extensive submissions by counsel, substantial evidence, and a deep dive into the merits of the stay applications. It led to a lengthy appeal which will result in repetition of the very same arguments when the applications are ultimately heard on their merits.\n[54] Clearly, it cannot simply be assumed that summary dismissal is a surefire way to increase efficiency. To be practical and take proportionality into account, judges should identify and weigh the full impact of the various procedural options. The resources that may be notionally saved by not hearing the main underlying application are simply a part of the picture. Judges must also factor in their extensive case management powers, which allow them to control the trial and the process and procedure of the underlying application. These powers go a long way towards tempering legitimate concerns over prolix trials, fishing expeditions, disproportionate processes and undue delay. They are not a full answer, but they play an important role because they encourage the tailoring of proportionate proceedings.\n(b) Trial Fairness\n[55] However pressing the goal of trial efficiency, summary dismissal also raises concerns about fairness because it runs counter to the notion that parties should have the opportunity to present their cases and to have their evidence, claims and allegations adjudicated on their merits. In civil cases, there is a reluctance to drive the plaintiff from the judgment seat at an early stage of the proceedings because of the potential prejudice which may result from the premature dismissal of the claim \u2014 especially when the claim is novel or close to the line.\n[56] In criminal cases, trial fairness is more than a policy goal: it is a constitutional imperative. A criminal trial involves allegations made by the state against an accused whose liberty is often at stake. The summary dismissal of criminal applications can curtail the accused\u2019s right to full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter by stopping the accused from fully making arguments and eliciting evidence on their application (see Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505; R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262). There are, of course, limits to these rights. For example, accused persons are not entitled to a voir dire and, if a voir dire is granted, are not entitled to whatever style of voir dire they would prefer (Vukelich, at para. 26). The trial judge decides if and how the voir dire proceeds and whether it should include an evidentiary hearing. Nevertheless, summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context implicates and, in certain circumstances, can curtail the accused\u2019s rights.\n[57] Due to this constitutional dimension, the civil rules and thresholds may provide limited guidance, but they cannot simply be adopted or transposed into the criminal domain. In this area of public law, the accused\u2019s Charter rights must be accounted for, particularly when the underlying application is brought by the defence in pursuit of fair trial rights. Additionally, the discrete realities of criminal trials must be respected. This includes an appreciation of the vast nature, breadth, scope and variety of possible applications made in the criminal law context \u2014 issues which go well beyond those raised by civil statements of claim. In the criminal context, certain applications are governed by a separate body of criminal procedure, legislated processes and statutory standards, and others are governed by long-standing case law. The distinctive features of the criminal context bear both upon the appropriate standard for summary dismissal and how it ought to be applied in individual cases.\n[58] Concerns about trial fairness can arise in numerous ways. Setting too lax a standard for summary dismissal risks the dismissal, based on a limited or incomplete record, of applications that might have proved successful after a full hearing on the merits. This risk becomes particularly salient where a party puts forward novel arguments which may carry significant precedential value and allow the law to develop. As recognized in the civil context, \u201c[t]he approach must be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed\u201d (Imperial Tobacco, at para. 21). This concern applies with equal force in criminal cases: courts have acknowledged the risk of stifling novel claims, given that \u201cthe contours of constitutional rights are settled through the litigation of emerging, unresolved and contentious issues\u201d (R. v. McDonald, 2013 BCSC 314, at para. 44 (CanLII); Teal Cedar Products Ltd. v. Rainforest Flying Squad, 2022 BCSC 429, at paras. 14-15 (CanLII)). Certain interveners pointed out that a novel application might require full evidentiary exploration for the issues to properly emerge. I agree.\n[59] These concerns inform and align with existing jurisprudence, which recognizes that trial fairness requires a low threshold for holding a voir dire, such that most applications are heard on their merits (see R. v. Frederickson, 2018 BCCA 2, at para. 33 (CanLII)). Indeed, the parties before this Court generally all agree that it should not be difficult for an accused\u2019s application to proceed to a voir dire, though they disagree on the exact standard to be applied.\n(c) The Values of Trial Efficiency and Trial Fairness Support a Rigorous Threshold for Summary Dismissal in the Criminal Context\n[60] The underlying values of trial fairness and trial efficiency mandate the conclusion that a rigorous threshold should be applied to summary dismissal motions in criminal trials. A summary procedure is, as its name suggests, intended to be summary: preliminary, brief, and more in the nature of an overview than a deep dive. Summary dismissal is built upon allegations and supported by the artifice of assuming that the facts asserted are true. By contrast, a hearing on the merits involves a final determination of the facts, and of whether, after a full review, the proven facts support the allegations and ground the requested remedy.\n[61] A rigorous threshold is also supported by the particular characteristics of criminal trials, including how the trial judge\u2019s broad case management powers can help ensure the efficient, effective and proportionate use of court resources as well as the accused\u2019s fair trial rights. Judges perform a gatekeeping function, and the goal is that only those applications that should be caught by the summary dismissal power are in fact summarily dismissed. Trial judges should therefore err on the side of caution when asked to summarily dismiss an application made in the criminal law context. This is especially so in light of the deferential standard of review applied on appeal to a judge\u2019s case management decisions (Samaniego, at para. 25; Edwardsen, at para. 75). The threshold and standard selected for summary dismissal must respect this Court\u2019s observation (in the context of jury selection) that \u201coccasional injustice cannot be accepted as the price of efficiency\u201d (R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 28).\nB. The \u201cManifestly Frivolous\u201d Threshold for Summary Dismissal\n[62] I turn now to the question at the heart of this appeal: What is the threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context? I briefly review the uncertainty in the existing jurisprudence. I then identify the correct threshold, which is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous, and explain why this threshold promotes both trial efficiency and trial fairness. I also outline why other proposed thresholds are less suited to summary dismissal motions and provide some guidance about how the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard is to be applied, who bears the burden on the summary dismissal motion, and what type of record should be filed. I conclude with a summary of the applicable framework for summary dismissal motions.\n(1) Review of the Jurisprudence\n[63] The threshold test \u201chas been expressed in different ways at different times\u201d (McDonald, at para. 18). It has been variably described as having no reasonable prospect of success (Cody, at para. 38); being frivolous or manifestly frivolous (Jordan, at para. 63; Cody, at para. 38; Accurso v. R., 2022 QCCA 752, at paras. 323 and 329 (CanLII); Br\u00fbl\u00e9 v. R., 2021 QCCA 1334, at para. 31 (CanLII)); having no basis upon which it could succeed (Cody, at para. 38); having no reasonable likelihood that the voir dire will assist (R. v. Pires, 2005 SCC 66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343, at para. 35); being doomed to failure (R. v. Armstrong, 2012 BCCA 242, 350 D.L.R. (4th) 457, at para. 38; R. v. Omar, 2007 ONCA 117, 84 O.R. (3d) 493, at para. 31; R. v. Cobb, 2021 QCCQ 546, at paras. 7 and 157 (CanLII); R. v. Gill, 2018 BCSC 661 (\u201cGill (BCSC)\u201d), at para. 36 (CanLII)); being unmeritorious on its face (Cobb, at para. 7); not being grounded in any facts that have a reasonable likelihood of ultimately supporting a remedy (Gill (BCSC), at para. 36); having no basis in fact or law (Kutynec, at p. 302); having no foundation in the evidence (Omar, at para. 31); being completely devoid of merit (R. v. Sandhu, 2021 MBQB 22, at para. 23 (CanLII)); or being [translation] \u201cmanifestly unfounded and frivolous\u201d (Valcourt v. R., 2019 QCCA 903, at para. 6 (CanLII)). Indeed, some cases refer to multiple combinations of these words or phrases (see, e.g., Cobb, at para. 7; Gill (BCSC), at para. 36; Omar, at para. 31).\n[64] As is apparent from the citations above, this uncertainty is not limited to British Columbia. Provinces and territories across the country have relied on a combination of cases, including Vukelich, Kutynec and Cody, as authority for the trial judge\u2019s power to summarily dismiss applications (see, e.g., R. v. RV, 2022 ABCA 218, at paras. 63-64 (CanLII); R. v. Wesaquate, 2022 SKCA 101, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 225, at para. 93; R. v. Giesbrecht, 2019 MBCA 35, [2019] 7 W.W.R. 280, at paras. 134-36; R. v. Greer, 2020 ONCA 795, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (\u201cGreer (ONCA)\u201d), at paras. 108, 111 and 113; Accurso, at paras. 311-12; R. v. Emery Martin, 2021 NBQB 67, at para. 14 (CanLII); Carver v. R., 2021 PESC 40, at para. 16 (CanLII); R. v. Greenwood, 2022 NSCA 53, 415 C.C.C. (3d) 89, at paras. 147-48; R. v. Lehr, 2018 NLSC 249, 426 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at paras. 14-18; R. v. Smith, 2021 YKTC 60, at paras. 5 and 13 (CanLII); R. v. Denechezhe, 2021 YKTC 18, at para. 82 (CanLII)).\n[65] While the various formulations all seek to avoid unnecessary and wasteful voir dires, Mr. Johnston was correct when he argued that rearticulating a standard using different words and phrases creates confusion and generates uncertainty. The existing jurisprudence is thus unsettled and demonstrates that this Court needs to provide clarity on the proper threshold to be applied to the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. This is a question of first instance, and the Court is now called upon to establish the correct threshold based on first principles.\n(2) The \u201cManifestly Frivolous\u201d Threshold\n[66] I conclude that the appropriate standard for summary dismissal is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. This standard draws on the case law concerning frivolous applications, as advanced by some parties and interveners, including Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer, the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia. However, it also requires that the flaws in the application are manifestly apparent.\n[67] The \u201cfrivolous\u201d part of the standard weeds out those applications that will necessarily fail. This Court has previously stated that the \u201c\u2018not frivolous\u2019 test is widely recognized as being a very low bar\u201d (R. v. Oland, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 20). Having reviewed the case law on the \u201cnot frivolous\u201d threshold, inevitability or necessity of failure is the key characteristic of a \u201cfrivolous\u201d application. In relation to the case law on applications for bail pending appeal of a conviction under s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , see R. v. Passey (1997), 56 Alta. L.R. (3d) 317 (C.A.), at paras. 6-8; R. v. Effert, 2006 ABCA 352, at paras. 5-6 (CanLII); R. v. Greer, 2021 BCCA 148, at para. 36 (CanLII); R. v. Mian (1996), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 155 (C.A.), at para. 9; R. v. Manasseri, 2013 ONCA 647, 312 C.C.C. (3d) 132, at para. 38; R. v. Gill, 2016 BCCA 355, 1 M.V.R. (7th) 245, at para. 17; R. v. Hanna (1991), 3 B.C.A.C. 57, at para. 6; R. v. Drouin, 1994 CanLII 4621 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 2; cf. R. v. Perrier, 2009 NLCA 61, 293 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 92, at para. 24. In relation to s. 685(1) applications for summary dismissal of appeals where the court of appeal determines that the legal grounds for the appeal are frivolous or vexatious, see R. v. Beseiso, 2020 ONCA 686, at para. 7 (CanLII); R. v. Mehedi, 2019 ONCA 387, at para. 6 (CanLII). Finally, in relation to s. 320.25 applications for a stay of a driving prohibition pending appeal, see R. v. McPherson, 1999 BCCA 638, 140 C.C.C. (3d) 316, at para. 5.\n[68] Aside from the inevitability or necessity of failure, the \u201cfrivolous\u201d standard has captured a compendium of other phrases. It is because it will necessarily fail that a frivolous application has also been described as \u201cnot arguable\u201d and as \u201chaving no basis upon which it could succeed\u201d. Similarly, saying an application is \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d connotes inevitability and is just another way of saying an application is \u201cfrivolous\u201d (see, e.g., Armstrong, at para. 38; Omar, at para. 31; Cobb, at para. 7).\n[69] However, I add the word \u201cmanifestly\u201d to capture the idea that the frivolous nature of the application should be obvious. \u201cManifestly\u201d is defined as \u201cas is manifest; evidently, unmistakably, openly\u201d, and \u201cmanifest\u201d is defined as \u201c[c]learly revealed to the eye, mind, or judgement; open to view or comprehension; obvious\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary (online)). Just like the civil standard for striking a claim requires that it be \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action (or, in French, \u201c\u00e9vident et manifeste\u201d), the addition of the word \u201cmanifestly\u201d adds another layer to the \u201cfrivolous\u201d standard and helpfully indicates that a summary dismissal motion should be based on that which is clearly revealed.\n[70] The \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard has been used recently by the Quebec Court of Appeal, including in the context of the proposed summary dismissal of a stay application (Accurso, at paras. 323 and 329; Br\u00fbl\u00e9, at para. 31; see also Ouellet v. R., 2021 QCCA 386, 70 C.R. (7th) 279, at para. 12, fn. 3, referring to an application being [translation] \u201cfrivolous on its face\u201d). In applying this standard, the Court of Appeal has called for judges to exercise caution before summarily dismissing an application because such dismissal deprives the applicant (often the accused) of a hearing on the merits (Accurso, at paras. 314-15, citing Br\u00fbl\u00e9, at para. 31). In summary dismissal motions, rather than requiring that the accused prove the existence of the Charter violation on an underlying Charter application, the Court of Appeal has required only that the accused demonstrate that it is conceivable that the claim could be allowed (Accurso, at para. 323).\n[71] Thus, the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard, which connotes the obvious necessity of failure, is the appropriate threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. If the frivolous nature of the application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed on its merits.\n[72] This standard best serves both the values of trial efficiency and trial fairness. It is a rigorous standard that will allow judges to weed out those applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste court time. The blunt tool of summary dismissal, which precludes the applicant from proceeding, is not the only way judges can protect efficiency. The judge\u2019s panoply of case management powers allows for tailored proceedings and mitigates concerns that \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d may derail a trial\u2019s progress, generate undue delay, or result in the disproportionate use of court time.\n[73] The \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d threshold also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those applications which might succeed, including novel claims, are decided on their merits. Protecting fair trial rights is always important, but takes on added significance when the application in question carries great consequences. Generally speaking, the greater the consequences associated with a given application, the greater the possible impact on an accused\u2019s rights if the application is summarily dismissed. Certain applications carry more significant consequences simply because of their nature and the issues they raise. For example, applications for a stay of proceedings based on abuse of process are of enormous import for an accused and the public. They often involve serious allegations of egregious state misconduct and always call for serious consequences, namely, a permanent halting of the prosecution (Babos, at paras. 30, 35 and 37; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91). Similarly, an underlying application might allege breaches of an accused\u2019s Charter rights, such that its summary dismissal prevents the accused from litigating those rights in the course of trial.\n(3) Other Standards Proposed by the Parties\n[74] The alternative standards proposed by some of the parties and interveners are not as well suited to the task as the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d threshold.\n[75] The Crown and others proposed the \u201cno reasonable prospect of success\u201d threshold based on their reading of Cody. In Cody, this Court used the phrases \u201creasonable prospect of success\u201d, \u201cno basis upon which the application could succeed\u201d, and \u201cfrivolous\u201d in connection with summary dismissal motions (para. 38). In this case, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia stated that this Court \u201chas articulated this standard as requiring an application to have a \u2018reasonable prospect\u2019 of success or of assisting in determining the issues before the court\u201d (para. 373). Other courts have also relied on Cody as authority for the threshold for summary dismissal, citing to one or more of the three phrases used (see, e.g., Lehr, at para. 17; Hu v. R., 2022 QCCS 2871, at para. 13 (CanLII); Greer (ONCA), at para. 108; R. v. Morin, 2022 SKCA 46, [2022] 7 W.W.R. 443, at para. 23; R. v. Walton, 2019 ONSC 928, at para. 47 (CanLII)).\n[76] However, Cody did not decide the threshold to be applied generally to the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. Cody was not a case on summary dismissal, but rather a case on unreasonable delay violating s. 11(b) of the Charter . Cody affirmed the framework set out in Jordan and echoed Jordan\u2019s call for trial judges to use their case management powers to minimize delay. In this latter respect, Cody remarked, as an example, that trial judges should exercise these powers to summarily dismiss applications. Cody did not closely examine and establish the proper standard under which that power should be exercised and should not be read to establish any authoritative statements in this regard.\n[77] Further, the \u201cno reasonable prospect of success\u201d standard is ill suited to summary dismissal in the criminal context as it may invite an assessment of the merits of the underlying application. A detailed assessment goes beyond the scope of a summary dismissal motion and invites the sort of protracted proceedings that currently plague Vukelich hearings. It risks drawing the summary dismissal judge in too deeply on a limited record. While it is a useful standard in other areas of law, it tends to work against efficiency when used for summary dismissal in the criminal context. The assessment of the merits of the underlying application ought to be reserved for the final part of the decision-making process: that is, when answering the ultimate question on the voir dire itself.\n[78] Alternatively, others before this Court invoked Pires to argue that trial judges should decline to embark on an evidentiary hearing if the petitioning party \u201cis unable to show a reasonable likelihood that the hearing can assist in determining the issues before the court\u201d (para. 35); this is sometimes referred to as the \u201cno reasonable likelihood of assistance\u201d standard. However, by commenting on the need for trial judges to control prolix proceedings, the Court in that case also did not purport to decide the threshold for summary dismissal motions. Rather, Pires dealt with a challenge to a search warrant and affirmed the requirement from Garofoli that the defence must show a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination of the affiant will assist in determining the relevant issues (paras. 3 and 40).\n[79] The \u201cno reasonable likelihood of assistance\u201d standard suffers from the same flaw of being merits-based. In addition, its focus is on procedure (how to decide the underlying application) rather than substance (namely, whether the application is somehow flawed and ought to be summarily dismissed). Thus, while this may be a helpful consideration when deciding how a voir dire should be conducted, it should not be used in summary dismissal motions to determine whether an underlying application should proceed to a voir dire.\n[80] The \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard is intended to be a clear standard to be applied to summary dismissal motions brought in the criminal law context that are not otherwise subject to a legislated or judicial threshold. It does not, for example, have an impact on applications brought under Criminal Code provisions such as s. 685(1) applications concerning frivolous appeals or s. 679 applications for bail pending an appeal (including Oland). Nor does this standard eclipse the bodies of law that have developed around particular types of applications, such as Garofoli and Pires applications to challenge the lawfulness of a search warrant.\n(4) Applying the \u201cManifestly Frivolous\u201d Standard\n[81] Having established what the threshold should be, I now provide guidance on how the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d threshold should be applied. I explain how judges should treat the facts and inferences alleged in the underlying application and how to identify when the application is manifestly frivolous.\n[82] The Crown argued that trial judges should be allowed to engage in a limited assessment or weighing of the proposed evidence and should be permitted to reject facts or inferences for which there is no reasonable basis in the facts alleged by the applicant. The Crown\u2019s approach invites an assessment of the merits and is thus out of step with the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d threshold. It runs contrary to the established proposition that the facts must generally be assumed true, not accepted as true after a limited weighing. The judge should not engage in a limited weighing of the evidence to ascertain if it is reasonably capable of supporting an inference, nor should the judge decide which among competing inferences they prefer. Any such weighing should be left to the voir dire proper.\n[83] On the summary dismissal motion, the judge must assume the facts alleged by the applicant to be true and must take the applicant\u2019s arguments at their highest (Vukelich, at para. 26; Armstrong, at para. 8; Gill (BCSC), at para. 24). While there is no need to weigh the evidence or decide any facts on the summary dismissal motion, the applicant\u2019s underlying application should explain its factual foundation and point towards anticipated evidence that could establish their alleged facts. Where the applicant cannot point towards any anticipated evidence that could establish a necessary fact, the judge can reject the factual allegation as manifestly frivolous.\n[84] Likewise, the judge ought to generally assume the inferences suggested by the applicant are true, even if competing inferences are proffered. The judge should only reject an inference if it is manifestly frivolous, meaning that there is no reasoning path to the proposed inference. This might be the case where a necessary fact underpinning the inference is not alleged or if the inference cannot be drawn as a matter of law (e.g., if the proposed inference is based on impermissible reasoning).\n[85] A similar approach is taken to the overall application. Because the truth of the facts alleged is assumed, an application will only be manifestly frivolous where there is a fundamental flaw in the application\u2019s legal pathway: the remedy cannot be reached. For example, an application may be manifestly frivolous because the judge has no jurisdiction to grant the requested remedy (see, e.g., Lehr, at paras. 27-32). Alternatively, the application could put forward a legal argument that has already been rejected: applications that depend on legal propositions that are clearly at odds with settled and unchallenged law are manifestly frivolous (see, e.g., Lehr, at paras. 22-23).\n[86] An application may also be manifestly frivolous where the remedy sought could never issue on the facts of the particular application. The nature of the application will be relevant to this analysis. On certain applications, the trial judge may be able to assume the facts put forward by the applicant and, assuming those facts, determine whether the remedy sought could issue. Garofoli applications, where trial judges ask if the ITO could still support the issuance of the search warrant even if the challenged portions of the ITO are excised, make the point. Where the ITO still supports the issuance of the warrant, then the application can be summarily dismissed because, even if the defence could prove that the impugned portions of the ITO ought to be struck, the sought-after remedy (the exclusion of evidence obtained under the warrant) would not follow.\n[87] Alternatively, key portions of the application could be missing. For example, the application may fail to set out a conclusion that is necessary to satisfy the relevant legal test. Specifically, an application for a stay for abuse of process must fail if the applicant accepts that an alternative remedy is capable of redressing the prejudice. Key factual allegations might also be missing. For instance, an application for a stay for abuse of process must fail if the applicant has not alleged any abusive conduct.\n[88] These fundamental flaws ought to be manifest. If the error is not apparent on the face of the record, the application should proceed.\n[89] Finally, the trial judge\u2019s power to summarily dismiss an application is ongoing. Even if the judge permits the application to proceed to a voir dire, the judge retains the ability to summarily dismiss the application during the voir dire if and when it becomes apparent that the application is manifestly frivolous (Cody, at para. 38, citing Jordan, at para. 63). This may occur if the applicant is unable to elicit any evidence, contested or otherwise, to prove a necessary fact.\n(5) The Burden Rests on the Party Seeking Summary Dismissal\n[90] On a motion for summary dismissal, the party moving for summary dismissal bears the burden of convincing the judge that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous.\n[91] Some argued that the burden should be placed on the party bringing the underlying application because there is no automatic entitlement to a voir dire (Vukelich, at para. 26). However, placing the onus on the party who moves for summary dismissal is logical, practical and preferable. Logically, the party who seeks summary dismissal should bear the onus of demonstrating that this remedy ought to be granted. Practically, the burden may discourage the moving party from applying to summarily dismiss every single application brought in a case, whether manifestly frivolous or not. Such tactical behaviour is highly inefficient and wastes court time.\n[92] If, without a motion from a party, a trial judge exercises the case management power to hold a summary dismissal hearing, the burden still rests on the party opposing the underlying application (i.e., the party who would benefit from the application\u2019s summary dismissal). If the party demonstrates that the application is manifestly frivolous, the judge can summarily dismiss the application.\n(6) Minimal Record on Summary Dismissal Motions\n[93] The record on a summary dismissal motion should normally be minimal and of a summary nature because extensive evidence often demands the type of time, effort and delay which works to defeat the very purpose of the motion. While both parties are expected to put their best foot forward, there is no need to set firm rules about what type of record ought to be filed (see Glegg, at para. 37; Giesbrecht, at para. 158). Given the different rules of procedure that apply across the provinces and territories, and given that a trial judge has discretion to determine how an application should unfold, the approach to a summary dismissal hearing should involve \u201ca flexible rather than a fixed process\u201d (Vukelich, at para. 19; see also Kutynec, at pp. 293-94 and 299).\n[94] As a preliminary matter, the party filing the underlying application must ensure that their application complies with the local court rules and the applicable practices, directives and procedures. Some jurisdictions have developed particular rules and approaches to control which applications should be heard in a voir dire. Ontario incorporated the power to summarily dismiss an application into its rules of criminal procedure (see Glegg, at para. 34; Criminal Proceedings Rules for the Superior Court of Justice (Ontario), SI\/2012-7, r. 34.02). Alberta requires all Charter applications to be accompanied by sufficient particulars (see R. v. Dwernychuk (1992), 135 A.R. 31 (C.A.), at paras. 12 and 21; R. v. Baker, 2004 ABPC 218, 47 Alta. L.R. (4th) 152, at para. 11; Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta Criminal Procedure Rules, SI\/2017-76, r. 14). The Crown in Alberta would often seek further particulars to better understand the defence\u2019s application before motioning for its summary dismissal.\n[95] Material filed on the underlying application, as well as the motion for summary dismissal, will of course form part of the record. The moving party should clearly explain how the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. It is not sufficient to simply advance conclusory statements that the underlying application will not, on the ultimate analysis, result in the remedy \u2014 that line of argument inappropriately focuses on the final merits of the underlying application and not on whether it is manifestly frivolous.\n[96] In accordance with the principle that an application should only be dismissed if it is manifestly frivolous, any additional material that is filed as part of the record on a summary dismissal motion should be minimal and necessary. This will help avoid the issue of delay and inefficiency that has, to date, plagued Vukelich hearings. It should not take extensive and detailed contested evidence to ascertain whether the application will necessarily fail. Counsel should, at minimum, offer particulars as to (1) what legal principles, Charter provisions, or statutory provisions are being relied on and how those principles or provisions have been infringed; (2) the (anticipated) evidence to be relied on and how it may be adduced; (3) the proposed argument; and (4) the remedy requested (Baker, at para. 11; Dwernychuk, at paras. 21-22).\n[97] On a summary dismissal motion, the party who has brought the underlying application bears the minimal burden of providing the judge with the specifics outlined above through oral or written submissions. While the overall burden rests on the party seeking summary dismissal, the applicant is the one with knowledge of what remedy they seek, so they should set out, with sufficient detail, what they hope to prove on the application in order to obtain that remedy. Depending on local filing requirements, much of this information may already be set out in a notice of application and supporting materials. Counsel\u2019s submissions will be a \u201cuseful first step\u201d to supplement that information (Vukelich, at para. 23). Additionally, it is worth recalling that it is within the trial judge\u2019s case management powers to make inquiries of the applicant to draw out these particulars before proceeding to a voir dire (R. v. Felderhof (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 57).\n[98] While counsel\u2019s statements will often be sufficient, sometimes more might be required. I leave it to the discretion of the judge deciding the summary dismissal motion to determine whether something more is required and, if so, what that something more should be. Deciding how the summary dismissal motion proceeds is within the judge\u2019s case management powers. However, the judge should bear in mind that the more material filed, the greater the risk of delay, the greater the risk that the summary dismissal hearing devolves into a scrum over the merits of the underlying application and the greater the risk that the judge inadvertently decides the merits of the application itself (Gill (BCSC), at para. 24).\nC. Summary and Framework for Summary Dismissal\n[99] While the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d standard sits at the core, the overall framework for summary dismissal requires a flexible approach to permit jurisdictional variance around the rules of criminal procedure and to foster a principled and practical approach.\n[100] In the normal course of a criminal trial one party files an underlying application \u2014 which can take many forms and cover myriad topics \u2014 and the party opposite may counter with a motion to dismiss that underlying application. This creates a two-part framework under which judges are asked to (1) address the summary dismissal motion; and, if refused, (2) decide the underlying application on its merits.\n[101] The two parts involve different questions, with distinct considerations and their own legal standards. During the first part, when deciding the summary dismissal motion, the question is whether, taking the facts and inferences alleged to be true, the party seeking summary dismissal has demonstrated that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. If the matter proceeds to a voir dire, then, during the second part, at the conclusion of the voir dire, judges must decide the ultimate question of whether the underlying application succeeds or fails on its merits: Has the applicant met the applicable burden of proof and established the facts necessary to fulfill the legal requirements underlying the requested remedy for the particular application at issue?\n[102] These parts are, however, related by more than sequence because, throughout, judges will need to consider how to exercise their discretion and case management powers to ensure justice is done in the circumstances. Judges control their courtrooms and are not required to hear all motions or hold particular types of hearings. Judges may, for example, direct how motions or the voir dire will be heard, especially whether to do so on the basis of testimony or some other form; direct the order in which evidence is called; restrict cross-examination that is unduly repetitive, rambling, argumentative, misleading or irrelevant; place reasonable limits on oral submissions; direct written submissions; and defer rulings (Samaniego, at para. 22; Felderhof, at para. 57). Case management powers also include the ability to revisit prior evidentiary determinations or to allow new applications mid-trial if doing so would be in the interests of justice (R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28, at para. 86). A motion by counsel for directions also calls for an exercise of case management powers (J.J., at paras. 103-5).\n[103] Quite apart from the separate legal standards applied at the two parts of this process, judges will need to turn their minds to whether they will entertain a summary dismissal motion at all; how that summary dismissal motion should be heard; and how any eventual voir dire will be conducted. These are discretionary decisions taken under judges\u2019 case management powers.\n[104] In exercising their discretion concerning whether to hear the summary dismissal motion, judges must consider the context and consequences associated with the underlying application, including whether it is amenable to summary disposition and how the applicant\u2019s fair trial rights will be affected by a summary dismissal hearing. Additionally, judges must consider whether holding a summary dismissal hearing will be an effective use of court time or if it will actually create delay. Where, for example, the summary hearing would take almost as long as a voir dire on the underlying application, consideration needs to be given to whether fairness, efficiency and respect for the administration of justice more strongly support using the time to deal with the merits of the underlying application rather than devoting resources to matters preliminary to it. In terms of pure efficiency, judges could not be faulted for proceeding directly to a voir dire when it would take the same time to hear the application on its merits as to conduct a summary dismissal hearing. Judges should only conduct a Vukelich-type hearing where doing so best ensures a proportionate process: one which respects the applicant\u2019s right to be heard, serves the goal of trial fairness, actually saves resources, and avoids undue delay.\n[105] If judges decide to hear the summary dismissal motion, they must also decide how to hear it. Judges must ensure the summary dismissal motion proceeds in a fair and proportionate manner.\n[106] If summary dismissal is refused, judges will also be called upon to determine how the voir dire on the underlying application should be conducted, including whether there should be an evidentiary hearing or whether the matter can proceed solely on the basis of argument, an agreed statement of facts or some combination of methods. Allowing an application to proceed to a voir dire is not a free licence to counsel to argue an application however they choose. The time and leeway given to counsel to present and argue the application should be proportionate: just enough to ensure that the application is fairly treated. Beyond that point, additional time and leeway can cause undue delay.\n[107] Exercising these case management powers not only calls for proportionate proceedings which balance trial efficiency and trial fairness, but may require a comparative assessment of what approach best meets the exigencies and equities of a particular case. Judges should bear in mind that the summary dismissal power is not their only tool to manage the underlying application and consider whether their other case management powers are better suited to managing the underlying application (Samaniego; Cody, at para. 38). The values of trial efficiency and trial fairness may be better served by holding a voir dire on the underlying application that is tailored through the use of judicial discretion to only what is necessary for a fair consideration of the substance of the allegations. When judges exercise their case management powers in this way, they fulfill the underlying purposes of case management powers: ensuring that trials proceed in a fair, effective and efficient manner (Samaniego, at para. 21).\nIV. Application to This Case\n[108] Bearing this framework in mind, the judge erred in summarily dismissing Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s applications for a stay based on abuse of process. First, the judge failed to assume the truth of the facts and inferences alleged by defence counsel and the amici. Second, the judge applied an insufficiently rigorous threshold for summary dismissal, which led her to engage in the balancing stage of Babos without the benefit of all the evidence on the scope of the state misconduct and to decide the merits of the stay applications on a partial record.\nA. Failure to Assume the Truth of the Alleged Facts\n[109] The judge correctly identified that she had to accept the facts alleged by the applicants as true. However, in practice, she failed to assume the truth of the alleged facts and inferences, and in doing so, failed to take the allegations at their highest.\n[110] Most notably, and as found by the Court of Appeal, the judge erred in her sealed reasons by weighing the evidence, drawing inferences and finding facts. The judge erred by accepting the Crown\u2019s argument that the filed materials did not support the amici\u2019s theory and, thus, she failed to take the amici\u2019s argument at its highest. The judge should have assumed that the facts alleged by the amici were true and should not have rejected the amici\u2019s inferences at this stage, given that the inferences were not manifestly frivolous.\n[111] I also find that the judge erred in the open ruling by failing to take the alleged facts and inferences as true in three instances.\n[112] First, the judge failed to accept the allegation that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy encompassed the abusive conditions of confinement. She acknowledged the defence allegation that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy \u201cincluded isolating the accused by directing their conditions of confinement so as to make them particularly vulnerable\u201d (trial judgment, at para. 35; see also paras. 58 and 113). While the judge accepted the factual allegations respecting the custodial conditions and the allegation that the conditions were directed by the RCMP, it does not appear that she accepted the connection alleged between the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy and the conditions of confinement. This is evident insofar as the judge rejected the allegation that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy was itself abusive. If the judge had accepted the alleged connection between the abusive conditions of confinement and the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy, then she would have accepted the inference that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy was itself abusive. On the face of the record, this inference was not manifestly frivolous. The judge erred by not accepting these allegations and inferences and failed to take Mr. Johnston\u2019s and Mr. Haevischer\u2019s cases at their highest.\n[113] Second, the judge did not accept the allegation that there was an intentional connection between the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy and the misconduct of the four officers. She accepted that the effect of the strategy \u201cwas to encourage an \u2018anything goes\u2019 attitude on [the four officers\u2019] part\u201d (para. 124). Defence counsel\u2019s arguments went beyond that. During submissions, Mr. Johnston\u2019s counsel clarified that they wished to cross-examine S\/Sgt. Attew and the supervising superintendent to help the court understand \u201chow that strategy came to be, how it was formulated, and by whom, and to what degree it influenced the conduct of these officers\u201d (A.R., vol. XV, at p. 263). The allegation was that the strategy explicitly or implicitly permitted the misconduct; the corresponding inference is that the strategy was itself abusive. For example, the applications raised the possibility that the strategy was created with the intention that the officers move loyalties by engaging in sexual conduct with protected witnesses. As pointed out by Mr. Johnston\u2019s counsel in his notice of application, a document summarizing the strategy makes note of the fact that \u201cgirlfriends\u201d might be vulnerable and discusses \u201ccreating events\u201d in the targeted witnesses\u2019 worlds, including \u201cinfidelity\u201d (A.R., vol. XIV, at pp. 14 and 31-32). The judge failed to take the applications at their highest by finding that the \u201cmoving witnesses\u201d strategy merely encouraged the officer misconduct.\n[114] Third, and finally, the judge found that other instances of police misconduct alleged by Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer did not amount to an abuse of process under stage one of the Babos test. While the judge may have assumed as a fact that these investigative practices occurred, she went on to make a finding that police handling of certain funds, witnesses, agents, informers and evidence could not amount to an abuse of process at stage one of Babos. Taking the arguments at their highest, I conclude that the allegation that these practices amounted to an abuse of process was not manifestly frivolous: there was no fundamental flaw in the allegation.\nB. Application of an Insufficiently Rigorous Threshold\n[115] The judge erred in law by applying an incorrect threshold for summary dismissal. Though the judge did not have the benefit of these reasons setting out the \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d threshold, she correctly noted that the overarching question was whether the stay applications should proceed to a hearing on their merits. However, in her analysis, she applied a more merits-based threshold for summary dismissal which was not sufficiently rigorous.\n[116] An application might be manifestly frivolous at stage one or stage two of Babos. However, that was not the case here in light of the strong allegations of abuse put forward by the applicants. Accordingly, once the judge found (1) that the applications put forward allegations of police misconduct that would shock the community\u2019s conscience and\/or were offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency; (2) that the integrity of the justice system would be prejudiced by continuing the proceedings; and (3) that no remedy short of a stay was capable of redressing the prejudice, it should have been clear that the applications were not frivolous, let alone manifestly frivolous. The findings that there were serious abuses at issue in this case and that a stay was the only possible remedy were enough to establish that the applications were not manifestly frivolous.\n[117] Accordingly, in this case, there was no need for the judge to engage in the balancing exercise at stage three of Babos. By engaging in that balancing exercise, the judge committed a further error as she purported to decide the ultimate issue on an incomplete record. She conducted the balancing exercise after inappropriately rejecting that certain of the allegations amounted to an abuse of process at stage one of Babos, thus skewing the balancing process. Additionally, I would note that, at the balancing stage, caution must be taken when considering the extent to which a judicial rebuke made in someone else\u2019s case (here, in Mr. Bacon\u2019s habeas corpus application before McEwan J.) can help redress the personal abuses alleged by others before a different court.\n[118] Moreover, the judge conducted the balancing exercise when she could not be sure that she had access to all the necessary evidence. In cases like this, which involve state misconduct, there is a distinct possibility that the extent of the misconduct will be unknown at the summary dismissal stage, and it may well be more serious than alleged. Where the trial disclosure is not relevant to the issues on an application, separate disclosure will likely be necessary to ensure that all material relevant to the application is produced. In addition, the misconduct may only come to light through cross-examination. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, certain defence allegations \u2014 such as the ones made here \u2014 \u201care such that they can likely only be established through cross-examination\u201d (para. 404; see also R. v. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, at para. 64 (CanLII)). This Court has further recognized that cross-examination is a critically important tool and an essential component of the accused\u2019s right to full answer and defence (see, e.g., R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at para. 41; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 663; R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 76; R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 64).\n[119] The Crown describes this outcome as troubling and submits that requiring a voir dire once the first two stages of Babos show that the application is not manifestly frivolous unduly curtails a judge\u2019s discretion to summarily dismiss an application, such that judicial resources will be wasted. The concern about wasting judicial resources is misplaced, in light of the possible consequences. Summarily dismissing a stay application without all the evidence impairs the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial and may undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. Stay applications may allege abuse of the highest order: summarily dismissing them without any opportunity for the applicant to further elicit evidence to substantiate their claims risks compounding any wrongs done by the state to the applicant. Additionally, this result does not unduly curtail a judge\u2019s discretion in the rare case in which balancing at stage three of Babos might be appropriate on the summary dismissal motion; it merely recognizes that, in this case, the application was not shown to be manifestly frivolous at stages one and two of Babos and, in the circumstances, should not have been summarily dismissed.\n[120] Finally, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the judge slid towards deciding the ultimate merits of the applications. In finding that she would not grant a stay, the judge focused on the merits and on the ultimate outcome rather than on whether the applications were manifestly frivolous. In doing so, she applied too lax a threshold for summary dismissal and conflated the analysis required for the summary dismissal hearing with the analysis she was required to undertake on the voir dire itself.\n[121] As a final matter, the Crown stresses that its submission is not that a stay could never issue for such serious offences, but rather that, in these particular circumstances, on balance, a stay should not issue. While it remains to be determined whether a stay of proceedings should or should not issue in this particular case, in light of both the seriousness of the offences and the seriousness of the abuse, I agree with the general proposition set out by the Court of Appeal that no category of offence is beyond the ambit of the abuse of process doctrine.\nV. Conclusion\n[122] When the above framework is applied, it is apparent that the stay applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not have been summarily dismissed. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. In light of Mr. Johnston\u2019s passing, only Mr. Haevischer\u2019s stay application will be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for hearing at a voir dire. Mr. Haevischer will have the opportunity to argue all the allegations. That Mr. Haevischer should have \u201ca full chance to re-litigate all the issues\u201d if the matter was remitted was agreed to by the Crown in submissions (transcript, at p. 20). That said, I leave how the voir dire ought to be conducted to the hearing judge\u2019s discretion.\n[123] In the course of my reasons, I have not relied on the fresh evidence admitted by the Court of Appeal and, as such, do not decide whether the Court of Appeal erred in admitting that evidence.

As well, while the terms \u201cvoir dire\u201d and \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d are often used interchangeably in the jurisprudence, here I use \u201cvoir dire\u201d to refer to a separate hearing that occurs within a trial to decide a particular application. I use \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d to refer to the calling of viva voce evidence during a voir dire. A voir dire may include an evidentiary hearing, but may also proceed only on a written record, or only on counsel\u2019s submissions (R. v. Kematch, 2010 MBCA 18, 251 Man. R. (2d) 191, at para. 43; see also R. v. Garnier, 2017 NSSC 239, at para. 13 (CanLII)). How the voir dire proceeds is a matter within the trial judge\u2019s discretion.\n"

A trial by jury was scheduled for November 2018, within the Jordan ceiling. However, changes to the Crown\u2019s case threatened to adjourn the proceedings. The defence offered to proceed by judge alone so that the trial could conclude within the Jordan ceiling, but the Crown refused. The trial judge then offered a trial date in June 2019, but defence counsel was unavailable. The trial was therefore set to begin on October 28 and it ultimately ended on November 28, 2019. The accused applied for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of his right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Charter . The trial judge denied the stay, even though the net delay of about 35 months exceeded the Jordan ceiling. Applying a transitional exceptional circumstance, he found that the parties had reasonably relied upon the law as it had been before Jordan was decided. The accused was convicted of several offences and a majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, finding no violation of s. 11(b).\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the convictions set aside and a stay of proceedings entered.\nNo transitional exceptional circumstance applies in the instant case. The net delay of about 35 months is an unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the Charter . First, the trial judge erred in concluding that the delay was justified based on the parties\u2019 reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed. The parties could not have reasonably relied upon the pre\u2011Jordan state of the law after Jordan had been decided in July 2016, nor did they, as they consciously scheduled a trial within the Jordan ceiling. The focus for the delay that accrues after Jordan was decided should instead have been on the extent to which the parties and the courts had sufficient time to adapt. Second, the delay beyond the ceiling was due not to a lack of time for the parties and system to adapt, but to the Crown\u2019s refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being warned of the possible consequences of delay and despite Jordan having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. Finally, it is unfair and unreasonable to characterize the entire period between June and October 2019 as defence delay. There is no bright\u2011line rule according to which all of the delay until the next available date following defence counsel\u2019s rejection of a date offered by the court must be characterized as defence delay. All relevant circumstances should be considered to determine how delay should be apportioned among participants.\nCases Cited\nReferred to: R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631; R. v.

(3d) 161, 412 C.C.C. (3d) 233, [2022] O.J. No. 1320 (QL), 2022 CarswellOnt 3450 (WL), affirming the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed.\nSaman Wickramasinghe and Parmbir Gill, for the appellant.\nTracy Kozlowski and Andrew Hotke, for the respondent.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ. \u2014\n[1] This is an appeal as of right from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed the appellant\u2019s convictions by a jury for manslaughter, discharging a firearm with intent to wound, and possession of a loaded restricted firearm without a licence. Two grounds of appeal are raised: first, a violation of the appellant\u2019s right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that would justify a stay of proceedings and, second, an error in the charge to the jury that would require a new trial. We are of the view that the first ground is dispositive, so we decline to address the second.\n[2] The events giving rise to the charges occurred on December 23, 2015. The appellant was charged the next day with various offences. The case was eventually scheduled for trial by jury in November 2018, which both parties agreed would be within the ceiling set by R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. However, on the eve of trial, changes to the Crown\u2019s case threatened to adjourn the proceedings. The defence offered to agree to a trial by judge alone, but the Crown refused. It is not disputed that had the Crown agreed to proceed by judge alone as proposed, the trial would have concluded within the Jordan ceiling. Because the Crown did not agree, the trial judge offered a trial date in June 2019, but defence counsel was unavailable. The trial was therefore rescheduled to the autumn of 2019, beginning on October 28, and it ultimately ended on November 28.\n[3] The appellant applied for a stay of proceedings. The trial judge calculated total delay as about 47.5 months. He deducted about 10 months for defence delay before committal for trial, and another 1.5 months as a discrete exceptional circumstance relating to issues with the Crown\u2019s evidence. After finding that the complexity of the case did not warrant further delay, the trial judge concluded that the net delay was about 35 months.\n[4] Even though the net delay exceeded the Jordan ceiling, the trial judge denied the stay. Applying a transitional exceptional circumstance, he found that the parties had reasonably relied upon the law as it had been before Jordan was decided. He also suggested that while the parties were aware of Jordan, they had not yet developed a \u201cfull understanding of the lessons of Jordan\u201d (2019 ONSC 320, at para. 277 (CanLII)).\n[5] In our respectful view, the trial judge erred in holding that a transitional exceptional circumstance applied, and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in upholding his decision.\n[6] First, the parties could not have reasonably relied upon the pre-Jordan state of the law after Jordan had been decided in July 2016. Nor did the parties actually rely upon the pre\u2011Jordan state of the law, as they consciously scheduled a trial within the Jordan ceiling. Rather, as this Court held in R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, the focus for delay that accrues after Jordan was decided \u201cshould instead be on the extent to which the parties and the courts had sufficient time to adapt\u201d (para. 71). As noted by Nordheimer J.A. in dissent, \u201conly a very small portion of the delay in this case preceded the decision in Jordan and most, if not all, of that delay has been laid at the feet of the defence\u201d (2022 ONCA 229, 161 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 143). Therefore, the trial judge erred in concluding that the delay in this case was \u201cjustified based on the parties\u2019 reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed\u201d (para. 278).\n[7] Second, as Nordheimer J.A. correctly observed, the Crown had \u201cample time\u201d to adapt to Jordan (para. 148). The delay beyond the ceiling was due not to a lack of time for the system to ameliorate ingrained institutional delays, but to the Crown\u2019s refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being warned of the possible consequences of delay, and despite Jordan having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. Were it not for the Crown\u2019s decision, the trial would have occurred within the ceiling. This clearly demonstrates that there was enough time for the parties and system to adapt.\n[8] We conclude that no transitional exceptional circumstance applies in this case. The result is that the net delay of about 35 months is an unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the Charter .\n[9] Like the majority and the dissent below, we reject the Crown\u2019s proposed \u201cbright\u2011line\u201d rule according to which all of the delay until the next available date following defence counsel\u2019s rejection of a date offered by the court must be characterized as defence delay. We agree with van Rensburg J.A. and Tulloch J.A., as he then was, at para. 56, that this approach is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s understanding of defence delay. Defence delay comprises \u201cdelays caused solely or directly by the defence\u2019s conduct\u201d or \u201cdelays waived by the defence\u201d (Jordan, at para. 66). Furthermore, \u201cperiods of time during which the court and the Crown are unavailable will not constitute defence delay, even if defence counsel is also unavailable\u201d (para. 64). All relevant circumstances should be considered to determine how delay should be apportioned among the participants (R. v. Boulanger, 2022 SCC 2, at para. 8). We share the view of the majority and dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case, it is unfair and unreasonable to characterize the entire period between June and October 2019 as defence delay (paras. 59 and 136).\n[10] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and order a stay of proceedings.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ursel Phillips Fellows Hopkinson, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ministry of the Attorney General for Ontario,\nCrown Law Office \u2014 Criminal, Toronto.\n"

F\u20116.3, ss. 38, 40.\nAt the end of a three\u2011year marriage, the wife and the husband executed a separation agreement which essentially provided that each party would keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the other\u2019s property, except for the family home and the household goods. The agreement, prepared by the wife, was executed at the end of a meeting with two friends of the parties, who witnessed its execution. There was no financial disclosure between the parties and neither party had the benefit of independent legal advice before signing. Nearly 17 months after the wife petitioned for divorce, the husband counter\u2011petitioned and sought family property division, arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress. The trial judge found that the agreement was not binding and declined to give it any weight. He instead equalized the family property under Saskatchewan\u2019s family property legislation, The Family Property Act (\u201cFPA\u201d), and ordered the wife to pay the husband a net equalization payment of about $90,000. The Court of Appeal set aside the trial judge\u2019s division of family property and found that the agreement was binding. It applied the framework developed by the Court in Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303, to conclude that the agreement should be afforded great weight. Based on family property values at the date closest in time to the agreement, the Court of Appeal ordered the husband to pay the wife about $5,000.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nDomestic contracts should generally be encouraged and supported by courts, within the bounds permitted by the legislature, absent a compelling reason to discount the agreement. This deference flows from the recognition that self\u2011sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family law context. In the instant case, the agreement between the wife and the husband was binding. It was fair and equitable, given the criteria and objectives of the FPA. The family home and household goods should be divided as of the date of the trial, resulting in a payment of $43,382.63, owed by the wife to the husband.\nDomestic contracts present unique advantages and concerns. On the one hand, parties are generally better positioned than courts to understand the distinctive needs and circumstances of their private relationship. On the other, parties to domestic contracts are particularly vulnerable to unfairness and exploitation, given the unique environment in which domestic contracts are negotiated and concluded. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence on domestic contracts, including Miglin, signals to courts to approach domestic contracts with caution and to have regard to important procedural protections that help ensure the deal struck is fair. Moreover, while the Court has long supported the freedom of parties to settle their domestic affairs privately, respect for private ordering cannot be permitted to thwart the public policy objectives enshrined in family law legislation. Courts must approach family law settlements with a view to balancing the values of contractual autonomy and certainty with concerns of fairness. In essence, courts must review domestic contracts with particular sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context, without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context.\nWhile useful general principles emerge from Miglin to guide courts in approaching domestic contracts, Miglin is not, and was never intended to be, a framework of general applicability for courts dealing with all types of domestic contracts. The Miglin framework, which arose within a different statutory context, should not be transposed into provincial family property legislation. Rather, the court\u2019s interpretive exercise is statute\u2011specific, and differences between property division and spousal support, division of powers concerns, and the distinctive features of particular statutes mandate a tailored analytical approach.\nLike other provincial family property legislation, the FPA begins from a presumption of equal distribution, but permits spouses to contract out of the scheme in certain circumstances. In particular, the FPA recognizes two types of domestic contracts dealing with family property. Interspousal contracts, under s. 38 of the FPA, are presumptively enforceable if they conform to the statutory formalities set out in that provision, including that the parties formally acknowledge that they understand the nature and effect of the terms of the agreement in the presence of independent counsel. Domestic contracts that do not meet the statutory requirements set out in s. 38 may still be considered by a court, and, under s. 40, assigned whatever weight the court considers reasonable. Therefore, while the FPA begins from a presumption of equal distribution, a written agreement between parties is an important factor in determining whether departure from equal division is fair and equitable in the circumstances.\nIn determining whether to consider an agreement that does not qualify as an interspousal contract under the FPA, the court should be alive to any concerns that the agreement is not valid according to ordinary contract law principles. Assuming there is a valid agreement, the court\u2019s attention shifts to whether the agreement merits consideration in the equalization analysis. The court must assess the agreement for its procedural integrity, where such concerns are raised. By examining the integrity of the bargaining process for undue pressure, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, the judge can determine whether the parties concluded the agreement freely and understanding its meaning and consequences. While safeguards like financial disclosure and independent legal advice provide critical protection in the family law context, they are not required by the legislation and their absence, without more, does not necessarily impugn the fairness of an agreement. Given the respect for spousal autonomy reflected in both the legislation and the jurisprudence, unless the court is satisfied that the agreement arose from an unfair bargaining process, an agreement is entitled to serious consideration.\nOnce the court is satisfied that an agreement is entitled to consideration, it may assess the substantive fairness of the agreement, in order to determine how much weight to afford the agreement in fashioning an order for property division. Ultimately, the weight given to the agreement in an order for the distribution of property depends on how its substance accords with what is fair and equitable in the circumstances, considering the objectives and factors of the legislative scheme. The purposes and criteria of the governing statute provide an objective yardstick against which to assess the parties\u2019 subjective understanding of what is fair, and limit the risk that parties will depart significantly from public policy goals expressed by the legislature.\nIn the instant case, the agreement was binding and there were no substantiated concerns with its fairness. The agreement is short and uncomplicated and reflects the intention of the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership. A lack of independent legal advice and formal disclosure can undermine informed choice, but was not troubling here because the husband could not point to any resulting prejudice: there was no suggestion that the absence of these safeguards undermined either the integrity of the bargaining process or the fairness of the agreement. The agreement was therefore entitled to serious consideration given that it reflects the parties\u2019 understanding of what division of property was fair in the context of their relationship at the time of separation. The trial judge erred in finding the agreement not binding on the parties and failing to consider its substance in his property distribution, and while the Court of Appeal concluded the agreement should be given great weight, it equalized the family property in a way that defeated the intent of the parties and resulted in unfairness. Besides the family home and household goods, equal division of the family property under the FPA results in unfairness. The parties were best positioned to organize the limited family property resulting from their short marriage and, given all the circumstances, the most fair and equitable solution is for their simple agreement to be given effect.\nCases Cited\nConsidered: Miglin v.

Danish Shah, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKarakatsanis J. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[1] In the family law context, private agreements present unique advantages and concerns. On the one hand, individual autonomy to settle domestic affairs should be encouraged, as parties are generally better positioned than courts to understand the distinctive needs and circumstances of their private relationships. On the other, parties to domestic contracts are particularly vulnerable to unfairness and exploitation, given the unique environment in which domestic contracts are negotiated and concluded. As a result, family law legislation typically authorizes judges to review a domestic contract. The degree of deference afforded to a domestic contract under the governing statute often depends on whether it meets statutory formalities, such as whether the parties received independent legal advice.\n[2] This appeal raises the issue of how courts should approach and weigh a domestic contract that purports to opt out of a provincial property scheme, but fails to meet the statutory requirements that would entitle it to presumptive enforceability. In particular, this appeal asks whether the analytical framework this Court developed in Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303 \u2014 which dealt with spousal support under the federal Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp .) \u2014 is appropriately applied to such a domestic contract.\n[3] This Court\u2019s jurisprudence on domestic contracts, including Miglin, recognizes that the breakdown of a spousal relationship is often wrought with emotional turmoil and can give rise to vulnerabilities that undermine the fairness of domestic contracts. The devastating impact of a separation means that parties to a separation agreement may be \u201cill-equipped to form decisions of a permanent and legally binding nature\u201d (J. D. Payne and M. A. Payne, Dealing with Family Law: A Canadian Guide (1993), at p. 78, quoted in Miglin, at para. 74). Miglin and the cases that follow it therefore signal to courts to approach domestic agreements with caution and to have regard to important procedural protections that help ensure the deal struck is fair. Moreover, while this Court has long supported the freedom of parties to settle their domestic affairs privately, respect for private ordering cannot be permitted to thwart the public policy objectives enshrined in family law legislation. Therefore, in deciding how much weight to give the agreement, a reviewing judge generally examines both the fairness of the bargaining process and the substance of the agreement, in accordance with the legislative scheme.\n[4] Like other provincial family property statutes, The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3 (FPA or Act), of Saskatchewan begins from a presumption of equal distribution, but permits spouses to contract out of the scheme in certain circumstances (relevant provisions of the FPA are reproduced in the appendix to these reasons). In particular, the FPA recognizes two types of domestic contracts dealing with family property. \u201cInterspousal contracts\u201d under s. 38 of the Act are presumptively enforceable if they conform to the statutory formalities set out in that provision, including that the parties formally acknowledge that they understand the nature and effect of the terms of the agreement in the presence of independent counsel. Domestic contracts that do not meet the statutory requirements set out in s. 38 may still be considered by a court, and, under s. 40, assigned \u201cwhatever weight [the court] considers reasonable\u201d. While the Act begins from a presumption of equal distribution, a written agreement between the parties is an important factor in determining whether departure from equal division is fair and equitable in the circumstances (see s. 21(1) and (3)(a)).\n[5] The agreement at issue was executed by separating spouses at the end of a three-year marriage. The agreement is simple: it provides essentially that each party will keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the other\u2019s property, except for the family home and the household goods. Because no lawyers were involved, the agreement is not presumptively enforceable, but can be considered by the court in determining whether to depart from equal distribution under s. 21.\n[6] The trial judge found the domestic contract was not binding on the parties and declined to give it any weight. He ordered the wife to pay the husband more than $90,000 (2019 SKQB 35). The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal found the trial judge erred in this respect, and applied the Miglin framework to conclude that the agreement should be afforded great weight (2021 SKCA 117, 463 D.L.R. (4th) 217). The Court of Appeal divided the family property using the trial judge\u2019s property valuation at the date closest in time to the agreement, and ordered the husband to pay the wife about $5,000.\n[7] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred. But I would not transpose the Miglin framework, which arose within a different statutory context, into provincial family property legislation. While useful general principles emerge from Miglin to guide courts in approaching domestic contracts, Miglin is not, and was never intended to be, a framework of general applicability for courts in dealing with all types of domestic contracts. Rather, the judge\u2019s interpretive exercise is statute-specific, and differences between property division and spousal support, division of powers concerns, and the distinctive features of the Saskatchewan statute mandate a tailored analytical approach.\n[8] In determining whether to consider an agreement that does not qualify as an interspousal contract under the FPA, the court must first assess the agreement for its procedural integrity, where such concerns are raised. By examining the integrity of the bargaining process for undue pressure, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, the judge can determine whether the parties executed the agreement freely and understanding its meaning and consequences. While safeguards like financial disclosure and independent legal advice provide critical protection in the family law context, they are not required by the legislation and their absence, without more, does not necessarily impugn the fairness of an agreement. Given the respect for spousal autonomy reflected in both the legislation and the jurisprudence, unless the court is satisfied that the agreement arose from an unfair bargaining process, an agreement is entitled to serious consideration under s. 21 of the FPA.\n[9] Once the court is satisfied that an agreement is entitled to consideration, it may assess the substantive fairness of the agreement, in order to determine how much weight to afford the agreement in fashioning an order for property division. The weight to ascribe to the substance of the agreement will ultimately be determined by what is fair and equitable according to the scheme set out by the FPA.\n[10] I agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the agreement was binding and there were no substantiated concerns with its fairness. A lack of independent legal advice and formal disclosure can undermine informed choice, but was not troubling here because the husband could not point to any resulting prejudice: there was no suggestion that the absence of these safeguards undermined either the integrity of the bargaining process or the fairness of the agreement. As a result, the agreement was entitled to serious consideration. But the trial judge erred in finding the agreement was not binding on the parties and in failing to consider its substance in his property distribution. And while the Court of Appeal concluded the agreement should be given great weight, it equalized the family property in a way that defeated the intent of the parties and resulted in unfairness.\n[11] Given the circumstances, including the brief marriage and the assets each party brought into the marriage, the simple agreement to keep individual assets and divide the family home equally was fair and equitable, given the criteria and objectives of the FPA. I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal with respect to the division of family property, and divide the family home and household goods as of the date of trial. I would order that the wife pay the husband $43,382.63.\nII. Background\n[12] Diana Anderson and James Allan Anderson were married for three years and separated on May 11, 2015. This was not the first marriage for either party and both came into the marriage with considerable assets, including houses, vehicles, personal property, RRSPs and pensions. They had no children. On July 19, 2015, the parties met with two friends, who brought the couple together to discuss the possibility of reconciliation. It soon became clear that reconciliation was not a possibility. At the end of the meeting, the parties executed an agreement, prepared by the wife, dividing the family property. It was witnessed by their two friends. There was no financial disclosure between the parties and neither party had the benefit of independent legal advice before signing. While the wife recommended that the husband \u201cthink it over and talk to a lawyer\u201d, he declined and signed immediately (Trial Reasons, at para. 79 (CanLII)).\n[13] The agreement divides all of the family property except for the family home. It largely provides that the parties\u2019 respective assets and liabilities are to remain separate, besides the family home and a truck that the wife agreed to reconvey to the husband.\n[14] Both parties contributed equally to the down payment on the family home and the couple split home ownership costs equally, including mortgage, tax and utilities. At the time of separation, there was no equity in the home and the parties would have suffered a loss had they sold it. The agreement thus provides that the home would be dealt with later. The parties agreed to have a valuation done on the home and, if they could not agree on its division, to seek mediation. After the separation, the wife continued to live in the home and the husband continued to pay half of the property taxes until June 2017, and half of the mortgage until the trial in June 2018.\n[15] The agreement also provides that the wife would give up any right to the husband\u2019s business interests. During the marriage, the husband invested in Globe-Elite Electrical Contractors Ltd., the company at which he worked. The wife considered this to be an improvident investment and refused to contribute to the share purchase. To invest, the husband borrowed a substantial sum of money from his sister and refinanced the home he had brought into the marriage. The company performed poorly in the years leading to the separation, but performed \u201cvery\u201d well in 2015, at the time of separation, returning a net corporate profit (Trial Reasons, at para. 27). After 2015, \u201cthere were no good years with losses in each subsequent year\u201d (para. 72).\n[16] Following the reconciliation meeting, the parties began to perform the terms of the agreement. The husband retrieved his furniture from the family home, cashed in some of his RRSPs, and the wife reconveyed the truck to the husband. However, the husband was not responsive to the wife\u2019s attempts to deal with the family home. The wife\u2019s lawyer subsequently contacted the husband to ask him to formalize the agreement according to the requirements of s. 38 of the FPA, which would have made the agreement presumptively enforceable. The wife\u2019s lawyer sent another letter to the husband seeking to value the husband\u2019s business interests. The husband did not respond to these overtures. Nor did he challenge or repudiate the agreement.\n[17] On December 10, 2015, the wife petitioned seeking a divorce and costs, but not spousal support or property division. On May 5, 2017, nearly 17 months after the wife filed her petition and nearly 2 years after the agreement was signed, the husband issued an answer and counter-petition in which he formally claimed for family property division and argued the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress.\n[18] The trial judge held that the agreement was unenforceable, finding the lack of independent legal advice to be \u201cmost troubling\u201d (para. 108). He found the agreement was \u201cmore akin to an agreement to agree than a contract\u201d, as it deferred the issue of the family home to be dealt with at a later date (para. 114; see also para. 109). The trial judge did not consider the substance of the agreement in dividing the family property, and instead equalized the family property under the FPA. For equalization purposes, the trial judge valued many of the parties\u2019 assets and debts as of May 2017, the date of the husband\u2019s counter-petition, but valued the parties\u2019 pensions, investments and the family home as of the date of adjudication in June 2018. Rather than give the substance of the agreement any weight, the trial judge exercised his equitable discretion under the FPA to reduce the equalization payment owed by the wife by $8,000, given the husband\u2019s refusal to communicate about the family home and his delay in filing for property division, which resulted in \u201cadditional expense and consternation\u201d for the wife (para. 278). The wife was ordered to pay the husband a net equalization payment of $62,646.98, and either an RRSP rollover valued at $37,089.69 or a further cash payment of $27,817.27, for a total of about $90,000 (para. 280).\n[19] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside the trial judge\u2019s order with respect to division of family property and costs, finding he erred in his interpretation of the agreement in several respects. Among the errors identified, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge placed too much weight on the lack of independent legal advice, which is not a requirement under s. 40 of the FPA. The Court of Appeal found that the agreement was a binding contract, not an agreement to agree, and, having regard to the Miglin framework, concluded that it was entitled to great weight. The Court of Appeal reasoned that the family property should be valued at the date closest in time to the agreement. The Court of Appeal divided the family property using values found by the trial judge as of December 2015, the date of the wife\u2019s divorce petition, and ordered the husband to pay the wife $4,914.95.\nIII. Analysis\n[20] This appeal asks how a judge should evaluate an agreement that does not meet the formal requirements of a presumptively enforceable agreement under provincial family property legislation. The specific question is whether the Miglin framework ought to apply to agreements that are not presumptively binding under the FPA.\n[21] Noting the inconsistent treatment by trial judges of agreements that do not meet the definition of an interspousal contract, the Court of Appeal set out a framework for courts to apply in assessing the weight to afford an agreement under s. 40 of the FPA. The Court of Appeal\u2019s framework asks first whether the agreement is a valid agreement according to contract law principles. If it is, the burden shifts to the party seeking to discredit the agreement to show that (1) there were inequities in the bargaining process; (2) the substance of the agreement is unfair in that it departs substantially from the objectives of the FPA; or (3) something has changed since the agreement was concluded such that it no longer reflects the parties\u2019 intentions when the agreement was entered into or no longer complies with statutory objectives. If the challenging party cannot discharge their burden as to these steps, the agreement is to be given great weight by the court. This analysis mirrors the framework set out by this Court in Miglin.\n[22] The husband contends that the application of the Miglin framework is inappropriate, given the authority granted by s. 40 to give an agreement between spouses \u201cwhatever weight\u201d the court considers reasonable. He submits that the framework creates a presumption of great weight unless the challenging party can discredit the agreement, and undermines the broad discretion conferred by s. 40.\n[23] I agree that it is inappropriate to import the Miglin framework without modification in light of the structure of the FPA and the nature of family property division. Still, principles from Miglin and other cases dealing with domestic contracts help inform judges\u2019 exercise of discretion under s. 40 of the FPA. I first canvass those cases before turning to interpret the Saskatchewan legislation.\n[24] Finally, I turn to the application of the legislation to the agreement. I examine first whether the trial judge erred in finding the agreement was not binding and failing to give it any weight. I conclude he did and agree with the Court of Appeal that the substance of the agreement should be seriously considered in making a property division order under the Act. I then examine the property division undertaken by the courts below and the proper remedy.\nA. Domestic Contracts: Miglin and Later Cases\n[25] A domestic contract is an agreement between spouses designed to organize some aspect of the couple\u2019s affairs, be it child support, custody, spousal support or family property division. The agreement may be concluded at the outset of a spousal relationship, during a spousal relationship, or at the time of separation. Over the past two decades, this Court has interpreted provisions dealing with domestic contracts in a variety of federal and provincial statutes, beginning with Miglin, the decision at the heart of the Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis below. While certain principles of general application emerge from this jurisprudence, the case law also reveals that a statute-specific approach must be taken when considering such contracts.\n[26] In Miglin, Bastarache and Arbour JJ., writing for a majority of the Court, adopted a contextual framework to discern the weight to be afforded to separation agreements dealing with spousal support under s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act . Section 15.2(4) directs judges to consider several factors in making a spousal support order, including any domestic agreement, and s. 15.2(6) instructs that a support order should advance certain objectives. The first stage of the Miglin framework examines fairness at the time the agreement was concluded. It proceeds in two parts. First, the court must evaluate the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the agreement\u201d to determine whether there were any vulnerabilities or circumstances of oppression that affected the bargaining process (para. 92; see also para. 81). This includes looking to whether the parties had professional assistance, such as legal counsel. Second, the court must assess the substance of the agreement to determine whether it is \u201cin substantial compliance with the general objectives of the [legislation] at its time of creation\u201d (para. 87).\n[27] The second stage of Miglin looks again to the substance of the agreement at the time of its enforcement to evaluate whether it still reflects the original intentions of the parties and remains consistent with the objectives of the Act. In essence, a court asks whether changes in circumstances make the agreement unfair to enforce today.\n[28] The analysis in Miglin was borne out of the spousal support context and the relevant provisions, objectives and structure of the Divorce Act . As our jurisprudence has since recognized, these origins limit the applicability of the Miglin framework in other legislative contexts.\n[29] In Hartshorne v. Hartshorne, 2004 SCC 22, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 550, Bastarache J., writing for a majority of the Court, declined to import the Miglin framework to interpret s. 65(1) of the British Columbia Family Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, which allowed a court to set aside a presumptively enforceable marriage agreement where division of property would be unfair at the time of distribution (paras. 13 and 42). Bastarache J. held that to adopt \u201cMiglin without qualification would distort the analytical structure\u201d of the B.C. statute (para. 42). In D.B.S. v. S.R.G., 2006 SCC 37, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, in considering four cases about retroactive awards for child support, the Court again did not import a Miglin analysis in assessing whether to vary a prior child support agreement between the parties, noting that two of the appeals fell under the Divorce Act , while the other two fell under Alberta\u2019s provincial regime (paras. 50-53). Rather, the Court had regard to the specific scheme set out in the legislation (see paras. 54 and 75-79). Finally, in L.M.P. v. L.S., 2011 SCC 64, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 775, this Court declined to apply the Miglin framework to interpret s. 17 of the Divorce Act , holding that the different language employed by Parliament in drafting ss. 15(2) and 17 warranted a different approach (paras. 25 and 28).\n[30] Adding to comments from this Court, scholars have also questioned the extension of Miglin\u2019s second stage of analysis to the family property division context. Spousal support is primarily a prospective and ongoing obligation that looks to future value, and is in part based on means and need; \u201c[t]he default assumption is that, spousal support is open to modification in response to changing circumstances\u201d (C. Rogerson, \u201cSpousal Support Agreements and the Legacy of Miglin\u201d (2012), 31 C.F.L.Q. 13, at p. 34; see also Miglin, at para. 209, per LeBel J., dissenting, but not on this point; Droit de la famille \u2014 152477, 2015 QCCA 1618, at para. 16 (CanLII); R. Leckey, \u201cA Common Law of the Family? Reflections on Rick v. Brandsema\u201d (2009), 25 Can. J. Fam. L. 257, at p. 280). The division of family property, by contrast, is a chiefly retrospective exercise: it takes stock of property brought into and acquired during the spousal relationship as past contributions giving rise to a property entitlement (Leckey (2009), at p. 280). The relevance of post-execution changes in circumstances is far less obvious to separation agreements dealing with property division, as opposed to spousal support. This subject matter distinction has similarly been recognized by this Court (see Miglin, at para. 76), and partly explains why we have never fully extended the Miglin framework to the division of family property (see Rick v. Brandsema, 2009 SCC 10, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 295, at para. 39; Hartshorne, at para. 42).\n[31] It is clear from this review that the Miglin framework is not a panacea for all domestic contracts. Rather, the analysis to be undertaken in determining whether to give weight to a domestic contract must be determined by reference to the distinctive nature of the underlying statutory scheme. This is especially so given our country\u2019s constitutional makeup: spousal support in the context of a divorce is dealt with under the federal Divorce Act , whereas, family property division, for instance, falls within the province\u2019s jurisdiction over property and civil rights. To automatically import a structured analysis grounded in federal legislation to interpret a discretionary provision in a provincial statute risks undermining the province\u2019s legislative authority (D.B.S., at para. 55; see also M. Bailey, \u201cLimits on Autonomy\u201d, in B. Atkin, ed., The International Survey of Family Law (2010), 95, at p. 97; Leckey (2009), at p. 287).\n[32] Still, this Court has more broadly relied on principles from Miglin that address concerns common to domestic contracts. Although Bastarache J. declined to directly apply the Miglin framework in Hartshorne and D.B.S., he relied on principles from Miglin in both cases, such as the judicial deference to be afforded to domestic contracts, to inform the inquiry to be taken under the relevant statutory scheme (see D.B.S., at para. 76; Hartshorne, at paras. 40 and 43-45). And in Rick, this Court relied on ideas from Miglin in reshaping the common law doctrine of unconscionability \u201cto reflect the uniqueness of matrimonial bargains\u201d (para. 43), recognizing a \u201cduty to make full and honest disclosure of all relevant financial information\u201d in the bargaining process (para. 47).\n[33] So while the proper interpretive framework for assessing a domestic contract is statute-specific, useful principles emerge from Miglin and this Court\u2019s subsequent jurisprudence that aid in this judicial assessment. As a starting point, domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and supported by courts, within the bounds permitted by the legislature, absent a compelling reason to discount the agreement (Miglin, at para. 46; D.B.S., at para. 76; Rick, at para. 45). This deference flows from the recognition that self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family law context (Miglin, at para. 28). Not only are parties better placed than courts to understand what is fair within the context of their relationship, but the private resolution of family affairs outside the adversarial process avoids the cost and tumult of protracted litigation (paras. 45-46; see also Association de m\u00e9diation familiale du Qu\u00e9bec v. Bouvier, 2021 SCC 54, at paras. 44 and 134).\n[34] At the same time, negotiations over domestic contracts take place in a singularly challenging environment, often at a time of acute emotional stress, \u201cin which one or both of the parties may be particularly vulnerable\u201d (Miglin, at para. 74; see also Rick, at para. 47; C. Rogerson, \u201cMiglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24: \u2018They are Agreements Nonetheless\u2019\u201d (2003), 20 Can. J. Fam. L. 197, at p. 225). In this context, the simple application of ordinary principles of contractual validity may be inadequate to quiet concerns of imbalance and exploitation (Miglin, at para. 77; M. Shaffer, \u201cDomestic Contracts, Part II: The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in Hartshorne v. Hartshorne\u201d (2004), 20 Can. J. Fam. L. 261, at p. 286). Rather, judges must approach family law settlements with a view to balancing the values of contractual autonomy and certainty with concerns of fairness. In essence, judges are to review domestic contracts with particular sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context, without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context (Miglin, at para. 82; see also R. Leckey, \u201cContracting Claims and Family Law Feuds\u201d (2007), 57 U.T.L.J. 1, at p. 14; Bailey, at p. 102 (citing the gendered unfairness that may arise from presuming incapacity to contract where a bargain is struck in an emotional context)).\n[35] Concern about vulnerabilities may be countered by the presence of procedural safeguards. For example, full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial information between the parties can go far to assuage concerns of informational asymmetry (Rick, at para. 47; Colucci v. Colucci, 2021 SCC 24, at para. 51). Similarly, professional assistance, such as independent legal advice, can serve as a hallmark of a fair bargaining process (Miglin, at para. 82; Rick, at paras. 60-61), although the curative impact of legal advice in the negotiation of domestic contracts should not be taken as given. As La Forest J. recognized, dissenting in Richardson v. Richardson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 857, divorce is one of the most stressful periods in an individual\u2019s life and many people do \u201cvery unwise things, things that are anything but mature and sensible, even when they consult legal counsel\u201d (p. 883). Courts must have careful regard to the financial and emotional pressures that characterized the relationship, and not simply presume that legal advice immunizes a contract from unfairness.\n[36] The rigour of a court\u2019s review of a domestic contract depends on the authorizing statute. Some statutes provide that a domestic contract may only be set aside where it is unconscionable, for example (see Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 33(4)), while others use the measures of \u201cinequitable\u201d or \u201cundue influence\u201d (see Marital Property Act, R.S.N.B. 2012, c. 107, s. 43; Family Property and Support Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 83, s. 2(4)). In any case, however, fairness review of a domestic contract typically looks both to the circumstances surrounding the contract\u2019s execution and to the substance of the agreement, where such a review is authorized by governing legislation. As Abella J. stated in Rick, at para. 50: \u201c. . . the best way to protect the finality of any negotiated agreement in family law is to ensure both its procedural and substantive integrity in accordance with the relevant legislative scheme\u201d.\n[37] An assessment of the substance of the agreement is generally determined by reference to the governing legislative regime. The purposes and criteria of the statute provide an objective yardstick against which to assess the parties\u2019 subjective understanding of what is fair, and limit the risk that parties will depart significantly from public policy goals expressed by the legislature. Measuring the substance of the agreement against the legislation also helps to promote greater certainty for parties, who may rely on their statutory entitlements as a reference point in organizing their personal affairs (M. Shaffer and C. Rogerson, \u201cContracting Spousal Support: Thinking Through Miglin\u201d (2003), 21 C.F.L.Q. 49, at p. 61).\n[38] In sum, our jurisprudence on domestic contracts, beginning with Miglin, values the principles of autonomy and certainty by encouraging parties to arrange their intimate affairs outside the court system. But the emotional complexities of family dynamics make contracting over domestic affairs unlike regular arm\u2019s length transactions. The unique context out of which these agreements arise requires courts to approach them with keen awareness of their potential frailties to ensure fairness, having regard for the integrity of the bargaining process and the substance of the agreement.\nB. The Saskatchewan Family Property Act\n[39] Here, the Court of Appeal was not wrong to refer to principles from Miglin to structure judges\u2019 exercise of discretion under s. 40 of the FPA. It failed, however, to appropriately tailor the analysis to the governing statutory scheme.\n[40] Family property law has evolved in response to the modern understanding of marriage as a joint economic endeavour. In 1973, Laskin J. (as he then was) recognized in dissent that a wife\u2019s contribution of labour to property in her husband\u2019s name should entitle her to a share in that property in equity (Murdoch v. Murdoch, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 423, at pp. 450-57). This opinion laid the groundwork for future cases like Pettkus v. Becker, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834, and Peter v. Beblow, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980, in which this Court extended the common law doctrine of the constructive trust to the family law context in recognition of the non-economic contributions that can entitle a spouse to share in the property accumulated during a marriage.\n[41] Similarly, years of advocacy by feminists culminated in reforms to family property legislation in the 1970s and 1980s to recognize \u201cthat women\u2019s unpaid work in the home and in child care [give] rise to an entitlement to share property accumulated during the marriage\u201d (M. Shaffer, \u201cDevelopments in Family Law: The 2003-2004 Term\u201d (2004), 26 S.C.L.R. (2d) 407, at p. 435). Thanks to these \u201chard fought gains\u201d, provincial property division schemes across the country now uniformly presume that family property ought to be divided equally upon marital breakdown, subject to exceptions and judicial discretion (Shaffer, at p. 435; see FPA, s. 21(1); Family Property Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F-4.7, s. 7(4); Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, s. 81; The Family Property Act, C.C.S.M., c. F25, s. 13; Marital Property Act (N.B.), s. 2; Family Law Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. F-2, s. 19; Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275, s. 12(1); Family Law Act, S.N.W.T. 1997, c. 18, s. 36(1); Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 5(1); Family Law Act, S.P.E.I. 1995, c. 12, s. 6(1); Family Property and Support Act (Yukon), s. 6(1)). While statutes across the provinces differ in structure \u2014 for example, on the statutory threshold for departing from equalization (see, e.g., Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 5(6) (using a threshold of \u201cunconscionable\u201d); Family Property Act (Alta.), s. 7(4) (using a threshold of \u201cnot . . . just and equitable\u201d)) \u2014 all are grounded in a presumption of equal division.\n[42] At the same time, nearly all provincial family property regimes let spouses contract out of the scheme by private agreement, so long as their agreements meet certain formal requirements, with the exception of Quebec (see Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, art. 391; Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras. 83\u201184). As a minimum, most regimes require that an agreement be in writing, signed by both parties, and witnessed to exempt family property from distribution under the statute. Some also include additional requirements, such as disclosure between the parties (see Family Law Act (B.C.), s. 93(3)(a); Family Law Act (N.W.T.), s. 8(4)(a); Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 56(4)(a); Family Law Act (P.E.I.), s. 55(4)(a)) or independent legal advice (see Family Property Act (Alta.), s. 38(2)). These statutory formalities serve to impress upon spouses the significance of their agreement and to encourage and preserve the validity of binding family property settlements (D. A. R. Thompson, \u201cWhen is a Family Law Contract Not Invalid, Unenforceable, Overridden or Varied?\u201d (2001), 19 C.F.L.Q. 399). If an agreement meets the legislative requirements, it can generally only be set aside upon a finding of significant unfairness or unconscionability (see, e.g., Matrimonial Property Act (N.S.), s. 29; Family Law Act (B.C.), s. 93(5)).\n[43] The purpose of the Saskatchewan FPA is to recognize that childcare, household management and financial provision are the mutual responsibilities of spouses, and that joint contributions are inherent to the spousal relationship (see s. 20). The Act applies both to married spouses and unmarried spouses who have cohabited continuously for a period of two years or more (see s. 2(1) \u201cspouse\u201d (c)). Like other provincial legislation, the FPA presumptively divides family property equally once an application is made by a spouse under the Act (see s. 21(1)).\n[44] Even so, where distribution according to the Act would be unfair and inequitable, the FPA empowers courts to depart from equal distribution (see ss. 21 and 22). Section 21(3) sets out several factors to guide courts in making that assessment, including: any written agreement between the spouses (s. 21(3)(a)); the period of cohabitation (s. 21(3)(b)); the duration of the period the spouses have lived separate and apart (s. 21(3)(c)); the date when family property was acquired (s. 21(3)(d)); the contribution of a third party on behalf of a spouse to the family property (s. 21(3)(e)); the contribution of one spouse to the career or career potential of another (s. 21(3)(f)); the extent to which the means and earning capacity of each spouse has been affected by the relationship (s. 21(3)(g)); any debts or liabilities of a spouse (s. 21(3)(o)); and any other relevant fact or circumstance (s. 21(3)(q)). Once satisfied that departure from equal division is warranted under the legislation, the court is empowered to make any distribution order that it considers fair and equitable (ss. 21(2)(c) and 22(2)(c)). The overarching goal of the legislative inquiry is thus the determination of a fair and equitable property distribution in the particular circumstances of a relationship.\n[45] Like other provincial family property legislation, the FPA permits spouses to contract out of the regime and resolve property matters by agreement. The Act distinguishes between a formalized agreement, referred to in the Act as an \u201cinterspousal contract\u201d, which is presumptively enforceable (s. 38), and other agreements that do not meet the requisite statutory formalities, but may still be considered and given weight by a court in making a fair and equitable property distribution (s. 40).\n[46] To constitute an interspousal contract under s. 38, the agreement must be in writing, signed by each spouse, witnessed, and an acknowledgment must be made in the presence of a lawyer that the signing spouse understands the nature and effect of the contract, and is aware of and intends to give up any statutory entitlements under the FPA. Once formalized, an interspousal contract presumptively exempts the contemplated assets from division under the statutory scheme (s. 24(1)). The legislature has determined that these formalities serve as sufficient indicators of a valid agreement and a fair bargaining process, such that the agreement will be enforced by a court, unless a challenging party can show unconscionability or gross unfairness (s. 24(2)).\n[47] Section 40 makes it clear that courts may still consider and give \u201cwhatever weight [the court] considers reasonable\u201d to agreements that fail to meet one or more of the formalities required under s. 38. And while property dealt with by a s. 40 agreement is not presumptively exempted from distribution, s. 21(3)(a) of the Act directs courts to consider any written agreement in determining whether equal division would be unfair and inequitable. Accordingly, the Act places considerable value on spousal autonomy to contract over matters of property division.\n[48] How, then, should a court approach, under s. 40, an agreement that is not an interspousal contract? As a starting point, the court should be alive to any concerns that the agreement is not valid according to ordinary contract law principles, given that it lacks one or more of the formal assurances of an interspousal contract. If such concerns arise, the court will need to satisfy itself of the agreement\u2019s validity.\n[49] Assuming there is a valid agreement, the court\u2019s attention shifts to whether that agreement merits consideration in the equalization analysis. Drawing on the general principles I have described from Miglin and subsequent cases, the relevant question under the FPA is whether any substantiated concerns about the agreement\u2019s formation were raised, such that it would be unfair to consider it. To show the agreement should not be considered, a party need not meet the stringent test of a common law defence to a contract\u2019s enforceability. Nonetheless, the challenging party must point to evidence that suggests that the agreement was tainted by undue pressure, circumstances of oppression, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, or that a defect in the bargaining process prevented the parties from understanding some essential part of the bargain. If the judge is satisfied that no such concerns are established, the agreement may be taken to represent the autonomous choice of the parties. While measures like independent legal advice and financial disclosure help ensure a fair bargaining process, they are not a statutory requirement under s. 40 of the FPA, and their absence alone is not determinative of the inquiry.\n[50] If a court is satisfied of the agreement\u2019s validity and procedural integrity, it then may consider the agreement in determining the appropriate order for the distribution of property. Given the considerable value placed on spousal autonomy to contract in the legislation and the jurisprudence, the substance of an agreement that represents the parties\u2019 subjective understanding of what property division was appropriate in the context of their relationship at the time of separation merits serious consideration.\n[51] Ultimately, however, the weight given to the agreement in an order for the distribution of property depends on how its substance accords with what is fair and equitable in the circumstances, considering the objectives and factors of the legislative scheme. The court should assess the substance of the agreement in the context of the FPA, including the Act\u2019s starting presumption of equal division and the equitable considerations set out in s. 21(3) that judges must consider in order to determine whether departures from equal distribution are justified by the circumstances. Other provisions may also be of use. Section 22, for instance, holds that departures from equal division of the family home are only justified in extraordinary circumstances or where equal division would be unfair to a custodial parent. Section 23 exempts certain property from distribution entirely. The standard is not strict compliance with statutory entitlements, however, as such a review risks gutting the FPA\u2019s enablement of private ordering (Leckey (2007), at p. 13). The question is whether the parties\u2019 autonomous choice at the time of separation falls within a range of fair and equitable possibilities contemplated by the FPA, by reference to the broad contextual factors set out in s. 21(3) and, where helpful, other provisions.\n[52] How a court takes the agreement into account is ultimately at the court\u2019s discretion in fashioning an order under s. 21(2). That the agreement is not an interspousal contract under s. 38 does not preclude it from being fully adopted by a court in making an order for the division of property, if the court is satisfied that doing so is what is fair and equitable in the circumstances. But even where an agreement departs from the FPA in some way, the court may still respect those parts of the agreement it considers fair and equitable, while disregarding the rest.\n[53] Having set out these principles, I turn to the application of this framework to the facts of the case.\nIV. Application\n[54] The agreement is short and uncomplicated. It reflects the intention of the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership, contemplating only division of the family home and household goods, and the reconveyance of a truck from the wife to the husband. This reconveyance has already taken place.\n[55] The husband contends that the agreement was executed quickly and without legal advice or disclosure. He argues the Court of Appeal was insufficiently deferential to the trial judge\u2019s discretionary determinations and factual findings on disclosure and legal advice, as well as on the issue of whether the parties executed a valid agreement.\n[56] Trial judges\u2019 decisions on matters of family law generally attract deference from appellate courts absent an error of law; a material misapprehension of the evidence; a failure to consider all relevant factors or a consideration of an irrelevant factor; or where the decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. C. (G.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1073, at p. 1077; Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at paras. 11-14; Boston v. Boston, 2001 SCC 43, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 413, at para. 73; Tysseland v. Tysseland, 2022 SKCA 39, at para. 12 (CanLII), citing Ackerman v. Ackerman, 2014 SKCA 137, 451 Sask. R. 132, at para. 23).\n[57] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the terms of the agreement in dividing the family property. There was nothing to suggest the agreement was not binding, that one party took advantage of the other or did not understand the bargain. As a result, the agreement was a relevant factor meriting serious consideration and the trial judge should have determined whether the substance of the agreement was fair and equitable by reference to the legislative scheme.\nA. Validity of the Agreement\n[58] In this case, the relevant issue of validity is whether there has been a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d, or consensus ad idem, on all essential terms of the agreement (see Jedfro Investments (U.S.A.) Ltd. v. Jacyk, 2007 SCC 55, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 679, at para. 16; J. D. McCamus, The Law of Contracts (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 31 and 97; see also Tether v. Tether, 2008 SKCA 126, 314 Sask. R. 121, at para. 62).\n[59] The trial judge found the agreement was more like an \u201cagreement to agree\u201d because it deferred final resolution of the family home until a later date and because the wife\u2019s lawyer later contacted the husband to formalize the agreement under s. 38 and to value his business interests. The trial judge held these latter communication attempts undermined the wife\u2019s contention that the agreement was binding. He also noted that the lack of legal advice \u201calone [was] sufficient to make [it] unenforceable\u201d, although, as the Court of Appeal reasoned, it is unclear whether his comments on this issue went to his analysis of the agreement under s. 38 or s. 40 (Trial Reasons, at para. 108; C.A. reasons, at para. 66). The Court of Appeal concluded the trial judge erred on all points and that the agreement was binding (para. 100).\n[60] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in principle in finding this was not a binding agreement. Consensus on all essential terms does not mean that the parties cannot defer the final resolution of an issue where the parties, as here, have included in the agreement a detailed and objective method by which to resolve it later. The agreement stated that the home would be dealt with through buyout or sale; that the parties would obtain an independent valuation of the home; that the household goods would remain with the home or be itemized and divided; and that the parties would resolve any disputes through mediation.\n[61] Nor is it necessary that the agreement resolve all issues of property division between the parties. There is a difference between a partial agreement and an incomplete agreement, and the Act does not require that an agreement deal with all issues of family property before it can be given weight. Spouses may agree to exempt certain property from equal distribution, for example, while leaving the rest to be divided under the FPA (see, e.g., s. 24(3)).\n[62] Finally, it is worth clarifying that, whatever the trial judge intended by his remark about the absence of legal advice, the involvement of counsel is not a prerequisite to enforceability under s. 40, as it is under s. 38. And I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in holding the wife\u2019s subsequent attempts to contact the husband suggested the agreement was an \u201cagreement to agree\u201d. Nothing suggested the agreement was made conditional on the execution of a formal agreement, or that it did not represent a final resolution of the parties\u2019 family property division as between them.\n[63] In my view, the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the agreement was binding on the parties.\nB. Integrity of the Bargaining Process\n[64] The husband claims that enforcing the agreement would be unfair because the parties did not engage in formal financial disclosure or consult legal counsel before signing the agreement. Although the trial judge did not refer to disclosure in his reasons, he found that the parties \u201cclearly had little understanding of the value of the assets and debts the other had\u201d or their entitlements under the FPA (para. 111). The husband suggests that the first part of this statement reflects the substantial weight placed by the trial judge on the lack of disclosure, and that the Court of Appeal ought to have deferred to this determination. But the Court of Appeal noted in its reasons that the husband did not \u201callude to inadequate disclosure or uneven knowledge of the parties\u2019 respective assets and liabilities\u201d in the proceeding (para. 103). On the issue of the parties\u2019 understanding, the Court of Appeal highlighted evidence that revealed the parties learned of one another\u2019s finances at the outset of the marriage (para. 114).\n[65] As to the lack of legal advice, the Court of Appeal noted that the involvement of counsel is not a requirement under s. 40 and that the absence of counsel here did not work to create any unfairness, given the relatively short duration of the parties\u2019 marriage and the comparable simplicity of the agreement (para. 104).\n[66] I agree with the Court of Appeal that neither the lack of disclosure nor the lack of legal advice was a reason to discount the agreement. To begin, disclosure is not a statutory precondition to the enforceability of an agreement under the FPA, even for an interspousal contract. Rather, s. 27(1) provides that a court may order disclosure between spouses upon the commencement of an application under the FPA. This case is unlike Colucci, then, in which the entire child support scheme was predicated on disclosure between the parties (see paras. 48-50).\n[67] Given that disclosure is not a legislative requirement, the lack of disclosure is only relevant if it undermined the fairness of the negotiation process. As this Court has noted several times, disclosure is critical in family law to prevent misinformation and exploitation (see Rick, at para. 47; Colucci, at para. 51). In the unconscionability context, this Court has recognized a general duty to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial information in family law cases (Rick, at para. 47). Even in the common law of unconscionability, however, the goal of requiring disclosure between contracting parties is to prevent one party from misleading the other or from exploiting an asymmetry of information (paras. 47-48, 58 and 63). A lack of disclosure, on its own, will not necessarily call for judicial intervention (para. 49). A court may intervene, however, where a failure to disclose is deliberate and coupled with misinformation, or where a failure to disclose leads to an agreement that departs substantially from the objectives of the governing legislation (para. 53). In other words, the focus is on prejudice resulting from uneven access to information.\n[68] Here, the lack of disclosure did not result in unfairness to either party. While the parties may not have been aware of the precise value of each other\u2019s assets and liabilities at the date of separation, there has been no suggestion that either party concealed important information or otherwise misled the other. Nor has there been a claim that disclosure was needed to cure an existing asymmetry of information resulting from an imbalance of power in the relationship. In fact, the husband has not pointed to any prejudice he experienced due to the lack of disclosure. This case is entirely unlike Rick, for example, in which this Court set aside a domestic contract where the husband deliberately failed to disclose significant assets and psychologically exploited his wife, who was mentally unstable, resulting in an agreement that substantially departed \u201cfrom the relevant legislative objectives and from the parties\u2019 undisputed intention to have an equal division of assets\u201d (para. 53).\n[69] Similarly, legal advice was not required here to ensure a fair bargaining process. In finding the lack of legal advice to be \u201cmost troubling\u201d, the trial judge stressed the role of counsel to counteract imbalances of bargaining power that can otherwise \u201ccarr[y] the day\u201d in the negotiation of domestic agreements when spouses are unaware of their legal entitlements (Trial Reasons, at paras. 108 and 99). However, there was no evidence of any such imbalance between the parties to this case. As this Court has instructed, vulnerabilities are not simply to be presumed because agreements are negotiated and concluded in an emotionally stressful context; a finding of vulnerability must be grounded in evidence (Miglin, at para. 82).\n[70] There is no doubt, as the trial judge recognized, that the involvement of counsel is an important safeguard to make sure parties understand the terms and effect of their agreement, as well as the rights they are giving up under the relevant statutory scheme. Just as with financial disclosure, the involvement of lawyers in the negotiation of a domestic contract helps to prevent prejudice arising from a vulnerability inherent in the parties\u2019 relationship or the bargaining process. For instance, independent legal advice helps to compensate for imbalances or informational deficiencies that may result in an agreement that is substantially unfair to one or both of the parties. Moreover, independent legal advice and financial disclosure are often functionally intertwined, in that legal advice can be instrumental in realizing the benefits of full and frank disclosure. For instance, a party may not know to request disclosure, and may not understand the legal significance of any assets that are disclosed without the advice of counsel.\n[71] Here, there was nothing to suggest that the parties did not understand the terms or effect of their agreement. Nor was there any assertion that the parties\u2019 relationship or its breakdown was characterized by vulnerability, imbalance or exploitation. And while the parties may not have been experts in the property division scheme set out by the FPA, the agreement\u2019s fairness, assessed below against the Act, is a reasonable proxy to ensure that any informational deficiency ultimately did not result in prejudice to either spouse. I note that the wife advised the husband to \u201cthink it over and talk to a lawyer\u201d before signing the agreement, but he refused and signed immediately. I agree with the Court of Appeal that, in this case, the lack of legal advice did not \u201coverride the parties\u2019 contractual autonomy\u201d or otherwise lead to unfairness in the bargaining process (para. 67).\n[72] In short, there is no reason not to consider the agreement in dividing the family property. The questions that remain are what weight should be given to the substance of the agreement under s. 21, and whether the property division undertaken by the courts below was tainted by reviewable error.\nC. Distribution of Family Property\n[73] The trial judge ignored the substance of the agreement and equalized the family property according to the Act. In doing so, he failed to consider a relevant factor in the exercise of his discretion, and his order is therefore not entitled to deference. However, his findings of fact have not been challenged. In equalizing the family property, the trial judge made findings as to the value of the assets for three possible dates: the date of the wife\u2019s petition for divorce (December 2015); the date of the husband\u2019s counter-petition for property division under the FPA (May 2017); and the date of trial (June 2018). He equalized most of the family property using the May 2017 values, but selected June 2018 as the proper date at which to value the family home, the parties\u2019 pensions and investments, and the husband\u2019s business interests, because those assets had changed in value post-separation due to market forces (Trial Reasons, at paras. 253, 261-62 and 264-65). As noted, the trial judge ultimately reduced the amount owing by the wife to the husband by $8,000 to account for the husband\u2019s silence in the two years following the execution of the agreement.\n[74] Having determined that the agreement was entitled to great weight, the Court of Appeal sought to give effect to it by dividing all of the family property as of the date of the wife\u2019s divorce petition in December 2015. The husband argues that the choice of this valuation date contravenes the statute, which provides that family property is to be valued as of the date of an application under the Act or the date of adjudication (see s. 2(1) \u201cvalue\u201d). Given that the wife did not apply for family property division in her divorce petition, so the argument goes, December 2015 is an inappropriate valuation date as there had been no application made under the FPA at that time.\n[75] In my view, the approaches to dividing the family property taken by both courts are flawed and neither is fair and equitable in light of the terms of the agreement, the scheme set out by the FPA, and the passage of time in this case. While the trial judge failed to consider the substance of the agreement in dividing the family property, the Court of Appeal\u2019s division actively undermined the agreement and resulted in unfairness. The inequity can be most clearly seen by looking to two key assets that were valued differently by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, with significant consequences for the final order: the family home and the husband\u2019s business interests. Each court below equalized one of these assets in a way that led to a result that was unfair to the parties and defeated the intent of the agreement.\n[76] Looking first to the family home, it is clear that the Court of Appeal\u2019s choice as to the valuation date resulted in an order that was not fair and equitable, regardless of whether it was at odds with s. 2(1) of the Act. The trial judge valued the family home as of the date of trial to give the husband an equal share of the equity to which he had been contributing throughout: the husband continued to pay half of the mortgage until the June 2018 date of trial. Moreover, the intention of the parties, as reflected in the agreement, was to defer the resolution of the issue of the home until a later date. To use the December 2015 value of the family home in dividing the family property would unfairly deprive the husband of his share in the growth of the home\u2019s equity, undermine the strong statutory presumption of equal division for the family home, and materially contradict the agreement (see ss. 21(3)(a) and (q) and 22(1)). In this respect, I agree with the trial judge that the husband should receive half the equity in the home as of the date of adjudication.\n[77] Yet, while the trial judge\u2019s valuation of the family home was appropriate, division of the husband\u2019s business interests at either date chosen by the courts below was highly problematic. The Court of Appeal\u2019s approach grants the wife a windfall by equalizing those interests at a time when the business was performing uncharacteristically well, when the parties had agreed that the wife would have no interest in the business at all. According to the record, 2015 was the only year of the husband\u2019s investment in Globe-Elite in which the company generated a net positive return. Under the terms of the agreement, the wife surrendered all rights to the husband\u2019s business interests at the time of separation in July 2015, when the company\u2019s value was at its highest. The business lost money in every subsequent year, and the value of the husband\u2019s interest declined by $160,000 between December 2015 and May 2017 (Trial Reasons, at para. 266). The trial judge found it was not \u201cfair, reasonable or appropriate\u201d to use the high December 2015 valuation of Globe-Elite, given the subsequent fiscal downturn the company experienced (paras. 181-82). I agree. To grant the wife an inflated share of the husband\u2019s interest in the company would be unfair to the husband and directly contradicts the clear intentions of the parties at the time of forming their agreement.\n[78] But while a December 2015 valuation date would grant the wife a windfall, the trial judge\u2019s June 2018 valuation date would work to her significant disadvantage by forcing her to share in the burden of the business\u2019s poor performance. Throughout the marriage, the wife disagreed with the husband\u2019s decision to invest in the business and refused to contribute to the share purchase. The husband incurred substantial debt in his name to finance the investment because the wife wanted no part in it (see s. 21(3)(o)). Because the value of the investment only decreased over time, a later valuation date works to the financial advantage of the husband in any division of those interests. Given that the husband waited nearly two years to challenge the agreement and apply for property division, the selection of a valuation date that not only undermines the terms of the agreement, but rewards the husband\u2019s delay would produce an order that is \u201cunfair and inequitable\u201d in the circumstances (see s. 21(2)). Just as the wife should not share in the business\u2019s profits, so she should not be held responsible for its post-separation losses.\n[79] As the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of the FPA was clearly wrong, the question of the proper remedy remains. In my view, nothing would be served by sending this case back to be retried after all this time. Accordingly, I turn to the issue of the application of the legislative property regime in this case. The first question is whether it would be unfair and inequitable to make an equal distribution, having regard to the agreement, under s. 21(3)(a). The agreement is entitled to serious consideration given that it reflects the parties\u2019 understanding of what division of property was fair in the context of their relationship at the time of separation. I am of the view, as was the Court of Appeal, that the parties\u2019 solution was also fair and equitable by reference to the legislative scheme (para. 120).\n[80] The agreement reflects an intention to split the family home and household goods equally, in line with the special rules for the treatment of the family home in the FPA (see s. 22(1)) and essentially keeps separate the rest of the family property (including the investments, businesses, pensions, and debts of each of the parties). As the trial judge found, both parties entered the marriage already owning homes, vehicles, savings and personal property, the balance of which was \u201cnot equal but also not so imbalanced that it was an unreasonable economic alliance\u201d (paras. 9 and 268) (see s. 21(3)(d)). Their marriage was short, and there is no suggestion either party disproportionately contributed to the responsibilities of the shared partnership, or suffered because of its breakdown (see s. 21(3)(b) and (e) to (g)). In this context, allowing each party to keep their own property and abandon claims to the other\u2019s property is fair and equitable.\n[81] Besides the family home and household goods, equal division of the family property under the FPA results in unfairness. As I have explained, the valuation dates chosen by each of the two courts for an important asset disadvantaged one party in a way that is unfair, particularly given the agreement. The courts\u2019 equalization also divides other significant assets that the parties intended to keep separate, such as the parties\u2019 pensions and RRSPs \u2014 personal assets each party brought into the marriage that naturally only continued to increase in value over time. I see no reason for the parties to be forced to share that increase in value two years post-separation, which would be the presumptive result under the Act. Apart from the family home, the husband\u2019s business interests, and the parties\u2019 pensions and investments, the remaining family property consists mainly of tools, jewelry and bank accounts that are not of significant value relative to other assets.\n[82] It would also be unfair to equalize the family property, in this case, given the delay of the husband in challenging the agreement. As of the trial date in June 2018, the parties had lived separate and apart nearly as long as they had been married (see s. 21(3)(c)). By that point, the record suggests the parties had considered their affairs to be resolved through agreement for close to two years, as shown by their actions between the date of the agreement and the husband\u2019s counter-petition (see s. 21(3)(a)). The husband retrieved his furniture from the family home and cashed in some of his RRSPs, and the wife reconveyed the truck to the husband and sold a trailer she used with the husband during the marriage (C.A. reasons, at paras. 78 and 122). The husband\u2019s conduct led the wife to believe that the matter of property division had been resolved, so that she did not apply for property division in her divorce petition. Any delay in valuing the assets thus only works to the advantage of the husband, given post-separation changes in the values of important assets. I find that it would be unfair for the husband to benefit from the delay he caused.\n[83] I would enforce the agreement according to its terms, as the wife requested before the Court of Appeal (although before this Court she sought to uphold the Court of Appeal\u2019s property division). As the Court of Appeal acknowledged, there is \u201ca certain logic and attraction\u201d to this remedy (para. 132). The parties were best positioned to organize the limited family property resulting from their short marriage and, given all the circumstances, the most fair and equitable solution is for their simple agreement to be given effect.\n[84] The only property the agreement contemplated dividing was the family home and the household goods. I would limit the equalization calculation to these assets alone. As noted, valuing the family home as of the date of trial was fair, given the husband\u2019s continued contribution to the mortgage and the terms of the separation agreement. No circumstances warrant departing from the strong presumption of equal distribution of a family home in the FPA (see s. 22(1)). Dividing these assets as of the date of adjudication results in a payment of $43,382.63, owed by the wife to the husband.\nV. Conclusion\n[85] I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal with respect to the division of family property and make an order that the wife pay the husband $43,382.63. As success is divided in this Court, each party will bear their own costs in this Court.\nAPPENDIX\nDistribution of family property\n21(1) On application by a spouse for the distribution of family property, the court shall, subject to any exceptions, exemptions and equitable considerations mentioned in this Act, order that the family property or its value be distributed equally between the spouses.\n(2) Subject to section 22, where, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (3), the court is satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to make an equal distribution of family property or its value, the court may:\n(a) refuse to order any distribution;\n(b) order that all the family property or its value be vested in one spouse;

Many considered his comments to be derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. H, a gay man, teacher, and former president of a large teachers\u2019 union in the province, was prominent among the dissenting voices and made statements to media. H called N\u2019s views bigoted, transphobic, and hateful; accused him of undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in schools; and questioned whether he was suitable to hold elected office.\nN sued H for defamation. H then applied to have N\u2019s defamation action dismissed as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (\u201cSLAPP\u201d) under s. 4 of British Columbia\u2019s Protection of Public Participation Act (\u201cPPPA\u201d). The chambers judge allowed the application and dismissed the action. He held both that H had a valid fair comment defence and that the value in protecting his expression outweighed the resulting harm done to N. The Court of Appeal disagreed on both counts and reinstated the action.\nHeld (C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.: The chambers judge did not err in concluding that the public interest weighing exercise mandated dismissal of the underlying action or that N failed to adequately challenge the validity of H\u2019s fair comment defence. Accordingly, his order dismissing the defamation action should be restored.\nSection 4 of the PPPA creates a pretrial screening mechanism that instructs a judge to dismiss an action arising from expression on a matter of public interest unless the plaintiff can satisfy the judge that their action has substantial merit (s. 4(2)(a)(i)); the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)); and the harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression is serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting that expression (s. 4(2)(b)). A s. 4 application first requires the defendant to prove that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest (s. 4(1)), at which point the onus shifts to the plaintiff under s. 4(2). The order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is at the discretion of the court, but the court must dismiss the proceeding if the plaintiff does not meet its onus as to either s. 4(2)(a) or 4(2)(b). Section 4 is nearly identical to the pretrial screening mechanism established by subss. (3) and (4) of s. 137.1 of Ontario\u2019s Courts of Justice Act: the core feature of both laws is the recognition that even claims with substantial merit will be dismissed where the public interest in preserving free debate outweighs the harm to the plaintiff that the litigation purports to address. Given the substantial similarity between the laws, the Court\u2019s interpretation of s. 137.1 in 1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, and Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645, applies with equal force to s. 4 of the PPPA.\nUnder s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA, on one side of the public interest weighing exercise, the factor to be considered in favour of the public interest in continuing the proceeding is the likely harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression. Although general damages are presumed in defamation law, the weighing exercise prescribed by s. 4(2)(b) requires that the harm to the plaintiff be serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression. While the presumption of damages can establish the existence of harm, it cannot establish that the harm is serious.\nTo succeed on the weighing exercise, a plaintiff must provide evidence that enables the judge to draw an inference of likelihood of harm of a magnitude sufficient to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression. Moreover, the legislation requires some evidence that enables the judge to infer a causal link between the defendant\u2019s expression and the harm suffered. Where the defendant is not the only one speaking out against the plaintiff, inferring a causal link between the defendant\u2019s expression and the harm suffered by the plaintiff becomes both more important and more difficult. In the instant case, given the dearth of evidence from N on harm, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that N had adduced almost no evidence of damage suffered as a result of H\u2019s statements.\nThe harm relevant to the public interest weighing exercise is harm to the plaintiff caused by the defendant\u2019s statements, not by the plaintiff\u2019s inability to sue. The loss of a right to sue is a possible outcome of the public interest weighing exercise, not an input. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal\u2019s consideration of a chilling effect flowing from a plaintiff\u2019s inability to pursue a defamation claim turns the concept on its head. The Court\u2019s freedom of expression jurisprudence addresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest. Instead, the Court of Appeal held that the inability to inflict a legal penalty on H would chill N\u2019s expression and those of others who wish to express unpopular views. There is no chilling effect in barring potential plaintiffs from silencing their critics and collecting damages through a defamation suit.\nThe other side of the weighing exercise evaluates the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression. In making this assessment, s. 2(b) Charter jurisprudence grounds the level of protection afforded to the defendant\u2019s expression in the nature of the expression. Similarly, s. 15(1) considerations may factor into the weighing analysis. As the Constitution recognizes, not all expression is created equal, and the level of protection to be afforded to any particular expression can vary widely according to the quality of the expression, its subject matter, the motivation behind it, or the form through which it was expressed. The closer the expression lies to the core values of s. 2(b), including truth\u2011seeking, participation in political decision-making and diversity in the forms of self\u2011fulfillment and human flourishing, the greater the public interest in protecting it.\nSome speakers seek to contribute to public discourse by countering ignorant or harmful expression with an informed or compassionate response. In s. 2(b) jurisprudence, this idea of \u201ccounter\u2011speech\u201d inheres in the recognition that the open exchange of ideas is a precondition to unlocking the value of free expression. While counter\u2011speech is not necessarily a complete solution to harmful expression, its close proximity to the values at the core of s. 2(b) is beyond doubt. Counter\u2011speech motivated by the defence of a vulnerable or marginalized group in society also engages the values at the core of s. 15(1); namely, the equal worth and dignity of every individual. Targets of degrading expression belonging to a vulnerable group in society may lack the ability or authority to effectively combat the harmful speech themselves. Discourse can then take on an uneven quality, making protective counter\u2011speech by the group or individual\u2019s more powerful advocates all the more influential and important.\nIn the instant case, H\u2019s expression is counter\u2011speech motivated by a desire to promote tolerance and respect for a marginalized group in society. H spoke out to counter expression he perceived to be untrue, prejudicial towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, and potentially damaging to transgender youth. The transgender community is undeniably a marginalized group in Canadian society. The history of transgender individuals in Canada has been marked by discrimination and disadvantage. Transgender and other gender non\u2011conforming individuals were largely viewed with suspicion and prejudice until the latter half of the 20th century, and have been stereotyped as diseased or confused simply because they identify as transgender. Significant legal advancements in transgender rights have only come in the last 35 years, with most change taking place in the last decade, and judicial recognition of the plight of transgender individuals in Canada is growing in the wake of legislative progress. Yet, despite some gains, courts and tribunals have recognized that transgender people remain among the most marginalized in Canadian society, and continue to live their lives facing disadvantage, prejudice, stereotyping, and vulnerability.\nH\u2019s counter\u2011speech fell close to the core of s. 2(b). His expression served a truth\u2011seeking function, and in speaking out, he sought to counter expression that he and others perceived to undermine the equal worth and dignity of marginalized groups. There is a great public interest in protecting H\u2019s freedom of speech on such matters. The subject matter of H\u2019s speech (commenting on the value of a government initiative, the need for safe and inclusive schools, and the fitness of a candidate for public office), the form in which it was expressed (solicited by the media to present a counter\u2011perspective within an ongoing debate), and the motivation behind it (to combat discriminatory and harmful expression and to protect transgender youth in schools) are all deserving of significant protection. The chambers judge\u2019s conclusion that the public interest in protecting H\u2019s expression outweighed the public interest in remedying the harm to N should be affirmed.\nThe chambers judge also did not err in concluding that N failed to challenge the validity of the fair comment defence. Section 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA provides that a court must make a dismissal order unless the plaintiff satisfies the court that there are grounds to believe that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The fair comment defence is premised on the idea that citizens must be able to openly declare their real opinions on matters of public interest without fear of reprisal in the form of actions for defamation. The fair comment defence has five elements: the comment must be on a matter of public interest; be based on fact; be recognisable as a comment; satisfy an objective test (could any person honestly express that opinion on the proved facts?); and the speaker cannot be actuated by express malice. Consideration of the elements of the fair comment defence requires an assessment of the defamatory words used in the full context surrounding their use.\nIn the instant case, N failed to adequately challenge the fair comment defence. First, N has not shown grounds to believe that H\u2019s statements lacked a factual basis. To constitute fair comment, a factual basis for the impugned statement must be explicitly or implicitly indicated within the publication itself or the facts must be so notorious as to be already understood by the audience. There is, however, no requirement that the facts support the comment, in the sense of confirming its truth. At trial, H need not demonstrate that N is bigoted, transphobic, or promoted hatred, as the question is merely whether the statement can be tethered to an adequate factual basis so the reader can be an informed judge. N\u2019s original online post could provide the requisite factual basis for most statements at issue, as N\u2019s views were available to readers and grounded H\u2019s statements. Additionally, this was a high-profile local controversy that spanned over a year, involving two public figures. N\u2019s statements had likely achieved a level of notoriety such that they would have been known to the reading audience.\nFurthermore, the chambers judge was entitled to find that the sting of H\u2019s statements was comment and it would have been understood as such by readers. For expression to constitute fair comment, the statement must be one that would be understood by a reasonable reader as a comment, rather than a statement of fact. Context is essential in distinguishing comment from fact. N has not shown grounds to believe that H\u2019s statements would not be seen as a comment in the context of the instant case. An allegation of bias or prejudice is a debatable assertion as to a state of mind and will typically be classified as a comment. Similarly, an allegation that a politician has not lived up to their obligations is generally understood to be a critique, not a declaration of fact. Finally, accusations of hate speech would not necessarily be understood by ordinary readers as referring to a Criminal Code offence. Such allegations have permeated public discourse in a way that well exceeds their narrow meaning within the legal system. It is clear, when read in context, that H\u2019s statements were an expression of H\u2019s beliefs based on his own interpretation of N\u2019s statements.\nFinally, the chambers judge did not err in his malice assessment. A finding of a subjective honest belief negates the possibility of finding malice; such a finding can be based on the thrust of the defendant\u2019s evidence, read as a whole. Ultimately, the chambers judge found that H\u2019s affidavit made it clear that he honestly believed the views he espoused, and he was entitled to do so.\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The question is not whether the Court agrees with either party\u2019s expression, but whether N\u2019s action should be dismissed at this early stage of the proceeding. It should not. N deserves to have his day in court.\nThere is disagreement with the structure of the majority\u2019s analysis, which begins with the public interest weighing exercise and then examines the validity of H\u2019s fair comment defence. That is not how the analysis must be conducted. When an application is brought under s. 4 of the PPPA, the plaintiff in the proceeding must first overcome a merits\u2011based hurdle by demonstrating that there are grounds to believe that the proceeding has substantial merit and demonstrating that there are grounds to believe that the applicant under the PPPA has no valid defence in the proceeding. Only then should the court conduct the public interest weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b), which is the final step of the analysis. In asserting that the order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is at the discretion of the court, the majority is effectively ignoring the Court\u2019s recent decision in Pointes, and undermining the legislative objective behind s. 137.1 of Ontario\u2019s Courts of Justice Act and s. 4 of the PPPA alike, namely, to ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim.\nUnder s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The standard is not a very demanding one: it requires showing that there is a basis in law and in the record for finding that there is no valid defence, taking into account the stage of the proceeding at which the application is brought. To succeed, the plaintiff does not have to establish that the defendant has no valid defence for every impugned statement; it suffices that a valid defence is unavailable for some statements or even only one. For this reason, it is important to examine the defamatory sting and the context of each of the impugned statements in order to assess the availability of a defence. This is particularly critical where a fair comment defence is being advanced. Assessing the availability of such a defence requires a careful review of the impugned statement in the context of the publication in which it appeared to determine whether it is recognizable as a comment rather than as a statement of fact.\nThere is a difference between comment or criticism and allegations of fact. A defining feature of a comment is that it is generally incapable of being proven. Similarly, a comment must be clearly recognizable as such and not be so entangled with allegations of fact that inferences cannot be distinguished from facts. Any ambiguity in this regard must benefit the plaintiff. The inquiry is an objective one aimed at discerning the perception of the reasonable viewer or reader. The chambers judge cursorily examined this issue. He concluded that the impugned statements could not be distinguished from those in WIC Radio v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, which were found to be comments. Characterizing speech as a comment or as a statement of fact involves a contextual analysis, the result of which is at most a finding of mixed law and fact. Transposing a finding of mixed law and fact to another case is a questionable practice that should be avoided.\nIn the instant case, there are grounds to believe that the fair comment defence is not available for two of H\u2019s statements because they were made as statements of fact and not comments. Those statements carry the defamatory sting that N engaged in hate speech. Affirming that N engaged in hate speech is quite different from expressing a judgment or making a remark incapable of proof. Read in their context, such allegations appear similar to allegations of fraud, theft or other criminal conduct that have been found to be statements of fact for which a fair comment defence is not available.\nAt the public interest hurdle under s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA, what is required of a plaintiff is not to prove harm or causation but only to provide evidence for the judge to draw an inference of likelihood in respect of the existence of the harm and the relevant causal link. The seriousness of the harm can be inferred from the gravity of the impugned statements, and allegations of hate speech rank high on the scale of seriousness. Regardless of whether such conduct is characterized as a criminal offence or as the subject matter of a human rights complaint, accusing a person of hate speech or promoting hatred against an identifiable group is extremely damaging to that person\u2019s reputation.\nThe absence of an apology is another aggravating factor increasing harm, as is the stature of the defendant. The greater the reputation of the defendant, the greater the impact that defamation can be expected to have on the plaintiff. In addition, the context of the publication and the platform on which the impugned statements were published should have been considered. The anonymity offered by the Internet, combined with the increased accessibility and information sharing, can result in greater harm to a person\u2019s reputation. Moreover, it is an error to discount the part played by a defendant in a plaintiff\u2019s harm because others had expressed similar criticism towards the plaintiff. A definitive determination of a defendant\u2019s part in a plaintiff\u2019s harm is not required at this stage of the proceeding. Further, the fact that a plaintiff was not silenced by a defendant\u2019s statements does not negate any harm suffered.\nThe role of the court in the public interest weighing exercise under the PPPA is not and should not be to evaluate the soundness of the parties\u2019 respective positions on an issue. Freedom of expression is content\u2011neutral and would be seriously undermined if the outcome of the weighing exercise depended on the alignment between the views expressed by the defendant and those held by the court. The majority follows an improper path of reasoning when it justifies reinstating the chambers judge\u2019s dismissal order on the basis that H\u2019s expression promotes equality. Equality is not one of the competing values at play under legislation designed to discourage SLAPPs; the protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression are. Moreover, the promotion of equality is not one of the core values underpinning freedom of expression. Assigning any role to the promotion of equality in the assessment of the public interest in protecting expression goes against the doctrine of content neutrality embraced by the Court in its jurisprudence. More importantly, the promotion of equality is in no way a factor tethered to the text of s. 4(2)(b), and for this reason alone, is not a relevant factor in the public interest weighing exercise.\nFinally, restricting the availability of tort actions for defamation can have a chilling effect. In the context of defamatory counter\u2011speech, interpreting s. 4 of the PPPA so as to deprive defamed parties who have suffered serious harm of their day in court could very well be detrimental to public debate. It could prevent those who hold controversial or unpopular views from entering the public arena to share them. This conclusion does not turn the concept of chilling effect on its head. The deprivation, through a court order, of a party\u2019s right to vindicate a legitimate claim imposes a legal penalty on that party.\nIn the instant case, the chambers judge erroneously ignored factors aggravating the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by N, despite the fact that they were specifically argued by him. In addition, he gave little consideration to the competing public interests and failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression, which constitutes a reviewable error. The chambers judge also erred in failing to consider the chilling effect that the dismissal of N\u2019s claim might have on future expression by others. The harm likely to have been or to be suffered by N strongly militates in favour of allowing the proceeding to continue, and the public interest in allowing N\u2019s claim to proceed to trial outweighs the public interest in protecting H\u2019s expression.\nCases Cited\nBy Karakatsanis J.\nApplied: WIC Radio Ltd. v.

Introduction\n[1] At the core of defamation law are two competing values: freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. Each is essential to maintaining a functional democracy. This appeal presents an opportunity to clarify the proper equilibrium between these two values where the expression at issue relates to a matter of public interest.\n[2] Defamation suits are a way to vindicate an individual\u2019s personal or professional reputation in the face of attack, but can have the undesirable effect of suppressing the open debate that is the cornerstone of a free and democratic society. For this reason, certain provincial legislatures have targeted strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs), or actions that disproportionately suppress free expression on matters of public interest. This case concerns the application of s. 4 of British Columbia\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, the Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (PPPA).\n[3] The defamation suit at the heart of this proceeding arises out of a high\u2011profile public debate \u2014 spanning traditional print media, the internet, rallies, protests, and a local election \u2014 on British Columbia\u2019s efforts to combat discrimination against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth.\n[4] The parties are both local public figures. Barry Neufeld, a public school board trustee in Chilliwack, British Columbia, made online posts criticizing a provincial government initiative designed to equip educators to instruct students about gender identity and sexual orientation. Mr. Neufeld\u2019s posts triggered significant local controversy, spurring protests and calls for Mr. Neufeld to resign. Many considered his comments to be derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. Glen Hansman, a gay man, teacher, and former president of the British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation (BCTF), a large teachers\u2019 union in the province, was prominent among the dissenting voices and made statements to media. Mr. Hansman called Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views bigoted, transphobic, and hateful; accused him of undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in schools; and questioned whether he was suitable to hold elected office.\n[5] Mr. Neufeld sued for defamation. Mr. Hansman then applied to have Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation action dismissed as a SLAPP under s. 4 of the PPPA. The core feature of the PPPA is that it instructs courts to dismiss even meritorious claims where the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s freedom of expression outweighs the public interest in remedying the harm done to the plaintiff. It also requires the plaintiff to meet a merits threshold by demonstrating grounds to believe that the underlying proceeding has substantial merit and that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding.\n[6] The chambers judge found that Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation action had the effect of unduly suppressing debate on matters of public interest and dismissed the suit (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205). The chambers judge held both that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence and that the value in protecting his expression outweighed the resulting harm done to Mr. Neufeld. The Court of Appeal disagreed on both counts and reinstated the action (2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217).\n[7] I agree with the chambers judge. Mr. Neufeld argued in the courts below and in this Court that he only criticized a policy; he never expressed hatred towards the transgender community, nor did his words create an unsafe school environment for transgender students. But his submissions miss the mark. Mr. Neufeld\u2019s right to criticize a government initiative is not in dispute. Rather, the central issue is whether Mr. Hansman had a right to respond to Mr. Neufeld in the way he chose without the threat of civil liability. In my view, he did.\n[8] The fair comment defence asks whether a person could honestly hold the views Mr. Hansman expressed and whether Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements related to a matter of public interest and were recognizable as comments based on facts. The chambers judge found that Mr. Neufeld did not adequately challenge any of these elements and he was entitled to dismiss the proceeding on this basis.\n[9] Even if Mr. Neufeld had discharged his burden as to the fair comment defence, however, the chambers judge was entitled to dismiss the defamation claim because the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression is not outweighed by the limited harm to Mr. Neufeld. Mr. Hansman\u2019s words were not a disproportionate or gratuitous response to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements, and there is a substantial public interest in protecting his counter-speech. Mr. Hansman spoke out to counter expression that he and others perceived to be discriminatory and harmful towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth \u2014 groups especially vulnerable to expression that reduces their worth and dignity in the eyes of society and questions their very identity. Not only does protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression preserve free debate on matters of public interest, it also promotes equality, another fundamental democratic value.\n[10] I would restore the order of the chambers judge dismissing the defamation action.\nII. Background\n[11] The public debate from which this appeal arises centered on provincial efforts to promote inclusion and counter discrimination against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ people in schools. In 2016, British Columbia amended its Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, to include a prohibition against discrimination based on \u201cgender identity or expression\u201d. Gender identity refers to one\u2019s deeply felt and inherent sense of self in relation to gender, or the social system of roles, behaviours, and expressions associated with sex at birth.[1] Gender identity is distinct from gender expression, which refers to the way one outwardly expresses gender, through clothes, behaviour, speech, pronouns, and more.[2] While gender was once understood only in the binary of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d, today, society\u2019s understanding of gender has broadened to encompass a spectrum of gender identities, modes of expression, and related terminology, all of which continue to evolve.[3]\n[12] Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex assigned to them at birth.[4] In April 2022, Canada became the first country in the world to publish census data on transgender and non-binary people.[5] The census estimated that, as of May 2021, there were over 100,000 transgender or non-binary people aged 15 and older in Canada \u2014 about 1 out of every 300 people.\n[13] Shortly after British Columbia\u2019s amendment to its Human Rights Code in 2016, the Ministry of Education ordered school boards in British Columbia to add \u201cgender identity or expression\u201d as a prohibited ground of discrimination in their student codes of conduct. The Ministry also collaborated with others, including the BCTF, to develop Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 (SOGI 123), an initiative to guide educators on instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity. The aim of SOGI 123 is to foster inclusion and respect for students who, because of their identity or expression, may face discrimination in British Columbia schools.\n[14] Mr. Neufeld publicly criticized SOGI 123. His first critique was posted on Facebook on October 23, 2017. In it, he called SOGI 123 a \u201cweapon of propaganda\u201d that teaches the \u201cbiologically absurd theory\u201d that \u201cgender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 16). He also lamented that children were \u201cbeing taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm\u201d (p. 16). He voiced his support for \u201ctraditional family values\u201d and heralded countries like Russia and Paraguay, which have \u201chad the guts to stand up to these radical cultural nihilists\u201d (p. 16). He acknowledged that he posted at the risk of \u201cbeing labelled a bigoted homophobe\u201d, but felt his voice needed to be heard (p. 16).\n[15] Mr. Neufeld\u2019s post was met with quick and forceful criticism. Within hours, major media outlets reported on the post, quoting members of the public, educational professionals, and other public figures denouncing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views. The former chair of the Vancouver School Board called for Mr. Neufeld to resign and apologize. The Chilliwack District Parent Advisory Council chair said that Mr. Neufeld\u2019s \u201ccomments promote the exclusion and isolation of a growing subset of children, including those with same-sex parents\u201d and transgender students in contravention of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s \u201cduty to ensure a safe and positive learning environment for all\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144).\n[16] Mr. Hansman was among Mr. Neufeld\u2019s more vocal critics. At issue in this appeal are 11 publications quoting statements made by Mr. Hansman to the media in his capacity as president of the BCTF. Mr. Hansman has admitted making the statements as alleged (Chambers Judge\u2019s Reasons, at para. 44).\n[17] The first three were published the day after Mr. Neufeld\u2019s Facebook post, when Mr. Hansman was contacted by the media for comment. An article by the Vancouver Sun included the following quote:\n[Mr. Neufeld] should step down or be removed . . . .\nIt\u2019s not OK. The public school system in this province and in Canada have the obligation to ensure safe and inclusive school environments for all kids regardless of race, nationality, or religion. They have to proactively address sexism and misogyny, they have to address transphobia and homophobia and racism.\nAnd Mr. Neufeld, I\u2019m doubtful that Mr. Neufeld did not know that. I\u2019m doubtful that he\u2019s not aware if he\u2019s been around as a trustee for some time.\n(Amended notice of civil claim, A.R., vol. I, p. 80 (ANCC), at para. 14) (Statement 1)\n[18] Then, in an interview with Global News, Mr. Hansman described Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views as \u201cintolerant\u201d, \u201cbigoted\u201d and stated that \u201cwhether [Mr. Neufeld] likes it or not, members of the LGBTQ school community are here to stay\u201d (ANCC, at para. 15) (Statement 2).\n[19] Finally, a Huffington Post article reported that Mr. Hansman \u201csaid Neufeld should resign because he ha[d] violated his obligations as a school board trustee to ensure that students and staff have a safe, inclusive environment (ANCC, at para. 16). This article also reported that \u201cHansman said trustees with faith-based views need to figure out how they\u2019ll work in a secular public school system\u201d or should look to work elsewhere (ANCC, at para. 16) (Statement 3).\n[20] Others contributed to the chorus of public critiques condemning Mr. Neufeld\u2019s Facebook post, including the president of the British Columbia School Trustees Association, other members of the Chilliwack School Board, transgender activists, and the Minister of Education, who called Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views \u201coutdated and bigoted\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 169). Many people posted statements of opposition or statements of support on Mr. Neufeld\u2019s Facebook page.\n[21] Two days after his post, Mr. Neufeld issued a public apology on his Facebook page, in which he stated that he was \u201ccritical of an educational resource, not individuals\u201d and that he \u201cbelieve[s] in inclusion and a safe learning environment\u201d for all students (C.A. Reasons, at para. 12).\n[22] But that was not the end of the matter. Both Mr. Neufeld and Mr. Hansman continued to express themselves publicly during the next year. Others also continued to speak out against Mr. Neufeld.\n[23] About a month after his original post, Mr. Neufeld spoke at a rally organized by a group called Culture Guard, which has a mandate to end the \u201cpolitical tyranny of politically-correct idiotology\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 70). As part of its efforts, Culture Guard seeks to \u201cSTOP SOGI 123\u201d (p. 87). During his speech, Mr. Neufeld described SOGI 123 as \u201can institutionalization of codependency: encouraging and enabling dysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns\u201d and as \u201ccoddling and encouraging what I regard as the sexual addiction of gender confusion\u201d (A.R., vol. V, at p. 10). He claimed that using SOGI 123 resources in classrooms amounts to \u201c[g]aslighting\u201d and an \u201cattack [on] the foundation of a child\u2019s being which is child abuse\u201d (p. 10).\n[24] Mr. Neufeld\u2019s remarks at the rally were not limited to SOGI 123. He also commented that \u201cgender is . . . rooted in biology\u201d, and lamented that media coverage of famous transgender individuals has spurred a \u201cnew fad\u201d of \u201cgender confusion\u201d (p. 11). He stated that \u201crushing into the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and gender reassignment [is] child abuse\u201d and referred to gender reassignment surgery as \u201clopping off perfectly good body parts\u201d (pp. 10-11).\n[25] In January 2018, the Chilliwack Teachers\u2019 Association (CTA) passed a motion of non-confidence in the Chilliwack Board of Education for its failure to intervene in the wake of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements about SOGI 123. In a letter to the media, the CTA cited growing concerns for \u201cthe emotional and physical safety of students, staff and teachers\u201d (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 157). Mr. Hansman was quoted in the letter as stating that: \u201c[s]ometimes our beliefs, values, and responsibilities as professional educators are challenged by those who promote hatred\u201d (ANCC, at para. 20) (Statement 4). That letter was published in two local newspapers.\n[26] Subsequently, the Chilliwack School Board and the Minister of Education asked Mr. Neufeld to resign from office. He refused and issued a press release declaring that he supports all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, or background. He concluded:\nI have simply taken issue with one facet of the SOGI 1-2-3 learning resources; the teaching of the controversial gender-fluid theory as fact. Despite the pressure to resign, I believe that I must remain on the Board to be a lonely voice protecting impressionable children who I believe will be confused and harmed, resulting in increased occurrences of gender dysphoria in at-risk children.\n(A.R., vol. V, at p. 18)\n[27] Gender dysphoria is a clinical diagnosis received by some transgender and other gender diverse people. It denotes an \u201caversion to some or all of [the] physical characteristics or social roles\u201d associated with the sex one was assigned at birth.[6]\n[28] At the end of January 2018, the BCTF and the CTA jointly filed a complaint against Mr. Neufeld in the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, alleging that Mr. Neufeld had violated British Columbia\u2019s Human Rights Code. The complaint alleges that Mr. Neufeld created a discriminatory work environment for union members, and published statements that are discriminatory or are \u201clikely to expose transgender individuals to hatred\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at p. 116). The local branch of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) had filed a similar complaint against Mr. Neufeld and the Chilliwack School Board earlier that month.\n[29] In April 2018, Mr. Hansman was interviewed by various media outlets about the teachers\u2019 human rights complaint. In one article, Mr. Hansman is quoted as calling Mr. Neufeld\u2019s comments \u201ctransphobic\u201d and alleging that Mr. Neufeld was \u201ccreating a school environment for [BCTF] members and students that is discriminatory and hateful\u201d (ANCC, at para. 24) (Statement 5). In another, Mr. Hansman is quoted as saying that Mr. Neufeld \u201ctip toed quite far into hate speech\u201d and did not fulfill his duty to ensure student safety (para. 25) (Statement 6). A third article said the human rights complaint referred to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s comments as \u201chateful\u201d and that they created an unsafe school environment, and quoted Mr. Hansman as stating that Mr. Neufeld should not be \u201canywhere near students\u201d (para. 26) (Statement 7).\n[30] Also in April, duelling rallies were held outside the BCTF office, one supporting SOGI 123 and another, organized by Culture Guard, against it. When interviewed by media about the rallies, Mr. Hansman said he was glad to see the public show of support for SOGI 123, given \u201cthe hateful comments\u201d made by Mr. Neufeld and the need for schools to be free from discrimination and safe for all students (ANCC, at para. 28) (Statement 8).\n[31] As the October 2018 Chilliwack civic election approached, Mr. Hansman was interviewed by media about his thoughts on an anti-SOGI slate of candidates vying for seats on the Chilliwack School Board. In September, an article was posted by a local news outlet quoting Mr. Hansman as stating:\nIt is extremely problematic to have somebody who is running as a school trustee continuing to spread hate about LGBTQ people \u2014 especially trans people . . . .\n(ANCC, at para. 29) (Statement 9)\nMr. Hansman also commented that racism and misogyny still exist in the British Columbia school system, and that trustee candidates need \u201cto commit to eradicating those things, not spreading hate and not spreading bigotry\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at p. 34). The article did not name Mr. Neufeld or any other candidate, but noted that \u201csome candidates\u201d had shared \u201ccontroversial views surrounding issues like refugees and LGBTQ supports in schools\u201d (p. 33).\n[32] One month before election day, counsel for Mr. Neufeld wrote to Mr. Hansman demanding that he retract the statements he had made \u201cover a number of months\u201d about Mr. Neufeld (A.R., vol. II, at p. 139). The letter stated that proceedings would be launched unless a retraction and an apology were received within 10 days.\n[33] The next day, Mr. Neufeld declared that he was suing Mr. Hansman for defamation in an interview with a local news outlet. Counsel for Mr. Hansman wrote to Mr. Neufeld, explaining that Mr. Hansman would not be issuing an apology, given that interview. The letter contended that the request for an apology was \u201cinsincere at best, and most likely a political ploy\u201d given that, as Mr. Neufeld was \u201cdemanding an apology as a way to avoid litigation\u201d, he was simultaneously \u201cdeclaring his intention to proceed with that litigation\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 147-48).\n[34] Eight days before election day, Mr. Neufeld filed and served his defamation action against Mr. Hansman. The media picked up on the lawsuit and contacted Mr. Hansman for comment. Mr. Hansman told a local newspaper that he stood by his statements and that, along with Mr. Neufeld\u2019s remarks about SOGI 123, \u201c[h]is other misogynist and problematic statements reported by Press Progress are also cause for alarm and not becoming of a school trustee\u201d (ANCC, at para. 42) (Statement 10).\n[35] The Press Progress article to which Mr. Hansman was referring was entitled \u201cThis Man is Probably The Worst School Trustee in British Columbia\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at p. 46). In addition to describing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s campaign against SOGI 123, the article included screenshots of other past Facebook posts by Mr. Neufeld, including one in which Mr. Neufeld contended that male seminal fluid is \u201c[o]ne of the most under-rated natural anti-depressants for women\u201d (p. 49). He claimed that women who regularly have unprotected sex are happier and less suicidal than women who have protected sex, sharing a link to an article about a controversial study that had found the same. The Press Progress article quoted another Facebook post in which Mr. Neufeld wrote that he and other trustee candidates \u201care worried about the safety of children who are being taught silly ideas that they can choose what gender they can be and are being told that they must approve of gay \u2018rainbow\u2019 families\u201d (p. 50). Mr. Neufeld criticized Christian churches for being \u201cslow to stand up against this evil agenda\u201d and claimed that more tolerant churches were infected with \u201cPink Christianity\u201d (p. 50).\n[36] Mr. Neufeld was re-elected to another term on the Chilliwack School Board. Mr. Hansman was interviewed about the results of the election, where he spoke about the human rights complaint the BCTF had filed against Mr. Neufeld, and declared that \u201c[h]ate and bigotry have no place on school boards\u201d (ANCC, at para. 44) (Statement 11).\n[37] Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation action was set for hearing in December 2019. In March, the PPPA was enacted. Mr. Hansman moved under s. 4 of the PPPA to dismiss Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation action against him. Section 4 creates a pretrial screening mechanism that instructs a judge to dismiss an action arising from expression on a matter of public interest unless the plaintiff can satisfy the judge that their action has substantial merit; the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding; and the harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression is serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting that expression.\nIII. Procedural History\nA. British Columbia Supreme Court, 2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205 (Ross J.)\n[38] The chambers judge granted Mr. Hansman\u2019s application for dismissal. He concluded that Mr. Neufeld had not established grounds to believe that Mr. Hansman had no valid defences in the proceeding (para. 135). He held that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence, relying on this Court\u2019s reasoning in WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, and on the lack of a compelling challenge to the defence by Mr. Neufeld (paras. 126 and 137).\n[39] If he was wrong as to the validity of the fair comment defence, the chambers judge considered the final step of his analysis: the public interest weighing exercise (paras. 144 et seq.). He determined that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression outweighed the harm likely suffered by Mr. Neufeld (para. 145). Mr. Neufeld had \u201csubmitted almost no evidence of damage suffered\u201d (para. 161), nor did he offer any evidence that would allow the judge to draw a causal link between any alleged harm and Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements (paras. 147-50 and 158).\n[40] The chambers judge considered that many of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements either commented on the need for safe and inclusive schools or did not mention Mr. Neufeld. Those statements deserved significant protection. The weighing exercise thus favoured dismissing the action (para. 160).\nB. Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217 (Willcock, Fenlon and Voith JJ.A.)\n[41] Fenlon J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, allowed the appeal and reinstated the defamation action. She concluded that the chambers judge erred in his assessment of the fair comment defence in several ways. The chambers judge erred in relying on WIC Radio, given material differences between that case and this one, and by \u201cwork[ing] from a summary of the type of comments made by Mr. Hansman rather than addressing the specific expressions\u201d (paras. 26-27 and 34). This analytical approach caused the chambers judge to overlook elements of the fair comment defence (paras. 27-29). In Fenlon J.A.\u2019s opinion, there were grounds to believe that several statements were not based on fact, making the defence unavailable. Fenlon J.A. further held that the chambers judge erred in his assessment of malice.\n[42] Fenlon J.A. also concluded that the chambers judge erred in the public interest weighing analysis. First, the chambers judge focused on the subject matter of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements to the exclusion of the defamatory sting of those statements (paras. 61-62). Second, the chambers judge erred in his harm analysis by \u201cfail[ing] to give full effect to the presumption of damages in defamation and wrongly assum[ing] causation would be difficult to establish because others had made similar comments about Mr. Neufeld\u201d (para. 51).\n[43] Finally, Fenlon J.A. held that the chambers judge ought to have considered as part of the weighing analysis \u201cthe potential chilling effect on future expression\u201d by the plaintiff, or others in his position, about \u201cthis or other highly charged matters of public interest\u201d that might occur if the action were dismissed (para. 65).\nIV. Analysis\n[44] This appeal presents two issues:\n(i) Did the chambers judge err in the weighing exercise set out in s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA by concluding that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression mandates dismissal of the underlying action?\n(ii) Did the chambers judge err in finding that Mr. Neufeld did not show, under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, grounds to believe Mr. Hansman had no valid fair comment defence?\n[45] Answering either of these questions in the negative would result in the dismissal of the action. I would answer \u201cno\u201d to both. The Court of Appeal should not have overturned the chambers judge\u2019s findings on the fair comment defence. More significantly, even if Mr. Neufeld had disproved the validity of Mr. Hansman\u2019s fair comment defence, the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression mandates dismissal of the underlying action. Before turning to the two questions before the Court, I summarize the applicable statutory framework.\nA. Section 4 of the PPPA\n[46] A SLAPP is a tactical action that seeks to suppress expression on matters of public interest. The goal of a SLAPP is not necessarily a legal victory, but a political one: to intimidate and suppress criticism with the threat of costly litigation (V. Pelletier, Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits), August 2008 (online), at para. 4). A key feature of a SLAPP is thus the strategic use of the legal system to silence contrary viewpoints. Binnie J. aptly described the problem posed by such litigious tactics in WIC Radio:\nThe function of the tort of defamation is to vindicate reputation, but many courts have concluded that the traditional elements of that tort may require modification to provide broader accommodation to the value of freedom of expression. There is concern that matters of public interest go unreported because publishers fear the ballooning cost and disruption of defending a defamation action. . . .When controversies erupt, statements of claim often follow as night follows day, not only in serious claims (as here) but in actions launched simply for the purpose of intimidation. Of course \u201cchilling\u201d false and defamatory speech is not a bad thing in itself, but chilling debate on matters of legitimate public interest raises issues of inappropriate censorship and self-censorship. Public controversy can be a rough trade, and the law needs to accommodate its requirements. [Emphasis in original; para. 15.]\n[47] SLAPPs first emerged in the United States as a tendency of some powerful businesses to use the threat of litigation to frustrate public mobilization efforts against them (R. A. Macdonald, P. Noreau and D. Jutras, Les poursuites strat\u00e9giques contre la mobilisation publique \u2014 les poursuites-b\u00e2illons (SLAPP) (2007), at p. 2). Because of these origins, the archetypal SLAPP is generally described as a powerful or wealthy plaintiff, who has suffered only nominal damage, using litigation against a comparatively under-resourced defendant to silence criticism (see Platnick v. Bent, 2018 ONCA 687, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 60, at para. 99).\n[48] But SLAPPs do not always embody the hallmarks of the archetype. A SLAPP may be initiated by the rich and powerful, but not always. Similarly, the plaintiff may not have a history of using litigation or the threat of litigation to silence critics. In any case, however, the consistent defining feature of a SLAPP is that the proceeding acts to silence the defendant, and more broadly, to suppress debate on matters of public interest, rather than to remedy serious harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n[49] Anti-SLAPP legislation, such as the PPPA, creates a procedure for screening proceedings arising from expression on matters of public interest at an early stage. Legislative anti-SLAPP solutions have now been passed into law in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. In Ontario, the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 23, s. 3, amends the province\u2019s Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, by adding s. 137.1, which introduces a pretrial screening mechanism designed to weed out SLAPPs. This Court recently analyzed s. 137.1 in two decisions released concurrently: 1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, and Platnick v. Bent, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645.\n[50] British Columbia\u2019s PPPA was modelled after the Uniform Protection of Public Participation Act (2017), May 1, 2017 (online), adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, which, in turn, is based on Ontario\u2019s statute. Like s. 137.1 of Ontario\u2019s Courts of Justice Act, s. 4 of the PPPA creates a pretrial screening procedure that enables a defendant to apply to the court to dismiss a proceeding against them, provided certain criteria are satisfied. Section 4 reads:\nApplication to court\n4 (1) In a proceeding, a person against whom the proceeding has been brought may apply for a dismissal order under subsection (2) on the basis that\n(a) the proceeding arises from an expression made by the applicant, and\n(b) the expression relates to a matter of public interest.\n(2) If the applicant satisfies the court that the proceeding arises from an expression referred to in subsection (1), the court must make a dismissal order unless the respondent satisfies the court that\n(a) there are grounds to believe that\n(i) the proceeding has substantial merit, and\n(ii) the applicant has no valid defence in the proceeding, and\n(b) the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by the respondent as a result of the applicant\u2019s expression is serious enough that the public interest in continuing the proceeding outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression.\n[51] Section 4 is nearly identical to the pretrial screening mechanism established by subss. (3) and (4) of s. 137.1. The core feature of both laws is the recognition that even claims with substantial merit will be dismissed where the public interest in preserving free debate outweighs the harm to the plaintiff that the litigation purports to address. In this way, anti-SLAPP legislation instructs judges to deny claimants a day in court on a meritorious claim, given a more compelling social goal (Pointes, at para. 62).\n[52] Given the substantial similarity between the Ontario and British Columbia laws, this Court\u2019s interpretation of s. 137.1 in Pointes and Bent applies with equal force to s. 4 of the PPPA.\n[53] A s. 4 application first requires the applicant (the defendant) to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest (s. 4(1); see Pointes, at paras. 18 and 31). If the defendant does so, the onus shifts to the respondent (the plaintiff) under s. 4(2) to satisfy the court there are grounds to believe that: (1) the proceeding has substantial merit (s. 4(2)(a)(i)), and (2) the defences raised by the defendant are not valid, in that they can be said to have no real prospect of success (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)). If the court is not satisfied the plaintiff has met their onus as to one or both criteria, it must dismiss the proceeding. Even if, however, the plaintiff meets their burden, the court must conduct a public interest weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b), in which the plaintiff must satisfy the court that the harm they are likely to have suffered or are likely to suffer due to the defendant\u2019s expression outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression. In other words, once the court is satisfied that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest, it must dismiss the proceeding if the plaintiff does not meet its onus as to either s. 4(2)(a) or (b). The order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is, of course, at the discretion of the court.\n[54] Only the \u201cno valid defence\u201d requirement (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)) and the public interest weighing exercise (s. 4(2)(b)) are at issue in this appeal.\n[55] As with a motion filed under s. 137.1, a s. 4 motion has evidentiary requirements distinct from other preliminary motions. A motion for summary judgment, for example, permits the parties to file an extensive record, while a motion to strike is adjudicated based on the pleadings alone. Section 4, by contrast, contemplates that parties will put forward a record beyond the pleadings, though a limited one, given that an anti-SLAPP motion is not the place for an ultimate adjudication of the issues (Pointes, at para. 38). The PPPA provides that evidence must be given by affidavit and the affiant may be called for limited cross-examination (see s. 9(4) and (5)).\n[56] Absent reviewable error, an application judge\u2019s determination on a s. 4 motion is entitled to deference (Bent, at para. 77, citing Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 8 and 36).\nB. Issue 1: Public Interest Weighing\n[57] The key issue in the appeal before us is whether the chambers judge erred in the public interest weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b). This issue was the most contentious in this Court, and invited considerable attention from parties and interveners, alike. Accordingly, although the chambers judge addressed the issues in a different order, I evaluate his findings as to the public interest weighing exercise before turning to his conclusion that Mr. Hansman had a valid defence in the proceeding.\n[58] Even when a plaintiff shows the proceeding has substantial merit and the defendant has no valid defence, \u201cit remains vulnerable to summary dismissal as a result of the public interest weighing exercise . . ., which provides courts with a robust backstop to protect freedom of expression\u201d (Pointes, at para. 53). Pointes described this weighing exercise as the core of the analysis, as it allows the court to strike an appropriate balance between the protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression, the competing values at the heart of anti-SLAPP legislation.\n[59] Section 4(2)(b) requires the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that \u2014 due to \u201cthe harm likely to have been or to be suffered\u201d by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression \u2014 the public interest in allowing the proceeding to continue outweighs the proceeding\u2019s \u201cdeleterious effects on expression and public participation\u201d (Pointes, at para. 82).\n[60] In Pointes, this Court outlined several factors that may help judges undertake the weighing exercise, provided those factors can be \u201ctethered to the text of [the provision] and the considerations explicitly contemplated by the legislature to conduct the weighing exercise\u201d (para. 80):\nFor example, the following factors, in no particular order of importance, may be relevant for the motion judge to consider: the importance of the expression, the history of litigation between the parties, broader or collateral effects on other expressions on matters of public interest, the potential chilling effect on future expression either by a party or by others, the defendant\u2019s history of activism or advocacy in the public interest, any disproportion between the resources being used in the lawsuit and the harm caused or the expected damages award, and the possibility that the expression or the claim might provoke hostility against an identifiably vulnerable group or a group protected under s. 15 of the Charter or human rights legislation. [Emphasis in original; para. 80.]\n[61] The chambers judge found that Mr. Neufeld had not shown harm substantial enough to outweigh the significant public interest in Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression. The Court of Appeal held that the chambers judge had erred both in his analysis of the harm to Mr. Neufeld and in his assessment of the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression. Specifically, the Court of Appeal found the chambers judge ought to have considered as part of the harm analysis \u201cthe potential chilling effect on future expression by\u201d potential plaintiffs who might wish to engage in highly charged public debates, but would opt not to \u201cfor fear of being inveighed with negative labels and accusations of hate speech with no opportunity to protect their reputation\u201d (para. 65). Finally, the Court of Appeal held that the chambers judge imposed too great a burden on Mr. Neufeld to prove harm and erred in affording Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech significant protection. On this basis, and without conducting any explicit weighing, the Court of Appeal determined that Mr. Neufeld\u2019s action deserved to go on to a trial.\n[62] As I explain below, I disagree with the Court of Appeal both as to the extent of the harm to Mr. Neufeld and as to the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression. First, Mr. Neufeld failed to identify any specific harm flowing from the statements serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression. Second, the Court of Appeal\u2019s consideration of the \u201cchilling effect\u201d factor was divorced from a proper interpretation of s. 4(2)(b) and runs contrary to how a chilling effect has been conceived of in freedom of expression jurisprudence. Third, Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression is counter-speech motivated by a desire to promote tolerance and respect for a marginalized group in society. His expression is deserving of significant protection. I would affirm the chambers judge\u2019s conclusion that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression outweighed the public interest in remedying the harm to Mr. Neufeld.\n(1) Harm Likely to Have Been or to Be Suffered by the Plaintiff as a Result of the Defendant\u2019s Expression\n[63] Under s. 4(2)(b), the factor to be considered in favour of the public interest in continuing the proceeding is the likely harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression.\n(a) Evidence of Harm and Causation\n[64] Mr. Neufeld pleaded generally that he suffered reputational harm and associated emotional distress due to Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements. He contended that these assertions were corroborated by a few examples of steps taken against him by other entities: the Chilliwack School Board sought his resignation and directed him to stay away from schools (he refused and continued to serve as a trustee); he was uninvited from an annual trustee meeting; and he was uninvited from delivering high school commencement addresses. Mr. Neufeld also argued that harm could be inferred based on circumstantial factors, including the identity of the accuser, the breadth, and distribution of the statements, and the republication of the statements (Chambers Judge\u2019s Reasons, at para. 155).\n[65] The chambers judge recognized that Mr. Neufeld was not expected to present a fully developed damages brief on a s. 4 application (para. 157). Still, he found that Mr. Neufeld had presented only \u201cbare assertions\u201d of harm, leaving him with \u201cprecious little evidence\u201d to weigh on Mr. Neufeld\u2019s side of the equation under s. 4(2)(b) (paras. 147 and 152). He found further that, \u201capart from one paragraph in his affidavit\u201d, Mr. Neufeld presented no evidence that would link the minimal harm he alleged to Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements (para. 158).\n[66] The Court of Appeal found two errors with the chambers judge\u2019s analysis. First, the chambers judge failed to give effect to the general principle that damages are presumed in defamation law (para. 51). The Court of Appeal also noted that Mr. Neufeld had alleged examples of reputational harm and argued that harm could be inferred based on circumstantial factors (paras. 57-58). Second, the chambers judge erred by assuming causation would be difficult to establish because others had made similar statements about Mr. Neufeld (paras. 51-59). I disagree.\n[67] Although general damages are presumed in defamation law, s. 4(2)(b) prescribes a weighing exercise which requires that the harm to the plaintiff be serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression. While the presumption of damages can establish the existence of harm, it cannot establish that the harm is \u201cserious\u201d (see, e.g., Lachaux v. Independent Print Ltd., [2019] UKSC 27, [2020] A.C. 612, at para. 13; see also United Soils Management Ltd. v. Mohammed, 2019 ONCA 128, 23 C.E.L.R. (4th) 11, at para. 22; Levant v. DeMelle, 2022 ONCA 79, 79 C.P.C. (8th) 437, at para. 68). To hold otherwise would be to presumptively tip the scales in favour of the plaintiff in defamation cases and effectively gut the weighing exercise. Rather, to succeed on the weighing exercise, a plaintiff must provide evidence that enables the judge \u201cto draw an inference of likelihood\u201d of harm of a magnitude sufficient to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression (Pointes, at para. 71; Bent, at para. 154). Presumed general damages are insufficient for this purpose, as are bare assertions of harm.\n[68] Even where the extent of harm suffered by the plaintiff is serious, however, the legislation also requires some evidence that enables the judge to infer a causal link between the defendant\u2019s expression and the harm suffered (Pointes, at para. 71). Where the defendant is not the only one speaking out against the plaintiff, inferring a causal link between the defendant\u2019s expression and the harm suffered by the plaintiff becomes both more important (para. 72), and more difficult.\n[69] The chambers judge\u2019s reasons on this issue are more summary because he had already concluded that Mr. Neufeld did not discharge his burden regarding the fair comment defence, and he considered the public interest weighing exercise as an alternative argument. Thus, he did not specifically deal with the relevant circumstantial arguments that Mr. Neufeld made in support of the extent of the harm he suffered. Still, the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the record is clear. Even considering the circumstantial factors that Mr. Neufeld alleged, there is no basis to disturb the judge\u2019s assessment of the harm to Mr. Neufeld. And as the judge recognized, other circumstantial factors clearly pointed to a conclusion that Mr. Neufeld had suffered limited reputational harm: Mr. Neufeld continued to express the same contentious views despite the public reaction and won re-election a year later.\n[70] Nor do I agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge found causation could not be established simply because Mr. Hansman was one of many speaking out against Mr. Neufeld. To link the few examples of harm he alleged to Mr. Hansman, Mr. Neufeld asserted only that the negative attention he received \u201ccommenced\u201d after Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements (Chambers Judge\u2019s Reasons, at para. 147). The chambers judge held this, too, was a bald assertion and one belied by the record before him. He found it was clear that other people and entities had independently reacted negatively to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views, and there was nothing to indicate their reactions were influenced or motivated by Mr. Hansman\u2019s comments (para. 150).\n[71] I would defer to the chambers judge\u2019s conclusions. As noted, there was an immediate public outcry to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views, one which began the day he first posted on Facebook, even before Mr. Hansman\u2019s first statement to the media. In the context of this case, I would not disturb the chambers judge\u2019s finding that something more than a bare assertion that the harm commenced after Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements was needed to prove a causal link.\n[72] Given the dearth of evidence from Mr. Neufeld on harm, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that Mr. Neufeld had adduced \u201calmost no evidence of damage suffered\u201d as a result of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements. Absent extricable error, his findings are entitled to deference (Bent, at para. 77).\n(b) The Chilling Effect on the Plaintiff and Others Similarly Situated\n[73] The Court of Appeal also held that the chambers judge erred in not considering the \u201cchilling effect\u201d dismissing the proceeding would have on \u201cothers who might wish to engage in debates on . . . highly charged matters of public interest\u201d (para. 65).The court hypothesized that people may \u201cwithdraw or not engage in public debate for fear of being inveighed with negative labels and accusations of hate speech with no opportunity to protect their reputation\u201d (para. 65). Given the \u201cserious reputational harm\u201d accusations of hate speech might inflict, the court determined that the chambers judge erred in overlooking the \u201ccollateral effect that preventing Mr. Neufeld from defending himself from such serious accusations could have on other individuals\u2019 willingness to express themselves on issues of public interest in [the] future\u201d (para. 68).\n[74] This reasoning runs counter to precedent, and is not \u201ctethered to the text of [the relevant provision]\u201d (Pointes, at para. 80). To begin, s. 4(2)(b) defines \u201cthe public interest in continuing the proceeding\u201d with reference to \u201cthe harm likely to have been or to be suffered by the respondent as a result of the applicant\u2019s expression\u201d. The harm relevant to the public interest weighing exercise is harm to Mr. Neufeld caused by Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements, not by his inability to sue. The loss of a right to sue is a possible outcome of the public interest weighing exercise, not an input.\n[75] The \u201cchilling effect\u201d identified by the Court of Appeal does not constitute a \u201charm\u201d suffered by Mr. Neufeld for the purpose of the weighing exercise. The concept of a chilling effect has a clear meaning in Canadian freedom of expression law. A chilling effect occurs where uncertainty surrounding the scope or application of a law limiting or prohibiting expression creates a risk that people will not speak for fear of violating the relevant law (see, e.g., Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 32; R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555, at para. 79; R. v. Vice Media Canada Inc., 2018 SCC 53, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 374, at para. 26; R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 104; Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 133). As McLachlin J., dissenting, but not on this point, explained in R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at p. 850:\nA second characteristic peculiar to freedom of expression is that limitations on expression tend to have an effect on expression other than that which is their target. In the United States this is referred to as the chilling effect. Unless the limitation is drafted with great precision, there will always be doubt about whether a particular form of expression offends the prohibition. . . . The result of a failure to [define any limitation with precision] may be to deter not only the expression which the prohibition was aimed at, but legitimate expression. The law-abiding citizen who does not wish to run afoul of the law will decide not to take the chance in a doubtful case. Creativity and the beneficial exchange of ideas will be adversely affected.\n[76] In the civil context, courts have taken care to circumscribe the tort of defamation to avoid causing a chilling effect on legitimate expression, in line with the goals of anti-SLAPP legislation (see Bent, at para. 165, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 J., and at para. 262, per Abella J.). As the intervener the Centre for Free Expression points out, since Pointes and Bent were released, the chilling effect on public debate has only been considered by courts under the weighing exercise to assess the concern that allowing the proceeding to continue will chill the expression of the defendant and others who might be sued in defamation (see, e.g., Schwartz & Red Lake Outfitters v. Collette, 2020 ONSC 6580, at para. 123 (CanLII); Catalyst Capital Group Inc. v. West Face Capital Inc., 2021 ONSC 7957, at para. 463 (CanLII); Smith v. Nagy, 2021 ONSC 4265, 156 O.R. (3d) 770, at para. 91; Galloway v. A.B., 2021 BCSC 2344, at para. 784 (CanLII); Gill v. Maciver, 2022 ONSC 1279, at para. 179 (CanLII); Volpe v. Wong\u2011Tam, 2022 ONSC 3106, 512 C.R.R. (2d) 153, at paras. 402-3).\n[77] The Court of Appeal\u2019s consideration of a \u201cchilling effect\u201d flowing from a plaintiff\u2019s inability to pursue a defamation claim turns the concept on its head. Our jurisprudence addresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest. Instead, the Court of Appeal held that the inability to inflict a legal penalty on Mr. Hansman would chill Mr. Neufeld\u2019s expression and those of others who wish to express unpopular views. Simply put, there is no chilling effect in barring potential plaintiffs from silencing their critics and collecting damages through a defamation suit. Just as our law protects Mr. Neufeld\u2019s right to voice his opinions on matters of public interest, so it protects the right of others, like Mr. Hansman, to respond. As the Court of Appeal recognized, \u201cfreedom of expression is \u2018the cornerstone of a pluralistic democracy\u2019 and . . . there must be room for views to be forcefully and even intemperately presented in the public forum\u201d (para. 70).\n[78] Mr. Hansman undoubtedly used words with the potential to inflict serious reputational harm. But the consideration of the public interest in continuing the proceeding must be grounded in harm to Mr. Neufeld, reputational or otherwise, caused by Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression, and not in the consideration of a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on others if Mr. Neufeld could not proceed with his defamation suit.\n(2) Public Interest in Protecting the Defendant\u2019s Expression\n[79] The other side of the weighing exercise evaluates the public interest in protecting the defendant\u2019s expression. In making this assessment, s. 2(b) Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms jurisprudence \u201cgrounds the level of protection afforded to [the defendant\u2019s] expression in the nature of the expression\u201d (Pointes, at para. 77). Similarly, s. 15(1) considerations may factor into the weighing analysis in a proper case. In Pointes, at para. 80, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. cited \u201cthe possibility that the expression or the claim might provoke hostility against an identifiably vulnerable group or a group protected under s. 15 of the Charter or human rights legislation\u201d as a relevant factor for courts to consider. As our Constitution recognizes, not all expression is created equal, and the level of protection to be afforded to any particular expression can vary widely according to the quality of the expression, its subject matter, the motivation behind it, or the form through which it was expressed (see Pointes, at paras. 74, 76 and 120). The closer the expression lies to the core values of s. 2(b), including truth-seeking, participation in political decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human flourishing, \u201cthe greater the public interest in protecting it\u201d (para. 77).\n[80] Some speakers seek to contribute to public discourse by countering ignorant or harmful expression with an informed or compassionate response (M. Lepoutre, \u201cCan \u2018More Speech\u2019 Counter Ignorant Speech?\u201d (2019), 16 J. Ethics & Soc. Philos. 155, at pp. 155-56; P. Horwitz, \u201cCitizenship and Speech. A Review of Owen M. Fiss, The Irony of Free Speech and Liberalism Divided\u201d (1998), 43 McGill L.J. 445, at pp. 464-65; C. F. Zwibel, \u201cReconciling Rights: The Whatcott Case as Missed Opportunity\u201d (2013), 63 S.C.L.R. (2d) 313, at pp. 332-33). The theory is that dissenting voices can \u201cout-compete more pernicious speech\u201d in the marketplace of ideas (C. Forcese and K. Roach, \u201cCriminalizing Terrorist Babble: Canada\u2019s Dubious New Terrorist Speech Crime\u201d (2015), 53 Alta. L. Rev. 35, at p. 47), showing that, \u201cthough some citizens may hold despicable ideas, the weight of public opinion runs against them\u201d (Horwitz, at p. 464). In American First Amendment jurisprudence, this concept is called \u201ccounterspeech\u201d (Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), per Brandeis J., concurring; United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012), per Kennedy J. (plurality opinion)).\n[81] In s. 2(b) jurisprudence, the idea of counter-speech inheres in the recognition that the open exchange of ideas is a precondition to unlocking the value of free expression. For example, in Keegstra, at p. 766, this Court noted that \u201cit is partly through a clash with extreme and erroneous views that truth and the democratic vision remain vigorous and alive\u201d (see also Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139, at pp. 173 and 175, per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., concurring; Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at para. 49). While counter-speech is not necessarily a complete solution to harmful expression (see Keegstra, at p. 763; Whatcott, at para. 104), its close proximity to the values at the core of s. 2(b) is beyond doubt.\n[82] Counter-speech motivated by the defence of a vulnerable or marginalized group in society also engages the values at the core of s. 15(1); namely, the equal worth and dignity of every individual (Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 138; see also Pointes, at para. 80). Targets of degrading expression belonging to a vulnerable group in society may lack the ability or authority to effectively combat the harmful speech themselves (Lepoutre, at p. 157). Discourse can then take on an uneven quality, making protective counter-speech by the group or individual\u2019s more powerful advocates all the more influential and important (Zwibel, at p. 333; see Whatcott, at para. 75 (recognizing the importance of maintaining a \u201cpath of reply by [a] group under attack\u201d)).\n[83] Mr. Hansman spoke out to counter expression he perceived to be untrue, prejudicial towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, and potentially damaging to transgender youth.\n[84] The transgender community is undeniably a marginalized group in Canadian society. The history of transgender individuals in our country has been marked by discrimination and disadvantage. Although being transgender \u201cimplies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities\u201d (J. Drescher and E. Haller, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, 2018 (online)), transgender and other gender non-conforming individuals were largely viewed with suspicion and prejudice until the latter half of the 20th century.\n[85] Indeed, transgender people occupy a unique position of disadvantage in our society, given the long history in psychiatry \u201cof conflating [transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+] identities with mental illness\u201d and even resorting to harmful \u201cconversion therapy\u201d to \u201cresolve\u201d gender dysphoria, and \u201crecondition\u201d the individual to reduce \u201ccross-gender behavior\u201d (A. Veltman and G. Chaimowitz, \u201cMental Health Care for People Who Identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and (or) Queer\u201d (2014), 59:11 Can. J. Psychiatry 1, at pp. 1-2; American Psychological Association, Task Force on Gender Identity and Gender Variance, Report of the Task Force on Gender Identity and Gender Variance (2009), at p. 27). As the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has recognized, \u201c[u]nlike other groups . . ., transgender people often find their very existence the subject of public debate and condemnation\u201d (Oger v. Whatcott (No. 7), 2019 BCHRT 58, 94 C.H.R.R. D\/222, at para. 61). They are stereotyped as diseased or confused simply because they identify as transgender (Nixon v. Vancouver Rape Relief Society (No. 2), 2002 BCHRT 1, 42 C.H.R.R. D\/20, at paras. 136-37).\n[86] Transgender people have faced discrimination in many facets of Canadian society. Statistics Canada has concluded that they are at increased risk of violence, and report higher rates of poor mental health, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse as a means to cope with abuse or violence they have experienced (see Experiences of violent victimization and unwanted sexual behaviours among gay, lesbian, bisexual and other sexual minority people, and the transgender population, in Canada, 2018 (September 2020)). Studies have concluded that they are disadvantaged relative to the general public in housing, employment, and healthcare (Department of Justice Canada, A Qualitative Look at Serious Legal Problems: Trans, Two-Spirit, and Non-Binary People in Canada (2022), at p. 10; XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services) (No. 4), 2012 HRTO 726, 74 C.H.R.R. D\/331, at paras. 164-66). And despite encountering a higher incidence of justiciable legal problems, studies have also found that transgender people have traditionally faced greater access to justice barriers than the broader population, in part due to a lack of explicit human rights protections (J. James et al., Legal Problems Facing Trans People in Ontario, TRANSforming JUSTICE Summary Report 1(1), September 6, 2018 (online); see also Department of Justice Canada, at p. 11).\n[87] Significant legal advancements in transgender rights have only come in the last 35 years, with most change taking place in the last decade (S. Singer, \u201cTrans Rights Are Not Just Human Rights: Legal Strategies for Trans Justice\u201d (2020), 35 C.J.L.S. 293, at p. 298). Once forced to advance claims of discrimination on the ground of \u201cphysical disability\u201d (B. Findlay et al., Finding Our Place: Transgendered Law Reform Project (1996), at pp. 20-21), gender identity and\/or expression are now prohibited grounds of discrimination in human rights codes across the country and included within the prohibition against hate speech under the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (see Alberta Bill of Rights, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-14; Human Rights Code, R.S.N.B. 2011, c. 171; Human Rights Act, 2010, S.N.L. 2010, c. H-13.1; Human Rights Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 214; Human Rights Act, S. Nu. 2003, c. 12; Human Rights Act, S.N.W.T. 2002, c. 18; Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19; Human Rights Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. H-12; Charter of human rights and freedoms, CQLR, c. C-12; Human Rights Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 116; The Human Rights Code, C.C.S.M., c.

S-24.2; An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, S.C. 2017, c. 13).\n[88] In the wake of this legislative progress, judicial recognition of the plight of transgender individuals in Canada is growing (see XY, at para. 164; see also Oger, at para. 62; Vanderputten v. Seydaco Packaging Corp. (No. 1), 2012 HRTO 1977, 75 C.H.R.R. D\/317, at para. 61; JY v. Mint Tanning Lounge, 2018 BCHRT 282, at para. 32 (CanLII); J.Y. v.

Manitoba (Justice), 2019 MBHR 12, at para. 24 (CanLII); A.B. v. Correctional Service Canada, 2022 CHRT 15, at para. 41 (CanLII)). And in 2021, the Superior Court of Quebec held that \u201c[g]ender identity is analogous to the grounds listed at s. 15(1) of the Canadian Charter \u201d because \u201c[g]ender identity is an immutable personal characteristic\u201d (Centre for Gender Advocacy v. Attorney General of Quebec, 2021 QCCS 191, 481 C.R.R. (2d) 273, at paras. 104 and 106).\n[89] Yet individual courts and tribunals have also recognized that, \u201cdespite some gains, transgender people remain among the most marginalized in our society\u201d (Oger, at para. 62), and continue to live their lives facing \u201cdisadvantage, prejudice, stereotyping, and vulnerability\u201d (C.F. v. Director of Vital Statistics (Alta.), 2014 ABQB 237, 587 A.R. 332, at para. 58).\n[90] Mr. Neufeld\u2019s right to express himself is not in doubt, nor is it for this Court to assess the value of his expression. But Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements are critical context in characterizing Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression, which is at issue. Despite Mr. Neufeld\u2019s submissions, it is evident that his expression went beyond a critique of a government program. For instance, in his original post, Mr. Neufeld criticized the fact that SOGI 123 materials instruct children \u201cthat gender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct\u201d and stated that permitting children to \u201cchoose to change gender is nothing short of child abuse\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 16). In the same post, Mr. Neufeld expressed concern that children were \u201cbeing taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm\u201d and that \u201c[i]ncreasing numbers of children are growing up in homes with same sex parents\u201d (p. 16). And in his speech at the Culture Guard event about a month following his original post, Mr. Neufeld claimed that SOGI 123 \u201cenabl[es] dysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns\u201d and \u201ccoddl[es] and encourag[es] what [he] regard[s] as the sexual addiction of gender confusion\u201d. Mr. Hansman was responding to these and other statements.\n[91] Mr. Hansman\u2019s counter-speech fell close to the core of s. 2(b). His expression served a truth-seeking function, as he was contacted by the media to present an alternative perspective within a debate on a matter of public importance. In speaking out, he sought to counter expression that he and others perceived to undermine the equal worth and dignity of marginalized groups. Finally, his speech commenting on the fitness of an electoral candidate was political expression, which is \u201cthe single most important and protected type of expression\u201d (Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 33, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at para. 11, per McLachlin C.J. and Major J., dissenting in part, but not on this point; see also Able Translations Ltd. v. Express International Translations Inc., 2018 ONCA 690, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 568, at paras. 41\u201144 (affording expression about a person\u2019s suitability for elected office significant protection under s. 137.1 of the Ontario Courts of Justice Act)).\n[92] Although one\u2019s engagement in counter-speech does not amount to \u201copen season\u201d on reputation (Grant, at para. 58) and speakers must always choose their words carefully (Pointes, at para. 75), on the whole, Mr. Hansman\u2019s words were not a disproportionate or gratuitous response to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements. When confronted with views a person believes to be discriminatory, individuals often use words such as \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201cintolerant\u201d, or even sometimes \u201chateful\u201d. I note that Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression generally focused on the views that Mr. Neufeld expressed, and not who he is as a person.\n[93] I agree with the chambers judge that there is a great public interest in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s freedom of speech on such matters. The subject matter of Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech (commenting on the value of a government initiative, the need for safe and inclusive schools, and the fitness of a candidate for public office), the form in which it was expressed (solicited by the media to present a counter-perspective within an ongoing debate), and the motivation behind it (to combat discriminatory and harmful expression and to protect transgender youth in schools) are all deserving of significant protection. Given Mr. Neufeld\u2019s failure to establish harm serious enough to outweigh that substantial public interest, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that the weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b) mandates dismissal of the underlying action.\nC. Issue 2: No Valid Defence\n[94] While the weighing exercise may be the core of the anti-SLAPP legislation, the chambers judge first grounded his dismissal of the action in the finding that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence. Section 4(2)(a)(ii) provides that a court must make a dismissal order unless the plaintiff satisfies the court that there are grounds to believe that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The defendant must first point to any defences they intend to raise at trial, after which the burden shifts to the plaintiff. \u201c[G]rounds to believe\u201d means \u201csomething more than mere suspicion, but less than . . . proof on the balance of probabilities\u201d (Pointes, at para. 40, quoting Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para. 114). To satisfy this burden, a plaintiff must show the defences advanced by the defendant \u201care not legally tenable or supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief such that they can be said to have no real prospect of success\u201d (Pointes, at para. 59).\n(1) Fair Comment Defence\n[95] In support of his s. 4 application, Mr. Hansman advanced the defence of fair comment. The right of fair comment is \u201ca basic safeguard against irresponsible political power\u201d (C. Sappideen and P. Vines, eds., Fleming\u2019s The Law of Torts (10th ed. 2011), at p. 668). The fair comment defence is premised on the idea that citizens must be able to openly declare their real opinions on matters of public interest without fear of reprisal in the form of actions for defamation (Cherneskey v. Armadale Publishers Ltd., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1086, quoting Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd., [1968] 1 All E.R. 497, at p. 503 (C.A.)). This democratic discourse is a defining feature of a free and open society. Thus, the defence aims to keep the equilibrium in defamation law between two competing values: the protection of individual reputation from unwarranted attack, on one side, and the free debate \u201cthat is said to be the \u2018very life blood of our freedom and free institutions\u2019\u201d on the other (WIC Radio, at para. 1, quoting Price v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. (1915), 51 S.C.R. 179, at p. 194). The task of courts in interpreting the defence is to reconcile these two values, not to prefer one over the other (WIC Radio, at para. 2).\n[96] The fair comment defence has five elements. First, the \u201ccomment must be on a matter of public interest\u201d (Grant, at para. 31). Second, it must be \u201cbased on fact\u201d (para. 31). Third, \u201cthough it can include inferences of fact, [it] must be recognisable as comment\u201d (para. 31). Fourth, it must satisfy an objective test: \u201ccould any person honestly express that opinion on the proved facts?\u201d (para. 31). Finally, even if the above elements are met, \u201cthe defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was actuated by express malice\u201d (para. 31). Consideration of the elements of the fair comment defence requires an assessment of the defamatory words used in the full context surrounding their use (WIC Radio, at paras. 55-56). In this appeal, the only elements at issue are the second and third elements of the defence, along with the question of malice.\n[97] When invoked at trial, the defendant must prove the elements of the fair comment defence before the onus switches to the plaintiff to defeat the defence by establishing malice by the defendant (para. 52). On a s. 4 application, however, the onus is on the plaintiff to show grounds to believe that the defendant cannot establish one or more of its elements and thus the defence has no real prospect of success.\n[98] As I explain, the chambers judge also did not err in concluding that Mr. Neufeld failed to challenge the validity of the fair comment defence.\n(a) Was the Expression Based on Fact?\n[99] To constitute fair comment, a factual basis for the impugned statement must be explicitly or implicitly indicated, at least in general terms, within the publication itself or the facts must be \u201cso notorious as to be already understood by the audience\u201d (WIC Radio, at para. 34). The defence is unavailable if \u201cthe factual foundation is unstated or unknown, or turns out to be false\u201d (para. 31).\n[100] There is, however, no requirement that the facts support the comment, in the sense of confirming its truth (para. 31). The expression must relate to the facts on which it is based, but the comment need not be a reasonable or proportionate response (paras. 39, 51 and 59). The purpose of this element is not to measure the fairness of expression, but to ensure the reader is aware of the basis for the comment to enable them \u201cto make up their own minds\u201d as to its merit (para. 31).\n[101] Here, the chambers judge held that Mr. Neufeld had not shown grounds to believe that the challenged statements were not based in fact, pointing to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s original Facebook post as a basis for the statements (para. 134). Mr. Neufeld argues, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that there were grounds to believe that Mr. Hansman would be unable to establish that certain of the statements were based in fact.\n[102] I disagree. The relevant inquiry is not whether the underlying facts supported the truth of the statements. At trial, Mr. Hansman need not demonstrate that Mr. Neufeld is bigoted, transphobic, promoted hatred, or created an unsafe environment for students. The question is merely whether the statement can be tethered to an adequate factual basis so the reader can be an informed judge. I agree with the chambers judge that Mr. Neufeld\u2019s original Facebook post could provide the requisite factual basis for most statements at issue. The post reads:\nOkay, so I can no longer sit on my hands. I have to stand up and be counted. A few years ago, the Liberal minister of education instigated a new curriculum supposedly to combat bullying. But it quickly morphed into a weapon of propaganda to infuse every subject matter from K-12 with the latest fad: Gender theory. The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) program instructs children that gender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct. At the risk of being labelled a bigoted homophobe, I have to say that I support traditional family values and I agree with the College of paediatricians that allowing little children [to] choose to change gender is nothing short of child abuse. But now the BC Ministry of Education has embraced the LGBTQ lobby and is forcing this biologically absurd theory on children in our schools. Children are being taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm. Teachers must not refer to \u201cboys and girls\u201d they are merely students. They cannot refer to mothers and fathers either. (Increasing numbers of children are growing up in homes with same sex parents) If this represents the values of Canadian society, count me out! I belong in a country like Russia, or Paraguay, which recently had the guts to stand up to these radical cultural nihilists. [A link to a news article entitled \u201cParents Defeat Gender Ideology in Paraguay\u201d.]\n(A.R., vol. III, at p. 16)\n[103] All of the challenged publications either reproduced, linked to, quoted from, or otherwise described Mr. Neufeld\u2019s original Facebook post, apart from one publication which does not refer to Mr. Neufeld, as I explain below. Most articles also describe Mr. Neufeld\u2019s anti-SOGI 123 views and views on gender dysphoria, in general. Certain of them also referenced other statements made by Mr. Neufeld, including his statement that semen is a natural anti-depressant for women, factually grounding Mr. Hansman\u2019s reference to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s \u201cother misogynist and problematic statements\u201d. Other articles referred to Mr. Neufeld\u2019s remarks at the Culture Guard event, in which he stated that SOGI 123 encourages and enables \u201cdysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns\u201d, namely \u201cthe sexual addiction of gender confusion\u201d. Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views were therefore available to readers within the four corners of the publications, either within the text itself or via hyperlinks to further articles and explanations. Those views grounded Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements that Mr. Neufeld should resign; expressed views that are bigoted, intolerant, transphobic, misogynist, or hateful; \u201ctip toed\u201d into hate speech; spread or promoted hatred against 2SLGBTQ+ students; and created or contributed to an unsafe or discriminatory environment.\n[104] As the chambers judge noted, Mr. Neufeld can hardly argue that his Facebook post did not provide a factual basis for Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements when he himself wrote that he posted at the risk of \u201cbeing labelled a bigoted homophobe\u201d. For the few publications that do not go into detail in describing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements, the journalists seem to have relied on the fact that those views had achieved a level of notoriety such that they would have been known to the reading audience. This was a high-profile local controversy that spanned over a year. Both men were public figures. Mr. Neufeld\u2019s Facebook post was widely reported by major media outlets within hours of it being posted, and the media continued to report on the dispute as it evolved. In this context, it was reasonable to conclude that it was unnecessary to set out the background to the controversy in great detail for all 11 publications.\n[105] But Mr. Neufeld says that the original Facebook post cannot ground Mr. Hansman\u2019s statement to the Huffington Post that \u201ctrustees with faith-based views need to figure out how they\u2019ll work in a secular public school system\u201d or seek work elsewhere. Mr. Neufeld contends there was no basis for this statement as his original post did not refer to his religious views (those posts came later). I disagree. The publication references the fact that Mr. Neufeld is a church subdeacon and prison chaplain, providing a factual nexus for the challenged statement.\n[106] Similarly, Mr. Neufeld contends the Facebook post is insufficient to ground Mr. Hansman\u2019s comment to a local news outlet on September 16, 2018, that \u201c[i]t is extremely problematic to have somebody who is running as a school trustee continuing to spread hate about LGBTQ people . . . and also be out there, making vile comments about refugees and immigrants\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at p. 34). There was some dispute in the courts below about whether this statement concerned Mr. Neufeld or, as Mr. Hansman contends, another trustee candidate, given that the publication does not name anyone in particular. I agree with the concession of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s counsel before the chambers judge that the comment appears to have been made \u201cin response to another school board trustee\u201d (A.R., vol. V, at p. 86), and should therefore not be considered.\n[107] In sum, Mr. Neufeld has not shown grounds to believe that Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements lacked a factual basis. As in WIC Radio, the general facts giving rise to the dispute were likely known to the audience and referred to in the publications themselves (para. 34).\n(b) Was the Expression Recognizable as Comment, Rather Than an Imputation of Fact?\n[108] For expression to constitute fair comment, the statement must be one that would be understood by a reasonable reader as a comment rather than a statement of fact (WIC Radio, at para. 27). A comment includes a \u201cdeduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation which is generally incapable of proof\u201d (para. 26, quoting Ross v. New Brunswick Teachers\u2019 Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 N.B.R. (2d) 112, at para. 56). This is a low threshold; \u201cthe notion of \u2018comment\u2019 is generously interpreted\u201d (WIC Radio, at para. 30).\n[109] The line between comment and fact can be difficult to draw, particularly \u201cin an editorial context where loose, figurative or hyperbolic language is used . . . in the context of political debate, commentary, media campaigns and public discourse\u201d (para. 26). Opinions are expressed as facts more often than as personal views, such that statements that may seem to convey fact might be more properly construed as comment (R. D. McConchie and D. A. Potts, Canadian Libel and Slander Actions (2004), at p. 342). Context is essential in distinguishing comment from fact.\n[110] Mr. Neufeld relies on a handful of cases to argue that Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements were not comments but imputations of fact. In Lascaris v. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, at para. 34, the court found that a reasonable trier might conclude that statements that the appellant supported terrorists were statements of fact, not opinion. In Bondfield Construction Company Ltd. v. Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 144 O.R. (3d) 291, at para. 17, the court held that statements suggesting corruption and collusion in a bidding process could be viewed as factual assertions. And in Pan v. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, at para. 104, the court concluded that a statement that someone was a \u201cseasoned liar\u201d was a statement of fact. But these cases do not help us to determine whether Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements were recognizable as comment. In the context of those cases, the statements suggested concrete knowledge of past wrongdoings, which is distinguishable from the generalized critiques at issue in this case.\n[111] More on point are the many cases in which Canadian courts have determined that \u201cloose, figurative or hyperbolic\u201d labels (WIC Radio, at para. 26), like homophobic, transphobic, bigoted, racist, or sexist are properly characterized as comment, not fact (see Mondal v. Evans-Bitten, 2022 ONSC 809, 82 C.C.L.T. (4th) 327, at paras. 3-7 and 34; see also Awan v. Levant, 2016 ONCA 970, 133 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 84 (\u201c[c]alling someone prejudiced will normally be a conclusion or opinion\u201d); Volpe, at para. 232 (a statement that a person is \u201chomophobic, transphobic, or anti-LGBTQ2S+\u201d was a comment); Bernier v. Kinsella, 2021 ONSC 7451, 73 C.P.C. (8th) 280, at para. 50 (\u201cA statement that a person is racist or a misogynist is a generalization or conclusion that is not itself either true or false.\u201d)). I agree that an allegation of bias or prejudice is \u201ca debatable assertion as to a state of mind\u201d and will typically be classified as a comment (P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5th ed. 2022), at pp. 298-99).\n[112] A few statements are arguably closer to the line between comment and fact. While not strictly necessary to decide, given my conclusion as to the public interest weighing exercise, I would agree with the chambers judge that, in the specific context of this case and given the supporting facts included in each publication, a reasonable reader would have interpreted the statements as expressions of Mr. Hansman\u2019s opinion. For example, the statement that Mr. Neufeld violated his obligations as a school board trustee could arguably be taken as an imputation of fact, especially given that Mr. Hansman\u2019s role as president of the BCTF might give readers the impression he is an authority figure on such matters. But an allegation that a politician has not lived up to their obligations is generally understood to be a critique, not a declaration of fact. Mr. Neufeld has not shown grounds to believe that it would not be seen as a comment in the context of this case.\n[113] Additionally, Mr. Neufeld contends that because the Criminal Code recognizes an offence of wilful promotion of hatred (see s. 319(2)), the allegation that he \u201ctip toed . . . into hate speech\u201d would be taken as imputing criminal liability. I do not agree that accusations of hate speech would necessarily be understood by ordinary readers as referring to a Criminal Code offence. Such allegations have permeated public discourse in a way that well exceeds their narrow meaning within the legal system. In any event, the reference to hate speech was published within an ongoing public debate in an editorial in which Mr. Hansman was being asked to comment on the human rights complaint he had recently filed. It is clear, when read in context, that the statement expressed Mr. Hansman\u2019s belief that Mr. Neufeld had \u201ctip toed . . . into hate speech\u201d, based on his own interpretation of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements. An assertion that might be taken as factual in one context may be properly construed as comment in another (WIC Radio, at para. 26; see Awan, at para. 76 (calling someone a \u201cliar\u201d can be fact or comment, depending on the context)).\n[114] Considered as a whole, the chambers judge was entitled to find under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) that the \u201csting\u201d of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements was \u201ccomment and it would have been understood as such\u201d by readers (WIC Radio, at para. 27).\n(c) Was the Fair Comment Defence Defeated by Malice?\n[115] A showing of malice defeats a valid fair comment defence. This can be done by demonstrating the defendant made the statement knowing it was false, with reckless indifference as to its truth, to injure the plaintiff out of spite or animosity, or for some other improper purpose (WIC Radio, at paras. 100-101 and 104; see also Bent, at para. 136; Smith v. Cross, 2009 BCCA 529, 314 D.L.R. (4th) 457, at para. 34). Proof of malice \u201cmay be intrinsic or extrinsic: that is, it may be drawn from the language of the assertion itself or from the circumstances surrounding the publication of the comment\u201d (WIC Radio, at para. 100). A finding of a subjective honest belief negates the possibility of finding malice (para. 53).\n[116] Mr. Neufeld argued that Mr. Hansman acted with malice in making the challenged statements \u2014 an allegation that the chambers judge found was unsubstantiated. The Court of Appeal held the chambers judge erred in his malice assessment in two material ways: (1) by finding as a fact that Mr. Hansman\u2019s affidavit \u201cstated\u201d an honest belief in the views he expressed, when it contained no such assertion; and (2) by holding that, once a defendant asserts a subjective belief in their comments, malice can be proved only by a full admission by the defendant on cross-examination (paras. 43-44). I disagree on both counts.\n[117] In WIC Radio, this Court cautioned against analyzing the fair comment defence at a \u201ctroubling level of technicality\u201d (para. 35). A finding of subjective honest belief can be based on the thrust of the defendant\u2019s evidence, read as a whole. Ultimately, the chambers judge found that Mr. Hansman\u2019s affidavit \u201cma[de] it clear\u201d that he honestly believed the views he espoused (at para. 141), and he was entitled to do so.\n[118] I also do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge held as a matter of law that once a defendant expresses an honest belief in their statements, malice can be proved only by an admission on cross-examination. The chambers judge noted that, while the PPPA provides for a right of cross-examination on affidavits, Mr. Neufeld declined to use this opportunity. The judge determined that, short of an admission of malice by Mr. Hansman on cross-examination, it was difficult to imagine how malice could be found on the \u201cevidence before [him]\u201d (para. 141). This simply amounted to a statement that Mr. Neufeld failed to meet his persuasive burden on this s. 4 application.\n[119] I agree with the chambers judge that Mr. Neufeld failed to adequately challenge the fair comment defence. The defence was Mr. Neufeld\u2019s to disprove, yet Mr. Neufeld adduced no \u201cevidence . . . that would form the basis of an argument against the validity of the fair comment defence\u201d (para. 126). The judge was therefore entitled to dismiss the proceeding on this basis.\n(d) Other Errors Found by the Court of Appeal\n[120] Besides impugning the chambers judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the fair comment defence, the Court of Appeal also objected to the way he undertook his analysis. The court held that the chambers judge erred by (1) working from a summary of the statements made by Mr. Hansman, and (2) placing undue reliance on WIC Radio. It is unnecessary for me to address these purported errors in detail, other than to say that the chambers judge\u2019s analysis was appropriate in the circumstances and responsive to the arguments of the parties. His reasons, read as a whole, do not suggest that he overlooked the defamatory meaning of any particular statement in context, or some essential aspect of the analysis. And unlike the Court of Appeal, I do not agree the chambers judge erred by relying on WIC Radio. WIC Radio is a seminal decision from this Court on the interpretation of the elements of the fair comment defence and is factually similar to this case. Both that case and this one involved defamation suits arising out of a public debate in the media over educational policies and practices about the 2SLGBTQ+ community. In each case, the plaintiff was a public figure who expressed views perceived by the defendant to be discriminatory, which invited harsh criticism by the defendant. I am of the view that WIC Radio was a relevant, if not controlling, precedent for the judge to have considered.\nD. Motion for Fresh Evidence\n[121] Mr. Hansman applied under s. 62(3) of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26 , and r. 47 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR\/2002\u2011156, to adduce two affidavits as fresh evidence in this Court. While I have serious reservations that this proposed evidence meets the Palmer test for admission (Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759), as affirmed in Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, at paras. 29-34, the evidence is unnecessary to resolve the appeal and I need not deal with the motion.\nV. Conclusion\n[122] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, and restore the order of the chambers judge dismissing the defamation action. I would make an order for costs to the appellant assessed on a party and party basis in this Court and on an ordinary costs basis at the Court of Appeal, with costs in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to be awarded on a full indemnity basis pursuant to s. 7(1) of the PPPA.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[123] In a famous concurring opinion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis posited that the remedy for objectionable speech \u201cis more speech, not enforced silence\u201d (Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), at p. 377). The argument that counter\u2011speech is to be preferred to the censorship or silencing of ideas perceived to be wrong or offensive is connected to the concept of a \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d encouraging competition between conflicting viewpoints. However, counter\u2011speech does not enjoy absolute constitutional protection, nor is it inherently more valuable than the speech to which it responds.\n[124] In fact, counter\u2011speech can even hinder the values underpinning our country\u2019s commitment to free expression (C. F. Zwibel, \u201cThe Right to Protest and Counter\u2011Protest: Complexities and Considerations\u201d, in E. Macfarlane, ed., Dilemmas of Free Expression (2022), 111, at pp. 111 and 120\u201125). For example, counter\u2011speech aimed at completely removing the initial expression from the public sphere appears to be inconsistent with the search for truth. Silencing contrary and unpopular views seems antithetical to our liberal, pluralistic and democratic society, which is committed to the free exchange of ideas in the pursuit of truth.\n[125] Indeed, the marketplace of ideas welcomes vigorous debates on divisive issues. Such confrontation helps shape, strengthen or even change people\u2019s perspectives. After all, he \u201cwho knows only his own side of the case knows little of that\u201d (J. S. Mill, On Liberty (1859 (reprinted 1978)), at p. 35). Truth is therefore arrived at by community members through the exercise of their agency and autonomous judgment, notably in the process of public discussion (R. Moon, \u201cThe Social Character of Freedom of Expression\u201d (2009), 2:1 Amst. L. Forum 43, at p. 46; on the ties between freedom of expression and human dignity and autonomy, see also Ward v. Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse), 2021 SCC 43, at para. 59; T. M. Scanlon, The Difficulty of Tolerance \u2014 Essays in Political Philosophy (2003), at pp. 14\u201116).\n[126] In short, not all counter\u2011speech is of equal value (R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 760\u201161). This is an appeal about defamatory counter\u2011speech and about whether a defamation action brought as a result should be dismissed before trial under s. 4 of the Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (\u201cPPPA\u201d).\n[127] Public debates on contentious issues can lend themselves to the use of intemperate, offensive or harsh language aimed at discrediting one\u2019s opponent (Keegstra, at p. 832, per McLachlin J. (as she then was), dissenting). Although freedom of expression protects such language, the protection it offers is not absolute. It is limited by, among other things, one\u2019s right to the protection of one\u2019s reputation (Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 102\u20116; Bou Malhab v. Diffusion M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia CMR inc., 2011 SCC 9, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 214, at para. 17).\n[128] As with freedom of expression, our law\u2019s protection of reputation is anchored in the notion of human dignity that underlies the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Hill, at paras. 120\u201121; see also Gilles E. N\u00e9ron Communication Marketing Inc. v. Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec, 2004 SCC 53, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 95, at paras. 52\u201153). While not a freestanding right, respect for one\u2019s reputation is essential to participation in society (R. v. Lucas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 48, per Cory J.). Thus, there is a strong societal interest in ensuring that individuals can protect their good reputation, as a \u201creputation tarnished by libel can seldom regain its former lustre\u201d (Hill, at para. 108).\n[129] Defamation lawsuits like the one in the present case call upon courts to cautiously strike the appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the protection of one\u2019s reputation (Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at para. 3; see also Bou Malhab, at para. 19). In determining whether Barry Neufeld\u2019s action in defamation against Glen Hansman should be dismissed at an early stage, our Court must remain mindful of this balance and take great care in not upsetting it (Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645, at para. 168). Unfortunately, and I say this with respect, by dismissing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s claim, my colleague fails to do so.\n[130] In my view, my colleague ventures beyond the narrow confines of the court\u2019s role when disposing of an application made under the PPPA. The purpose of s. 4 of the PPPA, just like that of s. 137.1 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (\u201cCJA\u201d), upon which it was modelled, is to act as a pre\u2011trial screening mechanism (1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, at para. 16). In Pointes, our Court cautioned against turning the analysis of a motion under s. 137.1 of the CJA into a de facto summary judgment motion, which would be \u201cinsurmountable at this stage of the proceedings\u201d (Pointes, at para. 52; see also para. 38).\n[131] The same caveat applies to s. 4 of the PPPA given the analogous procedural and evidentiary limitations contained in the statute. For example, an application for a dismissal order can be made any time after the commencement of a proceeding (PPPA, s. 9(2)). Once the plaintiff in the proceeding has been served with an application for a dismissal order under s. 4 of the PPPA, generally speaking, neither party can take further steps in the proceeding until the application has been adjudicated (s. 5). Furthermore, unless the court allows it, the plaintiff cannot amend his or her pleadings in order to prevent or avoid a dismissal order (s. 6). Likewise, evidence is to be given by affidavit (s. 9(4)). The rationale for these constraints is that an application under s. 4 of the PPPA is not meant to entail a determinative adjudication of the merits of the underlying proceeding (Pointes, at paras. 50\u201152). Rather, it is intended to serve as an expedient, cost\u2011efficient way to dismiss proceedings that unduly restrict free expression on matters of public interest.\n[132] Therefore, the question in this appeal is not whether this Court agrees with Mr. Neufeld\u2019s expression, or with Mr. Hansman\u2019s counter\u2011speech for that matter. The question is merely whether Mr. Neufeld\u2019s action should be dismissed at this early stage of the proceeding. Unlike my colleague, I conclude that it should not. In doing so, I am in no way prejudging the merits of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s action in defamation; I am strictly finding that he deserves to have his day in court.\nII. Analysis\n[133] As a preliminary matter, I part ways with my colleague regarding the structure of her analysis. Although my colleague accurately describes the applicable framework at para. 37 of her reasons, she does not apply it. Indeed, she begins with the public interest weighing exercise and then examines the validity of the fair comment defence advanced by Mr. Hansman. Respectfully, that is not how the analysis must be conducted (Pointes, at paras. 18 and 61\u201163).\n[134] In my opinion, the plaintiff in the proceeding (here, Mr. Neufeld) must first overcome a merits\u2011based hurdle, by demonstrating that there are \u201cgrounds to believe\u201d that the proceeding has substantial merit (PPPA, s. 4(2)(a)(i)) and that the applicant under the PPPA (here, Mr. Hansman) \u201chas no valid defence in the proceeding\u201d (PPPA, s. 4(2)(a)(ii)). Only once this is shown does the court have to determine whether the plaintiff has established that the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by him or her as a result of the applicant\u2019s expression is serious enough that the public interest in continuing the proceeding outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression (s. 4(2)(b)). Section 4(2)(b) of the PPPA is the final step of the analysis. If the plaintiff fails to show that the applicant has no valid defence, the underlying claim must be dismissed and there is no need to conduct the weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b) (Pointes, at para. 58).\n[135] My colleague asserts without explanation (and without citing any supporting authorities) that the \u201corder in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is, of course, at the discretion of the court\u201d (para. 53). In doing so, she is effectively ignoring our Court\u2019s recent decision in Pointes.\n[136] It is clear from Pointes that the merits\u2011based hurdle must be overcome before the court analyzes the public interest hurdle. The need to conduct the analysis in this order influenced how our Court defined the \u201csubstantial merit\u201d standard in Pointes. Indeed, the Court concluded that the standard could not be so stringent as to prevent cases from getting to the public interest weighing exercise, which is the core of the analysis under s. 137.1(4) of the CJA:\nHowever, while frivolous suits are clearly insufficient, \u201csomething more\u201d cannot require a showing that a claim is likely to succeed either, as some parties have posited. Neither the plain meaning nor the legal definition of \u201csubstantial\u201d comports with a \u201clikely to succeed\u201d standard. The legislative and statutory context does not support such a standard either. If \u201csubstantial merit\u201d requires a showing of being likely to succeed, this could unduly prevent cases from proceeding to the crux of the inquiry that is the weighing exercise under s. 137.1(4)(b). Given the importance of the weighing exercise in the legislative history, this cannot possibly be what the legislature contemplated. Indeed, nothing in the legislative history . . . points to a \u201clikely to succeed\u201d standard as the threshold for the plaintiff to prevail at the merits\u2011based hurdle of s. 137.1. While the plaintiff need not definitively demonstrate that its claim is more likely than not to succeed, the claim must nonetheless be sufficiently strong that terminating it at a preliminary stage would undermine the legislature\u2019s objective of ensuring that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim.\n. . .\nStatutory interpretation is a contextual exercise that requires reading a provision with and in light of other provisions: accordingly, if the bar is set too high at s. 137.1(4)(a)(i) or (ii), a motion judge will never reach s. 137.1(4)(b) \u2014 this cannot possibly be what the legislature contemplated given the legislative history and intent behind s. 137.1. The legislature repeatedly emphasized proportionality as the paramount consideration in determining whether a lawsuit should be dismissed. Weighing the public interest in freedom of expression and public participation against the public interest in vindicating a meritorious claim is a theme that runs through the entire legislative history, and this informs how s. 137.1 should be judicially understood. [Emphasis added; paras. 48 and 63.]\n[137] One of the objectives behind s. 137.1 of the CJA and s. 4 of the PPPA alike is to ensure \u201cthat a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim\u201d (Pointes, at para. 48 (emphasis added); see also paras. 63\u201164). The legitimacy of a claim is assessed, first and foremost, at the merits\u2011based hurdle stage, which concerns \u201cthe strength of the underlying proceeding\u201d (para. 60). In my view, by concluding that the order of the analysis is irrelevant and merely a matter of judicial discretion, my colleague undermines that legislative objective.\n[138] The analysis of the merits\u2011based hurdle informs that of the public interest hurdle. One aspect of the public interest hurdle requires assessing the seriousness of the harm suffered by the respondent (the plaintiff in the underlying proceeding) as a result of the applicant\u2019s expression, a task that is difficult if not impossible to perform without looking at the strength of the underlying proceeding. The following example illustrates this point. In a defamation action, harm is presumed (Pointes, at para. 71), but whether a claim has a real prospect of meeting the test for defamation must be determined at the merits\u2011based hurdle stage (Bent, at paras. 91 et seq.).\n[139] My colleague\u2019s approach does one of two things: either it glosses over the harm analysis or it subsumes the merits\u2011based hurdle under the public interest hurdle. Neither of these options is desirable. Indeed, the first tips the scales in favour of the applicant and upsets the balance that must be carefully maintained between freedom of expression and the protection of individual reputation. The latter effectively rewrites s. 137.1(4) of the CJA and s. 4 of the PPPA, which our Court is obviously not entitled to do.\n[140] I have searched in vain for an explanation in my colleague\u2019s reasons as to why she saw fit to reverse the order of the analysis, despite no party having asked the Court to do so. Not only did neither the appellant nor the respondent ask our Court to adopt a framework different from the one applied in Pointes, but they both presented their arguments by addressing the merits\u2011based hurdle first and then the public interest hurdle, as they should. The chambers judge and the Court of Appeal also proceeded in this order, as Pointes instructed them to do. The fact that the parties and interveners dedicated most of their submissions to the public interest hurdle is hardly a principled or good reason to change the framework adopted in Pointes.\n[141] While I recognize that the public interest weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA is the \u201ccrux\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d of the analysis, it must first be established that the underlying claim arises from an expression made by the applicant on a matter of public interest and that it clears the merits\u2011based hurdle (Pointes, at paras. 18 and 61\u201163; Bent, at para. 139). Ultimately, it is \u201cthe public interest in allowing meritorious lawsuits to proceed\u201d that is weighed against \u201cthe public interest in protecting expression on matters of public interest\u201d (Pointes, at para. 18 (emphasis added)).\n[142] Lower court judges may wish to enable proper appellate review and make alternative findings through the public interest weighing exercise even if a claim fails to clear the merits\u2011based hurdle. The proper way to proceed is to follow the approach adopted by our Court in Pointes: first determine whether the claim clears the merits\u2011based hurdle and then address the public interest hurdle (Pointes, at paras. 112\u201113; see also Echelon Environmental Inc. v. Glassdoor Inc., 2022 ONCA 391, at para. 12 (CanLII)). Furthermore, this approach is directly in line with the legislative intent behind s. 4 of the PPPA, and s. 4(2)(b) in particular.\n[143] Consequently, I will first analyze whether the chambers judge erred in concluding that Mr. Hansman has a valid fair comment defence. Afterwards, I will address whether the chambers judge erred in his analysis of the public interest hurdle. As I explain below, I am of the view that the chambers judge committed reviewable errors both in his assessment of the fair comment defence and in his analysis of the public interest hurdle. Indeed, the chambers judge misconstrued the applicable test under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) and (b) of the PPPA. Further, he misconstrued the law on defamation and on the fair comment defence, and failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression at issue when assessing the public interest in protecting it. Therefore, the applicable standard of review is correctness unless the chambers judge\u2019s findings are not affected by these errors (Bent, at para. 77, citing Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 8 and 36).\nA. Fair Comment Defence\n(1) There Are Grounds to Believe That Mr. Hansman Cannot Avail Himself of a Fair Comment Defence for at Least Some of His Statements\n[144] Under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201cthe applicant has no valid defence in the proceeding\u201d. The standard is not a very demanding one. It requires showing that there is a basis in law and in the record for finding that there is no valid defence, taking into account the stage of the proceeding at which the application is brought (Pointes, at paras. 37\u201139; Bent, at para. 103).\n[145] To succeed, the plaintiff does not have to establish that the applicant has no valid defence for every impugned statement; it suffices that a valid defence is unavailable for some statements or even only one. This is because s. 4 of the PPPA contemplates the dismissal of a proceeding altogether (see s. 1 of the PPPA, which defines \u201cdismissal order\u201d as \u201can order under section 4 dismissing a proceeding\u201d). It does not allow for partial dismissal of the proceeding or for striking out parts of the claim. This is entirely consistent with the PPPA\u2019s purpose, which is to screen out lawsuits in order to prevent defendants from being unduly pulled into the litigation process (Pointes, at paras. 16 and 62).\n[146] For this reason, it is important to examine the defamatory sting and the context of each of the impugned statements in order to assess the availability of a defence. Therefore, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge erred by failing to examine each of the impugned statements contained in the 11 publications. This was particularly critical because a fair comment defence was being advanced by Mr. Hansman. Assessing the availability of such a defence requires a careful review of the impugned statement in the context of the publication in which it appeared to determine whether it is recognizable as a comment rather than as a statement of fact (WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, at para. 28).\n[147] There is indeed a difference between \u201ccomment or criticism and allegations of fact, such as that disgraceful acts have been committed\u201d (Davis v. Shepstone (1886), 11 App. Cas. 187 (P.C.), at p. 190, cited in WIC Radio, at para. 70, per LeBel J., concurring). A defining feature of a comment is that it is generally incapable of being proven (WIC Radio, at para. 26, citing Ross v. New Brunswick Teachers\u2019 Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 N.B.R. (2d) 112, at para. 56). Similarly, a comment must be clearly recognizable as such and not be \u201cso entangled [with allegations of fact] that inferences cannot be distinguished from facts\u201d (R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States (2nd ed. (loose\u2011leaf)) (\u201cBrown on Defamation\u201d), at \u00a7 15:5). Any ambiguity in this regard must benefit the plaintiff (R. E. Brown, The Law of Defamation in Canada (2nd ed. (loose\u2011leaf)), at p. 15\u201127, cited in Ager v. Canjex Publishing Ltd., 2005 BCCA 467, 259 D.L.R. (4th) 727, at para. 43). The inquiry is an objective one aimed at discerning the perception of the reasonable viewer or reader (Brown on Defamation, at \u00a7 15:4).\n[148] The chambers judge cursorily examined this issue. He concluded that the impugned statements were very similar to those in WIC Radio, which were found to be comments. He ultimately found that \u201cno reasonable trier of this case could distinguish the facts in this case from the facts in WIC\u201d (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205, at para. 137; see also para. 178). In so doing, he erred.\n[149] Characterizing speech as a comment or as a statement of fact involves a contextual analysis, the result of which is at most a finding of mixed law and fact. The present case illustrates why merely transposing a finding of mixed law and fact to another case is a questionable practice that should be avoided. Unlike the defendant in WIC Radio, Mr. Hansman was not a well\u2011known, controversial commentator when he made the impugned statements; he was speaking in his capacity as president of the British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation (\u201cBCTF\u201d), a union composed of 45,000 teachers (C.A. reasons, 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217, at para. 35). Moreover, contrary to the facts of WIC Radio, Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements were not published in an editorial; they were reported in news articles. These are critical differences, as both the reputation of a defendant, such as Mr. Hansman, and the format of the publication matter in classifying expression as a comment or a statement of fact and in assessing the availability of the fair comment defence in general (WIC Radio, at paras. 27 and 48). More fundamentally, as the Court of Appeal aptly noted, the court\u2019s ruling in WIC Radio was the result of an adjudication on the merits at trial, unlike in the present case (para. 39).\n[150] In my opinion, there are grounds to believe that the fair comment defence is not available for two of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements because they were made as statements of fact.\n[151] In January 2018, news articles regarding Mr. Neufeld were published in the Fraser Valley News and the Agassiz Harrison Observer. Both articles, available online, reproduced a press release from the Chilliwack Teachers\u2019 Association. The press release announced the passing of a motion of non\u2011confidence in the Chilliwack Board of Education due to its perceived inaction in connection with Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements concerning the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 (\u201cSOGI 123\u201d) initiative. Mr. Hansman was quoted as saying the following:\nSometimes our beliefs, values, and responsibilities as professional educators are challenged by those who promote hatred. This is often the case when it comes to sexual health curriculum in schools and our efforts to ensure safe, inclusive schools for all students \u2014 including LGBTQ students . . . . [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 87)\n[152] Read plainly and in the context of the press release, this statement implies that Mr. Neufeld promoted hatred against an identifiable group, i.e. LGBTQ students.\n[153] Then, in April 2018, a news article was published on CityNews 1130\u2019s website. The article pertained to the human rights complaint filed against Mr. Neufeld by the BCTF. In the article, Mr. Hansman was quoted as saying that Mr. Neufeld had \u201ctip toed quite far into hate speech\u201d (A.R., vol. I, at p. 89 (emphasis deleted)). This statement is at the core of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s action in defamation (chambers judge\u2019s reasons, at para. 25).\n[154] Both of these statements carry the defamatory sting that Mr. Neufeld engaged in hate speech. Our law requires an onerous and objective standard to be met for speech to constitute hate speech (Keegstra, at pp. 777\u201178, per Dickson C.J.; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 56). Understandably, allowing subjective sensibilities to play a role in the analysis would endanger the constitutionality of anti\u2011hate speech laws. Therefore, what is considered hate speech is not speech that evokes a wide range of emotions, but speech that elicits deep feelings of detestation and vilification (Keegstra, at p. 777; R. v. Andrews (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 161 (C.A.), at p. 179, per Cory J.A., aff\u2019d [1990] 3 S.C.R. 870). Such speech sits at a distance from offensive or hurtful expression that \u201cdoes not incite the level of abhorrence, delegitimization and rejection that risks causing discrimination or other harmful effects\u201d (Whatcott, at para. 57; see also para. 46).\n[155] In my respectful view, affirming that Mr. Neufeld engaged in hate speech is quite different from expressing a judgment or making a remark incapable of proof. Read in their context, the aforementioned hate speech allegations appear similar to allegations of fraud, theft or other criminal conduct that have been found to be statements of fact for which a fair comment defence is not available (see, e.g., Nanda v. McEwan, 2019 ONSC 3357, at para. 48 (CanLII) (regarding allegations of theft and corruption), aff\u2019d 2020 ONCA 431, 450 D.L.R. (4th) 145; Hall v. Kyburz, 2006 ABQB 294, at para. 33 (CanLII) (regarding allegations of various criminal acts, such as fraud, kidnapping and extortion), aff\u2019d 2007 ABCA 228). I view the present case as being similar to Lascaris v. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, and Bondfield Construction Company Limited v. The Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 501, in which the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that statements that a party \u201csupported terrorists\u201d (Lascaris, at para. 34) or was involved in corruption and collusion (Bondfield, at para. 17) could be viewed as statements of fact. The present appeal also has similarities to Pan v. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, in which the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that calling someone a \u201cseasoned liar\u201d was a statement of fact (paras. 101\u20114).\n[156] My colleague distinguishes Lascaris, Bondfield and Pan from the matter at hand because \u201c[i]n the context of those cases, the statements suggested concrete knowledge of past wrongdoings, which is distinguishable from the generalized critiques at issue in this case\u201d (para. 110). But to accuse a person of hate speech is not the same as making a \u201cgeneralized critique\u201d. On the contrary, it is to attribute precise wrongdoing to that person (para. 110).\n[157] For this reason, I conclude that there are grounds to believe that the two impugned statements were made as statements of fact and not as comments and, consequently, that the fair comment defence is not available to Mr. Hansman. I turn now to the public interest hurdle.\nB. Public Interest Hurdle\n(1) The Harm Likely to Have Been or to Be Suffered by Mr. Neufeld Is Very Serious\n[158] Mr. Neufeld claims damages for non\u2011monetary harm. He seeks compensation for the stress, anxiety, humiliation, mental and emotional distress as well as reputational harm suffered as a result of Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 97\u201198). The chambers judge noted that Mr. Neufeld presented no evidence, aside from one paragraph in his affidavit, showing that he had suffered any damage that could be linked to Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements. It is worth emphasizing that what was required of Mr. Neufeld at this preliminary stage was not to prove harm or causation but only to \u201cprovide evidence for the . . . judge to draw an inference of likelihood in respect of the existence of the harm and the relevant causal link\u201d (Pointes, at para. 71). In my opinion, and as I demonstrate below, the chambers judge erroneously ignored factors aggravating the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by Mr. Neufeld, despite the fact that they were specifically argued by him (para. 155).\n[159] First, the chambers judge failed to consider that the seriousness of the harm can be inferred from the gravity of the impugned statements. Indeed, the \u201cnature of the defamatory comment is the most important element in assessing the amount of damages\u201d (Brown on Defamation, at \u00a7 25:19; see also P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5th ed. 2022), at \u00a714.01[2][b]). For example, allegations of criminal conduct rank high on the scale of seriousness (Grant, at para. 111; see also Lascaris, at paras. 40\u201141, cited with approval in Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2021 ONCA 529, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 245, at para. 39, per Jamal J.A. (as he then was); Clark v. East Sooke Rural Association, 2004 BCSC 1120, at para. 132 (CanLII); Manno v. Henry, 2008 BCSC 738, at para. 79 (CanLII); Lalli v. Athwal, 2017 BCSC 1931, at para. 141 (CanLII); Mann v. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 2012 BCSC 181, at para. 73 (CanLII)).\n[160] The same can be said of hate speech allegations. They refer to objectively and undeniably abhorrent conduct that can give rise to criminal prosecution (Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, s. 319(2) ). Such speech exposes members of an identifiable group to extreme and deep\u2011felt emotions of detestation and vilification (Whatcott, at para. 59; Keegstra, at pp. 777\u201178). It \u201clays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on vulnerable groups. These attacks can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide\u201d (Whatcott, at para. 74). Regardless of whether such conduct is characterized as a criminal offence under the Criminal Code or as the subject matter of a human rights complaint, accusing a person of having \u201ctip toed quite far into hate speech\u201d or having promoted hatred against an identifiable group is extremely damaging to that person\u2019s reputation. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal was right in noting that such an accusation \u201ccan inflict serious reputational harm\u201d (para. 68).\n[161] Second, the chambers judge did not consider the absence of an apology from Mr. Hansman, which is another aggravating factor increasing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s harm (Barrick Gold Corp. v. Lopehandia (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 416 (C.A.), at para. 51).\n[162] Third, the chambers judge did not take into account the stature of Mr. Hansman, who, at all relevant times, was acting as the president of the BCTF. This is likely to have magnified Mr. Neufeld\u2019s harm. Indeed, the \u201cgreater the reputation of the defendant, the greater the impact the defamation can be expected to have on the plaintiff\u201d (Downard, at \u00a714.01[2][g]; Bent, at para. 161).\n[163] Finally, the chambers judge failed to consider the context of the publication and the platform on which the impugned statements were published (Downard, at \u00a714.01[2][c]). The statements accusing Mr. Neufeld of hate speech were published by news organizations in articles available on the Internet (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 87 and 89). The anonymity offered by the Internet, combined with increased accessibility and information sharing, can result in greater harm to a person\u2019s reputation (Crookes v. Newton, 2011 SCC 47, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 269, at para. 37; Barrick Gold, at paras. 31\u201134; Pineau v. KMI Publishing and Events Ltd., 2022 BCCA 426, at para. 69 (CanLII)).\n[164] All of these aggravating factors relate to Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression and increase the amount of general damages, which are presumed in defamation cases (Bent, at para. 144; C.A. reasons, at paras. 55 and 57). These factors were erroneously ignored by the chambers judge. The chambers judge also erred in discounting the part played by Mr. Hansman in Mr. Neufeld\u2019s harm because others had expressed similar criticism towards Mr. Neufeld (para. 150). While I acknowledge that Mr. Hansman was not alone in criticizing Mr. Neufeld, the Court of Appeal was right in pointing out that a definitive determination of Mr. Hansman\u2019s part in Mr. Neufeld\u2019s harm is not required at this stage of the proceeding (Pointes, at paras. 71\u201172; C.A. reasons, at para. 59). To conclude otherwise would impose too onerous a burden on Mr. Neufeld at such an early stage. Furthermore, as our Court noted in Pointes, causation is not an \u201call\u2011or\u2011nothing proposition\u201d (para. 72).\n[165] The fact that Mr. Neufeld was re\u2011elected as trustee may be a mitigating factor, but it does not nullify his claim, nor does it render his harm minor. Even in cases where a defamatory statement is not believed, damages can be awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the injured feelings, psychological impact and inconvenience caused by the libel (Bent, at para. 149; Downard, at \u00a714.01[2][f] and [h]). Likewise, the fact that Mr. Neufeld was not silenced by Mr. Hansman\u2019s statements does not negate any harm he suffered. Otherwise, public figures could claim only nominal damages for defamation unless they lost their platform as a result. That is not, nor has it ever been, the state of the law. Granted, the fact that a plaintiff has shied away from the public sphere as a consequence of defamatory remarks can certainly increase the damages awarded, but this is not the yardstick by which harm is measured.\n[166] In my opinion, given the aggravating factors discussed above, the seriousness of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s harm should have been situated somewhere between the middle and the high end of the scale.\n(2) The Public Interest in Allowing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s Claim to Proceed to Trial Outweighs the Public Interest in Protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s Expression\n[167] Because of the subsidiary nature of this issue, the chambers judge gave little consideration to the competing public interests. He briefly noted that Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression deserved \u201csignificant protection\u201d because many of his statements pertained to the need for inclusive and safe schools or did not mention Mr. Neufeld, and he suggested that public debate should be favoured in light of the limited damage suffered by Mr. Neufeld (paras. 160\u201161).\n[168] The chambers judge failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression (Pointes, at para. 74). This constitutes a reviewable error. In fairness, he did not have the benefit of our Court\u2019s decision in Pointes. However, such an inquiry is essential to determine \u201cwhat is really going on\u201d in the case, which is ultimately the exercise contemplated by s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA (Pointes, at para. 81; Bent, at para. 172).\n[169] The role of this Court is not and should not be to evaluate the soundness of Mr. Hansman\u2019s and Mr. Neufeld\u2019s respective positions on SOGI 123 (C.A. reasons, at para. 2; chambers judge\u2019s reasons, at para. 177). Freedom of expression is content\u2011neutral, which is why its scope even encompasses expression that is \u201cunpopular, distasteful or contrary to the mainstream\u201d (Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 968). This fundamental freedom would be seriously undermined if the outcome of the public interest weighing exercise under the PPPA depended on the alignment between the views expressed by the applicant and those held by the court.\n[170] In my opinion, my colleague follows an improper path of reasoning when she justifies reinstating the chambers judge\u2019s dismissal order on the basis that Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression \u201cpromotes equality\u201d, which is also a \u201cfundamental democratic value\u201d (para. 9). Equality is not one of the competing values at play under legislation designed to discourage strategic lawsuits against public participation (\u201cSLAPPs\u201d); \u201cthe protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression\u201d are (para. 58).\n[171] Moreover, the promotion of equality is not one of the core values underpinning freedom of expression (i.e., the search for truth, participation in social and political decision making, and diversity in forms of self\u2011fulfillment and human flourishing) (Keegstra, at p. 728; Irwin Toy, at p. 976). Assigning any role to the promotion of equality in the assessment of the public interest in protecting expression goes against the doctrine of content neutrality embraced by this Court in its jurisprudence on s. 2 (b) of the Charter (see, e.g., Irwin Toy, at p. 968; Keegstra, at p. 729; R. v. Zundel, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731, at pp. 753\u201158). The more we evaluate the worthiness of expression in light of values unrelated to freedom of expression, the further we move from content neutrality. More importantly, the promotion of equality is in no way a factor tethered to the text of s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA and, for this reason alone, is not a relevant factor in the public interest weighing exercise (Pointes, at para. 80).\n[172] Ultimately, both Mr. Hansman and Mr. Neufeld had the right to express themselves on SOGI 123. It may be that Mr. Neufeld\u2019s statements crossed the line and that he breached the Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, but that is for the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal to decide following a hearing on the merits of the complaints filed against Mr. Neufeld.\n[173] It is undeniable that Mr. Hansman\u2019s counter\u2011speech concerned the importance of ensuring inclusive schools for LGBTQ students through the implementation of SOGI 123. But Mr. Hansman did not limit himself to criticizing Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views on SOGI 123 or to affirming his support for inclusive schools. He made personal attacks and serious hate speech accusations that were likely to cause or that did cause significant harm to Mr. Neufeld. This lowers the public interest in protecting his speech, as \u201cdefamatory statements and personal attacks are \u2018very tenuously\u2019 related to the core values which underlie s. 2 (b) of the Charter\u201d (Thorman v. McGraw, 2022 ONCA 851, 476 D.L.R. (4th) 577, at para. 15; see also Hill, at para. 106; Pointes, at paras. 74\u201175; Bent, at para. 163).\n[174] What is really going on in the present case is not an attempt to suppress Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression. Rather, this is \u201ca case in which one party is attempting to remedy seemingly legitimate harm suffered as a result of a defamatory communication\u201d (Bent, at para. 172). In other words, the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by Mr. Neufeld strongly militates in favour of allowing the proceeding to continue (para. 159).\n[175] Restricting the availability of tort actions for defamation can have a chilling effect. In Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland, [1960] S.C.R. 203, this Court refused to extend the defence of qualified privilege to defamatory statements related to the fitness of political candidates, in part because it would deter future candidates from seeking office (pp. 208\u20119; see also Hill, at para. 106). Likewise, in the context of defamatory counter\u2011speech, interpreting s. 4 of the PPPA so as to deprive defamed parties who have suffered serious harm of their day in court could very well be detrimental to public debate. It could prevent those who hold controversial or unpopular views from entering the public arena to share them. This conclusion does not turn the concept of chilling effect on its head, contrary to what my colleague contends (para. 77). My colleague asserts that our Court\u2019s jurisprudence on this concept \u201caddresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest\u201d (para. 77). However, the deprivation, through a court order, of a party\u2019s right to vindicate a legitimate claim also imposes a legal penalty on that party.\n[176] I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge erred in failing to consider the chilling effect that the dismissal of Mr. Neufeld\u2019s claim might have on future expression by others (Pointes, at para. 80; C.A. reasons, at para. 65).\n[177] Anti\u2011SLAPP legislation like the PPPA does not provide a licence to defame (Park Lawn Corporation v. Kahu Capital Partners Ltd., 2023 ONCA 129, 478 D.L.R. (4th) 514, at para. 33). Being the subject of defamatory counter\u2011speech is not the price that those who engage in public debate by expressing minority views on contentious topics must inevitably pay. This is not what is envisioned by s. 4 of the PPPA, which, like s. 137.1 of the CJA, aims to ensure \u201cthat a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim\u201d (Pointes, at para. 48). In my view, and with all due respect, my colleague is depriving Mr. Neufeld of that very opportunity.\n[178] As for Mr. Hansman\u2019s motion to adduce fresh evidence, I am of the view that both of the affidavits he seeks to file are not relevant to the decisive issues on appeal and therefore do not meet the test for admitting fresh evidence set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. The purpose of the first affidavit is to contradict Mr. Neufeld\u2019s claim that dismissing his defamation action would have a chilling effect on him by demonstrating that he continued to speak out after the chambers judge dismissed his action. However, the live issue before this Court is not whether Mr. Neufeld\u2019s expression was stifled because of the chambers judge\u2019s dismissal order. Rather, it is whether other people\u2019s expression could be. The second affidavit sets out developments in the human rights complaint filed by the BCTF; it is not relevant to the disposition of this appeal.\n[179] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with party and party costs in this Court and ordinary costs in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Pursuant to s. 7(2) of the PPPA, I would make no order regarding the costs of the PPPA application in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nAppeal allowed with costs, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation, Vancouver; Michael Sobkin, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Paul E.

However, s. 111(5) restricts non\u2011capital loss carryovers for a corporation if control of the corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, unless it continues the same or similar business that incurred the losses. Prior to the transactions in issue, Deans Knight Income Corporation (\u201cDeans Knight\u201d), then operating under the name Forbes Medi\u2011Tech Inc. (\u201cForbes\u201d), had approximately $90 million of unused non\u2011capital losses, scientific research and development tax expenditures, and investment tax credits but given that it was in financial difficulty, it did not have income which its past losses could offset. It entered into an investment agreement with a venture capital company, Matco, and a complex arrangement was devised to take advantage of the loss carryover deduction in s. 111(1) (a) without triggering the restriction in s. 111(5) . First, Forbe\u2019s assets and liabilities were moved into a new parent company, Newco. Second, pursuant to the investment agreement, Matco purchased a debenture convertible into some of the voting shares and all of the non\u2011voting shares that Newco held in Forbes. While Newco was not obliged to sell its shares to Matco, it was promised that it would receive at least a guaranteed amount if it sold the shares or if such an opportunity did not present itself. Third, Matco would find a new business venture for Forbes, which would be used to raise money through an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d). The profits from this venture could be sheltered by the tax attributes Forbes originally could not utilize. Other than when acting pursuant to the investment agreement, Newco and Forbes could not engage in a variety of activities without the consent of Matco. The arrangement went according to plan. Matco found a mutual fund management company, Deans Knight Capital Management, that agreed to use Forbes for an IPO through which it would raise money to invest in high\u2011yield debt instruments. Forbes\u2019 name was changed to Deans Knight. The IPO and subsequent investment business succeeded. Accordingly, for its 2009 to 2012 tax years, Deans Knight deducted a majority of its non\u2011capital losses to reduce its tax liability.\nThe Minister reassessed Deans Knight and denied the deductions. Deans Knight objected to the reassessments and appealed to the Tax Court. Among other arguments, the Minister adopted the position that the general anti\u2011avoidance rule in s. 245 of the Income Tax Act (\u201cGAAR \u201d) applied to deny the deductions because the transactions constituted abusive tax avoidance. The Tax Court agreed the transactions were tax avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit but held they were not abusive. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the transactions were abusive and the GAAR applied to deny the tax benefits. It set aside the judgment of the Tax Court and dismissed Deans Knight\u2019s appeal of the reassessments.\nHeld (C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ.: The transactions were abusive and therefore the GAAR applies to deny the tax benefits. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Through a complex series of transactions, Deans Knight underwent a fundamental transformation that achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the text of s. 111(5). Without triggering an \u201cacquisition of control\u201d, Matco gained the power of a majority voting shareholder and fundamentally changed Deans Knight\u2019s assets, liabilities, shareholders and business. This severed the continuity that is at the heart of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). The result obtained by the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5) and therefore constituted abuse.\nThe GAAR was a choice by Parliament to complement its specific anti\u2011avoidance efforts with the enactment of a general rule. While abusive tax avoidance can involve unforeseen tax strategies, it is more broadly designed to capture situations that undermine the integrity of the tax system by frustrating the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions relied on by the taxpayer. Some uncertainty is unavoidable when a general rule is adopted, but a reasonable degree of certainty is achieved by the balance struck within the GAAR itself. A GAAR analysis involves a structured, three\u2011step test, and asks whether (1) there was a tax benefit; (2) the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit was an avoidance transaction; and (3) the avoidance transaction was abusive.\nAnalyzing whether the avoidance transactions are abusive involves determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions, and determining whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose. The object, spirit and purpose represents the legislative rationale that underlies specific or interrelated provisions of the Act. It is critical to distinguish the rationale behind a provision from the means chosen to give that rationale effect within the provision. The object, spirit and purpose of a provision must be worded as a description of its rationale. A court is not repeating the test for the provision or crafting a new, secondary test; rather, the object, spirit and purpose is a concise description of the rationale underlying the provision, such as why relief is being provided, the conduct that Parliament sought to encourage, or the result or mischief that Parliament sought to prevent.\nThe use of a provision\u2019s text, context and purpose to determine the rationale differs from traditional statutory interpretation. Since in a GAAR analysis, the search is for the rationale that underlies the words, considering the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose ensures that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence used to discern that rationale remains tied to the provision itself. Considering a provision\u2019s text involves asking how it sheds light on what the provision was designed to achieve, since the language and structure of the provision can be evocative of Parliament\u2019s underlying concerns. Courts must also consider the provision\u2019s context, with a focus on the relationship between the provision alleged to have been abused and the particular scheme within which it operates. Understanding the provision\u2019s purpose is central to the GAAR analysis, and legislative history and extrinsic evidence provide insight into the rationale for specific provisions.\nOnce the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis focuses on whether the result of the transactions frustrates the provision\u2019s object, spirit and purpose. Avoidance transactions will be abusive where their result: is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions; or circumvents provisions in a manner that frustrates their object, spirit and purpose. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction must be clear. However, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met, as with a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule; even specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse.\nA review of s. 111(5)\u2019s text, context and purpose reveals its underlying rationale. With respect to the text of the provision, s. 111(5) is a restriction on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to make use of its non\u2011capital losses incurred in another taxation year. First, the text of s. 111(5) references \u201ccontrol\u201d, which has been interpreted as referring to de jure control. The general test for de jure control is whether the controlling party enjoys, by virtue of its shareholdings, the ability to elect the majority of the board of directors. Second, control must be \u201cacquired by a person or group of persons\u201d. Third, s. 111(5) creates an exception that losses remain deductible if, after an acquisition of control, the corporation engages in the same or a similar business. Thus, the connection to past losses is severed only when control has been acquired and there is a break from the corporation\u2019s past business. The text of s. 111(5) reflects a concern with denying loss carryovers when there is a lack of continuity within the corporation, as measured by both the identity of its controlling shareholders and its business activity.\nA contextual analysis also sheds light on the rationale behind s. 111(5). First, s. 111(5) should be considered against the foundational principles of the Income Tax Act . Under the Act, every person, including a corporation, is a separate taxpayer, and it is a foundational principle that taxpayers are to be taxed on their own earnings. When there has been an acquisition of control and a corporation\u2019s business ceases to operate, it can no longer be understood as the same taxpayer. Furthermore, s. 111(5) delineates the boundaries of the benefit\u2011conferring provision, s. 111(1)(a). Section 111(1)(a) modifies the general rule that each taxpayer is taxed based on their income and losses within a single taxation year to allow a taxpayer to deduct non\u2011capital losses against income in a future or prior taxation year, but only the taxpayer who suffered the loss is entitled to deduct the loss. Section 111(5) ensures that this principle is given effect for corporations. While a corporation is still the same legal person after an acquisition of control, the identity of those behind the corporation has changed. Section 111(5) functions so that the tax benefits associated with those losses will not benefit a new shareholder base carrying on a new business. This restriction is consistent with other provisions in the Act which also treat a corporation as, effectively, a new taxpayer following an acquisition of control. There are reasons why Parliament chose the de jure control test as the standard to be used on an application of s. 111(5): it is a clearer benchmark than de facto control, meaning greater certainty for the majority of transactions, which are not tax\u2011motivated. However, the provision\u2019s rationale is not fully captured by the de jure test; rather, the rationale of s. 111(5) is illuminated by related provisions which both extend and restrict the circumstances in which an acquisition of control has occurred, including by looking beyond the standard documentation under the de jure control test. These provisions suggest that de jure control is not a perfect reflection or complete explanation of the mischief that Parliament sought to address.\nIt is also necessary to consider extrinsic evidence of Parliament\u2019s purpose. The legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliament was concerned with addressing the trading of loss corporations, which was undermining the tax base and creating inequity among taxpayers. While the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns have evolved over time, its rationale for including the non\u2011capital loss carryover restriction in the Act has been consistent. When a corporation changes hands, and the loss business ceases to operate, the corporation is effectively a new taxpayer that cannot avail itself of non\u2011capital losses accumulated by the old taxpayer. The business continuity exception was included to encourage the recovery of unprofitable enterprises that require new investment by new owners to strengthen the corporation\u2019s business. Although the corporation may have changed hands, the link in continuity is preserved through a different marker and the justification for s. 111(1)(a) remains applicable. This reinforces that, at its core, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the circumstances in which the basis for the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) is non\u2011existent.\nTaken together, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporation\u2019s identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non\u2011capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s. 111(5).\nAn analysis of the transactions at issue demonstrates that their result served to frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5): they achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent and provided Matco with the benefits of an acquisition of control, all while narrowly circumventing the application of s. 111(5). They resulted in Deans Knight\u2019s near\u2011total transformation: it became a company with new assets and liabilities, new shareholders and a new business whose only link to its prior corporate life was the tax attributes. It was used as the vessel for an unrelated venture selected by Matco. Matco achieved the functional equivalent of an acquisition of control through the investment agreement, while circumventing s. 111(5), because the transactions dismembered the rights and benefits that would normally flow from being a controlling shareholder. First, it contracted for the ability to select Deans Knight\u2019s directors. Second, the investment agreement placed severe restrictions on the powers of the board of directors which, but for a circuit\u2011breaker transaction that occurred in this case, would normally occur through a unanimous shareholders agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control. Third, the transactions allowed Matco to reap significant financial benefits, while depriving Newco, the majority voting shareholder on paper, of each of the core rights that it could ordinarily have exercised.\nAny residual freedom that Deans Knight had was illusory and reinforces how the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5). Deans Knight\u2019s acceptance of the corporate opportunity presented by Matco was a fait accompli because Deans Knight was prohibited from engaging in any activity other than studying and accepting the corporate opportunity, and because the consequences of refusing the opportunity were severe. As for Newco\u2019s ability to sell its remaining shares to a party other than Matco or to opt not to sell at all, Deans Knight\u2019s actions were already locked down by the investment agreement, and the benefits of share ownership were already negated by being subjected to Matco\u2019s approval. The ability to receive the guaranteed amount without selling the remaining shares to Matco was important because in certain circumstances, Matco\u2019s purchase of the shares might lead to an acquisition of de jure control. The complex series of transactions and the flexibility built into the investment agreement were necessary only because the contracting parties sought to achieve the very mischief that s. 111(5) was intended to prevent. Considering the circumstances as a whole, the result obtained by the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5).\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the Tax Court\u2019s judgment restored. The avoidance transactions did not frustrate the rationale of s. 111(5), and therefore, do not amount to abuse. The GAAR requires a careful balance between the interest of the taxpayer in minimizing his or her taxes through technically legitimate means and the legislative interest in ensuring the integrity of the income tax system. Despite Parliament\u2019s unambiguous adoption of the de jure control test in s. 111(5) of the Income Tax Act, the majority has opted for an ad hoc approach that expands the concept of control based on a wide array of operational factors. This approach invites the exercise of unbounded judicial discretion and will result in the loss\u2011trading restrictions in s. 111(5) being applied to transactions on a circumstantial basis.\nThe majority\u2019s approach to determining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) fails to account for the central principle that the GAAR does not and cannot override Parliament\u2019s specific intent regarding particular provisions of the Act. The GAAR analysis rests on the same interpretive approach employed by the Court in all questions of statutory interpretation, and is little more than a specialized form of statutory interpretation to determine Parliament\u2019s intent. It should not be assumed that the GAAR plays a role in every transaction and in every context. There is agreement with the majority that there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule; however, a provision\u2019s text can sometimes be conclusive and fully explain its underlying rationale. The key question is whether Parliament specifically intended to prevent or permit a certain type of transaction. Where an anti\u2011avoidance provision has been carefully crafted to include some situations and exclude others, it is reasonable to infer that Parliament chose to limit its scope accordingly. The GAAR was intended to catch unforeseen tax strategies, but if Parliament drafts a specific anti\u2011avoidance provision in a way that keeps a highly foreseeable gap open, the gap is more likely to be intentional, and relying on it should not be considered abusive.\nSection 111(5) is a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule that limits what would otherwise be permissible deductions under s. 111(1)(a), which allows taxpayers to deduct non\u2011capital losses for the purpose of computing taxable income for a taxation year. Upon an acquisition of control, s. 111(5) prevents a corporation from carrying over losses unless the business, carried on by the corporation subject to the change of control, is continued for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit. It bars corporate acquisitions for the singular purpose of accessing tax attributes by restricting the use of those attributes if accessed through the exercise of control. Courts have determined that \u201ccontrol\u201d for the purposes of the Act means de jure control. De jure control refers to the ownership of a sufficient number of shares to have a majority of votes in the election of the corporation\u2019s board of directors. A corporation\u2019s constating documents create de jure control because they restrain the ability of shareholders to exercise their voting power freely. In contrast, external agreements give rise to obligations that are contractual and not legal or constitutional in nature. Consequently, the distinction between de jure and de facto control lies in the breadth of factors that can be considered in determining who has control over the corporation.\nThe object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. A textual, contextual and purposive analysis of s. 111(5) of the Act reveals that Parliament never intended courts to consider factors other than those related to share ownership in determining who has control over a corporation. The majority introduces the notion of functional equivalence, which treats the investment agreement as a constating document for the purposes of control. This ignores that constating documents and external agreements are enforced in radically different ways: an ordinary contract can never be functionally equivalent to a constating document. The GAAR cannot be invoked to override Parliament\u2019s clear intent, and the majority\u2019s approach departs from Parliament\u2019s clear articulation of a de jure control test for restricting losses under s. 111(5).\nWhether an avoidance transaction is abusive is a fact\u2011intensive inquiry that raises a question of mixed fact and law. Absent an extricable error of law, the application of the law to the facts is subject to the standard of palpable and overriding error. No such error exists in the instant case. As de jure control is an essential element of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the key question is whether Matco acquired de jure control of Deans Knight and the relationship between Matco and Deans Knight is the proper focus of the abuse analysis. The Tax Court\u2019s decision was based on a combination of findings of fact and an interpretation of the investment agreement that is supported by the evidence. There is no reviewable error in the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that Matco did not acquire \u201ceffective\u201d control of Deans Knight. At no point did Matco own or have a right to own enough shares to reach a majority shareholder position. The investment agreement is of no relevance as to whether Matco acquired de jure control. It did not give Matco control over Newco\u2019s sale of the shares remaining after Matco converted the debenture or require that Matco present a sale opportunity for those shares. Parliament\u2019s test for control is squarely focused on voting rights arising from ownership. The right to dividends is irrelevant. The only relevant incidence of ownership is voting power, something that the investment agreement did not take away. The Tax Court made a specific credibility finding on the point that Deans Knight remained a free actor throughout the transactions. Mischaracterization of s. 111(5) did not taint this important credibility finding. Matco did not acquire Deans Knight in any practical sense. Matco was only a facilitator of the transactions and did not use Deans Knight\u2019s non\u2011capital losses for its own benefit. The existence of abusive tax avoidance is, at best, unclear and the benefit of the doubt should go to the taxpayer.\nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\nDistinguished: Canada v.

Overview\n[1] This tax appeal raises the issue of the application of the general anti-avoidance rule (the \u201cGAAR \u201d) to transactions undertaken by the appellant, Deans Knight Income Corporation, to monetize non-capital losses and other deductions.\n[2] Under the Income Tax Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp .) (the \u201cAct \u201d), a taxpayer\u2019s tax burden is normally calculated based on the income and losses from that taxation year (s. 2). However, the Act allows non-capital losses to be carried back 3 years or carried forward 20 years in order to offset income in those years (s. 111(1)(a)). This ability to carry over losses is limited: one such limit is that, if control of the corporation has been acquired, non-capital losses from before the acquisition cannot be carried over, unless the corporation continues the same or similar business that incurred the losses (s. 111(5)). An acquisition of control occurs where a person or group of persons acquires de jure control, which generally involves acquiring sufficient share ownership to elect a majority of the board of directors (Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795). It is also deemed to occur when a taxpayer acquires a right to acquire such shares if the purpose is to avoid the application of the loss carryover restriction (ss. 256(8) and 251(5)(b); see Appendix).\n[3] The appellant sought to take advantage of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) without triggering the restriction in s. 111(5). Although the transactions in this appeal will be explained in detail in the following section, a brief summary is warranted. Prior to the transactions at issue, the appellant was a struggling Canadian corporation that had approximately $90 million of unused non-capital losses, scientific research and development tax expenditures (\u201cSR&ED\u201d expenditures), and investment tax credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d). Given that it was in financial difficulty, it did not have income which its past losses could offset. It sought to monetize their value and entered into an agreement with a venture capital company, Matco Capital Ltd. (\u201cMatco\u201d), in order to do so. A complex arrangement was devised involving the following key transactions. First, all of the appellant\u2019s assets and liabilities would be moved into its newly created parent company. Second, Matco would obtain a debenture which could be converted into shares of the appellant, and the appellant\u2019s parent company was promised that it would receive at least a guaranteed amount for the sale of its remaining shares. Third, Matco would find a new business venture for the appellant, which would be used to raise money through an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d). The profits from this venture could be sheltered by the Tax Attributes the appellant originally could not utilize. The arrangement went according to plan. For the 2009 to 2012 tax years, the appellant deducted a majority of its Tax Attributes to reduce its tax liability. However, the Minister of National Revenue reassessed and denied these deductions.\n[4] Before this Court, the parties accept that the appellant complied with the text of the Act . In other words, the parties agree that there was no \u201cacquisition of control\u201d and that, therefore, the loss carryover restriction in s. 111(5) did not apply. The central issue in this appeal is whether s. 245 of the Act , known as the general anti-avoidance rule or the GAAR , applies to deny the deductions. The GAAR operates to deny tax benefits flowing from transactions that comply with the literal text of the Act but nevertheless constitute abusive tax avoidance. For the GAAR to apply to a transaction, three elements found in s. 245 must be met: (1) there must be a \u201ctax benefit\u201d; (2) the transaction must be an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d, meaning one that is not undertaken primarily for a bona fide non-tax purpose; and (3) the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit must be an \u201cabuse\u201d of the provisions of the Act (or associated enactments).\n[5] The Tax Court found that the transactions were tax avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit, but concluded that they were not abusive. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the transactions were abusive, such that the GAAR applied to deny the tax benefits. I note that the parties and the lower courts focused on the non-capital loss deductions since the SR&ED and ITC provisions function similarly. As was the case in the Federal Court of Appeal, the only issue on appeal is whether the appellant\u2019s series of transactions resulted in abusive tax avoidance.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. The transactions were abusive. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Through a complex series of transactions, the appellant underwent a fundamental transformation that achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the text of s. 111(5). The result of the transactions thereby frustrated the provision\u2019s rationale. Since the GAAR applies to deny the tax benefits, the Minister\u2019s reassessments must be restored.\nII. Facts\n[7] Before the transactions at issue in this appeal, the appellant carried on a drug research and nutritional food additive business under the name Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. Its shares were publicly listed on the NASDAQ and TSX. In 2007, the appellant\u2019s business was struggling and it faced a potential delisting of its shares from the NASDAQ because the bid price for its common stock had fallen below the minimum price required by the exchange. At a meeting of the appellant\u2019s board of directors in May 2007, then-CFO David Goold reported on a method of realizing the value of its accumulated Tax Attributes in the form of non-capital losses, SR&ED tax expenditures and ITCs. These unused Tax Attributes had accumulated to nearly $90 million by the end of 2007. Goold told the board that a reorganization of the company, followed by a takeover by another company, would allow the Tax Attributes to be monetized for between 4 and 4.5 cents on the dollar for a total of between $3.5 million and $4 million. It was unlikely that the appellant would be able to use the Tax Attributes on its own at any point; indeed, by November 2007, it had only six months of cash flow left.\n[8] The appellant entered negotiations with Matco and signed a letter of intent in November 2007. However, the venture that Matco had wanted to offset with the appellant\u2019s Tax Attributes fell apart and in December 2007, Matco informed the appellant that it would not be proceeding with the agreement.\n[9] In early 2008, the appellant reorganized and restructured by way of a court-approved Plan of Arrangement. The board of directors had determined that this was the best way of maintaining compliance with the NASDAQ\u2019s minimum bid price listing standard while facilitating a future monetization of its Tax Attributes. A new company, 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (\u201cNewco\u201d), was incorporated, and all outstanding common shares, options and warrants of the appellant were exchanged for common shares and warrants of Newco on an 8:1 basis. The appellant thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco. Newco\u2019s shares began to be traded on the NASDAQ in substitution for the shares of the appellant.\n[10] On March 4, 2008, the appellant and Matco entered into a second letter of intent. On March 19, 2008, the appellant entered into an investment agreement with Newco and Matco (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d).\n[11] Under the Investment Agreement, Newco would receive roughly $3.8 million in the following manner. First, Matco purchased a convertible debenture for $3 million, subject to adjustments (ss. 2.2 and 2.3 of the Investment Agreement, reproduced in A.R., vol. II, at p. 86). The debenture would be convertible into 35 percent of the voting shares and 100 percent of the non-voting shares that Newco held in the appellant (i.e., 79 percent of the equity shares in the appellant). Second, Matco guaranteed that Newco would be able to sell its remaining shares in the appellant for a minimum of $800,000 (the \u201cGuaranteed Amount\u201d), subject to adjustments (s. 5.5). The remaining shares represented a majority (65 percent) of the voting shares of the appellant. Newco was not obliged to sell its shares to Matco. If an opportunity for Newco to sell its remaining shares did not present itself during the relevant period, then Matco would still be required to pay the Guaranteed Amount.\n[12] The appellant was to be reorganized: its assets, liabilities and the amount paid by Matco for the convertible debenture would be transferred to Newco (s. 3.2). Newco would also use its best efforts to ensure that the only three directors of the appellant would be Charles Butt (President and CEO of the appellant), Goold and a representative selected by Matco. Butt and Goold would resign following the acceptance of a corporate opportunity (s. 3.4).\n[13] Matco would have one year to present this corporate opportunity \u2014 a business opportunity that would be suitable for the appellant to commence, involving a new business and likely a new management team. This would be the business that would generate profits against which the Tax Attributes would be deducted. Newco could accept or refuse the corporate opportunity within a short timeframe (s. 4.1), but if it refused, Matco would be relieved from paying the Guaranteed Amount (s. 5.5(d)).\n[14] If an acquisition of control of the appellant or Newco occurred, then Matco would be relieved from paying the Guaranteed Amount, and Newco would be required to repurchase the convertible debenture from Matco and to pay an additional $1 million to Matco (s. 5.5(f)). Moreover, other than when acting pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Newco and the appellant could not engage in the following activities without the consent of Matco (s. 6.1):\n- issue any shares, options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights of any kind to acquire any shares of the appellant,\n- sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or dispose of or agree to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or dispose of any shares of, or any options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights of any kind to acquire any shares of the appellant,\n- change or amend the appellant\u2019s constating documents or by-laws,\n- split, combine or reclassify any outstanding shares of the appellant,\n- redeem or purchase any shares of the appellant,\n- reorganize, amalgamate or merge the appellant,\n- take any action or make any commitment with respect to, or in contemplation of, any complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the appellant,\n- declare and\/or pay dividends or reduce the capital of the appellant,\n- take any action that would or may give rise to a change of control of Newco or the appellant, other than in specific circumstances contemplated in the Investment Agreement,\n- enter into, assign, terminate or amend any contract or agreement in respect of the appellant,\n- create any encumbrance on any of the assets of the appellant,\n- in respect of the appellant, create, incur, guarantee, or assume any indebtedness for borrowed money or otherwise become liable or responsible for the obligations of any other person,\n- in respect of the appellant, make any loans, advances, or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other person,\n- change in any respect any of the accounting principles or practices used by Newco or the appellant, except for any change required by reason of a concurrent change in policy, and\n- engage in any activity other than examining and pursuing the corporate opportunity.\n[15] Before the Investment Agreement was executed, the managing director of Matco, Alan Ross, purchased 100 shares of the appellant from Newco through his wholly owned holding company, 1250280 Alberta Ltd. One of the purposes for this was to ensure that the Investment Agreement would not constitute a unanimous shareholder agreement.\n[16] The Investment Agreement was executed on May 9, 2008. Pursuant to the agreement, the appellant\u2019s assets and liabilities were transferred to Newco in exchange for a promissory note, which the appellant transferred to another subsidiary of Newco; Matco subscribed for the convertible debenture in the amount of nearly $3 million, which the appellant transferred to the other subsidiary. As planned, all of the appellant\u2019s directors resigned except Butt, and Goold and Ross were elected directors.\n[17] Matco sought to find a business that could use the appellant\u2019s Tax Attributes. In December 2008, Matco presented the appellant with a corporate opportunity pursuant to the Investment Agreement. Deans Knight Capital Management (\u201cDKCM\u201d), a mutual fund management company, was interested in investing in high-yield debt instruments, which were selling at low prices because of the 2008 financial crisis. DKCM planned to raise money for the investments through an IPO. Matco proposed that DKCM would use the appellant as the corporate vehicle for the intended IPO, rather than incorporating a new company, because the appellant\u2019s Tax Attributes would shelter the majority of the portfolio income and capital gains.\n[18] The appellant\u2019s board of directors discussed the proposal, did some investigation into DKCM, and approved the proposal. In December 2008, DKCM and the appellant entered into a letter of intent. The letter specified that the appellant must have at least $95 million in deductible amounts available to be used against income earned by the corporation in Canada. To allow the appellant to be used for DKCM\u2019s business venture, DKCM would be appointed to manage the appellant; 4 of the 5 directors of the appellant would be appointed by DKCM; and the appellant would be used in a $100 million minimum IPO, whose proceeds would be used to purchase corporate debt securities that would generate income and gains that could be sheltered by the Tax Attributes. The IPO would be priced such that the appellant\u2019s existing common shares (which would ultimately be held by Matco following its exercise of the convertible debenture) would be attributed a net asset value of $5 million.\n[19] In February 2009, the appellant\u2019s name was changed to its current name, \u201cDeans Knight Income Corporation\u201d. DKCM\u2019s President became a director of the appellant. In March 2009, Matco\u2019s managing director and four nominees of DKCM were appointed as directors of the appellant, and three officers of DKCM were appointed as officers of the appellant.\n[20] Immediately prior to the IPO, Matco converted its debenture into 35 percent of the appellant\u2019s voting shares and 100 percent of its non-voting shares. Matco also obtained an exception to the post-IPO lock-up period to enable it to purchase the remaining shares from Newco within the time period contemplated under the Investment Agreement.\n[21] The IPO closed on March 18, 2009. Notably, the prospectus indicated that there was a risk that the Canada Revenue Agency could \u201csuccessfully challenge the amount of such tax attributes or their availability to the Company\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 30). A total of 10,036,890 shares were issued at $10 per share, for proceeds of over $100 million. At this valuation, Matco\u2019s shares of the appellant were worth over $4 million.\n[22] In April 2009, Matco, through a related corporation, made an offer to Newco to purchase the remaining shares at the Guaranteed Amount. Though the Guaranteed Amount was a discount to the IPO price, Newco accepted the offer because it needed money for its own operations and because its board believed the share price might decrease before the end of the post-IPO lock-up period.\n[23] The appellant\u2019s investment business succeeded and it paid regular dividends to its shareholders in the first four years of operation. It began to wind up operations in its fifth year, as intended.\n[24] When filing its tax returns for 2009 to 2012 and in computing its income, the appellant claimed Tax Attributes from 2007 and earlier. The appellant deducted nearly $65 million of its Tax Attributes to reduce its tax liability from the debt-securities business.\n[25] The Minister reassessed these taxation years to disallow the claimed losses and expenditures. The appellant objected to the reassessments and appealed to the Tax Court.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. Tax Court of Canada, 2019 TCC 76, [2019] 4 C.T.C. 2001\n[26] At the Tax Court, Paris J. was faced with two issues. The first issue was whether Matco had obtained an option to purchase the majority of the voting shares of the appellant, thereby acquiring control pursuant to ss. 256(8) and 251(5) (b) of the Act . Paris J. concluded that Matco had not obtained such a right, and, accordingly, that there had been no \u201cacquisition of control\u201d triggering the application of s. 111(5). This finding was not challenged on appeal and is therefore not before this Court.\n[27] As for the second issue, the question was whether the GAAR could apply to deny the deduction of the Tax Attributes. This required Paris J. to determine whether there was a series of transactions that resulted in a tax benefit, whether the transactions were primarily for tax avoidance purposes and whether they resulted in an abuse of the provisions of the Act . Paris J. chose to focus on the non-capital loss provisions, since the SR&ED and ITC streaming restrictions operated in a similar manner. Applying each step of the GAAR test, Paris J. found that there was a series of transactions that resulted in a reduction of tax. He also concluded that the primary purpose of the Investment Agreement, the restructuring of the appellant and all related transactions was to monetize the Tax Attributes. Consequently, the series of transactions could be characterized as avoidance transactions. However, Paris J. concluded that the transactions were not abusive because they did not frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the Act .\n[28] First, Paris J. considered the object, spirit and purpose of ss. 111(1)(a), 111(5) and 256(8). Regarding s. 111(1)(a), he concluded that the object, spirit and purpose was to \u201cprovide relief to taxpayers who have suffered losses, given that the government, through income tax, shares in the income of a taxpayer\u201d (para. 99).\n[29] As for s. 111(5), Paris J. wrote that the acquisition of control test was the \u201cmeans by which Parliament has determined that a loss has notionally been transferred to an unrelated party\u201d (para. 103). He indicated that the notion of control was central to the working of s. 111(5) and that it has long been held to mean de jure control. He also considered the history of s. 111(5) and acknowledged that Parliament introduced provisions that deem de jure control to exist or not exist in some circumstances, thereby allowing the Minister to look \u201cbeyond the share registry of the corporation to determine who in substance has control\u201d (paras. 111 and 115). However, he noted that the de facto control test in s. 256(5.1) was not adopted. Paris J. moved to the purpose of s. 111(5) and found it to be \u201cclear that subsection 111(5) was enacted to prevent tax loss trading. The restriction on the use of losses is subject to limited exceptions relating to the rehabilitation of the loss business and to the transfer of losses between corporations under common control\u201d (para. 126). He recognized that the underlying rationale for the choice to deny loss carryovers is that \u201cafter the acquisition of control, the corporation can be likened to a new taxpayer because it has different shareholders\u201d (para. 128). He also indicated that the acquisition of control test served as a reasonable marker between \u201csituations where the corporation is a free actor in a transaction and when it is only a passive participant whose actions can be manipulated by a new person or group of persons in order to utilize the losses or Tax Attributes of the corporation for their own benefit\u201d (para. 134).\n[30] Based on this analysis, Paris J. concluded that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was to \u201ctarget manipulation of losses of a corporation by a new person or group of persons, through effective control over the corporation\u2019s actions\u201d (para. 134). He also briefly considered the object, spirit and purpose of s. 256(8) and found that it was to \u201cprevent a taxpayer from circumventing the listed avoidance provisions by acquiring control over shares or share voting rights in order to achieve effective control of the corporation\u201d (para. 138).\n[31] Turning to whether the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions were frustrated by the avoidance transactions, Paris J. framed the question as \u201cwhether despite there being no actual acquisition of de jure control by Matco, Matco acquired effective control of the Appellant such that the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 111(5) and the related tax attribute streaming restrictions was circumvented\u201d (para. 144). The judge rejected the argument that a change of management, business activity, assets and liabilities, and name were relevant to determining whether Matco gained effective control. He thereafter focused on whether Matco had effective control over the majority of the voting shares of the appellant prior to the IPO and answered in the negative. He determined that \u201c[t]he Appellant participated freely in the transactions that resulted in the use of the Tax Attributes against the investment business income\u201d (para. 152).\n[32] Nor did Paris J. accept that the transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 256(8) of the Act . He rejected the Crown\u2019s submission that Matco had effective control over the remaining shares of the appellant held by Newco: Newco could have sold the shares without Matco\u2019s consent; the Investment Agreement did not provide that only Matco could present an opportunity for Newco to sell its remaining shares; and the restrictions placed on the appellant\u2019s activities did not amount to control over its shares.\n[33] In light of his conclusion that the GAAR did not apply, Paris J. allowed the appeal from the reassessments.\nB. Federal Court of Appeal, 2021 FCA 160, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 731\n[34] Before the Federal Court of Appeal, the only issue in dispute was the third step of the GAAR analysis, namely, whether the avoidance transactions were abusive. Woods J.A., writing for a unanimous court, allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal and found that the transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act .\n[35] Woods J.A. agreed with Paris J.\u2019s approach to ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). However, she replaced the term \u201ceffective control\u201d with \u201cactual control\u201d, since the former term had led to confusion. Thus, she determined that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was to \u201crestrict the use of specified losses, including non-capital losses, if a person or group of persons has acquired actual control over the corporation\u2019s actions, whether by way of de jure control or otherwise\u201d (para. 72 (emphasis added)).\n[36] Woods J.A. rejected the argument that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was fully expressed by its text. She noted that the provision was introduced to prohibit trafficking in shares of companies with loss carryovers and that the GAAR itself was, in part, a response to the unintended use of loss carryovers. Moreover, she cited this Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cthe general policy of the Income Tax Act is to prohibit the transfer of losses between taxpayers, subject to specific exceptions\u201d and that \u201c[t]his policy is . . . to be taken into account in determining Parliament\u2019s intent\u201d (para. 81, citing Mathew v. Canada, 2005 SCC 55, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 643, at para. 49). Woods J.A. recognized that her formulation of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) \u201cdoes include forms of de jure and de facto control\u201d but indicated that the actual control test is different from the de facto control test (para. 83).\n[37] Turning to whether the avoidance transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), Woods J.A. concluded that the terms of the Investment Agreement gave Matco actual control over the actions of the appellant, both in general and in approving the corporate opportunity. At a general level, the restrictions in the Investment Agreement resulted in control being handed to Matco. As for approving the corporate opportunity, Woods J.A. remarked that \u201cthere was no realistic chance that a Corporate Opportunity would be rejected\u201d (para. 104) because the Guaranteed Amount would have been forfeited. Although the appellant discussed the proposal and did some investigation before approving it, it was not a free actor: Woods J.A. highlighted that it was a limited investigation to ensure that \u201cthis company was not a fly-by-night operation\u201d (para. 108).\n[38] Woods J.A. concluded that s. 111(5) had been abused. Accordingly, the conditions for the application of the GAAR were met and the tax benefit should be denied. As a result, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Tax Court.\nIV. Issues\n[39] Only the third step of the GAAR analysis is challenged before this Court. The issues can therefore be stated as follows:\n(1) Did the Federal Court of Appeal err in its articulation of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act ?\n(2) Did the Federal Court of Appeal err in concluding that the avoidance transactions were abusive?\nV. Analysis\nA. Background to the General Anti-Avoidance Rule\n[40] The present appeal is not the first time this Court has considered the GAAR . A review of its origins and role within the Act nonetheless provides useful background.\n[41] In 1988, Parliament enacted the GAAR in s. 245 of the Act , partially in response to this Court\u2019s decision in Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 536. In Stubart, this Court rejected a literal approach to interpreting the Act . At the same time, it also rejected an interpretation of a precursor to the GAAR that would have required transactions to have a bona fide business purpose. Instead, it offered guidelines to limit unacceptable tax avoidance arrangements. Parliament viewed the decision in Stubart as an inadequate approach to the problem of tax avoidance (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 14).\n[42] Moreover, abusive tax avoidance had become a problem of significant concern for Parliament. Taxpayers, aided by expert advice, increasingly devised complex legal transactions to avoid tax in ways unintended by Parliament. Once the avoidance mechanisms relied on became evident, either from advance ruling requests or tax assessments, Parliament would react to \u201cplug\u201d the loopholes in the Act to prevent future use. The problem was that increasingly convoluted rules were vulnerable, creating new loopholes to exploit. This Court described this cycle in Stubart as \u201cthe action and reaction endlessly produced by complex, specific tax measures aimed at sophisticated business practices, and the inevitable, professionally-guided and equally specialized taxpayer reaction\u201d (p. 580; see also D. A. Dodge, \u201cA New and More Coherent Approach to Tax Avoidance\u201d (1988), 36 Can. Tax J. 1, at p. 4). As this \u201ccycle of action and reaction\u201d between creative tax planners and Parliament continued, the Act grew in size and complexity (Department of Finance, Guidelines for Tax Reform in Canada (1986), at p. 7).\n[43] Despite these efforts, Parliament was unable to curb the proliferation of tax avoidance schemes. Corporate tax revenues in 1985-86 \u201cwere $1.2 billion lower than the initial budgetary forecasts\u201d, a shortfall which \u201cwas considered to be caused largely by the unexpected application of loss carryforwards\u201d (Dodge, at p. 3; see also W. J. Strain, D. A. Dodge and V. Peters, \u201cTax Simplification: The Elusive Goal\u201d, in Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 4:1, at pp. 4:43 and 4:52\u201153).\n[44] The GAAR was Parliament\u2019s chosen mechanism to interrupt this cycle. In the 1987 White Paper on Tax Reform, the government recognized that specific anti-avoidance rules are \u201cnot always desirable\u201d because they \u201cmake the tax system more complex; they sometimes create additional unintended loopholes, and they do not deal with transactions completed before the amendments become effective\u201d (see Department of Finance, The White Paper: Tax Reform 1987 (1987), at p. 57; see also B. J. Arnold and J. R. Wilson, \u201cThe General Anti-Avoidance Rule \u2014 Part 2\u201d (1988), 36 Can. Tax J. 1123, at p. 1140). A new general anti-avoidance rule was meant to overcome some of these disadvantages. The novel approach found within the GAAR explains why, upon its enactment, Parliament was able to remove certain specific anti-avoidance rules that it felt were sufficiently addressed by a general rule (White Paper, at p. 57; Triad Gestco Ltd. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 258, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 199, at paras. 52\u201153; Department of Finance, Tax Reform 1987: Income Tax Reform (1987), at p. 129; Dodge, at p. 8; Department of Finance, Modernizing and Strengthening the General Anti-Avoidance Rule: Consultation Paper, 2022 (online), at pp. 16 and 19-20; see also Arnold and Wilson, at p. 1148).\n[45] In light of the foregoing, the GAAR is best understood as a way to overcome the disadvantages of a system based solely on specific rules (White Paper, at p. 57; Dodge, at p. 8). The GAAR was a choice, made by Parliament, to complement its specific anti-avoidance efforts with the enactment of a general rule. To achieve this aim, the GAAR \u201cdraws a line between legitimate tax minimization and abusive tax avoidance\u201d (Trustco, at para. 16). Abusive tax avoidance can involve unforeseen tax strategies (Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 80). For example, in Alta Energy, this Court treated evidence of Parliament\u2019s knowledge and acceptance of the tax strategy at issue as a relevant consideration when ascertaining its intent. However, the GAAR is not limited to unforeseen situations; as this Court has explained, it is designed to capture situations that undermine the integrity of the tax system by frustrating the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions relied on by the taxpayer (Lipson v. Canada, 2009 SCC 1, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 2; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2011 SCC 63, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 721, at paras. 71-72; see also The Gladwin Realty Corporation v. The Queen, 2020 FCA 142, [2020] 6 C.T.C. 185, at para. 85; D. G. Duff, \u201cGeneral Anti-Avoidance Rules Revisited: Reflections on Tim Edgar\u2019s \u2018Building a Better GAAR\u2019\u201d (2020), 68 Can. Tax J. 579, at p. 591).\nB. The Relationship Between the GAAR, the Duke of Westminster Principle and Uncertainty\n[46] The GAAR must also be understood in light of its relationship to the Duke of Westminster principle. In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), Lord Tomlin recognized the foundational principle that \u201c[e]very man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be\u201d (p. 19). The principle that taxpayers can order their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable has been affirmed by this Court on numerous occasions (see, e.g., Stubart, at p. 552; Trustco, at para. 11; Copthorne, at para. 65).\n[47] The Duke of Westminster principle, however, has \u201cnever been absolute\u201d (Lipson, at para. 21) and it is open to Parliament to derogate from it. Parliament has done so through the GAAR . The GAAR does not displace the Duke of Westminster principle for legitimate tax planning. Rather, it recognizes a difference between legitimate tax planning \u2014 which represents the vast majority of transactions and remains unaffected, consistent with the Duke of Westminster principle \u2014 and tax planning that operates to abuse the rules of the tax system \u2014 in which case the integrity of the tax system is preserved by denying the tax benefit, notwithstanding the transactions\u2019 compliance with the provisions relied upon. Even where the purpose of a transaction is to minimize tax, taxpayers are allowed to carry it out unless it results in an abuse of the provisions of the Act (Lipson, at para. 25). Where the transaction is shown to be abusive, the Duke of Westminster principle is \u201cattenuated\u201d by the GAAR (Trustco, at para. 13).\n[48] In establishing a general anti-avoidance rule that operated to deny tax benefits on a case-specific basis, Parliament was cognizant of the GAAR \u2019s implications for the level of certainty in tax planning. Parliament sought to balance \u201cthe protection of the tax base and the need for certainty for taxpayers\u201d (Department of Finance, Explanatory Notes to Legislation Relating to Income Tax (1988), at p. 461). The GAAR was enacted to be \u201ca provision of last resort\u201d to address abusive tax avoidance only and was therefore not designed to create more generalized uncertainty in tax planning (Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). Some uncertainty is unavoidable when a general rule is adopted (Dodge, at p. 21; Copthorne, at para. 123). However, a reasonable degree of certainty is achieved by the balance struck within the GAAR itself.\n[49] First, as Professor Jinyan Li noted, \u201cthe GAAR cases generally involve situations that do not concern the majority of taxpayers, and the transactions are well planned and executed on the basis of professional tax advice\u201d (\u201c\u2018Economic Substance\u2019: Drawing the Line Between Legitimate Tax Minimization and Abusive Tax Avoidance\u201d (2006), 54 Can. Tax J. 23, at p. 40). The GAAR only scrutinizes transactions motivated by tax avoidance, and even a tax-motivated transaction that is consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the Act is unaffected by the GAAR (see Explanatory Notes, at p. 461). By virtue of the rigorous analysis required by s. 245 , the GAAR only affects a small subset of transactions, largely conducted by sophisticated parties with the ability to properly evaluate the risks inherent in a GAAR reassessment. Indeed, this is precisely what occurred in the present case: the prospectus relating to the appellant\u2019s IPO expressly recognized the risk of a successful challenge to the use of the Tax Attributes.\n[50] Second, a proper application of the GAAR methodology serves to ensure reasonable certainty in tax planning (P. Samtani and J. Kutyan, \u201cGAAR Revisited: From Instinctive Reaction to Intellectual Rigour\u201d (2014), 62 Can. Tax J. 401, at p. 403). The GAAR is not a tool to sanction conduct that courts find immoral (Copthorne, at para. 65; Alta Energy, at para. 48). Rather, courts must conduct an \u201cobjective, thorough and step-by-step analysis\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 68). Within this analysis, the principles of certainty, predictability and fairness do not play an independent role; rather, they are reflected in the carefully calibrated test that Parliament crafted in s. 245 of the Act and in its interpretation by this Court. It is to this test that I now turn.\nC. Applying the GAAR\n[51] As Rothstein J. wrote in Copthorne, \u201c[i]t is relatively straightforward to set out the GAAR scheme. It is much more difficult to apply it\u201d (para. 32). This is because the GAAR confers upon courts the \u201cunusual duty of going behind the words of the legislation\u201d (para. 66). While the duty imposed by the GAAR is unusual, the analysis involves a structured, three-step test that has been the subject of thorough guidance by this Court. In order for the GAAR to apply, the following questions must be asked (para. 33, citing Trustco, at paras. 18, 21 and 36):\n1. Was there a tax benefit? . . .\n2. Was the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit an avoidance transaction? . . .\n3. Was the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit abusive?\n[52] The taxpayer bears the burden of refuting the Minister\u2019s assumption of the existence of a tax benefit (Copthorne, at para. 34; Trustco, at para. 63) and the burden of proving the existence of a bona fide non-tax purpose (Copthorne, at para. 63; Trustco, at para. 66). In contrast, at the third step, the Minister bears the burden of proving that the avoidance transaction results in an abuse (Lipson, at para. 21).\n(1) Tax Benefit\n[53] The first step in the GAAR analysis is to determine whether a tax benefit arises from a transaction or a series of transactions (s. 245(2) of the Act ; Trustco, at para. 18). A tax benefit is defined as a \u201creduction, avoidance or deferral of tax\u201d or \u201can increase in a refund of tax or other amount\u201d paid under the Act (s. 245(1) of the Act ). The existence of a tax benefit may be clear on the face of the transactions; it is also appropriate to have regard to alternative arrangements that \u201cmight reasonably have been carried out but for the existence of the tax benefit\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 35, citing D. G. Duff et al., Canadian Income Tax Law (3rd ed. 2009), at p. 187).\n(2) Avoidance Transaction\n[54] The second step in the GAAR analysis is to determine whether the transaction or series of transactions was made primarily for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit (s. 245(3) of the Act ; Trustco, at paras. 17, 21 and 66). This requirement removes the majority of transactions from the ambit of the GAAR , including those that are made for family and investment purposes (Trustco, at paras. 21 and 33). A transaction may have both tax and non-tax purposes; in such a case, the taxpayer must satisfy the court that it is reasonable to conclude that the non-tax purpose was primary (paras. 27 and 29).\n[55] Moreover, in a series of transactions, if at least one transaction in the series is an avoidance transaction, the second step has been satisfied (Copthorne, at para. 64). As explained in Trustco, a series of transactions involves transactions that are \u201c\u2018pre\u2011ordained in order to produce a given result\u2019 with \u2018no practical likelihood that the pre-planned events would not take place in the order ordained\u2019\u201d (para. 25, citing Craven v. White, [1989] A.C. 398 (H.L.), at p. 514, per Lord Oliver). A series of transactions also includes \u201crelated transactions or events . . . in contemplation of the series\u201d (s. 248(10)), which refers to transactions or events before or after the series which were undertaken \u201c\u2018in relation to\u2019 or \u2018because of\u2019 the series\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 46, citing Trustco, at para. 26).\n(3) Abusive Tax Avoidance\n[56] The third step of the GAAR analysis is frequently the most contentious. Indeed, it is the only step at issue in the present appeal. Analyzing whether the transactions are abusive involves, first, determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions and, second, determining whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose (Trustco, at para. 44; Copthorne, at paras. 69\u201171).\n[57] The object, spirit and purpose reflects the rationale of the provision. The provision\u2019s text, context and purpose help to shed light on this rationale. Once the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis focuses on whether the result of the transactions frustrates the provision\u2019s rationale. I provide guidance on these aspects below.\n(a) The Object, Spirit and Purpose Reflects the Rationale of the Provision\n[58] To determine whether a transaction is abusive, courts must identify the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions alleged to have been abused, with reference to the provisions themselves, the scheme of the Act and permissible extrinsic aids (Trustco, at para. 55). The object, spirit and purpose of the provisions has been referred to as the \u201clegislative rationale that underlies specific or interrelated provisions of the Act \u201d (Copthorne, at para. 69, citing V. Krishna, The Fundamentals of Income Tax Law (2009), at p. 818).\n[59] At this juncture, it is critical to distinguish the rationale behind a provision from the means chosen to give that rationale effect within the provision. The drafting process reflects the task of translating government aims into legislative form in order to create intelligible, legally effective rules (see, e.g., Canada, Privy Council Office, Guide to Making Federal Acts and Regulations (2nd ed. 2001), at pp. 122-29). The means selected by drafters and adopted by Parliament are relevant indicia within the broader text, context and purpose analysis, since they may shed light on the rationale underlying the provision. However, the means do not necessarily provide a full answer as to why the provision was adopted (Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 3, at para. 101). This is not to imply that Parliament cannot translate its aims into effective legislation \u2014 quite the opposite: when drafting legal tests, Parliament is seeking to establish a general standard that is most faithful to its objectives from the options which are available and practicable. But even the most carefully drafted provision can be abused, which is why the GAAR exists to protect the provision\u2019s underlying rationale.\n[60] The object, spirit and purpose of a provision must be worded as a description of its rationale (Copthorne, at para. 69). When articulating the object, spirit and purpose of a provision, a court is not repeating the test for the provision, nor is it crafting a new, secondary test that will apply to avoidance transactions. Discerning the object, spirit and purpose does not rewrite the provision; rather, the court merely takes a step back to formulate a concise description of the rationale underlying the provision, against which a textually compliant transaction must be scrutinized (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69).\n[61] For example, for a provision conferring a tax benefit, the rationale might relate to the basis for providing relief to taxpayers in such circumstances or, for targeted relief, the conduct that Parliament sought to encourage. Conversely, for a specific anti-avoidance rule, the rationale might relate to the specific result, or mischief, that Parliament sought to prevent.\n(b) The Provision\u2019s Text, Context and Purpose Are Used to Determine Its Rationale\n[62] Although the GAAR analysis involves a consideration of the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose, the use of these elements differs from \u201ctraditional\u201d statutory interpretation (Copthorne, at para. 70; Alta Energy, at para. 30, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 J., and at para. 116, per Rowe and Martin JJ., dissenting but not on this point; Oxford Properties Group, at paras. 40-44). It must be recalled that the GAAR is a provision of last resort (Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). There is a distinction between the application of a provision in general and the application of the GAAR to a transaction motivated by tax avoidance. If a court is performing a GAAR analysis, the impugned transactions necessarily comply with the provisions of the Act , properly interpreted and applied (see Copthorne, at para. 88; D. G. Duff, \u201cThe Interpretive Exercise Under the General Anti-Avoidance Rule\u201d, in B. J. Arnold, ed., The General Anti-Avoidance Rule \u2014 Past, Present, and Future (2021), 383, at p. 391). This is self-evident: if there is a specific provision with which the taxpayer has not complied, the Minister need not resort to the GAAR .\n[63] In traditional statutory interpretation, the court considers a provision\u2019s text, context and purpose to determine what the words of the statute mean. In the GAAR analysis, however, \u201c[t]he search is for the rationale that underlies the words that may not be captured by the bare meaning of the words themselves\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70 (emphasis added); Triad Gestco, at para. 51). The object, spirit and purpose analysis has a precise function: to discern the underlying rationale of the provisions. A consideration of the text, context and purpose gives structure to this analysis. Indeed, the object, spirit and purpose analysis should not turn into a \u201cvalue judgment of what is right or wrong nor . . . what tax law ought to be or ought to do\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70). Nor should it become a \u201csearch for an overriding policy of the Act \u201d that is not founded in the text, context and purpose of the provisions (Canada Trustco, at para. 41; Alta Energy, at para. 49). Rather, a focus on the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose ensures that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence used to discern a provision\u2019s rationale remains tied to the provision itself. To that end, a brief discussion on how to conduct this analysis is useful.\n[64] The text of the provision is relevant to the analysis of a provision\u2019s object, spirit and purpose (Alta Energy, at para. 58). Bearing in mind the search for the provision\u2019s underlying rationale, courts may ask how the text sheds light on what the provision was designed to achieve. Put differently, what was the provision intended to do? (Copthorne, at para. 88). This includes considering what the text of the provision expressly permits or restricts. Similarly, the language and structure of the provision can sometimes be evocative of Parliament\u2019s underlying concerns. The text can also help to identify the nature (or \u201ctype\u201d) of provision at issue, which can be relevant to understanding the rationale underlying it.\n[65] There may be circumstances where the provision\u2019s underlying rationale is no broader than its text because, having regard to its context and purpose, the provision\u2019s text \u201cfully explains its underlying rationale\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 110). A court, however, must not lose sight of the goal of the exercise \u2014 to discern the underlying rationale of the provision \u2014 and the reality that this rationale \u201cmay not be captured by the bare meaning of the words themselves\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70). As explained by No\u00ebl C.J. of the Federal Court of Appeal, \u201c[w]hile one cannot rule out the possibility that the underlying rationale for a provision will be fully captured by the words, this must still be demonstrated by inquiring into the provision\u2019s reason for being\u201d (Oxford Properties Group, at para. 88, citing Copthorne, at paras. 110-11).\n[66] Beyond the provision\u2019s text, a court must consider the provision\u2019s context. The contextual analysis \u201cinvolves an examination of other sections of the Act , as well as permissible extrinsic aids\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 91; Trustco, at para. 55). Of course, this does not involve considering every other section of the Act . Rather, \u201crelevant provisions are related \u2018because they are grouped together\u2019 or because they \u2018work together to give effect to a plausible and coherent plan\u2019\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 91, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 361 and 364).\n[67] The focus is on the relationship between the provision alleged to have been abused and the particular scheme within which it operates (Triad Gestco, at paras. 26 et seq.). Although the Act is lengthy and detailed, an understanding of its structure can help to identify the function of the provision at issue. For example, a specific restriction may shed light on the rationale of a general benefit-conferring rule, and vice versa.\n[68] Finally, understanding the provision\u2019s purpose is central to the GAAR analysis. A purposive analysis permits courts to consider legislative history and extrinsic evidence (see R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at \u00a7 9.03, at paras. 7-8). These materials provide insight into the rationale for specific provisions. Of course, tax provisions can serve a variety of independent and interlocking purposes (Trustco, at para. 53). Nevertheless, such provisions are intended to promote particular aims, and courts must therefore determine what outcome Parliament sought to achieve through the specific provision or provisions (Copthorne, at para. 113).\n(c) The Abuse Analysis Focuses on Whether the Result of the Transactions Frustrates the Provision\u2019s Object, Spirit and Purpose\n[69] At the abuse stage, the avoidance transactions will be abusive where the outcome or result of the avoidance transaction \u201c(a) is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; (b) defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions relied on; or (c) circumvents certain provisions in a manner that frustrates the object, spirit and purpose of those provisions\u201d (Lipson, at para. 40, citing Trustco, at para. 45). These considerations are not independent of one another and frequently overlap (Copthorne, at para. 72). Ultimately, the analysis remains squarely focused on abuse. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction \u201cmust be clear\u201d (Trustco, at paras. 62 and 66; Copthorne, at para. 68; Alta Energy, at para. 33).\n[70] This Court\u2019s jurisprudence sheds light on the types of circumstances that rise to the level of abuse. For example, if the rationale underlying the provision is to encourage particular relationships or activities, abusive tax avoidance may be found where the relationships and transactions are \u201cwholly dissimilar to the relationships or transactions that are contemplated by the provisions\u201d, as was the case in Mathew (para. 57, citing Trustco, at para. 60). Similarly, where a specific anti-avoidance rule is flipped on its head to enable tax avoidance, there is likely to be a finding of abuse, as was the case in Lipson (para. 42; see also Fiducie Financi\u00e8re Satoma v. The Queen, 2018 FCA 74, 2018 D.T.C. 5052, at para. 52). An abuse may also be found in certain circumstances where a series of transactions \u201cachieved a result the section was intended to prevent\u201d while narrowly avoiding application of the provision, as in Copthorne (paras. 124-27). These examples are not exhaustive, but provide useful guidance on how the object, spirit and purpose of different types of tax provisions can be frustrated.\n[71] Importantly, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule. Thus, I do not agree with the appellant\u2019s submission that where Parliament has legislated with precision, as here, where loss carryovers are denied in specific instances, the GAAR is not meant to play a role. Of course, the GAAR will not apply in all circumstances \u2014 the analysis is inherently case specific. Further, the way a provision has been drafted is important within the text, context and purpose analysis, since it may shed light on the conduct that Parliament sought to target and how it went about doing so. But the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s. 245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules were being circumvented through abusive tax planning, and that such rules are among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions (J. Li, \u201cThe Misuse or Abuse Exception: The Role of Economic Substance\u201d, in Arnold, The General Anti-Avoidance Rule, 295, at pp. 299, fn. 25, and p. 316).\n[72] The appellant\u2019s position also runs contrary to this Court\u2019s jurisprudence. As the majority recognized in Alta Energy, \u201c[a]busive tax avoidance can also occur when an arrangement \u2018circumvents the application of certain provisions, such as specific anti\u2011avoidance rules, in a manner that frustrates or defeats the object, spirit or purpose of those provisions\u2019\u201d (para. 32 (emphasis added), citing Trustco, at para. 45). Moreover, this Court in Copthorne largely rejected the argument that where Parliament has drafted detailed provisions, then a taxpayer that has technically complied with these provisions cannot frustrate their rationale (paras. 108-11). Simply put, specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse. As with any other provision, the GAAR ensures that the rationale behind such provisions is not frustrated by abusive tax strategies.\n(d) Summary\n[73] In summary, at the third stage of the GAAR analysis:\n- The object, spirit and purpose is a description of the provision\u2019s underlying rationale. The means (the how) do not always provide a full answer as to the rationale underlying the provision (the why).\n- The text, context and purpose of a provision provide indicia of its rationale. The text can shed light on what the provision was designed to encourage or prevent based on what it expressly permits or restricts, how it is worded and structured, and the nature of the provision. Similarly, the context can serve to identify the function of the provision within a coherent scheme. Finally, the provision\u2019s purpose can help to discern the outcomes that Parliament sought to achieve or prevent.\n- Once the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis goes beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions to consider whether the result frustrates the provision\u2019s rationale.\n[74] Having summarized the proper approach to applying the GAAR in light of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, I now turn to the transactions at issue.\nVI. Application\nA. Which Provisions Are at Issue?\n[75] The parties do not dispute that the transactions complied with the text of the Act . The question is whether the GAAR applies to deny the deductions and uphold the Minister\u2019s reassessments. The appellant did not challenge the Tax Court\u2019s findings that there was a series of transactions that resulted in a tax benefit and that they constituted avoidance transactions. Thus, the only question in dispute is whether they abused certain provisions of the Act (the third stage of the GAAR analysis). This requires, first, ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of a provision and, second, determining whether it has been frustrated. Before proceeding, it is worth determining which provisions should be the focus of the analysis.\n[76] The Minister reassessed the appellant\u2019s claims relating to the deduction of non-capital losses, SR&ED expenditures and ITCs. However, since the restrictions on loss carryovers in each context operate in a similar way, a violation of the GAAR in one case would lead to a similar determination in the others. This is consistent with how the parties argued the case and how it was analyzed by both the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 87; C.A. reasons, at para. 5).\n[77] The courts below focused on three non-capital loss provisions: s. 111(1)(a), which sets out the benefit-conferring rule permitting non-capital loss carryovers; s. 111(5), which denies loss carryovers where the control of the corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, unless a continuity of business exists; and s. 256(8), which deems an acquisition of control to occur where certain share-related rights are obtained. These provisions are interrelated and complement each other, since they exist within a scheme regulating the carryover of non-capital losses. As set out below, an analysis of s. 111(5) is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nB. What Is the Object, Spirit and Purpose of Section 111(5)?\n[78] The first stage of the abuse analysis, ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions, is an extricable question of law, subject to a correctness standard of review (see Alta Energy, at para. 50, citing Trustco, at para. 44; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 8). To assess the underlying rationale of s. 111(5), it is necessary to consider the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose (Copthorne, at para. 70). A review of the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose reveals that Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take control of a corporation and change its business. I would formulate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) as follows: to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. In order to consider how this rationale flows from s. 111(5)\u2019s text, context and purpose, I begin by analyzing the text.\n(1) The Text of the Provision\n[79] Broadly stated, s. 111(5) is a restriction on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to make use of its non-capital losses incurred in another taxation year. At the time of the transactions in issue, the relevant portion of s. 111(5) read as follows:\n(5) Where, at any time, control of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending before that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending after that time and no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending after that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending before that time except that\n(a) such portion of the corporation\u2019s non-capital loss or farm loss, as the case may be, for a taxation year ending before that time as may reasonably be regarded as its loss from carrying on a business and, where a business was carried on by the corporation in that year, such portion of the non-capital loss as may reasonably be regarded as being in respect of an amount deductible under paragraph 110(1)(k) in computing its taxable income for the year is deductible by the corporation for a particular taxation year ending after that time\n(i) only if that business was carried on by the corporation for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit throughout the particular year, and\n(ii) only to the extent of the total of the corporation\u2019s income for the particular year from that business and, where properties were sold, leased, rented or developed or services rendered in the course of carrying on that business before that time, from any other business substantially all the income of which was derived from the sale, leasing, rental or development, as the case may be, of similar properties or the rendering of similar services . . . .\nThree elements of the text warrant consideration: s. 111(5)\u2019s reference to control; its focus on an acquisition by a person or group of persons; and the continuity of business exception. While the text of s. 111(5) has been amended since the transactions in question, the provision still encompasses these core elements, albeit structured differently (see s. 111(5.4)).\n[80] First, the text of s. 111(5) references \u201ccontrol\u201d. While control is not expressly defined within the provision or the Act , this Court concluded in Duha Printers that it refers to de jure control. The general test for de jure control is \u201cwhether the controlling party enjoys, by virtue of its shareholdings, the ability to elect the majority of the board of directors\u201d (Duha Printers, at para. 36; R. Taylor and M.\u2011C. Marcil, \u201cDuha Printers Revisited: Issues Regarding Corporate Control\u201d (2022), 70 Can. Tax J. 495, at pp. 504-7; G. Lord et al., Les principes de l\u2019imposition au Canada (13th ed. 2002), at s. 3.3; Explanatory Notes, at pp. 502-4; at common law, see Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299). The power to select a majority of directors generally means the power to choose those who manage the affairs of the corporation, subject, in particular, to the constating documents or a unanimous shareholder agreement (Duha Printers, at para. 85; see also Canada Business Corporations Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (\u201cCBCA \u201d), ss. 2(3) and 102(1); Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, ss. 1(5) and 115(1); Business Corporations Act, CQLR, c. S-31.1, ss. 2 \u201cto control\u201d and 112; Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, arts. 310, 335 and 336). I will return to the concept of de jure control, in contrast to de facto control, below.\n[81] Second, s. 111(5) does not refer merely to a change in control, but to a situation where control has been \u201cacquired by a person or group of persons\u201d. The provision indicates Parliament\u2019s focus on circumstances in which there is a shift in the locus of control, rather than, for example, high turnover in the shares of a publicly traded company (Silicon Graphics Ltd. v. Canada, 2002 FCA 260, [2003] 1 F.C. 447, at para. 36).\n[82] Third, s. 111(5) creates an exception to the rule it sets out: losses remain deductible if, after an acquisition of control, the corporation engages in the same or a similar business. Thus, the connection to past losses is severed only when control has been acquired and there is a break from the corporation\u2019s past business. The text of s. 111(5) reflects a concern with denying loss carryovers when there is a lack of continuity within the corporation, as measured by both the identity of its controlling shareholders and its business activity.\n[83] The appellant argues that the object, spirit and purpose of the provision is captured by the de jure control test within s. 111(5). In some cases, the object, spirit and purpose may be no broader than the provision itself. However, this is only where the text fully explains the provision\u2019s underlying rationale (Copthorne, at para. 110). To determine whether this is the case for s. 111(5), the analysis must move to the context and purpose of the provision.\n(2) The Context of the Provision\n[84] It would be difficult to understand the role of s. 111(5) within the Act without considering the function it plays in the larger scheme of computing taxable income. Section 111(5) operates as a step within this broader process.\n(a) Section 111(5) Should Be Considered Against the Foundational Principles of the Act\n[85] The roots of the basic income tax system of the Act lie in ss. 2 to 4 (Li (2021), at p. 307). Section 2(1) of the Act provides that income tax shall be paid \u201con the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada\u201d. The Act treats each \u201cperson\u201d as a tax unit; every \u201cperson\u201d, including a corporation, is a separate taxpayer. While this section is general in nature, it reflects the foundational principle that \u201ctaxpayers are to be taxed on their own earnings, and not the earnings of someone else\u201d (Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd., 2018 FCA 166, [2019] 5 C.T.C. 1, at para. 54). Consequently, the effect of s. 111(5) becomes more clear when read in light of s. 2: s. 111(5) suggests that, at a conceptual level, when there has been an acquisition of control, and the corporation\u2019s loss-generating business ceases to operate, the corporation can no longer be understood as the same taxpayer for the purpose of carrying over losses from the corporation\u2019s prior operations.\n(b) Section 111(5) Delineates the Boundaries of the Benefit-Conferring Provision, Section 111(1)(a)\n[86] Section 111(5) operates within a scheme for carrying over non-capital losses. The foundational provisions of the Act recognize that each taxpayer is taxed based on their income and losses within a single taxation year; however, s. 111(1)(a) modifies this general rule and provides that a taxpayer can deduct non-capital losses against income in a future or prior taxation year. It served as the benefit-conferring provision which the appellant relied on to obtain its tax benefits. Without such a loss carryover rule, a taxpayer who earns high income in one year and suffers a loss in the next would face financial hardship as a result of paying tax in the first year without relief in the second (Krishna, at p. 595). The taxpayer with fluctuating income is disadvantaged compared with the taxpayer who engages in a less risky venture, paying tax over time on a more stable income.\n[87] From this perspective, s. 111(5) does not operate independently, but rather serves to complement s. 111(1)(a). There is sound logic behind the ability to carry over one\u2019s losses. However, the specific purpose of s. 111(1)(a) has always been to more accurately measure income and provide relief to the individual taxpayer, accounting for fluctuating income over a period of multiple years. Amendments to this provision have broadened the ability to deduct non-capital losses (see, e.g., S.C. 1958, c. 32, s. 12(1), amending s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148), but never so as to benefit a new taxpayer who did not themselves generate the losses. Only the taxpayer who suffered the loss is entitled to deduct the loss.\n[88] Section 111(5) ensures that this principle is given effect for corporations. While the corporation is still the same legal person after an acquisition of control, the identity of those behind the corporation has changed. Section 111(5) functions so that the tax benefits associated with those losses will not benefit a new shareholder base carrying on a new business.\n[89] This restriction on s. 111(1)(a) promotes consistency with other provisions within the scheme for computing income tax. In particular, s. 249(4) specifies that when an acquisition of control occurs, the corporation\u2019s taxation year is deemed to have ended and a new taxation year commences. Thus, an acquisition of control severs the link between the corporation\u2019s prior and post-acquisition operations. It would be incongruous with several other provisions if the Act nevertheless allowed this corporation to carry forward past losses as if the link had not been severed.\n[90] Thus, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the boundaries of s. 111(1)(a) and to promote consistency with other provisions which treat the corporation as, effectively, a new taxpayer following an acquisition of control (Li (2021), at p. 314; Strain, Dodge and Peters, at pp. 4:52-54).\n(c) Parliament\u2019s Selection of Control Tests Differs Across the Act\n[91] The appellant places significant emphasis on s. 256(5.1) of the Act , which defines the de facto control test. This test was adopted after the introduction of s. 111(5) and while numerous provisions were amended to either adopt or reject the de facto control test, the de jure control test in s. 111(5) was left unchanged. The appellant argues that the use of the de facto control test in other provisions indicates that \u201cParliament turned its mind to the question of control throughout the Act . . . Parliament understood the difference between de facto and de jure control and intended that difference\u201d (A.F., at para. 64 (emphasis in original)). For the appellant, this is effectively determinative of the dispute, and reduces the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) to the de jure control test.\n[92] In my view, the context of the Act reveals that, when faced with a choice between de jure and de facto control as the general test, Parliament opted for de jure control. There are various reasons why Parliament would have chosen the de jure control test as the standard to be used on an application of s. 111(5), something this Court addressed in Duha Printers, at para. 58:\nIn my view, the de jure standard was chosen because in some respects it is a relevant and relatively certain and predictable concept to employ in determining control. In general terms, de jure refers to those legal sources that determine control: namely, the corporation\u2019s governing statute and its constitutional documents, including the articles of incorporation and by-laws. The de facto concept was rejected because it involves ascertaining control in fact, which can lead to a myriad of indicators which may exist apart from these sources. [Emphasis in original.]\n[93] There is no doubt that de jure control is a clearer benchmark than de facto control, meaning greater certainty for the majority of transactions, which are not tax-motivated. De facto control, by contrast, is a broad test that can be met by mere indirect influence, and therefore does not require the existence of legally enforceable rights (s. 256(5.1); Krishna, at p. 695). Such a test would have captured a variety of situations far beyond Parliament\u2019s concern for ensuring that one taxpayer would not benefit from another\u2019s losses. For example, there may exist significant continuity in the corporation\u2019s directors and shareholders, but an onerous loan designed to help a distressed corporation reorient its business could create a relationship of dependence sufficient to trigger the de facto control test, even if the creditor\u2019s influence was never exercised. Thus, when deciding between two imperfect tests, it is logical that Parliament would opt for de jure control.\n[94] However, it does not follow that the provision\u2019s rationale is fully captured by the de jure control test. Rather, de jure control was the marker that offered a roughly appropriate proxy for most circumstances with which Parliament was concerned \u2014 particularly given that the GAAR exists as a last resort. To ascertain the rationale underlying s. 111(5), more is needed than the simple fact that Parliament settled on this test to operationalize its intent.\n[95] Indeed, the rationale of s. 111(5) is illuminated by related provisions which both extend and restrict the circumstances in which an acquisition of control has occurred. These provisions suggest that de jure control is not a perfect reflection or complete explanation of the mischief that Parliament sought to address.\n(d) The Control Test in Section 111(5) Is Expanded and Restricted by Other \u201cDeeming\u201d Provisions\n[96] Section 256(8) deems control to have been acquired when, for the purpose of avoiding certain provisions, a taxpayer obtains a right to, inter alia: acquire shares; cause a corporation to redeem, acquire or cancel shares; acquire or control voting rights; or cause the reduction of other shareholders\u2019 voting rights (see s. 251(5)(b)). If the listed right, when exercised, would provide the taxpayer with de jure control, s. 256(8) deems control to have been acquired when the right was acquired. This subsection is notable because, although it remains focused on share-related rights, it looks beyond the standard documentation considered under the de jure control test. Instead, it assesses legal rights, including contractual agreements. Section 256(8) closes a loophole where corporations could have acquired a contractual right that, if exercised, would have enabled them to exert control over the corporation (Fiscal Statement (1980), at p. 40; G. W. Flynn, \u201cTax Planning for Corporations with Net Capital and Noncapital Losses\u201d, in Corporate Management Tax Conference, Current Developments in Measuring Business Income for Tax Purposes (1982), 208, at p. 209). More broadly, it demonstrates that the de jure control test in s. 111(5) does not, on its own, capture the full range of situations that Parliament sought to target; rather, the test in s. 111(5) is better understood as a rough proxy that seeks to give effect to Parliament\u2019s broader aims, while offering a degree of clarity and stability in most cases.\n[97] By contrast, s. 256(7) deems control not to have been acquired in certain circumstances in order to give proper effect to provisions similar to s. 111(5). For example, it ensures that transfers can occur between related parties without the unused losses being denied due to a \u201ctechnical change in control of the corporation\u201d (A. R. A. Scace and D. S. Ewens, The Income Tax Law of Canada (5th ed. 1983), at p. 106; s. 256(7)(a) and (b)). This suggests that the identity of those who have acquired control matters when determining whether the corporation should be treated as a new taxpayer. In this way, s. 111(5) and related provisions are not merely concerned with a formal change of control: if the corporation has not changed hands, the Act recognizes the continuity between its past losses and future business endeavours. It is only when an unrelated party takes the reins that permitting loss carryovers would undermine the fundamental principles underpinning the Act and the integrity of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a).\n[98] I note that s. 256.1, enacted after the transactions at issue, includes a deeming rule for substantial equity acquisitions. However, consideration of a provision enacted subsequent to the transactions at issue is neither necessary nor warranted in this case (see also Oxford Properties Group, at paras. 46 and 86).\n[99] The foregoing contextual analysis sheds significant light on the rationale behind s. 111(5). However, to more accurately ascertain its object, spirit and purpose, it is necessary to consider extrinsic evidence of Parliament\u2019s purpose throughout the legislative history of the provision.\n(3) The Purpose of the Provision\n[100] The legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliament was concerned with addressing the trading of loss corporations, which was undermining the tax base and creating inequity among taxpayers. This reflects a specific concern that fits within the Act \u2019s more general policy of prohibiting the transfer of losses between taxpayers, subject to specific exceptions (Mathew, at para. 53).\n[101] Importantly, a purposive analysis of s. 111(5) also demonstrates that, while the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns has evolved over time \u2014 finally settling on de jure control \u2014 its rationale for including the non-capital loss carryover restriction in the Act has been consistent.\n[102] The legislative history of s. 111(5) begins in 1958. In 1958, s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148 \u2014 the precursor to s. 111(1)(a) \u2014 was amended \u201cto permit business losses to be applied to reduce income not only from the same business, but also from any other business carried on by the taxpayer\u201d (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:42). This was a significant liberalization of the loss carryover rules; previously, business losses were deductible only against income generated in other years from the same business.\n[103] In the same amendment, s. 27(5) \u2014 the precursor to s. 111(5) \u2014 was added to the Act . This subsection read as follows:\n(5) Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) does not apply to permit a corporation to deduct, for the purpose of computing its taxable income for a taxation year, a business loss sustained by it in a preceding taxation year, in any case where\n(a) more than 50% of the shares in the capital stock of the corporation have, between the end of that preceding year and the end of the taxation year, been acquired by a person or persons who did not, at the end of that preceding year, own any of the shares in the capital stock of the corporation; and\n(b) the corporation was not, during the taxation year, carrying on the business in which the loss was sustained.\n(S.C. 1958, c. 32, s. 12(2))\n[104] Commentary in the Senate explained that without such a restriction, \u201cit would be quite easy to purchase companies that have incurred losses and then get the benefit\u201d of the carryforward (Debates of the Senate, 1st Sess., 24th Parl., August 21, 1958, at pp. 650-51 (Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson)). Put another way, the restriction was enacted \u201cfor the purpose of checking the practice of trading in tax-loss corporations\u201d (H. D. McGurran, \u201cPrinciples of Income Tax: 2. Taxable Income from a Business\u201d (1958), 6 Can. Tax J. 455, at p. 465). At the same time, the restriction on business loss carryovers introduced by s. 27(5) could be avoided if the business in which the loss was sustained continued to be carried on (i.e., a continuity of business exception). Notably, the test Parliament adopted at the time (more than 50 percent of the shares in the corporation\u2019s capital stock, acquired by one or more new shareholders in a single year) was distinct from the current marker (de jure control).\n[105] After s. 27(5) was enacted, commentators were quick to identify problems and loopholes. One author, for example, described how the new carryover restriction could be circumvented with only a bit of foresight:\nIf a prospective buyer had the foresight to acquire a nominal number of shares, or for that matter, one share, before the turn of the fiscal year, then the full amount of the losses would be preserved regardless of what type of business was in future carried on. Perhaps negotiations for the purchase of loss companies are best conducted in the final weeks of their fiscal year.\n(C. W. Leach, \u201cMaking the Most of Your Losses\u201d, in Canadian Tax Papers No. 19, Corporate Management Conference (1960), 27, at p. 29)\n[106] In 1963, s. 27(5)(a) was amended to refer to an acquisition of control of a corporation by a person or persons who did not control the corporation at the end of the preceding year, while still subjecting transactions that predated the amendment to the former test relating to an acquisition of 50 percent of its shares (S.C. 1963, c. 21, ss. 6(1) and (2), substituting s. 27(5)(a) and adding s. 27(5a)). At the Bill\u2019s Second Reading in the House of Commons, then Minister of Finance Walter L. Gordon raised concerns about the trafficking in shares of loss companies:\nThe public, including the business public, tends to lose respect for any tax administration when advantage can be taken freely of obvious loopholes in the law . . . it seems desirable to stop some clear opportunities for tax avoidance, and I should like to mention four examples of what it is intended to do about them.\n. . .\nThe second example that I would like to mention is the one that at present provides an opportunity, under the act, for companies which incur losses in one year to carry them forward and apply them against profits earned during subsequent years.\nAs a result of this, a practice has developed of trafficking in the shares of companies whose businesses have been discontinued, but which technically have certain tax loss carry forward entitlements. For example, a man with a profitable business may purchase the shares of one of these companies and transfer his prosperous business to it, and having done so he can apply the losses incurred previously, and often in a quite different class of business, against the taxable income of his own business. I suggest that surely this was never the intention of parliament when the original proposal was incorporated in the act, and that this practice should be stopped. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 26th Parl., October 16, 1963, at pp. 3636-37 (Hon. Walter L. Gordon))\n[107] The Minister of Finance later made the following statement about the provision\u2019s purpose:\nThe purpose of this clause is to prevent a company with a loss carry forward entitlement from changing hands, thus permitting a new owner to introduce into that business an entirely different business after the date of the budget, and having this entitlement applied against the profits of the new business enterprise. . . .\n. . .\n. . . This will wipe out the loss credit position if there has been a change in ownership. The reason, of course, is obvious. People with profitable businesses who were paying taxes on their profits were making a practice of acquiring companies, often shells which had nothing in them but which were in possession of a loss-carry-forward entitlement, for the purpose of applying this entitlement against their profits and thus avoiding the payment of tax. That is what this clause is intended to prevent. I am prepared to admit that in theory, certainly, if you look upon the corporation which has the entitlement as being a separate entity, it does lose its rights, where its ownership has been transferred to somebody else. However, that is the very thing we are trying to stop. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. V, 1st Sess., 26th Parl., November 1, 1963, at p. 4287 (Hon. Walter L. Gordon))\n[108] In 1966, the Carter Commission examined the Income Tax Act and made a variety of recommendations that were then considered by Parliament in subsequent years. It sought to explain the purpose for the restriction on loss transfers at a conceptual level:\nUnder the present tax system, the new owner of an unincorporated business does not obtain any deduction in respect of unabsorbed losses of the previous owner. The same position arises where assets of an incorporated company with unabsorbed losses are purchased. In each of these cases the purchaser is a different taxpayer from the vendor and is not permitted to utilize the losses of the vendor for tax purposes.\n. . .\nWe have stated our belief that a corporation should be regarded as an intermediary for the shareholders. The proposed liberal allowance of losses is not intended to be used in such a way that one taxpayer can deduct losses sustained by another and thereby defer or avoid tax liability. Accordingly, we recommend that losses should not be transferable from one taxpayer to another, and that the right to carry losses forward should be denied to a corporation where there is a change in control, either through a sale of its shares, through granting a right to acquire a controlling interest (unless the right is exercisable only on death or default of an obligation or under a first refusal arrangement) or through a statutory amalgamation. [Emphasis added.]\n(Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation (1966), vol. 4, at pp. 261-62)\n[109] In 1972, s. 27(5) was renumbered as s. 111(5). It continued to limit carryovers in the case of an acquisition of control and continued to provide a continuity of business exception. The \u201c50% of the shares\u201d test was dropped, and s. 111(5) now referred only to an acquisition of control (S.C. 1970-72, c. 63, s. 1). The carryover restrictions were tightened through subsequent amendments (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:42); however, this has remained the test since.\n[110] The foregoing legislative record demonstrates that, while Parliament has had to \u201credefine terms in order to enforce its intention\u201d (G. W. Riehl, Incorporation and Income Tax in Canada (4th ed., 1965 at p. 69), the provision has always restricted non-capital loss carryovers upon a change in the locus of control of a corporation from one person or group to another, subject to a continuity of business exception. When a corporation changes hands, and the loss business ceases to operate, the corporation is effectively a new taxpayer who cannot avail itself of non-capital losses accumulated by the old taxpayer. The following provides a useful explanation:\nFirst and foremost, the carryover of losses following a change of control is not generally supported in tax policy terms. Normally, one taxpayer cannot avail himself of another taxpayer\u2019s losses. In the case of an artificial entity such as a corporation, when its control changes it is essentially regarded as a new taxpayer, because different shareholders then become entitled indirectly to enjoy the benefits of its financial success. [Emphasis added.]\n(Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:52)\n[111] The business continuity exception does not undermine this conclusion: while this rule may be viewed as arguably benefitting new shareholders, there is a reason for the exception. It encourages \u201cthe recovery of unprofitable enterprises\u201d (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:53), which may require a new investment by new owners. Where this occurs, \u201cthe takeover has accomplished the sound commercial objective of making an unprofitable business profitable, and there is no reason why the unused pre-takeover losses should not continue to be available\u201d (P. W. Hogg, J. E. Magee and T. Cook, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (3rd ed. 1999), at p. 408, cited with approval in OSFC Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 FCA 260, [2002] 2 F.C. 288, at para. 91). Indeed, it suggests that those who have taken the reins were interested in strengthening the corporation\u2019s business, rather than using the corporation as a vessel for unrelated activities that would have distorted its identity. Although the corporation may have changed hands, the link in continuity is preserved through a different marker: the corporation\u2019s business remains consistent. Moreover, the justification for s. 111(1)(a) \u2014 to more accurately measure income and provide relief to an individual taxpayer with fluctuating income over time \u2014 remains applicable, given this continuity. This reinforces that, at its core, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the circumstances in which the basis for the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) is non-existent.\n[112] In sum, the legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliament\u2019s intended purpose was to address a specific mischief. While the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns have evolved over time, the rationale for including the loss carryover restriction in the Act has remained consistent.\n(4) Conclusion on Object, Spirit and Purpose\n[113] In light of the foregoing, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporation\u2019s identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non-capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s. 111(5).\n[114] In articulating the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the Tax Court focused on the concept of \u201ceffective control\u201d (para. 134), a term briefly employed by Iacobucci J. in Duha Printers (para. 36). The Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged that this wording was unclear, and replaced it with the term \u201cactual control\u201d (paras. 72-73). This arguably exacerbated the problem, and led the appellant to argue that the Federal Court of Appeal had substituted Parliament\u2019s de jure control test with an ambiguous de facto control test. The appellant proposed a formulation of the object, spirit and purpose centred on de jure control.\n[115] Respectfully, both the lower courts and the appellant formulated the object, spirit and purpose as a legal test, rather than summarizing the rationale of the provision. This ultimately distorted their GAAR analysis. De jure control, \u201ceffective\u201d control and \u201cactual\u201d control do not indicate why Parliament was concerned about an acquisition of control and the mischief it sought to address (Oxford Properties Group, at para. 101). To define the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) based on Parliament\u2019s choice of test or substitute it for another test would, in this case, result in prioritizing the means (the how) over the rationale (the why).\n[116] In s. 111(5), Parliament has clearly chosen a test for control: de jure control. De jure control was a reasonable marker for the situations in which a corporation\u2019s identity has changed. This being so, it is primarily a means of giving effect to Parliament\u2019s aim, rather than a complete encapsulation of the aim itself. As with any provision, Parliament had to select a general test for s. 111(5) among the options available: it had good reason to select the de jure control test over a broad de facto control test, which would have captured a variety of conduct unrelated to Parliament\u2019s aims. Again, the test to apply on the straightforward application of s. 111(5) is not in dispute. However, de jure control does not, in itself, explain what was concerning to Parliament, as is amply demonstrated by a careful analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. Respectfully, my colleague\u2019s reasons conflate the means found within a provision\u2019s text (in this case, de jure control) with the provision\u2019s underlying rationale; this approach would have implications for a variety of provisions involving a control test, such that the GAAR would effectively not apply.\n[117] Before proceeding, I make two further comments. First, accurately setting out the object, spirit and purpose that underlies the provision does not change the applicable test within the provision. Until Parliament legislates otherwise, de jure control remains the standard for the application of s. 111(5). As I explained, within the GAAR analysis, courts are not formulating a new legal test when they determine a provision\u2019s object, spirit and purpose; rather, they seek to capture a provision\u2019s rationale, thereby providing a synthesis of what the provision was designed to achieve or prevent. Nor are courts \u201capplying\u201d the object, spirit and purpose as if it was a new bright-line test in the abuse analysis. The analysis is comparative: for a provision to be abused under a GAAR analysis, the result that the transactions achieved \u2014 transactions which have already been shown to have the primary purpose of avoiding taxes \u2014 is assessed against the provision\u2019s rationale to determine whether this rationale is frustrated (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69).\n[118] In this case, s. 111(5) demonstrates Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business. This explains what Parliament sought to prevent through the provision, understood in light of its text, context and purpose.\n[119] Second, I note that contrary to my colleague\u2019s suggestion, this case does not resemble the dispute in Alta Energy, which concerned a carve-out provision in an international treaty that allocated to a person\u2019s residence state the right to tax certain capital gains for immovable property. The majority determined that through the carve-out, Canada was deliberately seeking to \u201cforego its right to tax\u201d certain capital gains because it wanted to \u201cencourage investments by Luxembourg residents in business assets embodied in immovable property located in Canada\u201d (paras. 6 and 89). The rationale for this incentive applied whether or not Luxembourg residents had sufficient economic connections or were merely residents based on formal criteria: Luxembourg was well-known for its international tax haven regime, and evidence demonstrated that Canada\u2019s \u201cnational interest in attracting foreign investors, using Luxembourg as a conduit to take advantage of the carve-out, outweighed its interest in collecting more tax revenues on such capital gains\u201d (para. 87). By contrast, in this case, Parliament did not make a choice to permit loss-trading strategies, nor viewed this as an acceptable tradeoff. The existence of s. 111(5), along with Parliament\u2019s continued amendment of related provisions to extend its reach, reflects that Parliament did not intend for such a result and sought to address conduct that bore no relation to aim of the non-capital loss carryover, as is shown by an analysis of s. 111(5)\u2019s text, context and purpose.\n[120] The sole question in this case is whether the result of the particular series of transactions at issue is inconsistent with the rationale underlying s. 111(5). It is to this question that I now turn.\nC. Was There an Abuse of Section 111(5)?\n[121] The second stage of the abuse analysis, determining whether the transactions are abusive, is \u201cnecessarily fact-intensive\u201d (Trustco, at para. 44; Oxford Properties Group, at para. 39). Thus, deference is owed to the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings (Housen, at para. 10). However, no deference is owed to the overall conclusion that there was no abuse in this case, as that conclusion was premised on an incorrect construction of s. 111(5)\u2019s object, spirit and purpose, and therefore, was based on an extricable error of law (Trustco, at para. 46). The trial judge\u2019s factual findings regarding the transactions themselves continue to merit deference, absent palpable and overriding error; that being said, facts which were decisive when answering the wrong legal question are not necessarily as salient when answering the right one. Thus, these findings may be more or less relevant when the transactions are considered in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose.\n[122] An analysis of the transactions at issue demonstrates that their result served to frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5): considering the circumstances as a whole, they achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent and provided Matco with the benefits of an acquisition of control, all while narrowly circumventing the application of s. 111(5). I note that finding that a transaction falling short of de jure control has abused s. 111(5) in this case does not mean that every transaction falling short of de jure control will be found abusive of this provision. Indeed, the question is not whether Matco holds de jure control or satisfies some other test such as de facto control. As I explained, the abuse analysis is comparative: it asks courts to assess the transactions at issue in light of the provision\u2019s rationale to determine whether the result achieved by the transactions frustrates this rationale. It clearly did so here.\n[123] The conclusion that the series of transactions involving the appellant were abusive flows directly from a proper consideration of what s. 111(5) was designed to achieve and how the appellant circumvented that outcome. In the analysis that follows, I consider the result obtained by the transactions, with particular emphasis on (1) the fundamental transformation of the appellant\u2019s identity and (2) the rights and benefits obtained by Matco.\n[124] Section 111(5)\u2019s rationale is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. As previously explained, s. 111(5) reflects the proposition that when the identity of the taxpayer has effectively changed, the continuity at the heart of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) no longer exists. From this perspective, the same result was achieved through the impugned transactions. Indeed, the reorganization transactions resulted in the appellant\u2019s near-total transformation: its assets and liabilities were shifted to Newco, such that all that remained were its Tax Attributes. Put differently, the appellant was gutted of any vestiges from its prior corporate \u201clife\u201d and became an empty vessel with Tax Attributes.\n[125] Importantly, the tax attributes of a loss corporation were preserved to benefit another party. Indeed, the payments agreed upon by Matco under the Investment Agreement were in contemplation of being able to financially benefit from the Tax Attributes by filling the vessel with its chosen corporate opportunity and remaining a significant equity shareholder. Such a conclusion is reinforced by the adjustment clause in the Investment Agreement. The amounts owed by Matco under the Investment Agreement were to be adjusted based on the actual value of the Tax Attributes; in this way, the consideration which Matco was to provide was tied to its ability to benefit from monetizing the Tax Attributes (arts. 2.3, 5.5(a) and 5.5(b)).\n[126] Moreover, the shareholder base of the taxpayer underwent a fundamental shift throughout the transactions: the appellant began as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco and ultimately became a publicly traded company advertised for a new business, with Matco as part of the new shareholder base.\n[127] As for its business activity, the appellant was used as the vessel for an unrelated venture planned by DKCM and selected by Matco. Thus, the only link between the appellant after the transactions and its prior corporate \u201clife\u201d was the Tax Attributes; in other respects, it was, in practice, a company with new assets and liabilities, new shareholders and a new business. Accordingly, the transactions resulted in a fundamental change in the identity of the taxpayer. The appellant\u2019s continued ability to benefit from the loss carryover deductions frustrates the rationale behind Parliament\u2019s decision to sever the continuity of tax treatment in s. 111(5), particularly considering the rights and benefits obtained by Matco.\n[128] As I explained, the de jure control test was used as a means to implement Parliament\u2019s aims in s. 111(5) because it appropriately recognizes that obtaining majority voting shares carries with it the ability to elect the board of directors and therefore to control the management of the affairs of the corporation (Buckerfield\u2019s, at pp. 302-3; Duha Printers, at paras. 35-36). Matco achieved the functional equivalent of such an acquisition of control through the Investment Agreement, while circumventing s. 111(5), because it used separate transactions to dismember the rights and benefits that would normally flow from being a controlling shareholder. Several aspects of the transactions at issue demonstrate this functional equivalence, by which I mean that Matco achieved an outcome that Parliament sought to prevent without directly acquiring the rights that would have triggered s. 111(5) (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69).\n[129] First, Matco contracted for the ability to select the corporation\u2019s directors. Section 3.4 of the Investment Agreement reads as follows:\n3.4 Resignation of Officers and Directors\nThe Parent shall exercise its best efforts to ensure that a nominee of Matco is added to the board of directors of the Subsidiary and that such nominee, as well as Charles Butt and David Goold, shall be the sole officers and directors of the Subsidiary, effective as of the Effective Time. The Parent shall exercise its best efforts to cause such directors to continue as directors of the Subsidiary until the closing of a Corporate Opportunity, at which time it shall exercise its best efforts to cause each of Charles Butt and David Goold to resign as an officer and director and provide an unconditional mutual release of all claims he or she may have against the Subsidiary and vice versa, other than claims in respect of indemnification.\n(A.R., vol. II, at p. 87)\n[130] Accordingly, even without holding majority voting shares, Matco contractually required Newco, who would have control over most remaining shares at the relevant time, to ensure that the three directors of the appellant would be Butt, Goold and a director selected by Matco. This is what occurred during the election following the execution of the Investment Agreement. It thereby contractually oversaw the makeup of the board of directors. As contemplated by s. 3.4, once the corporate opportunity was found and accepted, Butt and Goold were to resign and were to be replaced with directors selected by DKCM to implement its own business activity while monetizing the appellant\u2019s Tax Attributes. Again, this is precisely what occurred.\n[131] Second, the Investment Agreement in effect placed severe restrictions on the powers of the board of directors. The appellant was prohibited from taking a variety of actions including, but not limited to: issuing any shares, options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights to acquire any shares; changing or amending its constating documents or by-laws; reorganizing, amalgamating, merging or continuing the appellant with any other legal person; taking any action relating to the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the appellant; declaring any dividends; entering into any contract in respect of the appellant; and engaging in any activity other than examining and pursuing a corporate opportunity (s. 6.1). Several of these decisions are so central to directors\u2019 duties that under its governing corporate law statute, directors are not ordinarily permitted to delegate such authority to a managing director or a committee (s. 115(3) of the CBCA ). The aforementioned corporate activities could only occur with the \u201cprior written consent of Matco\u201d (s. 6.1 of the Investment Agreement).\n[132] The restrictions in favour of Matco resemble the fettering of discretion that would normally occur through a unanimous shareholder agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control (Duha Printers, at para. 71). The only reason that s. 111(5) was not violated was due to a circuit-breaker transaction: the managing director of Matco purchased 100 shares through a holding company, 1250280 Alberta Ltd., which was not a party to the agreement in order to prevent the Investment Agreement from being signed by all shareholders. Despite this manoeuvre, the result was similar: the powers of the directors were effectively neutralized for the duration of the agreement.\n[133] Third, the transactions allowed Matco to reap significant financial benefits. Through the transactions at issue, Matco became a significant equity owner and maintained a stake in the corporation worth $4.5 million following the IPO. However, rather than merely purchasing a majority of the voting shares, it used a separate contractual agreement to gain the functional equivalent of majority voting power prior to the fulfilment of the corporate opportunity. During this intervening period, Matco deprived Newco, the majority voting shareholder on paper, of each of the core rights that it could ordinarily have exercised. One need only examine the three traditional shareholder rights outlined in s. 24(3) of the CBCA : the right to vote at any meeting of shareholders, the right to receive any dividend declared by the corporation, and the right to receive a portion of the remaining property of the corporation on dissolution. While Newco maintained its voting rights in theory, most decisions that would normally be subject to a shareholders vote \u2014 such as a change in the corporation\u2019s by-laws \u2014 could only occur with the consent of Matco (s. 6.1(b)(iii) of the Investment Agreement). Similarly, it may have had a right to dividends on paper, but any such dividends could only be declared with the consent of Matco (s. 6.1(c)(iv)). Finally, Newco may have been entitled to the appellant\u2019s remaining property upon dissolution, but again, the directors were prohibited from taking such a step without Matco\u2019s approval (s. 6.1(c)(iii)). In any case, all of the appellant\u2019s assets had been removed through the reorganization transactions. In this way, the appellant corporation had changed hands, but Matco obtained such a result through a series of transactions rather than through the acquisition of a majority of the voting shares in the appellant.\n[134] In response, the appellant argues that it remained at all times a free actor. In my view, any residual freedom under the Investment Agreement is illusory and merely reinforces how the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5).\n[135] While the appellant could, in theory, refuse the corporate opportunity presented by Matco (s. 4.1 of the Investment Agreement), a careful reading of the Investment Agreement indicates that its acceptance of such an opportunity was a fait accompli.\n[136] First, the appellant was prohibited from engaging in any other activity other than studying and accepting the corporate opportunity (s. 6.1(d)). Put simply, the sole purpose for the appellant\u2019s continued existence was to serve as a vessel for the corporate opportunity selected by Matco. It was therefore not in doubt that such an opportunity would be accepted.\n[137] Second, the consequences of refusing the corporate opportunity were severe. In particular, Matco would no longer be obligated to provide the Guaranteed Amount (s. 5.5(d)). It is worth placing these consequences in context: when the appellant sought an external opportunity, it was in dire financial stress. The money owed by Matco under the Investment Agreement, in consideration for permitting it to indirectly monetize the Tax Attributes, provided the appellant with its only lifeline. The discretion provided in s. 4.1 must be understood in light of these circumstances, which were known to the parties at the time of contracting. Indeed, they are the reason that the negotiations occurred in the first place, because the appellant was unable to benefit from the Tax Attributes on its own due to its financial situation.\n[138] As for the fact that Newco could sell its shares to another party if it received a higher price than Matco (ss. 5.1 and 5.2), the prospect of finding another buyer was illusory. Given that the appellant was unable to carry out any activities without Matco\u2019s consent due to the Investment Agreement, it could not reasonably be expected that a third party would value the shares higher than the price stipulated within the agreement until Matco had first found a corporate opportunity.\n[139] Of course, Newco had the right not to sell its remaining shares at all (ss. 5.3 and 5.8), as the Tax Court recognized (paras. 159 and 164). But understood in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose, the fact that Newco could choose to keep its voting shares is consistent with the circuitous path by which the transactions circumvented s. 111(5). Regardless of whether Newco sold its shares to Matco, the actions of the appellant were already locked down by the Investment Agreement, and the core benefits of share ownership (such as the right to dividends) were negated by being subjected to Matco\u2019s approval. Furthermore, the ability to receive the Guaranteed Amount directly rather than by selling the shares to Matco (ss. 5.3 and 5.8) merely reinforces that the transactions were designed to circumvent s. 111(5). This option was important because in certain circumstances, Matco\u2019s purchase of the shares might lead to an acquisition of de jure control. The complex series of transactions and the flexibility built into the Investment Agreement were necessary only because the contracting parties sought to achieve the very mischief that s. 111(5) was intended to prevent.\n[140] Considering the foregoing circumstances as a whole, the result obtained by the transactions clearly frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5) and therefore constituted abuse. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. The transactions achieved the very result s. 111(5) seeks to prevent. Without triggering an \u201cacquisition of control\u201d, Matco gained the power of a majority voting shareholder and fundamentally changed the appellant\u2019s assets, liabilities, shareholders and business. This severed the continuity that is at the heart of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5).\nVII. Conclusion\n[141] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[142] This case is of profound concern to Canadian taxpayers. The legal issue before this Court is whether the investment agreement between Matco Capital Ltd., 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (\u201cNewco\u201d) and the appellant, Deans Knight Income Corporation (\u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d), amounts to an abuse of s. 111(5) of the federal Income Tax Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp .) (\u201cAct \u201d), for the purposes of the general anti\u2011avoidance rule (\u201cGAAR \u201d) in s. 245 of the Act .\n[143] It is essential to keep in mind that the GAAR requires a careful balance \u201cbetween two competing interests: the interest of the taxpayer in minimizing his or her taxes through technically legitimate means and the legislative interest in ensuring the integrity of the income tax system\u201d (V. Krishna, Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (2nd ed. 2019), vol. 1, at p. 96). As Binnie J., dissenting, aptly warned in Lipson v. Canada, 2009 SCC 1, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 55, \u201c[t]he GAAR is a weapon that, unless contained by the jurisprudence, could have a widespread, serious and unpredictable effect on legitimate tax planning\u201d. With respect, I am of the view that both my colleague Rowe J. and the Federal Court of Appeal have failed to apply the GAAR with due restraint. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.\n[144] I disagree with several aspects of my colleague Rowe J.\u2019s analysis. Despite Parliament\u2019s unambiguous adoption of the de jure control test in s. 111(5) of the Act , my colleague has opted for an ad hoc approach that expands the concept of control based on a wide array of operational factors. In my view, this approach invites the exercise of unbounded judicial discretion and will result in the loss\u2011trading restrictions in s. 111(5) being applied to transactions on a circumstantial basis. Moreover, unlike my colleague, I adopt the findings of fact made by the Tax Court of Canada. For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the Tax Court\u2019s judgment.\n[145] I proceed as follows. First, I reiterate and discuss some of the core principles of the GAAR jurisprudence, in particular, the principle that the GAAR cannot be used to override other provisions of the Act . Next, I examine the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act and describe the problems I see with my colleague\u2019s analysis. Having determined the object, spirit and purpose of the provision, I turn to the question of abuse. First, I lay out the proper standard of review. Then, applying the correct object, spirit and purpose, I conclude that the avoidance transactions at issue do not amount to abusive tax avoidance within the meaning of the GAAR . Finally, I show that even on my colleague\u2019s understanding of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), a conclusion of abuse is not available without overturning various findings of fact of the Tax Court.\nII. Analysis\nA. The GAAR Cannot Override Parliament\u2019s Intent\n[146] My colleague\u2019s approach to determining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) fails to account for one central principle established in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601: the GAAR does not and cannot override Parliament\u2019s specific intent regarding particular provisions of the Act . This principle is integral to the GAAR jurisprudence and should not be swept aside lightly.\n[147] It is a longstanding principle of tax law that every person is entitled to order their affairs \u201cso as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be\u201d (Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), at p. 19). Of course, this principle is not absolute in the GAAR context (Lipson, at para. 21; Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 30). The GAAR is \u201cintended to negate arrangements that would be permissible under a literal interpretation of other provisions of the Income Tax Act , on the basis that they amount to abusive tax avoidance\u201d (Canada Trustco, para. 13). But this purposive flexibility is limited given that courts must \u201ccontemporaneously give effect to both the GAAR and the other provisions of the Income Tax Act relevant to a particular transaction\u201d (para. 13). It is therefore inappropriate to interpret the GAAR as \u201cimplying moral opprobrium regarding the actions of a taxpayer to minimize tax liability utilizing the provisions of the Income Tax Act in a creative way\u201d (Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2011 SCC 63, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 721, at para. 65).\n[148] This is why, since Canada Trustco, this Court has repeatedly affirmed that the object, spirit and purpose analysis is essentially a form of statutory interpretation. There is \u201cbut one principle of interpretation: to determine the intent of the legislator\u201d (Canada Trustco, at para. 40). The GAAR analysis rests on \u201cthe same interpretive approach employed by this Court in all questions of statutory interpretation \u2014 a \u2018unified textual, contextual and purposive approach\u2019\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70). It \u201cdoes not rewrite the provisions of the Income Tax Act ; it only requires that a tax benefit be consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions that are relied upon\u201d (Canada Trustco, at para. 54; Alta Energy, at para. 96). The GAAR analysis merely seeks to \u201cdetermine a different aspect of the statute than in other cases\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70).\n[149] Since the GAAR analysis is little more than a specialized form of statutory interpretation, the central issue must be determining Parliament\u2019s intent (Canada Trustco, at para. 40). It should not be assumed that the GAAR , as a provision of last resort (Canada Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66), plays a role in every transaction and in every context. Sometimes, the GAAR is meant to \u201caddress the complexity of transactions which fall outside the scope of specific anti\u2011avoidance provisions\u201d (Lipson, at para. 47). Other times, Parliament drafts a specific anti-avoidance rule with clear objectives in mind. Applying the GAAR in this latter context would undermine Parliament\u2019s policy choices. Therefore, when it is said that the GAAR is a provision of last resort, this means only that it is not designed to be Parliament\u2019s first and primary anti\u2011avoidance measure \u2014 nothing more.\n[150] I agree with my colleague that \u201cthere is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule\u201d (para. 71). The GAAR can indeed supplement a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule; to say otherwise would \u201cru[n] contrary to this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u201d (Rowe J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 72). However, this Court has already acknowledged that a provision\u2019s text can sometimes be conclusive because it is \u201cconsistent with and fully explains [the provision\u2019s] underlying rationale\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 110). So while I agree with my colleague\u2019s assertion that the analysis is \u201ccase specific\u201d (para. 71), I find it incorrect and unhelpful to definitively and universally declare that technical, carefully drafted provisions \u201care not immune from abuse\u201d (para. 72), even though Copthorne, which case he cites, specifically acknowledges the very possibility that the underlying rationale of a provision could be no broader than the text itself. That said, I find instead that it is more fruitful to consider when the text is conclusive or not.\n[151] The key question is whether Parliament specifically intended to prevent or permit a certain type of transaction. Where Parliament has specified precisely what conditions must be satisfied to achieve a particular result, \u201cit is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended that taxpayers would rely on such provisions to achieve the result they prescribe\u201d (Canada Trustco, at para. 11). Although this is not determinative, \u201cwhere it can be shown that an anti\u2011avoidance provision has been carefully crafted to include some situations and exclude others, it is reasonable to infer that Parliament chose to limit their scope accordingly\u201d (Minister of National Revenue v. Landrus, 2009 FCA 113, 392 N.R. 54, at para. 47). Therefore, drafting precision is a key factor in revealing whether or not the GAAR may supplement a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule. This follows from the core principle that the GAAR analysis is a species of statutory interpretation: it cannot be used to effectively rewrite a provision.\n[152] With respect, my colleague applies the GAAR in a way that not only ignores but also disregards this core principle. He states that the rationale behind a provision must be distinguished from the means used to give effect to that rationale (para. 59). According to him, it is essential to look to the drafting process as it \u201creflects the task of translating government aims into legislative form in order to create intelligible, legally effective rules\u201d (para. 59). The necessary implication that flows from my colleague\u2019s reasoning is that Parliament is unable to translate its objectives into effective means; the best it can do is choose text that is \u201cmost faithful to its objectives\u201d (para. 59 (emphasis added)). In my view, Parliament often intends to do precisely what it actually does. If Parliament crafts a provision carefully, courts should pay close attention to the means chosen and not simply assume that Parliament drafted the provision incompetently.\n[153] In Alta Energy, this Court affirmed the notion of foreseeability as another important tool to gauge Parliament\u2019s specific intent (para. 82). Sometimes, the absence or presence of a specific anti\u2011avoidance provision can be \u201can enlightening contextual and purposive element\u201d that sheds light on Parliament\u2019s intent (para. 82). If \u201cParliament did not or could not have foreseen the tax strategy employed by the taxpayer\u201d, it is more likely that a gap in the legislation is unintentional, and the GAAR can be applied to avoidance transactions that exploit that gap (para. 82). The GAAR was intended to catch unforeseen tax strategies (para. 80) and to allow Parliament to stay one step ahead of ingenious and innovative tax avoidance schemes.\n[154] But if Parliament drafts a specific anti\u2011avoidance provision in a way that keeps a highly foreseeable gap open, the gap is more likely to be intentional, and relying on it should not be considered abusive for the purposes of the GAAR . In Alta Energy, this Court declined to use the GAAR to introduce a \u201csufficient substantive economic connections\u201d test into the residency requirement of a tax treaty between Canada and Luxembourg. The GAAR did not apply because \u201cCanada and Luxembourg made a deliberate choice to leave the business property exemption unguarded\u201d in the treaty (para. 82). In other words, the GAAR cannot be used to punish taxpayers for walking through a door that Parliament intentionally left open.\n[155] My colleague is essentially applying the same reasoning that this Court expressly rejected in Alta Energy. In that case, my colleague, together with Martin J., dissenting, characterized the relevant articles of the treaty broadly, stating that any other interpretation \u201crenders the GAAR \u2018meaningless\u2019\u201d (para. 133). In their view, \u201cno inference [could] be drawn from the absence of an anti\u2011avoidance rule designed to counter the particular scheme employed in this case\u201d (para. 150). Thus, \u201cthe absence of specific anti\u2011avoidance rules . . . sheds little light on [the provision\u2019s] underlying rationale\u201d (para. 150). According to the dissent in Alta Energy, drawing such an inference would \u201cbe patently contrary to this Court\u2019s repeated holding that the GAAR is a provision of last resort, and can only find application where no other provisions of the Act do\u201d (para. 150, citing Canada Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). In other words, the dissenting view in Alta Energy was that, because the GAAR is a \u201cprovision of last resort\u201d, it has a role to play in each and every case.\n[156] My colleague follows the same reasoning in this case. He discerns an object, spirit and purpose that conflicts with Parliament\u2019s adoption of a well\u2011established legal test: de jure control. In his view, Parliament\u2019s chosen control test in s. 111(5) of the Act is of little import. Instead, the provision\u2019s \u201cunderlying rationale\u201d allows the Minister of National Revenue to apply s. 111(5) in a way that overrides Parliament\u2019s specific intent. Simply stated, this approach is contrary to this Court\u2019s holding in Canada Trustco. It impermissibly elevates the role of the GAAR and enables the Minister to selectively override Parliament. This is not what the GAAR was intended to do.\nB. The Text, Context and Purpose of Section 111(5)\n[157] I agree with much of my colleague\u2019s analysis of the text, context and purpose of s. 111(5). However, I disagree with his conclusion that the provision\u2019s rationale is \u201cto deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business\u201d (para. 118). The analysis below addresses this issue, focusing on the concept of control as this is the main source of disagreement between my colleague and me.\n[158] I begin my analysis with the observation that s. 111(1) (a) of the Act allows taxpayers to deduct non\u2011capital losses for the purpose of computing taxable income for a taxation year. This general rule is restricted by s. 111(5). Upon an acquisition of control, s. 111(5) prevents a corporation from carrying over losses unless the business, carried on by the corporation subject to the change of control, is continued for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit. Thus, the general loss deductibility provision \u2014 s. 111(1)(a) \u2014 sets out the default rule subject to the restrictions found in s. 111(5), with exceptions in specific circumstances. Section 111(5) is a specific anti\u2011avoidance rule that limits what would otherwise be permissible deductions under s. 111(1)(a) (D. G. Duff et al., Canadian Income Tax Law (7th ed. 2023), at pp. 205\u20116; T. E. McDonnell, \u201cLegislative Anti\u2011Avoidance: The Interaction of the New General Rule and Representative Specific Rules\u201d, in Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 6:1, at p. 6:18). It bars corporate acquisitions for the singular purpose of accessing tax attributes by restricting the use of those attributes if accessed through the exercise of control. The acquisition of control test and the business continuity requirement are, properly construed, narrow exceptions to the anti\u2011avoidance provision.\n[159] It follows that the restrictions on loss carryovers in s. 111(5) are triggered when \u201ccontrol of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons\u201d. \u201cControl\u201d is therefore central to how s. 111(5) functions. The parties in this case disagree as to whether a change of control for the purpose of s. 111(5) is signalled through an acquisition of de jure control or de facto control.\n(1) The Notion of De Jure Control\n[160] \u201cControl\u201d is not defined in the Act . However, courts have considered this concept on a number of occasions and have determined that \u201ccontrol\u201d for the purposes of the Act means de jure control. In Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299, the Exchequer Court of Canada held that de jure control refers to the ownership of a sufficient number of shares to have a majority of votes in the election of the corporation\u2019s board of directors.\n[161] The principle established in Buckerfield\u2019s was affirmed by this Court in Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795. In that case, Iacobucci J. stated that in assessing de jure control, one must consider the corporation\u2019s governing statute, the share register of the corporation and any specific or unique limitation on the majority shareholder\u2019s power to control the election of the board of directors, as manifested in either the corporation\u2019s constating documents or a unanimous shareholder agreement. Iacobucci J. also made it clear that external documents are not relevant to determining de jure control (para. 85). Thus, the voting power attributable to shareholdings, ascertained in light of the corporation\u2019s constating documents and share register, is generally the determinative factor for de jure control.\n[162] It is useful to recall the rationale for this approach. In Duha Printers, Iacobucci J. distinguished external agreements from a corporation\u2019s constating documents on the basis that the latter create de jure control because they restrain the ability of shareholders to exercise their voting power freely (paras. 65 and 71). He commented at length on the peculiar character of unanimous shareholder agreements, stating that they are \u201ca corporate law hybrid, part contractual and part constitutional in nature\u201d (para. 66). Significantly, Iacobucci J. noted that corporate law offers remedies, such as compliance orders, that effectively enforce rights and obligations under the statutes of a corporation, including a unanimous shareholder agreement. It is important to point out that a compliance order is analogous to a judgment for specific performance (Corporations Act, R.S.M. 1987, c. C225, quoted in Duha Printers, at para. 13; K. P. McGuinness, Canadian Business Corporations Law (3rd ed. 2017), at \u00a722.301).\n[163] The only exception to the general rule discussed above is found in cases like Minister of National Revenue v. Consolidated Holding Co., [1974] S.C.R. 419, where the capacity of shareholders to act is limited by a trust instrument. In Duha Printers, Iacobucci J. commented on the distinction between a trust instrument and other external documents for the purposes of assessing de jure control, noting that \u201c[a] trust imposes upon the trustee a fiduciary obligation to act within the terms of the trust instrument and for the benefit of the beneficiary\u201d (para. 49). In light of such fiduciary duties, Iacobucci J. concluded that trust instruments limit the capacity of trustees who hold shares to act as \u201cfree actors\u201d (para. 49).\n[164] In contrast to a corporation\u2019s constating documents, external agreements \u201cgive rise to obligations that are contractual and not legal or constitutional in nature\u201d (Duha Printers, at para. 59). Consequently, any limitations imposed by such agreements \u201care limitations freely agreed to by the shareholders, and not at all inconsistent with their de jure power to control the company\u201d (para. 49). Although such agreements do not have an impact on de jure control, they remain relevant in assessing de facto control. This is because control in fact is based on the ability to exercise direct or indirect influence over the corporation\u2019s voting shareholders (Silicon Graphics Ltd. v. Canada, 2002 FCA 260, [2003] 1 F.C. 447, at para. 67). As such, there are a broader range of factors \u2014 beyond voting power determined in light of constating documents and the share register \u2014 that have the potential to establish de facto control. De facto control thus captures everything that de jure control does not.\n(2) The Binary Nature of Control: De Jure and De Facto Control\n[165] The legal distinction between constating documents of a corporation and external agreements exposes the binary nature of control, which can be either de jure or de facto. While the former give rise to legal powers over a corporation, the latter do not, such that the distinction between de jure and de facto control goes to the dichotomy between power and influence. The breach of a corporation\u2019s constating documents entitles a complainant to seek a compliance order requiring adherence to the corporate constitution (e.g., Corporations Act, quoted in Duha Printers, at para. 13). In contrast, external agreements do not bind the corporation in the same way: shareholders remain free to exercise de jure control \u201ceven if an outside agreement exists to limit actual or de facto control\u201d (Duha Printers, at para. 49). Consequently, the distinction between de jure and de facto control lies in the breadth of factors that can be considered in determining who has control over the corporation.\n[166] In light of the case law, Parliament has clarified the concept of \u201ccontrol\u201d in order to reach specific legislative goals. Since September 13, 1988, when s. 256(5.1) was introduced, the Act has been clear as to which provisions refer to the concept of de jure control as opposed to those that involve, rather, the application of de facto control. The use of the phrase \u201ccontrolled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever\u201d specifically refers to de facto control, which exists when a party has direct or indirect influence over the corporation which can result in control in fact. This change illustrates the intentionality with which Parliament prescribes control tests, bearing in mind the distinction between de jure and de facto control.\n[167] The deeming rule found in s. 256(8) of the Act is another indication that Parliament maintained and did not abandon the acquisition of de jure control test in s. 111(5). Rather than replacing the de jure control test, Parliament extended the definition of de jure control to include contingent and future rights to shares under s. 256(8) \u2014 but de jure rights nonetheless. Section 256(8) applies when a person acquires certain rights (enumerated in s. 251(5)(b)) in respect of a corporation\u2019s shares and deems the person to be in the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the rights had been exercised. Once it is determined that a person has rights under s. 251(5)(b), the de jure control test is applied in relation to those shares. Accordingly, s. 256(8) measures voting power on the basis of shareholdings and captures option agreements that, if exercised, would provide de jure control. It does not capture operational\u2011level factors that relate to a company\u2019s management.\n[168] In addition to the above, the advantages of using a bright\u2011line test are instructive of Parliament\u2019s rationale in selecting a test like de jure control. Clearly defined rules are essential in banking and commercial transactions because they reduce costs related to litigation and promote predictability by allowing all parties to know their rights and obligations in advance. As this Court said in Duha Printers, \u201ca simple test such as that which has been followed since Buckerfield\u2019s is most desirable. If the distinction between de jure and de facto control is to be eliminated at this time, this should be left to Parliament, not to the courts\u201d (para. 52). This is a test that has been recognized and built upon by Parliament (para. 52).\n[169] The importance of creating transactional certainty and minimizing costs is heightened in the context of a provision that applies exclusively to non\u2011capital losses. Using a more ambiguous hybrid test would pose commercial risks for parties looking to invest in companies with accrued losses (i.e., risks of reassessment, litigation). In turn, discouraging investments of this type would hinder the rehabilitation of Canadian businesses and undermine economic growth as a whole.\n[170] In short, Iacobucci J. in Duha Printers took a purposive approach to interpreting the word \u201ccontrol\u201d. Interpreted literally, \u201ccontrol\u201d could mean any type of influence over a corporation (para. 35). Nevertheless, Iacobucci J. concluded that the \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d of s. 111(5) \u2014 preventing the transfer of non\u2011capital losses from one corporation to another \u2014 does not expand the meaning of de jure control (para. 88). Therefore, even prior to the adoption of the GAAR , one thing was clear: Parliament intended the acquisition of de jure control \u2014 and only the acquisition of de jure control \u2014 to trigger the application of s. 111(5). To this day, Parliament continues to rely upon the distinction between de jure and de facto control. And despite my colleague\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, the GAAR cannot eliminate this distinction.\n(3) Conclusion on the Object, Spirit and Purpose of Section 111(5)\n[171] In light of the above, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. A textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the relevant provisions reveals that Parliament never intended courts to consider factors other than those related to share ownership.\n[172] Relying on Alta Energy, my colleague accepts that the GAAR cannot be used to restrict certain types of tax avoidance strategies if Parliament demonstrates a clear rationale to \u201cpermit loss\u2011trading strategies\u201d or \u201cview[s] [a chosen regime] as an acceptable tradeoff\u201d (para. 119). In his mind, s. 111(5) does not meet these criteria because Parliament \u201cdid not make a choice to permit loss\u2011trading strategies\u201d (para. 119). I strongly disagree. As discussed above, Duha Printers was not based on a literal interpretation of s. 111(5). Understanding the term \u201ccontrol\u201d purposively, this Court found that Parliament specifically intended to allow certain types of legal relationships that create de facto control without resulting in a change of de jure control (paras. 52 and 58). My colleague does not appreciate that Parliament has incorporated a judicially developed meaning of \u201ccontrol\u201d into the provision.\n[173] My conclusion echoes this Court\u2019s decision in Canada Trustco, which my colleague is unable to distinguish from this case. The key issue in that case was the definition of \u201ccost\u201d for the purpose of s. 20(1) of the Act . McLachlin C.J. and Major J., writing for the Court, noted that \u201ccost\u201d is a \u201cwell\u2011understood legal concept\u201d that is carefully defined by the Act and the jurisprudence (para. 75). In this context, they held that \u201cnothing in the GAAR or the object of the [capital cost allowance] provisions . . . permits [this Court] to rewrite them to interpret \u2018cost\u2019 to mean \u2018amount economically at risk\u2019\u201d (para. 75).\n[174] The same can be said with respect to the concept of control. Indeed, Parliament\u2019s intent has not changed since Duha Printers. As discussed earlier in these reasons, Parliament has always relied on the de jure and de facto control tests. In 1988, Parliament legislated the concept of de facto control into s. 256(5.1) of the Act (Lyrtech RD Inc. v. The Queen, 2014 FCA 267, 2015 D.T.C. 5054, at para. 36). The deeming rule found in s. 256(8) is based and builds upon the notion of de jure control. These provisions show that Parliament has expressly decided to maintain the distinction between de jure and de facto control and continues to rely on it. I do not see how any amendments to the control tests have tarnished the core logic that this Court accepted in Duha Printers. This being so, the GAAR cannot override Parliament\u2019s intent; it must give effect to it.\n[175] In sum, a change in control is the singular event that triggers the loss\u2011trading restrictions found in s. 111(5). The notion of \u201ccontrol\u201d is therefore central to the operation of s. 111(5), and any object, spirit and purpose that omits it lacks coherence. In my opinion, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to deny the use of specified losses of a corporation if a person or group of persons has acquired de jure control of that corporation.\n[176] My colleague concedes that Parliament has opted for de jure control. But to his mind, \u201cmore is needed than the simple fact that Parliament settled on this test to operationalize its intent\u201d (para. 94 (emphasis in original)). He contends that \u201cthe de jure control test in s. 111(5) does not, on its own, capture the full range of situations that Parliament sought to target; rather, the test in s. 111(5) is better understood as a rough proxy that seeks to give effect to Parliament\u2019s broader aims\u201d (para. 96 (emphasis in original)). There is only one difficulty with this position, but it is a major one: it completely ignores how Parliament actually defined what constitutes an acquisition of control. With respect, this is wholly inconsistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on interpreting the object, spirit and purpose of a provision under the GAAR .\n[177] My colleague also tries to downplay the importance of the so\u2011called \u201cmeans\u201d of s. 111(5) by omitting the control test from the provision\u2019s rationale. In his view, describing \u201cthe object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) based on Parliament\u2019s choice of test\u201d would \u201cresult in prioritizing the means (the how) over the rationale (the why)\u201d (para. 115 (emphasis in original)). Ironically, his own abuse analysis illustrates how Parliament\u2019s chosen test is central to s. 111(5)\u2019s rationale. While he refuses to formulate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) as a legal test, my colleague cannot articulate the provision\u2019s rationale without referring to the concept of \u201cacquisition\u201d. What is an \u201cacquisition\u201d? It is merely a synonym for \u201ccontrol\u201d.\n[178] Despite correctly pointing out that de jure control \u201cremains the standard for the application of s. 111(5)\u201d, my colleague introduces the notion of \u201cfunctional equivalence\u201d (paras. 117 and 128). This novel concept treats the Investment Agreement as a constating document for the purposes of control (para. 122). The nuance lost on my colleague is that constating documents and external agreements are enforced in radically different ways. That being so, an ordinary contract can never be functionally equivalent to a constating document. In this regard, I see no difference between my colleague\u2019s approach and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s \u201cactual control\u201d test. Both ignore the rationale behind the de jure and de facto control tests and erode the distinction between them.\n[179] The jurisprudence is clear that the GAAR cannot be invoked to override Parliament\u2019s clear intent. It seems to me, however, that this is what my colleague is doing in this case. Indeed, his approach departs from what is otherwise Parliament\u2019s clear articulation of a de jure control test for restricting losses under s. 111(5). Beyond this, my colleague introduces the novel and unprecedented concept of functional equivalence, which has no known boundaries. With respect, this approach illustrates the potential overriding power of the GAAR , as cautioned against in Canada Trustco.\nC. Abuse Analysis\n(1) Standard of Review\n[180] My colleague and I agree that whether an avoidance transaction constitutes a misuse or abuse of a provision is a question of mixed fact and law that is reviewable for palpable and overriding error. I cannot agree, however, with his observation that a \u201ctrial judge\u2019s factual findings regarding the transactions\u201d may be \u201cmore or less relevant when the transactions are considered in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose\u201d (para. 121 (emphasis in original)). With respect, this suggests that it is open to appellate courts to disregard key findings of fact in GAAR cases.\n[181] Findings of fact and inferences drawn from those facts can be set aside only if it is established that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in reaching those findings and drawing those inferences (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 23). Absent a palpable and overriding error, an appellate court cannot reweigh the facts or evidence before the trial court. This is true in any appeal, including one involving the GAAR . I therefore fail to understand why this case in particular warrants the application of a standard less strict than the \u201cpalpable and overriding\u201d standard.\n[182] Whether an avoidance transaction is abusive is a fact\u2011intensive inquiry that raises a question of mixed fact and law (Canada Trustco, at para. 44). Absent an extricable error of law, the application of the law to the facts is subject to the standard of palpable and overriding error. I note in passing that questions of contractual interpretation are subject to the same deferential standard of review (Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para. 50). As discussed below, it is my view that no such error exists in this case.\n(2) The Avoidance Transactions Do Not Amount to an Abuse of Section 111(5)\u2019s Object, Spirit and Purpose\n[183] As stated above, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. Since de jure control is an essential element of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the key question at this stage is whether Matco acquired de jure control of Deans Knight.\n[184] Before turning to this question, it should be noted that the relationship between Matco and Deans Knight is the proper focus of the abuse analysis. My colleague seems to imply that the disclosure in the prospectus relating to the foreseeable tax risks associated with the loss transfer is somehow relevant (paras. 21 and 49). However, the Minister did not argue that a change of control occurred as a result of the initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d): he argued that a change of control occurred as a result of the avoidance transactions between Matco and Deans Knight. Therefore, given that the prospectus was in connection with the IPO, the disclosure to which my colleague refers is irrelevant here. In any case, disclosures of this kind are commonly included in securities offerings and continuous disclosure documents and are not indicative that a transaction is motivated by abusive tax avoidance.\n[185] Turning now to the question of abuse, I am of the opinion that the Tax Court\u2019s decision was based on a combination of findings of fact and an interpretation of the Investment Agreement that is supported by the evidence. According to the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings, Matco did not acquire \u201ceffective control\u201d of Deans Knight. I see no reviewable error in this conclusion.\n[186] The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion was largely based on an interpretation of the Investment Agreement and on credibility findings. First, the debenture purchased by Matco under the Investment Agreement was convertible into no more than 35 percent of the voting common shares of Deans Knight (2019 TCC 76, [2019] 4 C.T.C. 2001, at para. 21). At no point did Matco own or have a right to own enough shares to reach a majority shareholder position. Thus, the only key question is whether the evidence supports the contention that Matco had de jure control over the remaining shares of Deans Knight (para. 157).\n[187] My colleague claims that Matco acquired the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of de jure control through the Investment Agreement (para. 128). He goes to great lengths to underscore that \u201c[t]he restrictions in favour of Matco resemble the fettering of discretion that would normally occur through a unanimous shareholder agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control\u201d (para. 132). In his view, those restrictions were so severe that they \u201ceffectively neutralized\u201d Deans Knight\u2019s board of directors (para. 132). He therefore concludes that Deans Knight\u2019s status as a \u201cfree actor\u201d was \u201cillusory\u201d (para. 134); that its acceptance of the corporate opportunity presented by Matco was a fait accompli (para. 135); that the possibility of Newco receiving a higher price for its shares from a third party was \u201cillusory\u201d (para. 138); and that Newco would receive the same money even if its remaining shares in Deans Knight were not sold shows that the transactions were \u201cdesigned\u201d to circumvent s. 111(5) (para. 139).\n[188] In my view, the Investment Agreement is of no relevance to de jure control. In Duha Printers, this Court stated that, contrary to unanimous shareholder agreements, voting agreements give rise to contractual obligations that are neither legal nor constitutional in nature (para. 59). Despite this, my colleague treats the Investment Agreement as sufficient for establishing de jure control. Again, the problem with his conclusion is that external agreements cannot be functionally equivalent to constating documents.\n[189] But moving past this initial hurdle, my colleague\u2019s approach fails to accord proper deference to the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings. The Tax Court focused on s. 5.8 of the Investment Agreement, which says that \u201c[Newco] shall not be required to sell any of the Remaining Shares prior to or during the Guarantee Period or at any other time\u201d (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 59). The Tax Court found that this term was not a sham or inconsistent with any other rights in the agreement (para. 60). This conclusion was supported by the other terms of the Investment Agreement, which did not give Matco control over the sale of the remaining shares (para. 61) or require that Matco present third parties with a sale opportunity for those shares (para. 62).\n[190] These findings were supported by oral testimony. David Goold (Deans Knight\u2019s Chief Financial Officer) testified that Newco believed it had a choice whether or not to accept Matco\u2019s offer to purchase the remaining shares (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 64 and 162\u201164). The Tax Court considered the restrictive aspects of the Investment Agreement (paras. 156 and 161) but preferred the testimony of Deans Knight\u2019s witnesses. Put simply, the Tax Court made credibility findings. Credibility findings can be interfered with only if a palpable and overriding error is demonstrated (Housen, at paras. 10\u201115 and 19\u201125). Since the Tax Court\u2019s factual assessment was not tainted in any way by its characterization of s. 111(5), I see no reason why its findings should be overturned.\n[191] I see several serious problems with my colleague\u2019s conclusion that the prospect of Newco selling its shares to another party was \u201cillusory\u201d (para. 138). First, my colleague suggests that share ownership is somehow less relevant to the abuse inquiry under s. 111(5). Indeed, he states that \u201c[r]egardless of whether Newco sold its shares to Matco, the actions of the appellant were already locked down by the Investment Agreement, and the core benefits of share ownership (such as the right to dividends) were negated by being subjected to Matco\u2019s approval\u201d (para. 139). This suggests that a shareholder\u2019s right to dividends is somehow relevant to the analysis, but this line of reasoning misses the fact that Parliament\u2019s test for control is squarely focused on voting rights arising from ownership. The \u201cright to dividends\u201d is irrelevant here. Indeed, it is not unusual for a company to issue shares without declaring dividends. The only relevant incidence of ownership is voting power \u2014 something that the Investment Agreement did not take away.\n[192] But putting that aside for a moment, the logical inconsistency in my colleague\u2019s argument shows how voting power is indeed very much relevant to the question on appeal. My colleague finds that the prospect of Newco finding another buyer was \u201cillusory\u201d, but he asserts that his conclusion \u201cis consistent with the circuitous path by which the transactions circumvented s. 111(5)\u201d (para. 139). If the question of whether Newco had the right to retain its shares is irrelevant, why does it matter that this right was \u201cillusory\u201d? Clearly, share ownership is a \u201cdecisive\u201d factor in my colleague\u2019s analysis (para. 121).\n[193] Ultimately and with respect, my colleague\u2019s argument is an attempt to re\u2011weigh the evidence considered by the Tax Court. The issue of whether Newco retained the right not to sell its remaining shares is a question of mixed fact and law. The Tax Court held that Newco\u2019s right to retain its shares was bona fide and certainly not a sham. Re\u2011characterizing this right to support the notion that Newco and Deans Knight were intending to abuse s. 111(5) is manifestly counter to the Tax Court\u2019s finding. Considering that my colleague has pointed us to no palpable or overriding error in the Tax Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence, his conclusion requires overturning a key finding of fact made by the Tax Court.\n[194] My colleague defends his approach by stating that the Tax Court\u2019s finding is tainted by its mischaracterization of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). He seems to suggest that the Tax Court\u2019s finding of fact can be discounted as it was only relevant to answering the narrow question of whether Matco had acquired control over the majority of the voting shares of the appellant. However, this is simply not the case: the Tax Court \u201caccept[ed] Goold\u2019s testimony that Newco believed it had the choice whether to accept Matco\u2019s offer for the Remaining Shares or not\u201d (para. 164). This is a specific credibility finding on the point that the appellant remained a free actor throughout the transactions. Unlike my colleague, I therefore fail to see how the Tax Court\u2019s mischaracterization of s. 111(5) tainted this important credibility finding.\n[195] Even if my characterization of s. 111(5)\u2019s object, spirit and purpose is wrong and the object, spirit and purpose of this provision is instead \u201cto prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders\u201d (Rowe J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 113), the appeal should still be allowed.\n[196] In my view, Matco did not really \u201cacquire\u201d Deans Knight in any practical sense. The Minister\u2019s submissions focused on Matco, and the Tax Court held that Matco was only a facilitator of the transactions (para. 152). The Tax Court found that there was no trade or transfer of non\u2011capital losses. Matco did not use Deans Knight\u2019s non\u2011capital losses for its own benefit (para. 152). The post\u2011IPO shareholders were the only ones that directly received the benefits of ownership. At best, one could argue that the Investment Agreement \u201clocked down\u201d Deans Knight so that Matco could market it for a subsequent acquisition. However, it requires a great leap in logic to infer that Matco \u201cacquired\u201d Deans Knight. Such a leap would create uncertainty as to what exactly constitutes abuse: at what point does \u201ctak[ing] the reins\u201d of a corporation result in the acquisition of that corporation (Rowe J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 118)? Under my colleague\u2019s approach, the existence of abusive tax avoidance is, at best, unclear. In such circumstances, \u201cthe benefit of the doubt goes to the taxpayer\u201d (Canada Trustco, at para. 66).\n[197] For these reasons, I am of the view that the avoidance transactions did not frustrate the rationale of s. 111(5). There was therefore no abuse, and consequently, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada.\nAPPENDIX\nIncome Tax Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp .)\n2 (1) An income tax shall be paid, as required by this Act , on the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada at any time in the year.\n(2) The taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year is the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year plus the additions and minus the deductions permitted by Division C.\n(3) Where a person who is not taxable under subsection 2(1) for a taxation year\n(a) was employed in Canada,\n(b) carried on a business in Canada, or\n(c) disposed of a taxable Canadian property,\nat any time in the year or a previous year, an income tax shall be paid, as required by this Act , on the person\u2019s taxable income earned in Canada for the year determined in accordance with Division D.\n3 The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year determined by the following rules:\n(a) determine the total of all amounts each of which is the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year (other than a taxable capital gain from the disposition of a property) from a source inside or outside Canada, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year from each office, employment, business and property,\n(b) determine the amount, if any, by which\n(i) the total of\n(A) all of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable capital gains for the year from dispositions of property other than listed personal property, and\n(B) the taxpayer\u2019s taxable net gain for the year from dispositions of listed personal property,\nexceeds\n(ii) the amount, if any, by which the taxpayer\u2019s allowable capital losses for the year from dispositions of property other than listed personal property exceed the taxpayer\u2019s allowable business investment losses for the year,\n(c) determine the amount, if any, by which the total determined under paragraph (a) plus the amount determined under paragraph (b) exceeds the total of the deductions permitted by Subdivision E in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year (except to the extent that those deductions, if any, have been taken into account in determining the total referred to in paragraph (a), and\n(d) determine the amount, if any, by which the amount determined under paragraph (c) exceeds the total of all amounts each of which is the taxpayer\u2019s loss for the year from an office, employment, business or property or the taxpayer\u2019s allowable business investment loss for the year,\nand for the purposes of this Part,\n(e) where an amount is determined under paragraph (d) for the year in respect of the taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year is the amount so determined, and\n(f) in any other case, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have income for the year in an amount equal to zero.\n111 (1) For the purpose of computing the taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year, there may be deducted such portion as the taxpayer may claim of the taxpayer\u2019s\n(a) non-capital losses for the 20 taxation years immediately preceding and the 3 taxation years immediately following the year;\n. . .\n(5) Where, at any time, control of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending before that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending after that time and no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending after that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending before that time except that\n(a) such portion of the corporation\u2019s non-capital loss or farm loss, as the case may be, for a taxation year ending before that time as may reasonably be regarded as its loss from carrying on a business and, where a business was carried on by the corporation in that year, such portion of the non-capital loss as may reasonably be regarded as being in respect of an amount deductible under paragraph 110(1)(k) in computing its taxable income for the year is deductible by the corporation for a particular taxation year ending after that time\n(i) only if that business was carried on by the corporation for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit throughout the particular year, and\n(ii) only to the extent of the total of the corporation\u2019s income for the particular year from that business and, where properties were sold, leased, rented or developed or services rendered in the course of carrying on that business before that time, from any other business substantially all the income of which was derived from the sale, leasing, rental or development, as the case may be, of similar properties or the rendering of similar services; and\n(b) such portion of the corporation\u2019s non-capital loss or farm loss, as the case may be, for a taxation year ending after that time as may reasonably be regarded as its loss from carrying on a business and, where a business was carried on by the corporation in that year, such portion of the non-capital loss as may reasonably be regarded as being in respect of an amount deductible under paragraph 110(1)(k) in computing its taxable income for the year is deductible by the corporation for a particular year ending before that time\n(i) only if throughout the taxation year and in the particular year that business was carried on by the corporation for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit, and\n(ii) only to the extent of the corporation\u2019s income for the particular year from that business and, where properties were sold, leased, rented or developed or services rendered in the course of carrying on that business before that time, from any other business substantially all the income of which was derived from the sale, leasing, rental or development, as the case may be, of similar properties or the rendering of similar services.\n245 (1) In this section,\ntax benefit means a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act , and includes a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount that would be payable under this Act but for a tax treaty or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act as a result of a tax treaty;

In essence, the treaty provides that refugee claimants must, as a general rule, seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The Safe Third Country Agreement is given effect in Canadian domestic law through the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA \u201d) and its regulations (\u201cIRPR\u201d). Under s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA , refugee status claims are ineligible to be considered in Canada if the claimant came from a country designated by the IRPR. Section 102(1) (a) of the IRPA provides that countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with their non\u2011refoulement obligations under international law, which prohibit directly or indirectly returning a person to a place where they would face certain kinds of irreparable harm, including threats to their life or freedom, torture and cruel or degrading treatment. Section 102(2) lists factors for the Governor in Council to consider in designating a country, and s. 102(3) creates an obligation for the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of those factors with respect to each designated country. The United States is designated under s. 159.3 of the IRPR.\nSeveral individuals arrived from the United States to claim refugee protection in Canada. Their claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, pursuant to s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR. However, most of the individuals were not returned to the United States, as they had obtained a stay of removal or temporary resident permit. One individual was returned to the United States. That individual says American officials detained her in solitary confinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her for another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of criminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not respected.\nThe individuals whose claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, along with public interest litigants (collectively, the \u201capplicants\u201d), challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis that the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA because of post\u2011promulgation constraints on the Governor in Council\u2019s statutory authority to maintain a designation. They also argued that s. 159.3 of the IRPR and s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA violated the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter , asserting that the legislative scheme results in Canadian immigration officers summarily returning claimants to the United States without considering whether that country will respect their rights under international law, including those related to detention and non\u2011refoulement.\nThe Federal Court judge rejected the ultra vires argument because whether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on facts at the time of promulgation. With respect to s. 7 of the Charter , she found the alleged violations were largely substantiated and most grave, and that deprivations of liberty and security of the person for refugee claimants arose because those returned to the United States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm relating to immigration detention. She concluded that s. 7 was violated and that this breach was not justified under s. 1 , and she therefore declined to rule on the s. 15 claim. She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal brought by the ministers, dismissed the cross-appeal of the s. 15 claim and the ultra vires argument, and set aside the judgment of the Federal Court. The basis for these conclusions was that the causation requirements for a Charter claim were not met because the applicants improperly targeted the legislation rather than administrative conduct.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part.\nSection 159.3 of the IRPR is not ultra vires, nor does it breach s. 7 of the Charter . However, the challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter , which was not decided by either court below, should be remitted to the Federal Court.\nThe applicants\u2019 submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA should be rejected. Regulations derive their validity from the statute that creates the power to promulgate a regulation, and not from the executive body by which they are made. The limits imposed by the enabling statute are therefore fundamental to determining whether a regulation is intra vires that statute. In the instant case, s. 102(1) (a) and (2) of the IRPA establishes conditions precedent to designation for the purposes of s. 101(1)(e); these conditions must be met before, not after, a country is designated. While s. 102(3) creates an obligation for the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors, these reviews are not directed at whether the regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute. The s. 102(3) reviews are thus outside the scope of a challenge alleging that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA , although they may well be subject to other forms of challenge based on administrative law principles. Whether or not the impugned regulation is intra vires its enabling statute must be examined at the time of promulgation. Regulations benefit from a presumption of validity. The applicants have not shown that on the date of promulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by s. 102(1) (a) or (2) of the IRPA .\nThe applicants\u2019 s. 7 Charter challenge was properly constituted. The s. 159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant ineligibility determinations and is thus properly subject to constitutional scrutiny. To succeed, a Charter claim must show a causal link between state action and the violation of the relevant right or freedom; a sufficient causal connection must be established, which does not require that the impugned state action be the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant. As a result, the mere fact that other forms of state action may also have a causal connection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to legislation is improperly constituted. Furthermore, Charter challenges need not target provisions that might have served to prevent or cure the harms alleged when the provision of general application to which those other provisions relate is a cause of the mischief. But when a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative scheme, the potential impact of related provisions, including preventative or curative measures, must be reviewed. Courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire statutory context, irrespective of how the parties frame their challenge of a legislative scheme. In the instant case, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in different ways to the applicants\u2019 Charter claim; however, they did not need to target these provisions in addition to s. 159.3 of the IRPR to constitute their challenge.\nIt was also open to the applicants to challenge s. 159.3 of the IRPR rather than administrative conduct, such as s. 102(3) reviews, and seek a declaration that the provision is of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter . The s. 102(3) reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make after\u2011the\u2011fact relief available on an individual basis. They are also distinct from targeted preventative measures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through legislative exceptions. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being maintained may also be susceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the existence of this alternative does not insulate s. 159.3 of the IRPR from Charter scrutiny. Similarly, while the applicants might have challenged administrative decisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, this does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3.\nThe first stage of the s. 7 analysis makes clear that s. 159.3 engages liberty and security of the person. Assessing the constitutional implications of effects that materialize in other countries does not amount to applying the Charter to foreign governments. The challenge in the instant case is directed at the legislative scheme, which is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. Whether an alleged effect of the scheme exists is a question of fact, for which the standard of review is palpable and overriding error, while the scope of a s. 7 interest is a question of law, for which the standard of review is correctness. Although the evidence does not support the Federal Court judge\u2019s finding that returnees face automatic detention in the United States, the risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three aspects of detention conditions as found by the Federal Court judge \u2014 the use of medical isolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care \u2014 fall within the scope of liberty and security of the person. In addition, taking the applicants\u2019 position on s. 7 engagement at its highest, it can be assumed that the following effects occur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: the non-accommodation of religious dietary needs, detention in a facility housing criminally convicted individuals and risks of refoulement flowing from the one-year bar policy and the United States\u2019 approach to gender\u2011based claims.\nTo establish s. 7 engagement, challengers must not only demonstrate effects falling within the scope of the s. 7 interests, but also that these effects are caused by Canadian state action. As Canada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign authorities, drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action requires showing that Canadian authorities were implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers will succeed in drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action at least where Canada\u2019s participation is a necessary precondition for the deprivation. Further, as Canada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will take, it must be shown that Canadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as a result of Canada\u2019s actions. This foreseeability threshold can be established by a reasonable inference, drawn on a balance of probabilities. What is required is a sufficient connection, having regard to the context of the case. Here, it is clear that the relevant Canadian state action \u2014 s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the broader legislative scheme \u2014 is a necessary precondition to each of the proven or presumed effects related to detention and refoulement. Without the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, individuals could advance their refugee protection claims in Canada; instead, they are sent back to the United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, where they face (or are presumed to face) these effects. However, the Federal Court judge erred in her application of the foreseeability standard established by the Court in Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, and explained in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101. With respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies in medical care, detention alongside criminally convicted individuals and the violation of religious dietary restrictions, the record does not support a finding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence of Canada\u2019s actions. By contrast, the record substantiates that the other negative effects were entirely foreseeable, such as the risk of detention, the \u201cone-year bar\u201d, the treatment of gender\u2011based claim and the widespread practice of medical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security of the person are causally connected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in relation to the principles of fundamental justice.\nThe applicable principles of fundamental justice in the instant case are overbreadth and gross disproportionality as described by the Court in Bedford. The \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard may well be relevant to the review of individualized decisions, but it is not relevant to Charter challenges to legislation; it is therefore not the appropriate measure here. When assessing whether legislation violates the Bedford principles of fundamental justice, courts must identify the legislative purpose and then assess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation breached any of the relevant principles. When a legislative objective is at issue as part of the s. 7 analysis, the focus is the purpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader legislative scheme may provide clues as to the narrower provisions\u2019 purpose. Here, taken together, the statement of objectives of the IRPA , the text, context, and scheme of the legislation, and the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non\u2011refoulement. It is in light of this purpose that the relevant s. 7 deprivations \u2014 the risk of discretionary detention and medical isolation, along with the presumed risks of refoulement \u2014 must be assessed for overbreadth and gross disproportionality.\nThe impugned legislative scheme in the instant case is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate. With respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the scheme is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose. The analysis is focused not on whether Parliament has chosen the least restrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the person in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the legislature. The risk of detention in the United States, with opportunities for release and review, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for refugee claims with another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal regime that governs refugee claimants\u2019 presence in that country. A degree of difference as between the legal schemes applicable in the two countries can be tolerated, so long as the American system is not fundamentally unfair. While the record shows that returnees face a risk of detention in the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that create opportunities for release and provide for review by administrative decision makers and courts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally unfair, and thus the risk of detention that returnees face is not overbroad. Similarly, the use of medical isolation to control public health risks is not fundamentally unfair. The applicants do not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical isolation is being used improperly in the American immigration detention system. With respect to gross disproportionality, the question is whether the impugned legislation\u2019s effects on the s. 7 interests are so grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they cannot rationally be supported. Neither a risk of detention with opportunities for release and review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In Canada, as in the United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted by our free and democratic societies.\nA provision mandating return to a real and not speculative risk of refoulement, however, would be overbroad as it would bear no relation to the purpose of the impugned legislation, which has respect for the non\u2011refoulement principle at its core. Such a provision would similarly be grossly disproportionate because it would, by definition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom, torture or other fundamental human rights violations. However, the impugned legislation in the instant case does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must be factored into the analysis, including administrative deferrals of removal (IRPA , s. 48(2) ), temporary resident permits (s. 24), humanitarian and compassionate exemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). When the impugned legislative scheme contains safety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms \u2014 properly interpreted and applied \u2014 are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur. When the IRPA\u2019s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted from return. If they are not returned to the United States, they do not face any risk of refoulement from the United States. The safety valves can therefore intervene to cure what might otherwise be unconstitutional effects. Moreover, these mechanisms are properly considered within the principles of fundamental justice stage of s. 7 because they can be exercised in order to address the specific deprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement. Properly interpreted, these mechanisms in the broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that individuals are not subjected to real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such risks do exist. These mechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that Article 6 of the Safe Third Country Agreement preserves for Canada to consider claims when it is in its public interest to do so. The mere fact that the mechanisms predate the treaty does not make them irrelevant; when the agreement was signed, Canadian domestic law already included provisions that could facilitate individualized consideration of claimants\u2019 circumstances. Thus, even assuming that claimants face real and not speculative risks of refoulement from the United States, the Canadian legislative scheme provides safety valves that guard against such risks. For that reason, the legislative scheme implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of fundamental justice. Consequently, no breach of s. 7 of the Charter has been established, and it is not necessary to undertake a s. 1 analysis.\nThe challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter should be sent back to the Federal Court for determination. The basis of this claim is that women fearing gender\u2011based persecution are adversely affected by the legislative scheme. Given the profound seriousness of the matter, the size and complexity of the record and the conflicting affidavit evidence, it would be imprudent for the Court to dispose of the equality rights claim as would a court of first instance and thus leave the losing party with no avenue of appeal. While the Federal Court judge should not be faulted for exercising judicial restraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim, a false economy has arisen due to the need to remit these issues. The principle of judicial policy underlying restraint in constitutional cases is sound, but it must be weighed against other factors, such as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. Claims based on s. 15 are not secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The Charter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s. 15 occupies a lower tier.\nCases Cited\nApplied: Canada (Attorney General) v.

Conclusion\n183\nI. Overview\n[1] Canada and the United States are parties to a bilateral treaty designed to enhance their sharing of responsibility for considering refugee status claims. In essence, the treaty provides that refugee claimants must, as a general rule, seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries, Can. T.S. 2004 No. 2, is known as the \u201cSafe Third Country Agreement\u201d. The treaty\u2019s preamble speaks to the parties\u2019 mutual recognition that both countries offer generous systems of refugee protection, such that claimants can find effective protection in either country. Sharing responsibility is thus understood as justified, even though the laws of each country differ.\n[2] The Safe Third Country Agreement is given effect in Canadian domestic law through the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (\u201cIRPA \u201d), and its regulations. Under s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA , refugee status claims are ineligible to be considered in Canada if the claimant came from a country designated by the regulations. Countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with their \u201cnon\u2011refoulement\u201d obligations under international law. These obligations \u2014 which prohibit directly or indirectly returning a person to a place where they would face certain kinds of irreparable harm, including threats to their life or freedom, torture and cruel or degrading treatment \u2014 are the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime (see, for a plain language summary, United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, The principle of non\u2011refoulement under international human rights law, July 5, 2018 (online)). A designated country is thus seen as a safe third country in that it is viewed as an appropriate partner with which Canada can share responsibility for considering refugee claims. The United States is designated under s. 159.3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002\u2011227 (\u201cIRPR\u201d). It is the sole designated country in Canadian law.\n[3] The appellants challenge this scheme principally on the basis that it violates the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . They claim that the legislation results in Canadian immigration officers summarily returning claimants to the United States without considering whether the United States will respect their rights under international law, including those relating to non\u2011refoulement and detention.\n[4] Certain questions are not in issue in this appeal. First, there is no debate that safe third country agreements, as a general matter, may be compatible with international law (see, e.g., I. Atak and F. Cr\u00e9peau, \u201cAsylum in the twenty\u2011first century: Trends and challenges\u201d, in A. Triandafyllidou, ed., Routledge Handbook of Immigration and Refugee Studies (2nd ed. 2023), 358, at p. 363). Second, the appellants do not attack the validity of the Safe Third Country Agreement itself. Third, this Court is not tasked with assessing the wisdom of Canadian immigration policy, a matter that courts are not institutionally designed to evaluate, much less reform. Fourth, this Court is not asked to resolve the thorny issue of irregular entry into Canada at border crossings other than official land ports of entry (see, e.g., A. Macklin, \u201cCitizenship, Non-Citizenship and The Rule of Law\u201d (2018), 69 U.N.B.L.J. 19, at pp. 35\u201137). Instead, the appeal focuses on whether the Canadian legislative regime implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement \u2014 that is, the relevant provisions of the IRPA and IRPR \u2014 complies with constitutional and administrative law requirements.\n[5] The complexion of the judgments below on the Charter questions could not be more different. The Federal Court judge, who reviewed the evidence first\u2011hand, found that the alleged s. 7 violations were largely substantiated and most grave. Deprivations of liberty and security of the person for refugee claimants arose because those returned to the United States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm relating to immigration detention. In the result, she was persuaded that s. 7 was violated and that this breach was not justified under s. 1. She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 .\n[6] By contrast, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Charter challenge was not properly constituted and thus allowed the appeal brought by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Despite the appellants\u2019 evidence and the findings of the Federal Court judge, the Court of Appeal found that the causation requirements for a Charter claim were not met because the appellants improperly targeted the legislation rather than administrative conduct. Respectfully, I disagree with the Court of Appeal and prefer the view \u2014 shared by both parties on appeal to this Court \u2014 that the regulation designating the United States was an appropriate focus of the Charter challenge. In particular, since the s. 159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant ineligibility determinations, it is properly subject to constitutional scrutiny.\n[7] Further, I agree with the Federal Court judge\u2019s findings that the liberty and security of the person interests of refugee claimants are engaged by the Canadian legislation that renders their claims ineligible. Specifically, I reject the notion that the claimants\u2019 s. 7 interests are not engaged simply because the legislation contains measures that could ultimately have offered protection. This, I think, rests on a misunderstanding of Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, and is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s approach to s. 7 set out in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101.\n[8] The findings of fact relating to the treatment of refugee claimants made by the Federal Court judge are troubling. Apart from her determinations that detention in the United States is \u201cautomatic\u201d and that detention conditions cause a risk of refoulement, the respondents have failed to show that those conclusions are tainted by reviewable errors. While she made no finding that American asylum policies give rise to a risk of refoulement, I am nevertheless persuaded that the record substantiated her view that the designation of the United States engages the liberty and security of the person interests spoken to in s. 7 of the Charter .\n[9] After engagement of these constitutionally protected interests is established, however, the s. 7 analysis turns to what scholar Gerald Heckman, writing prior to his appointment to the bench, describes as the \u201ckey question\u201d in refugee protection decision making: whether the deprivation of the liberty or security of the person interests is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (\u201cRevisiting the Application of Section 7 of the Charter in Immigration and Refugee Protection\u201d (2017), 68 U.N.B.L.J. 312, at p. 356). This requires an examination of whether Canadian state action \u201chas interfered with those fundamental interests pursuant to a fair process and in a manner rationally connected and proportionate to the objectives of Canada\u2019s immigration laws\u201d (ibid.). The focus of this examination is not on whether asylum law in the United States mirrors the law in Canada. Instead, the focus is on the purpose and effects of the Canadian legislative scheme. Of particular significance here is whether the ineligibility rule in the legislation is tempered by related provisions that provide relief from potential s. 7 violations. As this Court held in Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, speaking specifically to what are usefully described as curative exemptions, legislative \u201csafety valve[s]\u201d can ensure that deprivations of the s. 7 interests are not arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate (para. 113).\n[10] From this perspective, and notwithstanding the findings of the Federal Court judge that the s. 7 interests are engaged, the challenge to s. 159.3 of the IRPR ultimately fails. The IRPA and the IRPR contain exceptions, exemptions and review obligations that address the problems associated with ineligibility and removal from Canada. These provisions give voice in Canadian law to the idea, expressed in Article 6 of the treaty, that each government should be free to examine any refugee status claim when it determines that doing so is in its public interest. In particular, even where ineligibility under the scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the person \u2014 as the Federal Court judge found \u2014 the legislative scheme\u2019s discretionary exemptions ensure compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. In sum, the legislation is tailored to prevent certain infringements of s. 7 interests and, importantly for present purposes, survives constitutional scrutiny here because legislative safety valves provide curative relief.\n[11] While the Federal Court judge stated that safeguards in the scheme were \u201cillusory\u201d, her assessment did not consider all the relevant safety valves. This omission was an error of law that led her to improperly discount how the legislative scheme allows Canada to consider refugee status claims when the principles of fundamental justice so require, notwithstanding their presumptive ineligibility. As a result, I am respectfully of the view that the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the designation of the United States for the purposes of the Safe Third Country Agreement breached s. 7 cannot stand.\n[12] It may well be that, in practice, administrative decision makers do not always construe or deploy the legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the legislation itself remains valid, but administrative and Charter relief remains available on an individual basis. For instance, the Charter can prohibit administrative actors from returning refugee claimants to places where they would face circumstances that would shock the conscience of Canadians. Yet, while some of the appellants have detailed the difficulties they faced in seeking refugee protection at Canadian land ports of entry, they have not asked this Court to provide them with individualized relief. Instead, they focus their constitutional challenge solely on alleged defects in the legislative scheme itself in order to have s. 159.3 of the IRPR declared of no force or effect under the Constitution Act, 1982 .\n[13] While I reject the appellants\u2019 s. 7 challenge to the legislative scheme and their other arguments, I would nevertheless allow the appeal in part. I would remit the appellants\u2019 claim that the legislation violates Charter \u2011guaranteed equality rights, which was not decided by either court below. The appellants\u2019 s. 15 claim rests on grave allegations that women facing gender\u2011based persecution and sexual violence are often denied refugee status in the United States contrary to Article 33 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (\u201cRefugee Convention\u201d). The evidentiary basis for the appellants\u2019 s. 15 claim remains disputed and no factual findings were made in the Federal Court on which we can rely on appeal. It would be imprudent for this Court to dispose of the equality rights claim as would a court of first instance and thus leave the losing party with no avenue of appeal.\nII. The Parties\n[14] The appellants are individual refugee claimants and public interest litigants. The respondents are the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.\n[15] Each individual appellant arrived from the United States to claim refugee protection in Canada. Because they arrived at land ports of entry, their claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, pursuant to s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR.\n[16] ABC and her daughters are citizens of El Salvador, where they say they were subject to gender\u2011based persecution and sexual violence committed by gangs. They fled to the United States in 2016, where they were initially detained. American officials advised them they were subject to removal proceedings. ABC and her daughters were released for the duration of those proceedings. In 2017, ABC and her daughters arrived at the land port of entry at Fort Erie, Ontario to claim refugee protection in Canada. They say that a Canadian Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) officer advised them that they should withdraw their claim, as they would be found ineligible in keeping with the Safe Third Country Agreement. They decided to return to the United States. About six months later, ABC and her daughters again attempted to make a claim for refugee protection. ABC\u2019s husband, whose own refugee claim in Canada was pending, retained legal counsel in anticipation that the CBSA would determine that ABC\u2019s and her daughters\u2019 claims were ineligible. When the CBSA made that determination, it agreed to defer removal briefly. Counsel applied for judicial review and also obtained a stay of removal, which remains in effect while this appeal is pending.\n[17] Ms. Mustefa is an Ethiopian citizen and member of the Oromo ethnic group. When she was 11, she travelled alone to the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa for medical treatment. She stayed there through the end of high school. Ms. Mustefa says that oppression of the Oromo in Ethiopia escalated around this time. She decided not to return to Ethiopia but believed a policy known as the \u201cone\u2011year bar\u201d made her ineligible to claim asylum in the United States. In 2017, Ms. Mustefa travelled to the land port of entry in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec to make a claim for refugee protection in Canada. The CBSA determined her claim was ineligible. She was returned to the United States, where she says that American officials detained her in solitary confinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her for another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of criminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not respected. While detained, Ms. Mustefa was able to communicate with her family and with legal counsel, and she was later released on a bond. Ms. Mustefa applied for permanent residence in the United States, which was granted in 2021.\n[18] Ms. Al Nahass and her three children are citizens of Syria. She and her family lived in Saudi Arabia, where her husband worked. In 2015, Ms. Al Nahass travelled to Syria for medical treatment. She says that during that trip, she was kidnapped, attacked and threatened with sexual violence. The family subsequently travelled to the United States. While there, she says that her husband lost his job, jeopardizing the family\u2019s residency in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Al Nahass feared returning to Syria and began the asylum process in the United States. During this process, Ms. Al Nahass says that she grew concerned with what she perceived as public hatred expressed towards Muslim and Arab people and with actions taken by the United States executive. She and her family decided to seek refugee protection in Canada. When they did so at the land port of entry in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, the CBSA determined their claims were ineligible. Ms. Al Nahass contacted legal counsel, who filed a motion for an emergency stay of removal at the Federal Court. An interim stay was granted. Before the full stay motion could be heard, the Minister granted the family temporary resident permits. They have now been granted permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n[19] The appellants introduced into evidence affidavits from ten anonymized, non\u2011party affiants. Each affiant says that they were returned to the United States after their claims were found ineligible pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. The nine affiants who answered written cross\u2011examinations stated that, after their return, they were detained by American authorities. With one exception, they were released from detention pursuant to an administrative decision or bond hearing. Likewise, they made asylum claims in the United States with the assistance of counsel. One affiant could not meet the bond set for their release. That individual was removed from the United States after unsuccessfully appealing the immigration judge\u2019s unfavourable decision to the American Board of Immigration Appeals and, subsequently, to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nIII. Proceedings Below\nA. Federal Court, 2020 FC 770, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 209 (McDonald J.)\n[20] The appellants challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis that the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA . They also said that s. 159.3 of the IRPR and s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA unjustifiably violated ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter . The Federal Court judge rejected the argument that the regulation was ultra vires but found an unjustified s. 7 breach. Because of her conclusion on s. 7, she declined to rule on the s. 15 claim.\n[21] The vires argument was rejected because Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada, 2008 FCA 229, [2009] 3 F.C.R. 136 (\u201cCCR (2008)\u201d), at para. 57, held that whether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on facts at the time of promulgation.\n[22] The Federal Court judge found that the Charter applied. Deprivations effected by foreign actors remain \u201csubject to the guarantee of fundamental justice, as long as there is a sufficient causal connection between our government\u2019s participation and the deprivation\u201d (para. 100, citing Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; see also Federal Court reasons, at para. 93, citing Bedford, at paras. 58 and 75\u201176).\n[23] In the Federal Court judge\u2019s view, the impugned scheme engages \u201cliberty\u201d because \u201cineligible [Safe Third Country Agreement] claimants are . . . immediately and automatically imprisoned by U.S. authorities\u201d (para. 103). It infringes security of the person given the risk of refoulement and the conditions of detention in the United States. She found there was a \u201creal and not speculative\u201d risk that ABC would have been refouled from the United States based on \u201cthe challenges in advancing an asylum clai[m] for those detained\u201d, such as barriers to accessing legal advice (para. 106). In addition, she concluded that some detention conditions in the United States engage security of the person since being subjected to these conditions flows directly from Canadian officials\u2019 conduct in returning claimants there.\n[24] The Federal Court judge held that these deprivations do not comport with the principles of fundamental justice. She concluded that, despite the suggestion that there are certain \u201csafeguards\u201d available to protect against overbreadth and gross disproportionality, these remedies \u201care largely out of reach and are therefore \u2018illusory\u2019\u201d (paras. 129-30, distinguishing Tapambwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 34, [2020] 1 F.C.R. 700).\n[25] The Federal Court judge held that the s. 7 violations were not justified under s. 1 of the Charter and \u201cdecline[d]\u201d to address the s. 15 arguments (see para. 154, citing Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 93). She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 , and suspended the declaration for six months.\nB. Federal Court of Appeal, 2021 FCA 72, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 294 (No\u00ebl C.J. and Stratas and Laskin JJ.A.)\n[26] Stratas J.A., writing for a unanimous Court of Appeal, allowed the ministers\u2019 appeal, dismissed the cross\u2011appeal of the s. 15 claim and the ultra vires argument, set aside the judgment of the Federal Court, and dismissed the applications for judicial review.\n[27] The court found that the Charter claim was not properly constituted because it failed to account for two practical rules flowing from the requirement that impugned state action must be the cause of a Charter infringement (para. 57). The first rule is that \u201cprovisions in an interrelated legislative scheme cannot be taken in isolation and selectively challenged\u201d because \u201c[o]ther related provisions may be responsible [for the alleged Charter violation] or may prevent or cure any possible defects\u201d (para. 58(a), citing PHS). The second rule is that when administrative action or inaction is the source of a rights infringement, that is what must be challenged rather than the legislation (para. 58(b), citing Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2000 SCC 69, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120). The court concluded that if anything were to blame for the alleged violations, it would be the Government of Canada\u2019s reviews of the United States\u2019 designation, which are required under s. 102(3) of the IRPA , and related administrative conduct. Thus, by targeting s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR, the challenge was improperly constituted.\n[28] Despite allowing the appeal on this basis, the Court of Appeal addressed certain substantive s. 7 issues. First, it noted that the Federal Court judge erred in finding that returnees are \u201cautomatically detained\u201d (para. 138, see also paras. 139-40). Second, the court rejected the finding that the scheme\u2019s safety valves were \u201cillusory\u201d (para. 144). Third, the court found error with the Federal Court judge\u2019s analysis of American detention conditions (para. 146). Fourth, it also perceived errors in her analysis of the principles of fundamental justice. For the Court of Appeal, there was \u201cno evidence that could support a finding that the treatment of returnees to the United States at the Canada\u2011United States border \u2018shocks the conscience\u2019\u201d (para. 161). In any event, the court considered the scheme to be neither overbroad nor grossly disproportionate.\n[29] The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to address the substance of the s. 15 claim. Had it been necessary, the court wrote that \u201c[w]here, as here, no factual findings have been made on the section 15 issues, it is generally best for us to send the matter back to the Federal Court because of its expertise in fact-finding\u201d (para. 173).\nIV. Issues\n[30] The appellants raise three issues: Is s. 159.3 of the IRPR ultra vires? Does s. 159.3 unjustifiably breach s. 7 of the Charter ? Should the s. 15 Charter claim be remitted to the Federal Court or decided based on the record on appeal?\nV. Statutory and Regulatory Scheme and Context\n[31] The impugned regulation is part of the legislative scheme that implements a bilateral treaty between Canada and the United States, that is, the Safe Third Country Agreement. While not itself challenged, this treaty shapes the interpretation of its implementing scheme (see National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at p. 1371). It is useful to examine the treaty and the legislation in turn, as they remain substantively distinct under Canada\u2019s \u201cdualist system\u201d for the application of international legal instruments (Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para. 150; see G. van Ert, Using International Law in Canadian Courts (2nd ed. 2008), ch. 7). An additional protocol to the treaty has been signed and the implementing legislation has been amended since the hearing (Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Examination of Eligibility to Refer Claim), SOR\/2023-58; Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries, March 24, 2023 (online)). I refrain from commenting on these instruments as they do not directly affect the substance of the issues on appeal before the Court.\nA. Safe Third Country Agreement\n[32] About 30 years ago, Canada and the United States undertook the negotiation of an agreement to share responsibility for refugee status claims. The Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\u201cUNHCR\u201d) were among the organizations whose comments resulted in substantive amendments to a draft of the Safe Third Country Agreement. The two states signed the agreement in 2002.\n[33] The preamble to the agreement expressly acknowledges the governments\u2019 international obligations to refugees (paras. 1, 2 and 8). It also addresses the parties\u2019 shared determination to safeguard for each eligible claimant \u201caccess to a full and fair refugee status determination procedure\u201d (para. 8) and emphasizes that both countries offer generous refugee protection systems (para. 4). Accompanying the treaty is a Statement of Principles associated with its implementation, which states that the parties intend to abide by principles that include safeguards for claimants, such as the opportunity for claimants to have a third party present during proceedings (Procedural issues associated with implementing the Agreement for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries: Statement of Principles, August 30, 2002 (online)).\n[34] The principle animating the Safe Third Country Agreement is that \u201cthe country of last presence shall examine, in accordance with its refugee status determination system, the refugee status claim of any person who arrives at a land border port of entry\u201d (Article 4(1)). This is the \u201ccrux\u201d of the treaty (A. Macklin, \u201cDisappearing Refugees: Reflections on the Canada\u2011U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement\u201d (2005), 36 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 365, at p. 371) or its \u201cgeneral principle\u201d (S. Baglay and M. Jones, Refugee Law (2nd ed. 2017), at p. 279). The country of last presence is \u201cthat country, being either Canada or the United States, in which the refugee claimant was physically present immediately prior to making a refugee status claim at a land border port of entry\u201d (Article 1(1)(a)). The parties committed to reviewing the agreement and to inviting the UNHCR to participate in the first review (Article 8(3)).\n[35] While Article 4(1) sets out a broad principle, the treaty is limited in its application. To begin, the governments sought to ensure that \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201cchain\u201d refoulement would not occur. They agreed that individuals returned to Canada or the United States would not be removed therefrom until that country had adjudicated the individual\u2019s refugee status claim (Article 3). They also did not seek to apply the agreement to citizens or habitual residents of either country (Article 2) and provided for exceptions for unaccompanied minors and family reunification (Article 4(2)).\n[36] Even when the principle articulated in Article 4(1) would apply, the parties agreed that there should be an authority to exempt claimants. Article 6 provides that \u201ceither Party may at its own discretion examine any refugee status claim made to that Party where it determines that it is in its public interest to do so\u201d.\nB. Domestic Implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement\n[37] Section 101(1) (e) of the IRPA implements the core principle of the Safe Third Country Agreement by providing that the claims of individuals who \u201ccame directly or indirectly to Canada from a country designated by the regulations, other than a country of their nationality or their former habitual residence\u201d are \u201cineligible\u201d to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division. This gives domestic effect to the principle set out in Article 4(1) that an individual\u2019s country of last presence will examine their refugee status claim. Various other rules in the IRPA and its regulations affect the application of this \u201cgeneral rule\u201d, including (1) designation and review mechanisms; (2) limits to the scope of the general rule; and (3) exemptions.\n(1) Designation and Review Mechanisms\n[38] The IRPA sets forth the relevant criteria for when a country may be designated by the Governor in Council under s. 101(1)(e). Only countries that comply with the non-refoulement obligations under the relevant international conventions are eligible:\n102 (1) The regulations may govern matters relating to the application of sections 100 and 101 . . . and, for the purpose of sharing responsibility with governments of foreign states for the consideration of refugee claims, may include provisions\n(a) designating countries that comply with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture;\n[39] Section 102(2) lists factors to be considered when ascertaining whether a country complies with refugee protection standards mandated by the Conventions:\n(2) The following factors are to be considered in designating a country under paragraph (1)(a):\n(a) whether the country is a party to the Refugee Convention and to the Convention Against Torture;\n(b) its policies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee Convention and with respect to obligations under the Convention Against Torture;\n(c) its human rights record; and\n(d) whether it is party to an agreement with the Government of Canada for the purpose of sharing responsibility with respect to claims for refugee protection.\n[40] The Governor in Council \u201cmust ensure the continuing review\u201d of the s. 102(2) factors with respect to each designated country (s. 102(3)). The United States is the only country that has been designated (Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2004\u2011217). Section 159.3 of the IRPR, which the appellants challenge, provides:\n159.3 The United States is designated under paragraph 102(1)(a) of the Act as a country that complies with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, and is a designated country for the purpose of the application of paragraph 101(1)(e) of the Act.\n(2) Limits to the General Ineligibility Rule\n[41] Various provisions in the IRPR narrow the application of the ineligibility rule by ensuring that not all refugee claimants arriving from the United States are returned there. The regulations do this in two ways. First, the regulations contain limitations that closely track the contours of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Safe Third Country Agreement. For instance, under the regime considered in this appeal, s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility applies only to the claims of individuals who arrive at land ports of entry \u2014 not elsewhere along the land border, by ship or by air (IRPR, s. 159.4). There are specific exceptions for individuals with family in Canada, to facilitate family reunification (s. 159.5(a) to (d)). As the treaty contemplates, these exceptions are applied according to Canada\u2019s domestic understanding of the family (Article 1(2); IRPR, s. 159.1). There are also exceptions for unaccompanied minors (s. 159.5(e)) and for individuals who have certain Canadian immigration statuses (s. 159.5(f) and (g)). Finally, the regulations ensure that certain individuals whose claims will not be adjudicated in the United States can access the Canadian system (s. 159.5(h)).\n[42] Second, the regulations include an exception reflecting Canada\u2019s discretion, preserved under Article 6 of the treaty, to consider claims when doing so is in its public interest (Baglay and Jones, at p. 279). Section 159.6 of the IRPR ensures that claimants who establish that they have been charged with, or convicted of, an offence punishable by the death penalty in the United States or another country are not returned.\n(3) Exemptions From the Application of the General Ineligibility Rule\n[43] Individuals subject to the provisions implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement cannot access some of the statutory mechanisms available to claimants in different circumstances. For instance, returnees are not eligible for a pre\u2011removal risk assessment before they are removed (IRPA , s. 112(2) (b)). Further, there is no administrative appeal body set out in the IRPA for them. Judicial review at the Federal Court, however, remains available (s. 72). Judges may grant stays of removal while such proceedings are ongoing (Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106, r. 373; see also Baglay and Jones, at pp. 354\u201157).\n[44] The IRPA does, however, contain mechanisms for temporary or permanent exemptions from return to the United States (see, e.g., H. Mayrand and A. Smith\u2011Gr\u00e9goire, \u201c\u00c0 la crois\u00e9e du chemin Roxham et de la rh\u00e9torique politique: d\u00e9mystifier l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs\u201d (2018), 48 R.D.U.S. 321, at p. 342). First, officers may grant an administrative deferral from the enforcement of a removal order. This authority flows from s. 48(2) of the IRPA , which requires that removal orders be enforced \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Courts have held that this provision leaves officers with discretion to delay the enforcement of a removal order (see, e.g., Atawnah v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 144, [2017] 1 F.C.R. 153, at paras. 13\u201118; Revell v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 355, at para. 50; Tapambwa, at para. 87). In this case, ABC and her daughters benefitted from an administrative deferral of removal, during which their counsel applied for a stay of removal.\n[45] Second, officers may grant a temporary resident permit. This authority flows from s. 24 of the IRPA , which allows an officer to issue a permit if they are \u201cof the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances\u201d. The Minister or their delegate may also make instructions to guide officers in determining when to issue such permits (s. 24(3)). Here, Ms. Al Nahass\u2019s family received temporary resident permits while the Minister considered whether to grant permanent exemptions.\n[46] Third, the Minister may grant an exemption based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, as occurred for Ms. Al Nahass\u2019s family. The Minister may exempt certain foreign nationals who are inadmissible from any of the requirements of the IRPA . They may grant exemptions where they view doing so as \u201cjustified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected\u201d (s. 25.1(1)). This assessment must \u201cconsider and give weight to all relevant humanitarian and compassionate considerations in a particular case\u201d (Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 33 (emphasis in original)).\n[47] Fourth, the Minister has a further discretion to exempt foreign nationals who are inadmissible from any of the requirements of the IRPA . The Minister may do so when they are \u201cof the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations\u201d (s. 25.2(1)). The respondents observe that this provision permits the Minister to establish a temporary public policy exempting individuals who are part of a specified group from the ineligibility provision.\n[48] Any removal order against a foreign national can be stayed while the Minister makes their decision in relation to s. 25.1(1) or 25.2(1) (IRPR, s. 233).\nVI. Administrative Law Issues\n[49] I turn now to the appellants\u2019 argument that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires because of post\u2011promulgation constraints on the Governor in Council\u2019s statutory authority to maintain a designation. First, the appellants submit that it was unreasonable, given the factors in s. 102 of the IRPA , to maintain the United States\u2019 designation when there is evidence that many refugees cannot access effective protection there. Second, they say that the Governor in Council breached its s. 102(3) obligation to ensure continuing review of the United States\u2019 compliance.\n[50] I would not give effect to these arguments. I agree with the respondents that the vires of s. 159.3 of the IRPR must be examined at the time of promulgation.\n[51] Regulations \u201cderive their validity from the statute which creates the power, and not from the executive body by which they are made\u201d (Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals, [1943] S.C.R. 1, at p. 13, per Duff C.J., quoting The Zamora, [1916] 2 A.C. 77 (P.C.), at p. 90). The limits imposed by the enabling statute are therefore fundamental to determining whether a regulation is intra vires (see J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 165).\n[52] Here, the appellants misconstrue the limitations imposed by s. 102 of the IRPA . The Governor in Council may promulgate regulations \u201cdesignating countries that comply with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture\u201d (s. 102(1)(a)). The statute also prescribes factors for the Governor in Council to consider \u201cin designating a country\u201d (s. 102(2)). These factors concern when countries may be designated. Thus, s. 102(1)(a) and (2) establishes conditions precedent to designation for the purposes of s. 101(1)(e), as the Federal Court of Appeal held in CCR (2008) (para. 75). The statute requires that these conditions be met before, not after, a country is designated (see E. A. Driedger, \u201cSubordinate Legislation\u201d (1960), 38 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 8).\n[53] The Governor in Council does, however, have statutory obligations in the period after a country is designated pursuant to s. 102(1)(a). Section 102(3) creates an obligation to \u201censure the continuing review\u201d of the s. 102(2) factors. These reviews are not directed at whether the regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute, which is the proper focus of a vires challenge. In this sense, the s. 102(3) reviews are outside the scope of a challenge alleging that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA . Instead, the continuing reviews are a distinct statutory obligation of the Governor in Council. As a result, s. 102(3) reviews may be challenged based on administrative law principles (see C.A. reasons, at para. 96). However, the appellants did not seek judicial review of particular s. 102(3) reviews conducted after the promulgation of s. 159.3.\n[54] Focusing on the appropriate date and recognizing that the s. 102(3) reviews are outside the scope of a vires argument, I am persuaded that the appellants fail on this point. As this Court has held, \u201c[r]egulations benefit from a presumption of validity\u201d (Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, at para. 25; see also P.-A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para. 1314). Thus, to succeed in their argument based on s. 159.3\u2019s inconsistency with the provisions they rely on, the appellants must show that on the date of promulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by s. 102(1) (a) or (2) of the IRPA . Because they have directed their argument at post\u2011promulgation developments, the appellants have not done so. Accordingly, the appellants\u2019 submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires should be rejected.\n[55] As a result, addressing other aspects of the appellants\u2019 administrative law claims is unnecessary, including the appropriate standard of review and how that standard would be applied in the circumstances of this case.\nVII. The Section 7 Claim\n[56] To establish a violation of s. 7 of the Charter , challengers must first show that the impugned legislation deprives them of life, liberty or security of the person. This analysis asks whether the legislation \u201cengage[s]\u201d those interests, in the sense that it causes a limitation or negative impact on, an infringement of, or an interference with them (Carter, at para. 55; see also Bedford, at paras. 57\u201158, 90 and 111). A risk of such a deprivation suffices (see, e.g., Carter, at para. 62; R. v. Malmo\u2011Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 89; Suresh, at para. 27). Second, challengers must show that the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[57] The appellants say that the Federal Court judge\u2019s findings were grounded in the evidence, which demonstrates that s. 159.3 of the IRPR causes deprivations of liberty and security of the person. They say these deprivations are not consistent with the applicable principles of fundamental justice: overbreadth and gross disproportionality. The appellants argue discretionary remedies cannot ensure that deprivations accord with the principles of fundamental justice and, in any event, the Federal Court judge found that these safeguards are illusory.\n[58] In my respectful view, the Federal Court judge made errors at both stages of her s. 7 analysis. The legislative scheme engages s. 7 in some, but not all, of the respects she identified. Moreover, it does accord with the principles of fundamental justice.\nA. Properly Constituting a Section 7 Challenge\n[59] The parties agree that s. 159.3 of the IRPR was an appropriate target for a Charter challenge. The Federal Court of Appeal had disagreed, holding that the claim was not properly constituted because it should have been directed at other forms of state action that are the \u201creal cause\u201d of any possible infringements. In particular, the court concluded that the appellants should have targeted the administrative reviews, required by s. 102(3) of the IRPA , of the United States\u2019 designation and related administrative conduct. In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal erred by misapplying the relevant Charter causation jurisprudence.\n[60] This Court has long recognized that, to succeed, a Charter claim must show a causal link between state action and the violation of the relevant right or freedom (see, e.g., Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at p. 447, per Dickson J., as he then was). In Bedford, this Court held that a \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d must be established, which does not require that the impugned state action \u201cbe the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant\u201d (para. 76). As a result, the mere fact that other forms of state action may also have a causal connection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to legislation \u2014 such as s. 159.3 of the IRPR \u2014 is improperly constituted.\n[61] The Court of Appeal dismissed the Charter challenges for failing to adhere to two propositions it drew from this Court\u2019s causation jurisprudence. First, challengers should not attack provisions in artificial isolation. Second, when administrative conduct under legislation is responsible for unconstitutional effects, that action or inaction must be challenged, not the legislation. While these two propositions do speak to important considerations, in my respectful view they do not justify the conclusion that the appellants\u2019 challenge is improperly constituted.\n(1) The Relevance of Preventative and Curative Measures to the Section 7 Challenge\n[62] Provisions in a complex, interrelated legislative scheme should not be viewed in isolation. Generally, the constitutionality of these provisions can only be evaluated by considering the entire scheme. However, this did not preclude the appellants from targeting s. 159.3 of the IRPR.\n[63] When a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative scheme, the potential impact of related provisions, including those that may serve to \u201cprevent or cure any possible defects\u201d, must be reviewed (C.A. reasons, at para. 58(a) (emphasis added)). The success or failure of a Charter claim may turn on arguments or evidence related to preventative or curative provisions. But this should rarely preclude consideration of whether life, liberty or security of the person under s. 7 are \u201cengaged\u201d.\n[64] Legislation often implicates interests that s. 7 protects. At times, this will result from broad provisions that would \u2014 taken on their own \u2014 have constitutionally relevant effects on life, liberty or security of the person. However, legislatures can include related provisions within a scheme that temper those effects. When these measures are part of an integrated legislative whole, they must be accounted for when assessing the constitutionality of rules of general application.\n[65] In PHS, for example, this Court considered the linkages between a general rule and provisions related to it. At issue was, among other things, a general statutory prohibition on possession of controlled substances except as authorized under the regulations. The statute gave the Minister the power \u201cto issue exemptions for medical or scientific reasons, or for any purpose the Minister deems to be in the public interest\u201d from the application of any provision of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c. 19 (\u201cCDSA \u201d) (PHS, at para. 39).\n[66] The Court found that exemptions acted \u201cas a safety valve that prevents the [statute] from applying where such application would be arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate in its effects\u201d (PHS, at para. 113). In other words, when the Minister\u2019s discretion was exercised, these provisions cured the constitutional defects that would have arisen had the general prohibition been left to apply to those who ought not to have been caught by it: the staff and clients of a safe injection facility (paras. 94 and 114).\n[67] Here, the Federal Court of Appeal rightly drew on PHS in stating that related provisions in a legislative scheme may \u201cprevent\u201d or \u201ccure\u201d constitutional defects (C.A. reasons, at para. 58(a)). The exemptions discussed in PHS were \u201ccurative\u201d in that they made discretionary relief available to those who would otherwise be inappropriately subject to the general prohibition. In other words, the exemption remedied the specific harm that would have flowed from the application of the general rule.\n[68] Curative measures are thus remedial: they repair a breach that would be caused by a general rule by providing a targeted exemption after the fact (see PHS, at para. 41). These measures often work together with preventative measures to limit the scope of a provision of general application. Preventative measures narrow a general rule by precluding its application in anticipation of a breach, often through legislative exceptions. These categories are not watertight compartments, nor are they exhaustive. Moreover, if a class of individuals habitually receive individualized exemptions after the fact, a legislature could enact a class\u2011wide exception that applies in advance.\n[69] Charter challenges need not target preventative and curative provisions when the provision of general application to which they relate is a cause of the alleged mischief. Following PHS, courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire statutory context, irrespective of how the parties frame their challenge of a legislative scheme. Indeed, a failure to consider a relevant related provision can \u201cundermine the legitimacy\u201d of constitutional analysis (R. v. Parker (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 171, per Rosenberg J.A.).\n[70] In the legislative scheme at issue in this case, examples of preventative measures include the death penalty exception in s. 159.6 of the IRPR and the various family reunification exceptions in s. 159.5(a) to (d). Curative measures include the availability of temporary resident permits under s. 24, humanitarian and compassionate exemptions under s. 25.1(1), and public policy exceptions under s. 25.2(1).\n[71] At the engagement stage, preventative provisions can tailor a provision of general application so carefully that it never threatens s. 7 interests. For instance, s. 159.6 of the IRPR prevents the threat to life that might emerge from returning individuals subject to the death penalty. In so doing, preventative provisions like s. 159.6 rule out certain s. 7 engagements. By contrast, curative provisions will rarely, if ever, preclude the engagement of s. 7. PHS provides direct support for this proposition, as this Court held that the general prohibition on possession engaged s. 7 despite the availability of safety valves. Curative provisions create exceptional departures from a general rule; they are typically available only after a determination that the general rule applies. The possibility of obtaining an exemption is therefore a path through which the risks the general rule poses to life, liberty or security of the person can sometimes be avoided. In such cases, the threat to the s. 7 interests persists, but it does not always materialize.\n[72] Some have suggested that because curative mechanisms are available, refugee claimants\u2019 s. 7 interests are not engaged at the exclusion or inadmissibility determination stage. This assertion rests on a statement in B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, that it is at the \u201csubsequent pre\u2011removal risk assessment stage of the IRPA \u2019s refugee protection process that s. 7 is typically engaged\u201d rather than earlier stages (para. 75). This comment in B010 relied on a passage from Febles, which spoke to the Charter \u2011compliance of an exclusion provision in the IRPA . Some scholars have criticized this view of curative mechanisms\u2019 role in engagement, saying that dicta from these cases should not deflect analysis from this Court\u2019s approach to s. 7 engagement established in other contexts (see Heckman, at p. 313; C. Grey, \u201cThinkable: The Charter and Refugee Law after Appulonappa and B010\u201d (2016), 76 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111, at pp. 131\u201135 and 139; see also H. Stewart, Fundamental Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2nd ed. 2019), at pp. 77\u201181 and 342).\n[73] Febles stated that an exclusion provision was \u201cconsistent\u201d with s. 7 of the Charter (para. 67). In line with Bedford and PHS, Febles should not be read as conflating the engagement and the principles of fundamental justice stages of the s. 7 analysis. As for B010, I observe that this Court ordered a new hearing in that appeal as a matter of statutory interpretation and found it unnecessary to consider the appellants\u2019 s. 7 challenge (para. 74). The brief comment that it is only at the pre-removal stage that \u201cs. 7 is typically engaged\u201d was neither a formal statement of the law nor necessary to decide the case (para. 75). It should not be taken to have changed the established law on s. 7 engagement. It is helpful to recall that in other contexts, such as extradition, s. 7 \u201cpermeates\u201d the entire process and is \u201cengaged, although for different purposes\u201d at each stage of the proceedings (United States of America v. Cobb, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, at para. 34, per Arbour J.). In the context of ineligibility under s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA , where curative measures are key to the s. 7 analysis, such measures are thus best understood as relevant to the principles of fundamental justice rather than to the threshold question of engagement, in keeping with this Court\u2019s methodology in Bedford (see, e.g., Heckman, at pp. 347\u201156).\n[74] Turning to the principles of fundamental justice analysis, the role of preventative provisions will vary depending on which principles are at issue. For example, legislative tailoring determines how broadly the general regime will be applied and thus undoubtedly factors into whether a scheme is overbroad.\n[75] The parties disagree as to how curative measures bear on this case. In line with this Court\u2019s reasoning in PHS, the respondents appear to see curative measures \u2014 like humanitarian and compassionate exemptions \u2014 as relevant to determining whether the principles of fundamental justice are respected. Conversely, the appellants claim that Bedford\u2019s highly individualistic focus on \u201cwhether anyone\u2019s life, liberty or security of the person has been denied\u201d has overtaken PHS on this point (para. 123 (emphasis in original)). They say that discretionary exemptions now only factor into the s. 1 analysis.\n[76] I disagree with the appellants. Curative mechanisms are properly considered when assessing whether a deprivation comports with the principles of fundamental justice. Bedford did not hold otherwise. Indeed, curative mechanisms were not at issue in Bedford, so it was unnecessary for this Court to comment on how its approach interacted with its reasoning in PHS. In my view, Bedford and PHS are compatible. Curative provisions have taken on increased significance in the wake of Bedford\u2019s recognition that a regime that is rational and non\u2011arbitrary in almost all circumstances can nonetheless violate s. 7 if it is arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate for one individual (para. 123). If the legislature has crafted a scheme that cures potential breaches by providing exemptions that can target the specific deprivations, this can render the legislative scheme Charter \u2011compliant (see D. Moore, \u201cEngagement with Human Rights by Administrative Decision-Makers: A Transformative Opportunity to Build a More Grassroots Human Rights Culture\u201d (2017), 49 Ottawa L. Rev. 131, at pp. 150\u201151; see also PHS, at para. 114). In this sense, the focus of the s. 7 analysis is, at most, only \u201chighly individualistic\u201d when the legislature has not provided mechanisms that individualize the law\u2019s effects (Stewart (2019), at p. 150; see also C. Fehr, \u201cRethinking the Instrumental Rationality Principles of Fundamental Justice\u201d (2020), 58 Alta. L. Rev. 133). However, as in PHS, the exemption mechanism must be responsive to the specific deprivation that is the subject of the Charter challenge.\n[77] I note that the Court of Appeal viewed the availability of judicial review in the federal courts as a relevant safety valve. It is true that within the framework established by Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, and this Court\u2019s broader administrative law jurisprudence, judicial review helps ensure that public authorities respect \u201clegal limits, derived from the enabling statute itself, the common or civil law or the Constitution\u201d (Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 28). However, judicial review offers different relief than a statutory mechanism that prevents or cures defects that would arise from the isolated operation of a general rule. This is because legislatures can never entirely \u201cshield administrative decision making from curial scrutiny\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 24). The general availability of judicial review therefore cannot save otherwise unconstitutional legislation. For this reason, I consider it unhelpful to view judicial review as a form of \u201csafety valve\u201d or statutory safeguard.\n[78] In sum, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in different ways to the appellants\u2019 Charter claim. To assess a s. 7 breach, the presence of such mechanisms must be considered. However, the appellants did not need to target these provisions to constitute their challenge.\n(2) The Relevance of Associated Administrative Conduct to the Section 7 Challenge\n[79] I now turn to the question of whether the appellants were obliged to target administrative conduct rather that the legislation. The Court of Appeal said that \u201csubsection 102(3) reviews and related administrative conduct\u201d, which could have led to the revocation of the United States\u2019 designation under the IRPR, was the proper focus of the challenge (para. 61). The appellants dispute this conclusion, submitting that whatever the result of the s. 102(3) reviews should have been, \u201cthe fact remains that the law on the books (s. 159.3 IRPR) is the cause of the Charter breaches in issue and is therefore the proper object of Charter scrutiny and s. 52 [of the Constitution Act, 1982 ] relief\u201d (A.F., at para. 34).\n[80] I agree with the appellants that it was open to them to challenge s. 159.3 of the IRPR, rather than administrative conduct, and seek a declaration that the provision is of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter . While other avenues may have been available \u2014 such as challenging the conduct of the s. 102(3) reviews or seeking individual relief from adverse administrative decisions related to the s. 24, 25.1(1), 25.2(1) or 48(2) curative mechanisms \u2014 the appellants did not have to pursue these alternatives to properly constitute their Charter claim.\n[81] To understand why the appellants were not obliged to target the s. 102(3) reviews, it is necessary to examine their role within the overall legislative scheme. The s. 102(3) reviews are not safety valves. Safety valves, as referred to in the ss. 7 and 12 Charter jurisprudence, typically mean discretionary exemptions or other curative mechanisms, rather than preventative provisions (e.g., PHS, at para. 113; Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 224, per Binnie and LeBel JJ., dissenting; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 36, per McLachlin C.J.). The reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make after-the-fact relief available on an individual basis. They are also distinct from targeted preventative measures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through legislative exceptions.\n[82] Section 102(3) of the IRPA requires the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors, such as the designated country\u2019s human rights record. The reviews conducted to date have left the designation in place, which remains the legislative basis for the ineligibility of claims advanced by the individual appellants. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being maintained may also be susceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the existence of this alternative does not insulate s. 159.3 of the IRPR from Charter scrutiny. Similarly, while the appellants might also have challenged administrative decisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, this does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3.\nB. Engagement of Section 7 Interests\n[83] In light of the foregoing, the appellants\u2019 challenge was properly constituted. I now turn to the substantive s. 7 Charter analysis. While the parties agree that s. 159.3 of the IRPR engages s. 7, they disagree on the particulars of each alleged deprivation and their causal connections to Canadian state action. The first stage of the s. 7 analysis makes clear that the Federal Court judge was right that s. 159.3 engages liberty and security of the person. But in my respectful view, she erred in her assessment of certain particulars.\n[84] The respondents rightly acknowledge that assessing the constitutional implications of effects that materialize in other countries does not amount to applying the Charter to foreign governments. Here, the challenge is directed at the legislative scheme, which is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. There is no place in this analysis for assessing whether American laws, policies or actions themselves comply with the Charter . Canadian courts only consider deprivations \u201ceffected by actors other than our government, if there is a sufficient causal connection between our government\u2019s participation and the deprivation ultimately effected\u201d (Suresh, at para. 54). Canada cannot \u201cavoid the guarantee of fundamental justice merely because the deprivation in question would be effected by someone else\u2019s hand\u201d (ibid.; see also Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 522; United States v. Burns, 2001 SCC 7, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, at paras. 59\u201160; India v. Badesha, 2017 SCC 44, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 127, at para. 38). But the focus remains fixed on the Canadian legislative scheme and its effects.\n(1) Effects Implicating Section 7 Interests\n[85] The appellants\u2019 liberty and security of the person submissions focus on detention in the United States and the risks that claimants may be refouled to their countries of origin following their return to the United States. These arguments have both factual and legal aspects. Whether an alleged effect exists is a question of fact, while the scope of a s. 7 interest is a question of law. The standard of review for the factual questions on appeal is \u201cpalpable and overriding error\u201d (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 10; Bedford, at para. 56; Carter, at para. 109). The standard of review for the legal questions is correctness (Housen, at para. 8).\n(a) Detention in the United States\n[86] The appellants argue that all returnees face a risk of detention in the United States. They allege that this risk is especially pressing for individuals without status there and that those under a removal order are certain to be detained. Further, they claim that the Federal Court judge\u2019s findings did not turn on her references to \u201cautomatic\u201d detention. In any event, \u201cautomatic\u201d refers to detention that is imposed without consideration, as a mechanistic or reflexive result and, as such, is not an error.\n[87] With respect, the Federal Court judge\u2019s references to \u201cautomatic\u201d detention were erroneous. The evidence shows that detention is not automatic and returnees\u2019 risks of detention vary on a case-by-case basis. In my view, this palpable error overwhelmed the Federal Court judge\u2019s conclusions on detention. I agree with the respondents and the Court of Appeal that detention is not automatic, in the sense that it is not universally applied: for the broad class comprising all returnees, the \u201chighest possible finding on this record is that returnees to the United States are exposed to a risk of discretionary detention . . . [as] returnees who are detained in the United States can seek release and release is often granted, either on bond or without\u201d (C.A. reasons, at paras. 140\u201141).\n[88] It is true that the respondents\u2019 expert acknowledged that there are certain categories of individuals for whom detention is automatic or mandatory: those whom American law defines as arriving or criminal aliens; individuals subject to a final removal order; and suspected terrorists (Affidavit of Stephen Yale\u2011Loehr, at paras. 135\u201141, reproduced in A.R., vol. XLVII, at pp. 20144\u201145). But the record does not demonstrate that these categories apply to those returned pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. For other categories of non\u2011citizens, the appellants did not seriously dispute that detention is discretionary and subject to the possibility of release (ibid., at paras. 131\u201134; Cross-examination of Anwen Hughes, questions 143\u201149, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXVII, at pp. 11291\u201192). Indeed, Ms. Mustefa and all of the anonymized affiants who answered written cross\u2011examinations were offered release on bond, and all but one were released. The record also suggests that other alternatives to detention are available (Affidavit of Yale\u2011Loehr, at paras. 159\u201162). Thus, the evidence does not support the Federal Court judge\u2019s finding that detention is \u201cautomatic\u201d, in the ordinary sense of the word.\n[89] While returnees do not face automatic detention in the United States, the risk of detention remains an effect that engages liberty. This Court has repeatedly held that \u201cliberty\u201d encompasses freedom from detention, imprisonment and the threat thereof (R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 652; R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 969; Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 64; R. v. Demers, 2004 SCC 46, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 30). Thus, because the question at the engagement stage is simply whether the appellants have demonstrated an effect within the scope of s. 7, a risk of detention suffices.\n(b) Conditions While Detained in the United States\n[90] The appellants also argue that conditions of detention in the United States implicate the security of the person interest, as the Federal Court judge held. To be sure, security of the person protects against physical punishment or suffering and the threat thereof (Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 207; Suresh, at paras. 53\u201155). It also protects against serious and profound state-imposed psychological stress (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, at para. 60). The respondents have failed to show reversible errors in the Federal Court judge\u2019s determination that the conditions of detention fall, in certain respects, within the scope of the security of the person interest.\n[91] First, the Federal Court judge found that the \u201cuse of solitary confinement\u201d raised the security of the person interest (para. 110). Ms. Mustefa and one of the anonymized affiants stated that they were isolated pending the results of tuberculosis tests. The Federal Court judge\u2019s heavy reliance on this evidence suggests that she reached her conclusion on solitary confinement with respect to its uses for this public health purpose. Thus, as I understand her finding, she concluded that isolation is used while some returnees are awaiting tuberculosis testing. This finding discloses no reviewable error. I have no hesitation in concluding that the use of medical isolation presents a risk of serious physical and psychological suffering, as do other forms of \u201csolitary confinement\u201d. Whether these risks accord with the principles of fundamental justice, or are otherwise justified, is not the question at this stage.\n[92] Second, the Federal Court judge also accepted evidence that certain detention centres were \u201cabnormally cold\u201d (para. 111). She relied, in support of this conclusion, on four affiants who had themselves experienced cold conditions in detention. Ms. Mustefa says that her detention facility was \u201cfreezing cold\u201d and that, during the day, she had to put socks over her hands and arms to stay warm, while curled up under a towel. I see no reversible error in the conclusion that this level of cold could cause physical suffering, which engages security of the person.\n[93] Third, the Federal Court judge concluded that the medical care provided in the detention facilities was inadequate in certain respects (para. 112). For instance, she noted evidence that medical staff would ignore Black detainees while addressing White detainees\u2019 medical issues (ibid.). No reversible error has been shown in her factual findings on inadequacies in medical care, nor in her conclusion that these effects fall within the scope of the security of the person interest (para. 114).\n[94] Fourth, the Federal Court judge noted two other portions of Ms. Mustefa\u2019s affidavit. In particular, Ms. Mustefa said that while detained in the United States, her religious dietary restrictions were not respected and she was held alongside individuals who had been criminally convicted (para. 96). The appellants reference these forms of treatment, even though the Federal Court judge did not rely on them in her analysis of whether security of the person was engaged. I would hesitate to conclude, absent clear findings below, that this treatment falls within the scope of security of the person. However, as will become plain, even taking the appellants\u2019 case on this point at its highest, I would find no breach of s. 7 on this basis.\n(c) Risks of Refoulement From the United States\n[95] The appellants also argue that returnees are at a real and not speculative risk of being refouled from the United States to their countries of origin, as the Federal Court judge held. Returning individuals to the United States does not itself constitute refoulement, nor does the United States returning individuals to their countries of origin if the relevant international obligations are respected. Rather, the concern is that the United States may be returning individuals contrary to those obligations, thereby making Canada a participant in indirect refoulement when it returns refugee claimants to the United States. The appellants claim that this risk implicates security of the person. There is no question that a risk of refoulement \u2014 whether directly from Canada or indirectly after return to a third country \u2014 falls within the scope of the security of the person interest. This Court has noted that the non-refoulement principle is \u201cthe cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime\u201d (N\u00e9meth v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para. 18). By definition, refoulement exposes individuals to threats to their life or freedom (Refugee Convention, Article 33), torture (Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Can. T.S. 1987 No. 36, Article 3) or other serious human rights violations. It is because these potential consequences are so grave that this Court in Singh considered it \u201cunthinkable\u201d that refoulement would fall outside the scope of s. 7\u2019s protections (p. 210).\n[96] In this case, the more difficult question at the s. 7 engagement stage is the factual one: whether the Federal Court judge erred in concluding that a real and not speculative risk of refoulement from the United States exists. As I will explain, so said most respectfully, the Federal Court judge made reviewable errors on this point.\n(i) Refoulement Because of Barriers Caused by Detention Conditions\n[97] The appellants argue that the Federal Court judge was right to find that a risk of refoulement flows from the barriers to making an asylum claim while detained (Federal Court reasons, at para. 106). The respondents submit that the record cannot support this conclusion and that Canadian courts should presume that foreign processes for determining asylum claims are fair. The respondents also invoke a presumption of compliance with international obligations and say that the standard for displacing this presumption with respect to the United States is that \u201cthe evidence must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances and impeach the totality of the system, even casting doubt on the independence of the judiciary\u201d (R.F., at para. 89; see also transcript, at pp. 89 and 92).\n[98] The respondents\u2019 arguments are overstated. It is true that there is a presumption that foreign states have fair and independent judicial processes (Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, at p. 725, quoting Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Satiacum (1989), 99 N.R. 171 (F.C.A.), at para. 19). But I am not satisfied that courts should rely on a presumption that foreign states comply, in every respect, with international law. Instead, the ordinary principles for Charter claims should be followed: the challengers must prove the facts substantiating the alleged rights violations connected to state action ascribed to Canada. When those factual findings are challenged, the ordinary appellate standard of \u201cpalpable and overriding error\u201d applies.\n[99] Applying the proper standard, I am satisfied that the respondents have shown a reviewable error. The record cannot support the Federal Court judge\u2019s finding that barriers to advancing an asylum claim while detained give rise to a \u201creal and not speculative\u201d risk of refoulement from the United States.\n[100] To begin, as the Court of Appeal noted, the Federal Court judge\u2019s reasons did not squarely engage with significant evidence related to how asylum claims are advanced while individuals are detained (para. 142). For instance, Ms. Mustefa and nearly all of the anonymized affiants had access to counsel to assist with their claims while detained in the United States. Further, several of the expert affiants acknowledged widespread programs designed to provide free legal representation to individuals in immigration detention. Indeed, the record indicates that relevant American legislation offers guarantees of a right to counsel in asylum proceedings and requires claimants be given a list of pro bono counsel (see Affidavit of Yale\u2011Loehr, at paras. 21\u201124 and 68\u201174, discussing, inter alia, Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4)(B) (2018); see also Cross\u2011examination of Hughes, questions 298\u2011310). The Federal Court judge did not explicitly engage with this important evidence in making her finding. In my respectful view, this omission \u201cgives rise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected [her] conclusion\u201d (Housen, at para. 39, quoting Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at para. 15).\n[101] Further, the record does not support the Federal Court judge\u2019s finding that refoulement flows from alleged barriers to advancing a claim while detained. In this respect, two crucial matters went largely unaddressed. First, the record discloses review and appeal mechanisms internal to the American asylum system (Affidavit of Yale\u2011Loehr, at paras. 67\u201174). The appellants point to no evidence establishing that these mechanisms are ineffective. Second, the record reveals that certain claimants whose asylum applications fail have avenues for remaining in the United States. Among these is temporary protected status, which permits individuals from designated countries to remain (see, e.g., Cross\u2011examination of Abed Ayoub, questions 236\u201160, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXI, at pp. 13012\u201117). Another avenue is \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d, which allows individuals to remain if they are more likely than not to be persecuted based on one of the grounds recognized in the Refugee Convention (see, e.g., Affidavit of Deborah Anker, at paras. 65\u201167, reproduced in A.R., vol. XVII, at pp. 7340\u201141). Yet another path is protection based on the Convention Against Torture (see, e.g., ibid.). There are also many targeted visa programs for individuals in certain classes, like victims of crime or trafficking (see, e.g., Cross\u2011examination of Lenni B. Benson, questions 278\u201182, 344\u201147, 350\u201155 and 513\u201121, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXVIII, at pp. 11604\u20115, 11621, 11623 and 11659\u201161). These mechanisms are relevant to whether individuals whose detention may create barriers to advancing their asylum claims are, in the end, refouled. But the Federal Court judge did not assess these mechanisms.\n[102] Respectfully said, the Federal Court judge erred by not explicitly considering these aspects of the record that undermine her finding. The record does not support her conclusion that American detention conditions pose barriers to the advancement of asylum claims that raise a real and not speculative risk of refoulement. While it is possible that barriers to advancing a claim in a third country could be so high as to create such a risk, the appellants have not demonstrated that here.\n(ii) Refoulement Due to American Asylum Policies\n[103] Before the Federal Court, the appellants also argued that the imposition of a \u201cone-year bar\u201d (i.e., a rule under which asylum claims must be advanced within a year of a claimant\u2019s arrival) and the restrictive interpretation of gender-based persecution as a basis for asylum each result in a risk of refoulement from the United States. They argued that the Canadian legislation facilitating the return of claimants to the United States, where those risks may materialize, implicates the security of the person interest. The Federal Court judge did not make any findings in connection with these arguments, resting her conclusion about the risk of refoulement solely on barriers to advancing an asylum claim from detention (paras. 106 and 113). Indeed, she did not comment on the nature or scope of the relevant American policies.\n[104] On appeal to this Court, the appellants invoke the purported risks of refoulement flowing from these aspects of American asylum law. However, they do not address how these policies operate and should be understood. Instead, they cite the findings of the Federal Court in Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada, 2007 FC 1262, [2008] 3 F.C.R. 606, along with certain aspects of the evidence that was before the Federal Court judge in the present case. The respondents, by contrast, argue that the relevant American policies respect the non-refoulement principle, relying on other parts of the evidentiary record.\n[105] In CCR (2008), the Federal Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the Federal Court, in part because the hypothetical nature of the challenge provided \u201cno factual basis upon which to assess the alleged Charter breaches\u201d (para. 103). More importantly, however, findings made in those proceedings are not properly before this Court here. The Federal Court\u2019s 2007 findings are thus of no assistance here.\n[106] Further, the evidence on the applicable American policies is of limited assistance absent relevant factual findings. The record on this issue is mixed. For instance, the respondents\u2019 expert appeared to acknowledge that the one-year bar leads to some individuals being denied asylum even if their underlying claims are meritorious (Cross\u2011examination of Stephen Yale\u2011Loehr, question 664, reproduced in A.R., vol. XLVIII, at p. 20508). If this is true, risks of refoulement would be pressing. But the one-year bar has exceptions for changed or extraordinary circumstances (see, e.g., ibid., questions 655 and 660\u201164; Affidavit of Anker, at para. 60; Affidavit of Jaya Ramji\u2011Nogales, at para. 9, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXX, at pp. 12752\u201153). Without findings of fact on how these exceptions function, this Court is not positioned to assess whether the one-year bar actually leads to refoulement. Further, the various alternative avenues for remaining in the United States, as described above, may be relevant. These exceptions and alternative avenues may be the manner in which the United States implements its non-refoulement obligations in light of its one-year bar policy.\n[107] The Federal Court judge\u2019s lack of findings in relation to American policies on gender-based persecution also makes it imprudent for this Court to determine whether there is a real and not speculative risk of refoulement for claimants fleeing such persecution. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for this Court to attempt to make its own factual findings. In any event, as will become clear, even assuming that these policies do present a real and not speculative risk of refoulement for returnees, I would not ultimately find a s. 7 breach on this basis.\n(d) Conclusion as to the Effects Implicating Section 7 Interests\n[108] The risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three aspects of detention conditions as found by the Federal Court judge \u2014 the use of medical isolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care \u2014 fall within the scope of liberty and security of the person. Beyond that, to take the appellants\u2019 position on s. 7 engagement at its highest, I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that the following effects occur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: the non\u2011accommodation of religious dietary needs, detention in a facility housing criminally convicted individuals and the risks of refoulement flowing from the one-year bar policy and the United States\u2019 approach to gender-based claims. With these effects in mind, I turn to the causation analysis.\n(2) Causal Link to Canadian State Action\n[109] As noted above, to establish s. 7 engagement, challengers must not only demonstrate effects falling within the scope of the s. 7 interests, but also that these effects are caused by Canadian state action. In domestic matters, the requisite causal link will often be obvious. This is rarely so for cases where the deprivation in question is effected by foreign actors. When connecting harms to Canadian state action, courts must be \u201csensitive to the context of the particular case\u201d (Bedford, at para. 76). When a challenger seeks to draw a causal connection between Canadian state action and a harm brought about by a foreign actor, the context is meaningfully different from cases in which harms arise through purely domestic processes.\n[110] Canada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign authorities. Thus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, Canadian authorities must have been implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers will succeed in drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action \u201c[a]t least where Canada\u2019s participation is a necessary precondition for the deprivation\u201d (Suresh, at para. 54).\n[111] Further, Canada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will take. Where there is no basis for Canada to have known that a harm would arise, it would be improper to view those harms as causally connected to Canadian state action. Thus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, it must be shown that Canadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as a result of Canada\u2019s actions. This has been expressed through the recognition that challengers will be able to show a causal connection to Canadian state action \u201c[a]t least where . . . the deprivation is an entirely foreseeable consequence of Canada\u2019s participation\u201d (Suresh, at para. 54 (emphasis added)).\n(a) Necessary Precondition\n[112] In this case, it is clear that Canada\u2019s participation is a necessary precondition to each of the effects related to detention and refoulement. Without the legislative implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, individuals could advance their refugee protection claims in Canada. Instead, they are sent back to the United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, where they face (or are presumed to face) these effects. Thus, I have no hesitation in concluding that the relevant Canadian state action \u2014 here, s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the broader legislative scheme \u2014 is a necessary precondition.\n(b) Foreseeable Consequence\n[113] In Bedford, this Court discussed the foreseeability threshold from Suresh and further explained its role (para. 77). Foreseeability, as described in Suresh, can be established \u201cby a reasonable inference, drawn on a balance of probabilities\u201d (Bedford, at para. 76). As is generally true, what is required is \u201ca sufficient connection, having regard to the context of the case\u201d (para. 78). Nevertheless, foreseeability remains useful in an international context where Canada does not necessarily have full knowledge of how foreign authorities will act (see, e.g., J. C. Hathaway, The Rights of Refugees Under International Law (2nd ed. 2021), at pp. 367\u201168). To be plain, the foreseeability standard described in Suresh and interpreted in Bedford is binding on this Court.\n[114] An effect can be shown to be foreseeable in at least two ways (see, e.g., Hathaway, at p. 373). First, challengers can show that Canada had actual knowledge of the risk that the effects would emerge. For example, Parliamentary debates discussing the risks may establish this knowledge. Second, challengers can also show that Canada ought to have known about the risks, such that knowledge can be imputed. Public reporting, academic analysis, and other sources originating outside government may help establish constructive knowledge. While speculation will not suffice, the threshold for constructive knowledge should remain attainable since foreseeability is a \u201cport of entry for s. 7 claims\u201d (Bedford, at para. 78). For example, the threshold should remain well below the strict approach taken to judicial notice (see R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48).\n[115] In this case, the Federal Court judge noted the Suresh causation framework but did not explicitly consider whether each of the relevant effects was foreseeable (para. 100). She did not state what evidence could have allowed her to conclude that Canada knew, or ought to have known, that these effects would occur. In my respectful view, this approach led the Federal Court judge into reversible error in her application of the foreseeability standard this Court established in Suresh and Bedford.\n[116] With respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies in medical care, detention alongside criminally convicted individuals and the violation of religious dietary restrictions, the record does not support a finding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence of Canada\u2019s actions on the Suresh and Bedford standard. While these effects are concerning, the question at this stage is whether Canada knew or ought to have known they could occur. The appellants have not pointed to evidence that would enable this Court to answer this question in the affirmative in light of the absence of findings below. They have not established that Canada either knew or ought to have known of this kind of harm arising in American detention facilities. Thus, in my respectful view, there was no basis for concluding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence.\n[117] By contrast, the record substantiates that the other negative effects were entirely foreseeable. With respect to the risk of detention, it is plain that Canada knew returnees would be exposed to such a risk. From the earliest consultations on the scope of a possible safe third country agreement, the use of detention in the United States was the subject of debate and study (see, e.g., UNHCR, UNHCR Comments on the Draft Agreement between Canada and the United States of America for \u201cCooperation in the Examination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries\u201d, July 26, 2002 (online), at p. 3). Similarly, the \u201cone-year bar\u201d and the treatment of gender-based claims were each focal points during the adoption of the agreement (see, e.g., p. 2; Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR\/2004\u2011217, Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 138, No. 22, November 3, 2004, at p. 1627). Further, Canada ought to have known that returnees were at risk of being subjected to the widespread practice of medical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security of the person are causally connected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in relation to the principles of fundamental justice.\nC. Principles of Fundamental Justice Analysis\n(1) The Applicable Principles\n[118] Here, the applicable principles of fundamental justice are overbreadth and gross disproportionality. These principles were applied at first instance and are invoked by the appellants before this Court. By contrast, the respondents argue that the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard applies to \u201cthe constitutional review of the effects of removal to foreign legal systems and administrations\u201d (R.F., at para. 64). They submit that this high threshold is only met in exceptional circumstances, as is proper given the importance of international comity and respect for the sovereignty of foreign states. In my view, the respondents\u2019 arguments are misplaced. The \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard may well be relevant to the review of individualized decisions, but it is not relevant to Charter challenges to legislation.\n[119] It is true, as the respondents noted in oral argument, that \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d was treated as applicable to legislative challenges by some members of this Court in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, at pp. 849\u201150. But Kindler must be read in light of this Court\u2019s later, more complete, consideration of \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d in Burns. It must also be read in the context of this Court\u2019s broader assessment of the principles of fundamental justice in Malmo-Levine.\n[120] In Burns, this Court made plain that the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard applies to reviewing individual decisions by the Minister and \u201cshould not be allowed to obscure the ultimate assessment that is required\u201d, which is whether those decisions are \u201cin accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\u201d (para. 68). Following Burns, this Court has used \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d when assessing requests for individualized Charter relief from the Minister\u2019s decisions on extradition or deportation rather than, as here, to evaluate the constitutionality of a legislative regime (see, e.g., Lake v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2008 SCC 23, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at paras. 38\u201139; Canada (Attorney General) v. Barnaby, 2015 SCC 31, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 563, at para. 11). Academic commentators have also concluded that the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard speaks to how \u201ca discretionary decision by a state official can be challenged under the Charter even though the statute under which the decision was made is not itself challenged\u201d (see, e.g., Stewart (2019), at pp. 130\u201131). Indeed, in Malmo-Levine, this Court explicitly concluded that a broad balancing exercise \u2014 of the kind that \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d describes \u2014 is not an applicable principle of fundamental justice for challenges to legislation (paras. 94\u201199). It is true that in some contexts, the language of \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d has been used to inform the gross disproportionality standard (see, e.g., in relation to s. 12, R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at paras. 109\u201110, 145 and 163, per Martin J., and at paras. 182\u201183, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 J., dissenting, but not on this point). As a practical matter, a provision held to be grossly disproportionate to its purpose might well shock the conscience if it were pressed into service. But this convergence does not displace the principles of fundamental justice that apply in challenges to legislation.\n[121] Because the appellants target legislative provisions, the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard is not the appropriate measure in this case. This is not to say, however, that whether governmental conduct shocks the conscience is not relevant to challenging the implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement. Administrative decisions made under legislative schemes must, like the schemes themselves, respect the guarantees in the Charter . It therefore remains open to refugee claimants arriving from the United States to advance constitutional challenges against determinations that their claims are ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division or against decisions that exceptional relief is unavailable. As this Court has recognized, it is possible to consider challenges to both legislation and administrative conduct within the same proceeding (see, e.g., PHS, at paras. 74\u201177; Kindler, at p. 840, per McLachlin J.).\n[122] If claimants in future cases challenge administrative conduct, courts may conclude that returning them would shock the conscience of Canadians (see Burns, at para. 69). In this way, vulnerable claimants whom Canada improperly seeks to return can be protected. However, at oral argument, the appellants expressly disclaimed any intention to challenge the constitutionality of administrative decisions to deny them exemptions.\n[123] None of the foregoing implies that the respondents\u2019 concern for international comity and foreign states\u2019 sovereignty is unwarranted. In my view, however, these concerns can be accommodated under the principles of overbreadth and gross disproportionality. To begin with, the Suresh and Bedford causation analysis ensures that Canadian courts only assess effects brought about by foreign actors if those effects are causally connected to Canadian state action.\n[124] Further, the Bedford principles of fundamental justice provide space to consider comity and foreign sovereignty. This is because arbitrariness, overbreadth and gross disproportionality are principles of \u201cinstrumental rationality\u201d or of means-ends assessment, which can only be examined in light of the impugned law\u2019s purpose (paras. 107\u20119; Stewart (2019), at pp. 150\u201151; P. W. Hogg, \u201cThe Brilliant Career of Section 7 of the Charter \u201d (2012), 58 S.C.L.R. (2d) 195, at p. 209). The proper articulation of the purpose of a scheme with foreign elements must be sensitive to the international context, in which there will rarely, if ever, be exact correspondence between foreign and Canadian regimes. Courts should thus hesitate to conclude that such legislation is predicated on the laws of the foreign state precisely mirroring those of Canada. In these circumstances, I emphasize that courts must take due care in defining the purpose of Canadian legislation.\n[125] Finally, this Court has left open the possibility that a s. 7 breach might be justified under s. 1 in appropriate circumstances (Malmo-Levine, at paras. 96\u201198; Bedford, at para. 129). This Court has also emphasized that the s. 1 analysis must be approached with sensitivity to the factual and social context of each case (see, e.g., RJR\u2011MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 63, per La Forest J., dissenting, but not on this point, and at paras. 132\u201134, per McLachlin J.). At the s. 1 stage, a contextual approach would likely consider international comity and the sovereignty of foreign states.\n(2) The Scheme Is Not Overbroad or Grossly Disproportionate\n[126] The respondents do not mention Bedford in their factum. Although their position is that the Bedford principles of fundamental justice do not apply to this appeal, their failure to address Bedford was unhelpful. The appellants\u2019 case focused on overbreadth and gross disproportionality at each stage of the proceedings. The Federal Court applied these principles and the Court of Appeal commented on them. It would therefore have been useful to this Court for the respondents to provide explanations, or alternative arguments, about these principles.\n[127] Here, the Bedford principles apply. When assessing whether legislation violates these principles, courts consider \u201cwhether the law\u2019s purpose, taken at face value, is connected to its effects and whether the negative effect is grossly disproportionate to the law\u2019s purpose\u201d (para. 125). This requires courts to identify the legislative purpose and then to assess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation breached any applicable principle of fundamental justice.\n(a) Legislative Purpose\n[128] The courts below relied on the purpose of the legislative scheme articulated in CCR (2008), at para. 75: \u201c. . . the sharing of responsibility for the consideration of refugee claims with countries that are signatory to and comply with the relevant articles of [the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture] and have an acceptable human rights record\u201d (Federal Court reasons, at paras. 119\u201122; C.A. reasons, at para. 164). The appellants advance a broader view of the place of international law in the scheme\u2019s purpose, saying that it is designed \u201cto share responsibility for the protection of refugees in accordance with Canada\u2019s international obligations\u201d (A.F., at para. 56 (emphasis deleted)). Conversely, the respondents would have this Court adopt a purpose that does not make international obligations explicit: \u201c. . . to share responsibility for providing protection to those in need and to improve the efficiency of the refugee determination system\u201d (R.F., at para. 26). I would not adopt any of these statements. In my view, the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement.\n[129] In R. v. Ndhlovu, 2022 SCC 38, this Court reiterated several principles guiding the characterization of legislative purpose within a s. 7 analysis. It noted, for instance, that the focus is the purpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader legislative scheme may provide clues as to the narrower provisions\u2019 purpose (para. 61, per Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., and para. 153, per Brown J., dissenting in part, but not on this point). Courts may consider \u201cstatements of purpose in the legislation, if any; the text, context, and scheme of the legislation; and extrinsic evidence\u201d (para. 64; see also R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para. 33).\n[130] Purpose statements are \u201c[t]he first, \u2018most direct and authoritative evidence\u2019 of the legislative purpose\u201d (Appulonappa, at para. 49, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at pp. 274\u201176). Here, while the specific sections containing the impugned provisions do not provide formal purpose statements, s. 3(2) of the IRPA articulates the Act\u2019s overall objectives with respect to refugees:\n(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are\n(a) to recognize that the refugee program is in the first instance about saving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted;\n(b) to fulfil Canada\u2019s international legal obligations with respect to refugees and affirm Canada\u2019s commitment to international efforts to provide assistance to those in need of resettlement;\n(c) to grant, as a fundamental expression of Canada\u2019s humanitarian ideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution;\n(d) to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment;\n(e) to establish fair and efficient procedures that will maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canada\u2019s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings;\n[131] These objectives supply three key considerations relevant to assessing the purpose of the provisions at issue here: respecting Canada\u2019s international obligations (s. 3(2)(b) and (d)), ensuring fair process and consideration for claimants (s. 3(2)(b), (c) and (e)), and upholding the efficiency and sustainability of the Canadian refugee protection system (s. 3(2)(e)). Further, s. 102(1) of the IRPA also speaks to legislative objective in this instance insofar as it permits the designation of countries \u201cfor the purpose of sharing responsibility with governments of foreign states for the consideration of refugee claims\u201d.\n[132] With respect to the text and context of the legislative scheme, the provision directly challenged is s. 159.3 of the IRPR. This provision designates the United States pursuant to s. 102(1) (a) of the IRPA . In my view, the purpose of a provision designating a specific country can only be understood in light of s. 102(2), as the Federal Court of Appeal recognized in CCR (2008). Considering the factors set out in s. 102(2) is a condition precedent to designating a country. These factors, identified by Parliament, necessarily partake of the purpose for which a designation is made. They include the country\u2019s \u201cpolicies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee Convention and with respect to obligations under the Convention Against Torture\u201d (s. 102(2)(b)). The \u201chuman rights record\u201d of a country is another (s. 102(2)(c)).\n[133] The authority to designate a country flows from s. 102(1)(a), which focuses on whether the designated country complies with the non-refoulement principle, as embodied in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The non-refoulement principle, which scholars have also described as the [translation] \u201ccornerstone of refugee law\u201d (see, e.g., F. Cr\u00e9peau, Droit d\u2019asile: De l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9 aux contr\u00f4les migratoires (1995), at p. 166), is thus of central importance to the scheme\u2019s purpose. Indeed, even scholars who are critical of the agreement have recognized that it \u201cevinces a joint commitment to ensuring access to a refugee protection procedure in either Canada or the United States\u201d in order to respect the non-refoulement principle (Macklin (2005), at p. 381; Mayrand and Smith\u2011Gr\u00e9goire, at p. 337).\n[134] The various factors in s. 102(2) of the IRPA clearly relate to the non-refoulement principle. But they also go beyond it. By referencing policies and practices related to the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture as a whole (s. 102(2)(b)), the legislation directs the Governor in Council to consider a broad range of guarantees designed to ensure that refugee claimants receive fair treatment in host countries. The requirement in s. 102(2)(c) to consider a country\u2019s \u201chuman rights record\u201d is to similar effect, as it helps assess whether refugees will receive fair treatment beyond the floor established by the non-refoulement principle. These requirements do not suggest that designated countries must have identical policies or human rights records to Canada, so long as the designated countries respect certain minimum requirements. In that sense, the s. 102(2) factors leave space for permissible differences in countries\u2019 domestic regimes, which reflects Parliament\u2019s respect for international comity, within the bounds of the Constitution.\n[135] The broader statutory scheme that structures the legal effects flowing from designating a country is also illuminating, in that it shows that sharing responsibility with a designated country is a core objective. In particular, s. 101(1) (e) of the IRPA renders individuals arriving from designated countries ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division. Access to other procedures in Canada is also restricted (see, e.g., IRPA , s. 112(2) (b)). The message is clear: designation ensures that claims will be considered in the designated country, rather than in Canada.\n[136] Finally, three sources of extrinsic evidence assist in ascertaining the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR. First, the preamble to the Safe Third Country Agreement provides useful indicators of Parliament\u2019s and the Governor in Council\u2019s objectives in enacting the legislation that gives domestic effect to the treaty. As discussed, the preamble acknowledges the non-refoulement obligations that bind both countries (para. 2). It states that the governments were aware of the necessity to avoid \u201cindirect breaches of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement . . . [through] access to a full and fair refugee status determination procedure\u201d (para. 8). Thus, the preamble to the Safe Third Country Agreement confirms that the non-refoulement principle is at the core of the scheme, along with a broader emphasis on the fair adjudication of refugee claims. It was in light of these mutually held commitments that the sharing of responsibility was proposed.\n[137] Second, the accompanying Statement of Principles agreed to by Canada and the United States reflects a shared commitment to ensuring that refugee claimants subject to the scheme are treated fairly. For instance, it affords claimants an opportunity for a chosen person to be present during proceedings.\n[138] Third, the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement for s. 159.3 of the IRPR stated that the \u201cpurpose of the provisions is to render paragraph 101(1)(e) of the [IRPA ] effective\u201d by designating the United States in order to proceed with \u201csharing responsibility [for] refugee protection\u201d while also respecting \u201cCanada\u2019s commitment to its international obligations toward refugees\u201d, which \u201creflects our humanitarian tradition and core values of compassion and fairness\u201d (pp. 1622\u201123).\n[139] Taken together, the statement of objectives of the IRPA , the text, context, and scheme of the legislation, and the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of the legislation has three essential elements: (1) to share responsibility for considering refugee claims; (2) to respect the non-refoulement principle; and (3) to return refugee claimants only to countries that will fairly consider their claims. Given these elements, the legislative purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. This purpose reflects a primary goal (sharing responsibility), which is subject to two limits (the non-refoulement principle and the requirement for fair consideration). Notably, these two limits do not disclose an expectation that the American asylum claim system mirror the Canadian system in every respect. It is in light of this purpose that the relevant s. 7 deprivations \u2014 the risk of discretionary detention and medical isolation, along with the presumed risks of refoulement \u2014 must be assessed for overbreadth and gross disproportionality.\n(b) Risks of Detention and Medical Isolation\n[140] The appellants argue that the risks of detention and medical isolation are both overbroad and grossly disproportionate. I am not persuaded that either principle of fundamental justice is breached in the circumstances of this case.\n[141] With respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the impugned legislation \u201cis so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose\u201d (Bedford, at para. 112 (emphasis deleted)). As this Court has affirmed, a law is overbroad if it overreaches in a single case (paras. 113 and 123; Ndhlovu, at para. 78). This analysis is focused not on \u201cwhether Parliament has chosen the least restrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the person in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the legislature\u201d (Carter, at para. 85).\n[142] In my view, the risk of detention in the United States, with opportunities for release and review, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for refugee claims with another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal regime that governs refugee claimants\u2019 presence in that country. Exposure to foreign legal systems \u2014 including their detention practices \u2014 necessarily results from achieving the scheme\u2019s purpose. Of course, the legislation\u2019s responsibility-sharing objective is qualified by the requirement that refugee claimants are to be given fair consideration in the designated country. But whether this requirement is respected does not turn on the extent to which the American asylum system mirrors Canada\u2019s system. A degree of difference as between the legal schemes applicable in the two countries can be tolerated, so long as the American system is not fundamentally unfair. Thus, for the appellants to show that the scheme overreaches this limit \u2014 such that there is \u201cno connection\u201d at all between the effects of the scheme and the legislative objective, which includes the aim of only returning refugee claimants to countries that will fairly consider their claims (see Carter, at para. 85) \u2014 the question is whether the American system is fundamentally unfair. In my view, the record does not support the conclusion that the American detention regime is fundamentally unfair.\n[143] International legal instruments provide indicia of what it means to treat refugee claimants fairly. For instance, the UNHCR\u2019s Detention Guidelines recognize that detention of refugee claimants \u201cis neither prohibited under international law per se, nor is the right to liberty of person absolute\u201d (Guidelines on the Applicable Criteria and Standards relating to the Detention of Asylum\u2011Seekers and Alternatives to Detention (2012), Guideline 4, at para. 18). The Detention Guidelines require safeguards in relation to the use of detention. The particular form of these safeguards is a matter of state practice. Here, the appellants did not discharge their burden to show that safeguards are absent in the American asylum system. While the record shows that returnees face a risk of detention in the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that create opportunities for release and provide for review by administrative decision makers and courts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally unfair. Thus, the risk of detention that returnees face is not overbroad.\n[144] Similarly, the use of medical isolation is not fundamentally unfair. Nothing in the record suggests that isolating those awaiting tuberculosis test results is unnecessary to control public health risks in detention facilities. Indeed, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), U.N. Doc. A\/RES\/70\/175, December 17, 2015, require that where individuals in detention facilities are suspected of having contagious diseases, measures are taken \u201cproviding for the clinical isolation and adequate treatment of those prisoners during the infectious period\u201d (Rule 30(d)). Of course, the Mandela Rules also restrict the use of isolation or segregation (see, e.g., Rules 37(d), 43(1), 44 and 45). But the appellants do not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical isolation is being used improperly in the American immigration detention system.\n[145] It is true that the record includes the affidavits of two lawyers from American advocacy organizations outlining their belief that isolation may be used more broadly. For instance, the lawyers suggested solitary confinement may be used to deal with claimants facing mental health challenges (Affidavit of Ruby Robinson, at para. 18, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXIII, at pp. 13884\u201185) or as a punitive mechanism (Affidavit of Timothy Warden\u2011Hertz at para. 8, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXIII, at pp. 13807\u20118). However, there are no findings below on these specific matters. The Federal Court judge did not find that the American immigration detention system imposes isolation on individuals with mental health challenges or that isolation is used punitively.\n[146] This Court is appropriately reluctant to assume the mantle of a finder of fact (Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp., [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634, at para. 33, per La Forest J., and at para. 89, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point). Here, given the limitations of the evidentiary record, it would be imprudent for this Court to make factual determinations about how the United States uses solitary confinement in immigration detention. There is therefore no basis to conclude that American practices are fundamentally unfair. As a result, I am not satisfied that the risk of medical isolation for individuals returned to the United States is an overbroad effect of the Canadian legislation.\n[147] With respect to gross disproportionality, the question is whether the impugned legislation\u2019s effects on the s. 7 interests are \u201cso grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they cannot rationally be supported\u201d (Bedford, at para. 120). This threshold is only met \u201cin extreme cases where the seriousness of the deprivation is totally out of sync with the objective\u201d and is \u201centirely outside the norms accepted in our free and democratic society\u201d (ibid.). Neither a risk of detention with opportunities for release and review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In Canada, as in the United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted by our free and democratic societies. The appellants have not shown otherwise.\n(c) Risks of Refoulement Due to American Asylum Policies\n[148] Subjecting returnees to real and not speculative risks of refoulement would bear no relation to the purpose of the impugned legislation, which has respect for the non-refoulement principle at its core. A provision mandating return to a risk of refoulement would therefore be overbroad. Similarly, a provision mandating return to a risk of refoulement would be grossly disproportionate because doing so would, by definition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom (Refugee Convention, Article 33), torture (Convention Against Torture, Article 3) or other fundamental human rights violations. Scholars have criticized these sorts of mandatory regimes, which require countries to assume \u201cthe partner state\u2019s ability and willingness to protect refugees\u201d (see, e.g., Hathaway, at p. 330). However, the impugned legislation in this case does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must be factored into the analysis. These provisions include administrative deferrals of removal (IRPA , s. 48(2) ), temporary resident permits (s. 24), humanitarian and compassionate exemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). I note that while the Federal Court judge did not consider the full range of relevant curative measures, she properly recognized \u2014 in her s. 7 analysis under the headings of \u201cOverbroad\u201d and \u201cGrossly Disproportionate\u201d in her reasons \u2014 that safety valves are germane to the assessment of the Bedford principles of fundamental justice.\n[149] As this Court held in PHS, when the impugned legislative scheme contains safety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms \u2014 properly interpreted and applied \u2014 are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur (para. 113; see also Moore, at pp. 150\u201151). Plainly, if no such deprivations materialize, then there is no breach of s. 7. This observation is what, in my view, explains McLachlin C.J.\u2019s statement in PHS that \u201cif one were to set out to draft a law that combats drug abuse while respecting Charter rights, one might well adopt . . . a prohibition combined with the power to grant exemptions\u201d (para. 114).\n[150] The IRPA \u2019s curative provisions are, in many key respects, analogous to the safety valve in the CDSA upon which the Court relied in PHS. For example, s. 25.1 of the IRPA is structurally similar to what was then s. 56 of the CDSA . Both mechanisms contemplate the exercise of ministerial discretion to grant relief from rules that would otherwise apply. Moreover, they both grant a broad discretionary authority, as they permit exemptions from any of the Act\u2019s provisions (in the case of the CDSA ) or any of the Act\u2019s applicable criteria or obligations (in the case of the IRPA ). Exemptions on public policy grounds (IRPA , s. 25.2 ) play a comparable role. Further, administrative deferrals of removal (s. 48(2)) and temporary resident permits (s. 24) also create avenues for discretionary relief, by front-line decision makers rather than the Minister.\n[151] When the IRPA\u2019s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted from return. If they are not returned to the United States, they do not face any risk of refoulement from the United States. The safety valves can therefore intervene to cure what might otherwise be unconstitutional effects, as was the case in PHS. Moreover, as in PHS, they are properly considered as part of the principles of fundamental justice stage of s. 7 because the mechanisms can be exercised in order to address the specific deprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement.\n[152] The appellants argue that \u201coverbroad and grossly disproportionate effects cannot be cured\u201d by these mechanisms in the IRPA (A.F., at para. 67). They say the safety valves are irrelevant because they are \u201cnot among the legislative and regulatory provisions implementing the [Safe Third Country Agreement] ineligibility\u201d (para. 69). I disagree. This is not a case where the scheme\u2019s safety valves are so disconnected from the deprivation that they are irrelevant for determining whether the challenged provision violates s. 7 of the Charter . Properly interpreted, the curative mechanisms in the broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that individuals are not subjected to real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such risks do exist. These mechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that Article 6 of the Safe Third Country Agreement preserves for Canada to consider claims when it is in its public interest to do so.\n[153] In Article 6, the parties agreed that each of them could examine \u201cany refugee status claim\u201d when it was in their public interest to do so. The United States has implemented this provision in a manner that leaves room for discretion and consideration of various humanitarian factors (see, e.g., UNHCR, Monitoring Report: Canada-United States \u201cSafe Third Country\u201d Agreement (2006), at pp. 63\u201165). Nothing in the agreement prevented Canada from leaving in place mechanisms that permit a similar approach.\n[154] The mere fact that these mechanisms predate the treaty does not make them irrelevant. Indeed, scholars have observed that \u201c[t]he great majority of treaties concluded by Canada are in the nature of state-to-state agreements that do not require amendment of the internal laws of either party\u201d (van Ert, at p. 233). When the agreement was signed, Canadian domestic law already included provisions that could facilitate individualized consideration of claimants\u2019 circumstances when it is in Canada\u2019s public interest to do so. New legislation implementing additional mechanisms was not necessary. Likewise, it is of no consequence that these provisions are found in other, generally applicable parts of the IRPA . As I have said, Charter analyses must consider all relevant provisions in an interrelated legislative scheme.\n[155] The related provisions in the IRPA and IRPR provide various avenues for refugee claimants to be exempted from return on a temporary or permanent basis. For instance, an officer who is persuaded during an initial interview that a real and not speculative risk of refoulement exists could refer the case to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for further consideration. That department could then determine whether to recommend that the Minister grant a humanitarian and compassionate exemption under s. 25.1 of the IRPA , including waiving the s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility. Alternatively, the Minister might decide that grounds for granting a temporary resident permit exist, thus providing time for determining whether permanent resident status should be granted on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. These avenues are, of course, not exhaustive. But they suggest that the statutory scheme can limit the risk of harm that the general rule might otherwise occasion.\n[156] It is true that Canada has only ever expressly relied on Article 6 to create categorical exceptions (Canada, A Partnership for Protection: Year One Review (2006), at p. 37). Nevertheless, Canada has long been aware that Article 6 may permit it to consider the claims of \u201cindividuals who would not normally be eligible under an exception but who nevertheless warrant special consideration because of their vulnerability\u201d (UNHCR, Monitoring Report, at p. 36; see also A Partnership for Protection, at pp. 35\u201137). I share this reading of Article 6, which must inform the interpretation of the existing exemption mechanisms.\n[157] The appellants argue in their factum that the Federal Court judge found these mechanisms to be \u201cillusory\u201d and \u201clargely out of reach\u201d (A.F., at para. 68). The respondents, by contrast, say these mechanisms \u201cexist in law\u201d and the Court of Appeal found that they were available in practice, as the record reflects (R.F., at para. 91). In my view, neither position can be accepted outright.\n[158] It is clear that an exemption would be merely \u201cillusory\u201d \u2014 and thus incapable of curing constitutional defects \u2014 if there were no possibility of accessing it in law. For example, if there is no legal pathway to obtain a statutory exemption, then it is illusory (see Parker, at para. 174). It is also insufficient for curative mechanisms to be available in law but unavailable in practice. Empty promises do not safeguard against breaches of constitutionally protected rights. For instance, this Court has recognized that a statute permitting exemptions may nonetheless create barriers to accessing them (see, e.g., R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 60-62, per Dickson C.J., and at pp. 91\u2011100, per Beetz J.). It is open to challengers to argue that legislation unjustifiably breaches s. 7 because the exemption mechanism itself produces difficulties for individuals seeking access to it (Morgentaler, at pp. 73\u201176, per Dickson C.J., and at pp. 122\u201128, per Beetz J.). This Court has, however, emphasized that the legislation must be the cause of the alleged difficulties in order for Charter scrutiny to attach to it (see Little Sisters, at para. 128).\n[159] It may not always be obvious whether the source of an alleged breach is the legislation or the administrative conduct implementing it (see, e.g., A. M. Latimer and B. L. Berger, \u201cA Plumber with Words: Seeking Constitutional Responsibility and an End to the Little Sisters Problem\u201d (2022), 104 S.C.L.R. (2d) 143, at pp. 145\u201146). In applying Morgentaler and Little Sisters, it is appropriate to look to the broader jurisprudence on the assessment of causation in s. 7 challenges. As is true at every stage of proving a s. 7 violation, challengers bear the evidentiary burden to establish that the legislation causes difficulties for individuals seeking access to curative mechanisms (Bedford, at para. 78). They must therefore show that the legislation causes the exemption to be illusory in their individual circumstances. Challengers need not show that the legislation causes exemptions to be illusory in general, as the s. 7 analysis is not focused on \u201cthe percentage of the population that is negatively impacted\u201d (para. 123). When courts conclude that the legislation causes the alleged difficulties, they should explain how this burden is met for each of the relevant curative mechanisms.\n[160] It is true that the Federal Court judge wrote that \u201csafeguards . . . are largely out of reach and are therefore \u2018illusory\u2019\u201d (para. 130). Nevertheless, as the appellants themselves acknowledged in oral argument before this Court, when that statement is read in context, the Federal Court judge\u2019s immediate focus was on the practical availability of judicial review proceedings. As discussed above, the availability of judicial review is distinct from whether there are statutory safeguards that may function as curative mechanisms or \u201csafety valves\u201d. The Federal Court judge\u2019s reasons in this case do not point to a considered finding that all the relevant curative mechanisms are illusory for any individual. Indeed, she did not assess the relevant curative mechanisms in any substantive way. In my respectful view, this was an error of law reflecting a failure to consider how the relevant legislative provisions might apply to the question at hand \u2014 although the Federal Court judge can hardly be blamed for it, as the parties\u2019 arguments before her do not appear to have squarely addressed how these mechanisms might, properly interpreted, be relevant.\n[161] Had the full range of relevant curative measures been considered, the Federal Court judge would have recognized that there is insufficient evidence in the record regarding their practical operation. For example, the appellants have identified no evidence that could support a finding that an individual returnee would not have access to these mechanisms. Instead, the record shows that administrative deferrals of removal, temporary resident permits, and humanitarian and compassionate consideration are available. I note, in particular, the circumstances of Ms. Al Nahass\u2019s family, who did receive temporary resident permits and permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thus, the record in this case cannot sustain the conclusion that the applicable curative mechanisms are \u201cillusory\u201d. In any event, the Federal Court judge\u2019s error of law means that her comment does not bind this Court.\n[162] The public interest authority preserved in Article 6 may be exercised on an individualized basis through the IRPA \u2019s curative mechanisms. Absent a finding that these mechanisms are illusory or otherwise inadequate to respond to the potential harms, realizing the Article 6 discretion in this manner poses no constitutional defect. It is, of course, also open to the Governor in Council to make regulations respecting the criteria for the application of s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility in order to clarify when the general principle of return should not apply (IRPA , s. 102(1) (c)). The Governor in Council has done so in s. 159.6 of the IRPR, which exempts individuals subject to the death penalty from return. This exception responds to a marked difference between American and Canadian law. It is thus one example of how sharing responsibility need not require that the two countries agree in every respect. Indeed, Article 6 reflects an acceptance that each party to the treaty will abide by its own distinctive view of when considering a refugee claim is in its public interest. Further, regulations under s. 102(1)(c) are not the only avenue for specifying circumstances that warrant an Article 6 exception. The Minister may also set out classes for whom public policy dictates that an exception should be established (IRPA , s. 25.2 ). Using the authority under s. 102(1)(c) or 25.2 to clarify the relevant exceptional circumstances may make the process more efficient and predictable.\n[163] In sum, even assuming that claimants face real and not speculative risks of refoulement from the United States, the Canadian legislative scheme provides safety valves that guard against such risks. For that reason, the legislative scheme implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of fundamental justice. In light of this conclusion, as well as my conclusions on deprivations related to detention, no breach of s. 7 of the Charter has been established.\n[164] I recall that the challenge here was advanced against legislation, not administrative conduct. It may be that administrative actors, such as CBSA officers, acted unreasonably or unconstitutionally in their treatment of some returnees or in their interpretation of the legislative scheme, including its safety valves. As noted above, when administrative action or inaction is the cause of the alleged harms, then that conduct is properly the subject of Charter scrutiny, not the legislation itself. But these are not issues before this Court on appeal. If administrative malfeasance results in returning individuals to circumstances that would shock the conscience of Canadians, such as returning individuals to face a real and not speculative risk of refoulement, constitutional and administrative remedies remain available. Without saying more, I observe that administrative decisions in this area call for \u201cthe most anxious scrutiny\u201d (R. (Yogathas) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2002] UKHL 36, [2003] 1 A.C. 920, at paras. 9, 58 and 74, quoting R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p. Bugdaycay, [1987] A.C. 514 (H.L.), at p. 531).\nD. Section 1\n[165] Given that the legislative scheme does not violate s. 7, it is not necessary to undertake a s. 1 analysis. However, for the sake of completeness, I provide some brief comments on s. 1 justification for circumstances in which it would be required. In doing so, I highlight the distinct relevance of safety valves in a s. 1 analysis where the burden of justification is on the state.\n[166] The appellants argue that while legislative safety valves did not ensure that the legislation accords with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, such avenues for discretionary relief may remain relevant in addressing s. 1. However, they submit that the respondents did not file any evidence in support of a s. 1 justification, and they rely on the Federal Court judge\u2019s statement that safeguards are \u201cillusory\u201d.\n[167] The respondents argue that had a s. 7 breach been made out, it would be justified under s. 1, in part because of related provisions in the legislative scheme. They say that the whole of the law serves to advance the pressing and substantial objective of sharing responsibility for refugee status determinations with the United States. Further, they submit that the scheme is minimally impairing of claimants\u2019 s. 7 rights and point to the continuous monitoring of the regime under s. 102(3) of the IRPA and to the IRPA \u2019s safety valves.\n[168] Both parties rightly acknowledge that safety valves are relevant at the s. 1 stage, as this Court accepted in Carter (paras. 114\u201121). However, the role these mechanisms play at the s. 1 stage differs from their role at the s. 7 stage as does, of course, the burden that the state bears. This is because s. 7 and s. 1 \u201cask different questions\u201d insofar as \u201cjustification on the basis of an overarching public goal is at the heart of s. 1, but it plays no part in the s. 7 analysis, which is concerned with the narrower question of whether the impugned law infringes individual rights\u201d (Bedford, at para. 125). Given this distinction, \u201ca different set of considerations comes into play under section 1: not just the effect of the law on (at least) one person\u2019s section 7 interests, but the effect of the section 7 violation in achieving the law\u2019s policy objectives\u201d (H. Stewart, \u201cBedford and the Structure of Section 7\u201d (2015), 60 McGill L.J. 575, at p. 589). When safety valves are at issue, the considerations in play under s. 7 and s. 1 remain distinct.\n[169] While discretionary exemption mechanisms are relevant to determining whether impugned legislation breaches individual rights protected by s. 7, they may not be adequate to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur. In other words, they may not succeed in curing all deprivations of individuals\u2019 s. 7 interests. For instance, the scope of a safety valve may simply not be wide enough to exempt all individuals inappropriately caught by the general rule.\n[170] As is the case throughout the s. 7 analysis, claimants bear the burden to show that legislative safety valves do not remedy individual deprivations. To do so, they may, for example, advance arguments and lead evidence demonstrating that a legislative regime itself causes a statute\u2019s curative mechanisms to be practically unavailable. However, at the s. 1 stage, the government bears the burden to show that the safety valves \u2014 as a whole \u2014 are sufficient to justify any established s. 7 breaches under the test from R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. This Court has left open the \u201cpossibility that the government could establish that a s. 7 violation is justified\u201d (Bedford, at para. 129).\n[171] At the s. 1 stage, the government may argue \u2014 as Canada did here \u2014 that a scheme\u2019s safety valves, if they proved to be imperfect under s. 7, nonetheless render the legislation minimally impairing. Further, the government might seek to rely on safety valves in the final balancing stage of Oakes. Nonetheless, given that a s. 7 violation was not established in this case, it is unnecessary to comment on what the outcome of any part of the s. 1 analysis might have been here.\nVIII. The Section 15 Claim\nA. The Parties\u2019 Positions on the Section 15 Challenge\n[172] In their factum, the appellants asked this Court to remit the matter to the Federal Court. They acknowledge that, in declining to decide their claim under s. 15 of the Charter , the Federal Court judge made no findings of fact on which a gender-based discrimination argument might rest. In oral argument, counsel for the appellants advanced the alternative argument that it is open to this Court to make the necessary factual findings to decide the s. 15 issue and noted that the matter was pleaded before the courts below.\n[173] The basis of the appellants\u2019 s. 15 claim in the Federal Court was that women fearing gender-based persecution are adversely affected by s. 159.3 of the IRPR. The appellants submitted, for instance, that the American interpretation of \u201cparticular social group\u201d \u2014 one of the classes of individuals protected from refoulement under Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention \u2014 is overly restrictive with respect to women.\n[174] The respondents argue that there is no need to remit the matter because the appellants\u2019 gender-based concerns are properly addressed within the s. 7 analysis. In the respondents\u2019 submission, what primarily drove the s. 15 claim was the decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), which was vacated in 2021. They submit that the American system recognizes gender-related harms as a basis for asylum claims and that, on a fair reading of the record, there is no evidence of a s. 15 breach.\nB. The Section 15 Challenge Should Be Remitted to the Federal Court\n[175] The Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S\u201126 , empowers this Court to remand any appeal or part thereof to the court appealed from or the court of original jurisdiction (s. 46.1). This discretion is to be exercised \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d (Wells v. Newfoundland, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 68; Saadati v. Moorhead, 2017 SCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at para. 45; R. v. Esseghaier, 2021 SCC 9, at para. 63). Here, remitting the s. 15 challenge is just in the circumstances.\n[176] A court of first instance would have, as a part of its fact-finding mandate, an institutional advantage in making the determinations necessary to a fair treatment of the s. 15 claim. The evidentiary record is voluminous, and while this Court is entitled to make factual findings based upon it, much of the expert affidavit evidence regarding the s. 15 allegations conflicts. For example, the Court would have to evaluate competing expert opinions on a line of cases dealing with the American approach to defining a \u201cparticular social group\u201d (see, e.g., Affidavit of Yale\u2011Loehr, at paras. 118\u201130; Affidavit of Karen Musalo, at paras. 10 et seq., reproduced in A.R., vol. XXI, at pp. 8965 et seq.). To decide the gender-based claim on the merits, this Court would have to assume the mantle of trier of fact and consider potentially conflicting trends in American jurisprudence as an appellate court of final resort.\n[177] Appellate courts may \u2014 and occasionally are required to \u2014 assume the role of finder of fact where doing so is \u201cin the interests of justice and feasible on a practical level\u201d (Hollis, at para. 33, per La Forest J.). However, they are \u201cgenerally, and justifiably, wary\u201d of doing so (ibid.), given the many advantages first instance courts have in drawing factual inferences. These include their \u201crelative expertise with respect to the weighing and assessing of evidence\u201d and their \u201cinimitable familiarity with the often vast quantities of evidence\u201d (Housen, at para. 25). Appellate courts should be especially cautious, for example, when a first instance judge has failed to make essential factual findings and where evidence conflicts or is in dispute (Hollis, at paras. 89 and 93, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point).\n[178] In my view, this Court is not well placed to make the factual findings necessary to assess the merits of the s. 15 claim. Given the profound seriousness of the matter, the size and complexity of the record and the conflicting affidavit evidence, it would be neither \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d nor \u201cfeasible on a practical level\u201d for this Court to take up the task of finder of fact (Hollis, at para. 33). Notably, there would be no possibility of appeal with respect to any factual determinations this Court might make on the disputed, conflicting evidence.\n[179] Further, it would not be in the interests of justice to dismiss the s. 15 claim for lack of argument. It is true that the appellants did not argue the substance of their s. 15 claim before this Court beyond a brief mention in their factum and a reference in oral argument to their pleadings before the courts below. This Court has sometimes held that the aspects of a claim not argued by an appellant can be considered abandoned and can thus be dismissed (see, e.g., Meyer v. General Exchange Insurance Corp., [1962] S.C.R. 193, at p. 201, per Locke J.). These decisions rightly recognize that appellants are generally expected to provide full arguments for the claims they maintain before this Court. Yet, I sense it would be inappropriate to interpret the appellants\u2019 lack of argument as an abandonment of serious submissions that the courts below commented on so briefly and did not decide. In the specific circumstances of this appeal, it was not unreasonable for the appellants to limit their pleadings to a request for this Court to remit the s. 15 matter. The alternate argument that the matter be decided here was not a considered position. It would have been unrealistic for the appellants to attempt to fill the factual void left by the courts below while simultaneously advancing novel legal arguments, such as those relating to causation and equality rights in the international context.\n[180] Finally, I note that certain interveners are troubled by what they see as a judicial \u201cpattern of neglect with respect to section 15\u201d in challenges based on multiple Charter rights (I.F., David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights, West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association and Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund Inc., at para. 13). One can well understand the concern: claims based on s. 15 are not secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The Charter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s. 15 occupies a lower tier.\n[181] I would not fault the Federal Court judge here for exercising judicial restraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim. I recognize that the principle of judicial policy underlying such restraint is sound, as \u201c[i]t is based on the realization that unnecessary constitutional pronouncements may prejudice future cases, the implications of which have not been foreseen\u201d (Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 9, per Sopinka J.). Even so, these judicial policy considerations are not always determinative. They must be weighed against other factors, such as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. While the proceeding at first instance remains the \u201cmain event\u201d (Housen, at para. 13, quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985), at pp. 574\u201175), the possibility that further proceedings might require addressing alternative constitutional grounds should be considered. As in this case, when first instance judges decline to consider further constitutional issues, a false economy may arise if appellate courts have to remit claims.\n[182] In sum, it is in the interests of justice to send the matter back to the Federal Court for determination, as the Federal Court of Appeal rightly recognized (para. 173). Nothing in these reasons should be taken to decide the factual or legal questions that will be relevant to the s. 15 challenge.\nIX. Conclusion\n[183] I would answer the questions posed on appeal as follows. First, s. 159.3 of the IRPR is not ultra vires. Second, s. 159.3 does not breach s. 7 of the Charter . Third, the challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter should be remitted to the Federal Court.\n[184] Because the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the applications for judicial review in their entirety, certain aspects of its judgment should be set aside. In particular, the Court of Appeal erred in deciding that the challenge to s. 159.3 of the IRPR based on s. 15 of the Charter should be dismissed rather than remitted to the Federal Court. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part. Neither party sought costs. Like the courts below, I would make no order as to costs on the appeal or the application for leave to appeal.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitor for the appellants the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches: Refugee Law Office, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the appellants ABC, DE by her litigation guardian ABC, FG by her litigation guardian ABC, and Nedira Jemal Mustefa: Downtown Legal Services, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the appellants Mohammad Majd Maher Homsi, Hala Maher Homsi, Karam Maher Homsi and Reda Yassin Al Nahass: Jared Will & Associates, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Department of Justice \u2014 Ontario Regional Office, Toronto; Department of Justice \u2014 Quebec Regional Office, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates en droit de l\u2019immigration: Cliche\u2011Rivard, Avocats et Avocates, Montr\u00e9al.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Landings, Toronto; Legal Aid Ontario \u2014 Refugee Law Office, Toronto; University of British Columbia Allard School of Law, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers: Silcoff Shacter, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the interveners the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association: Mithoowani Waldman Immigration Law, Toronto; National Council of Canadian Muslims, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the interveners the Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights and the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture: Waldman & Associates, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Queen\u2019s Prison Law Clinic: Alison M.

C\u201146, ss. 259(1) (a), 719(1) .\nAfter being charged with a summary conviction impaired driving offence, the offender was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She remained subject to that prohibition until she was sentenced 21 months later. At the time of the offence, s. 259(1) (a) of the Criminal Code (\u201cCr. C.\u201d) required the court to make an order prohibiting an offender charged with a first impaired driving offence from operating a motor vehicle during a period of not less than one year. The sentencing judge imposed a one\u2011year driving prohibition on the offender and chose to backdate the order to the first day of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition, which meant that the period prescribed by law had been completed in full by the date of his decision.\nThe summary conviction appeal judge dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal. While noting that the sentencing judge had erred in backdating the prohibition, he found that the sentencing judge could nevertheless give credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition as long as such a prohibition was a condition of release and also part of the sentence later imposed. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s subsequent appeal, holding that there is no authority for giving credit so as to depart from a mandatory minimum provided for by statute.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIt was open to the sentencing judge to take into account the period of 21 months already served by the offender, as this would not undermine Parliament\u2019s intent in enacting the mandatory minimum. No conflict arises from the concurrent application of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. and the common law rule that allows credit to be granted. At the time of sentencing, the court is required to impose the one\u2011year mandatory minimum, but there is nothing in the statute that prevents it from then granting credit. Similarly, granting credit is not contrary to the rule set out in s. 719(1) Cr. C. requiring that a sentence commence when it is imposed. Only the sentence has to commence when it is imposed, not the one\u2011year mandatory minimum served under s. 259(1)(a). These statutory provisions therefore do not displace the common law discretion of sentencing judges, recognized in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, to grant credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition.\nCanadian criminal law is made up of both statute law and common law principles. This coexistence of statute and common law is a feature of the law of sentencing. While the Criminal Code codifies the fundamental principles of sentencing, courts can also take account of other principles and factors arising from the common law. Although legislation may prevail over the common law, the latter remains applicable insofar as it has not been displaced expressly or by necessary implication, a principle justified by the importance of stability in the law. The two\u2011step framework used to analyze the interaction between legislation and the common law is well settled. The first step is analyzing, identifying and setting out the applicable common law; and then, at the second step, the statute law\u2019s effect on the common law must be specified.\nWith regard to the first step of the analysis, the common law allows courts to grant credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition imposed on an offender. This common law discretion is a natural extension of an analogous principle that applies in the context of pre\u2011sentence custody. Courts have long recognized that they can take into consideration, in imposing a sentence, any period of incarceration that the offender has already undergone between the date of arrest and the date of sentencing. Giving credit for the time an offender is subject to pre\u2011sentence custody is part of the central principles of sentencing, although it is not statutorily expressed. The principle that credit can be granted for pre\u2011sentence custody serves to mitigate certain injustices arising from the application of the principle that a sentence may not be backdated, now codified in s. 719(1). While Canadian law does not permit courts to backdate a sentence in order to reduce it, they may nevertheless consider the time spent in pre\u2011sentence custody in determining the period that must be served prospectively by an offender. The application of this common law rule allowing credit to be granted is therefore not equivalent to backdating a sentence.\nFurthermore, the absence of a statutory provision for pre\u2011sentence driving prohibitions that is equivalent to s. 719(3) Cr. C., which codifies the granting of credit in the case of pre\u2011sentence custody, does not have the effect of displacing or limiting the common law rule allowing credit to be granted. Absent clear legislative intention to the contrary, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law, including the common law. Section 719(3) was enacted in the specific context of pre\u2011sentence custody, and the legislative debates suggest that Parliament\u2019s intention was to ensure that credit could still be granted when a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was imposed. There is no indication that Parliament considered whether credit could be given for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. There is also nothing in the legislative debates to support the position that Parliament sought to displace, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the common law rule applicable to such prohibitions. This is not a situation in which Parliament made clear its intention to displace or limit the applicable common law.\nWith regard to the second step in the analysis, s. 259(1)(a) does not limit the scope of the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. The discretionary authority to grant credit under the common law can coexist harmoniously with judicial adherence to a mandatory minimum established by statute. This coexistence rests on the well\u2011known distinction between the concepts of \u201cpunishment\u201d, understood as a deprivation, and of \u201csentence\u201d, understood as a judicial decision (in French, the distinction between \u201cpunition\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d, where the term \u201cpeine\u201d can also be used to convey both meanings). While the French term \u201cpeine\u201d used in the sense of \u201cpunishment\u201d refers to the total punishment imposed on an offender, the same word when used to mean \u201csentence\u201d refers to the decision rendered by the court, which is always prospective in order to prevent the judicial practice of backdating sentences.\nIn accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the reach of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be determined by considering its text, context and purpose. Properly interpreted, s. 259(1)(a) provides for a minimum punishment, not a minimum sentence. Interpreting s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. as providing for the imposition of a one\u2011year global punishment is perfectly in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and punishment that underlie the provision. Parliament\u2019s intention is respected whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the effect on the offender is the same in either case. Though silent with respect to credit, the provision is not ambiguous: it can be read in only one way, that is, as providing for the imposition of a mandatory minimum punishment. If s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required that a minimum sentence be handed down, the appropriate difference between the punishments imposed on the most dangerous offenders and those imposed on the least dangerous offenders could be unduly eroded, and the precise gradation of minimum prohibition periods established by Parliament in s. 259(1) would be undermined. Absent a clear intention to this effect, it must be presumed that Parliament did not intend to produce such absurd results. In addition to leaving room for the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to grant credit, this interpretation of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. is consistent with general principles of sentencing and does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system.\nIn this case, the imposition of an additional one\u2011year punishment would amount to a kind of double punishment, contrary to the most fundamental requirements of justice and fairness. By the time the sentencing decision was rendered, it had been 21 months since the offender had essentially begun serving her sentence. Conscious of this fact, the sentencing judge ordered a one\u2011year driving prohibition but found that the offender had already satisfied this condition. However, he backdated the offender\u2019s sentence to achieve this result, which was an error. He could quite properly have imposed the one\u2011year mandatory minimum punishment required by s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed under s. 719(1) Cr. C., and then granted credit for the pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period by exercising his common law discretion, which has not been displaced by the Criminal Code .\nCases Cited\nApplied: R. v.

Overview\n[1] After being charged with a summary conviction impaired driving offence in 2017, the appellant, Jennifer Basque, was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She remained subject to that prohibition until she was sentenced 21 months later. At the time of the offence, s. 259(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 (\u201cCr. C.\u201d), required the court to make an \u201corder prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle . . . during a period of . . . not less than one year\u201d.[1]\n[2] Could the sentencing judge credit Ms. Basque for the driving prohibition period already served, notwithstanding the combined effect of that one\u2011year mandatory minimum prohibition and the direction \u2014 codified in s. 719(1) Cr. C. \u2014 that except where otherwise provided, a sentence commences when it is imposed?\n[3] If not for the requirement in s. 259(1)(a), granting credit would undoubtedly be possible. Indeed, in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089 \u2014 a case that did not concern a mandatory minimum prohibition \u2014 this Court confirmed that there is a common law judicial discretion to grant credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. This discretion is a natural extension of the longstanding practice of crediting offenders for periods of pre\u2011sentence custody.\n[4] Provided that Parliament respects the relevant constitutional constraints, it can, of course, enact legislation that displaces the common law rule allowing credit to be granted for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. Ms. Basque does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 259(1)(a) but argues that her request for credit is not limited in any way by the imposition of the mandatory minimum prohibition. The respondent Crown, relying on the majority reasons of the Court of Appeal, argues instead that granting credit in this case would conflict with the application of the one\u2011year minimum prohibition, even though the relevant statutory provision is silent on crediting.\n[5] Respectfully, I believe that the respondent is mistaken. In my view, granting credit based on the common law discretion recognized in Lacasse is perfectly consistent with the application of the minimum prohibition in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. and with the rule requiring that a sentence commence when it is imposed in s. 719(1) Cr. C. It was therefore open to the sentencing judge to take into account the period of 21 months already served by Ms. Basque, as this would not undermine Parliament\u2019s intent.\n[6] The discretionary authority to grant credit under the common law can coexist harmoniously with judicial adherence to a mandatory minimum established by statute. This coexistence rests on the well\u2011known distinction between the concepts of \u201cpunishment\u201d, understood as a deprivation, and of \u201csentence\u201d, understood as a judicial decision (in French, the distinction between \u201cpunition\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d, where the term \u201cpeine\u201d can also be used to convey both meanings). This distinction, considered by Rosenberg J.A. in the context of credit for pre\u2011sentence custody in R. v. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), was taken up by Arbour J. of this Court in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at paras. 35\u201137, with particular attention to the multiple meanings of the French term \u201cpeine\u201d. From this perspective, Arbour J. explained that while the term \u201cpeine\u201d used in the sense of \u201cpunishment\u201d refers to the total punishment imposed on an offender, the same word when used to mean \u201csentence\u201d refers to the decision rendered by the court. It bears noting that a sentence is always prospective in order to prevent the judicial practice of backdating sentences (see s. 719(1) Cr. C.).\n[7] As a general rule, the purpose of a mandatory minimum is to impose on an offender an effective punishment of a specified minimum length. This is so because the objectives underlying a minimum punishment are achieved equally well whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced. In the instant case, the mandatory minimum provided for in s. 259(1)(a) is no exception to this rule.\n[8] Properly interpreted, s. 259(1)(a) requires the court to impose a total punishment of one year to be served by the offender, not to hand down a sentence imposing a one\u2011year prohibition that must necessarily be served prospectively. As Rosenberg J.A. noted in McDonald, Parliament\u2019s intention is respected whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the effect on the offender is the same in either case. Interpreted in this way, s. 259(1)(a) did not prohibit the sentencing judge from \u201creducing\u201d the sentence by granting credit for the pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period, as long as the total punishment remained consistent with the minimum prescribed by Parliament.\n[9] By the time the trial judgment was rendered in this case, it had been 21 months since Ms. Basque had essentially \u201cbegun serving [her] sentence\u201d (see R. v. Sharma, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 814, at p. 818, cited with approval by Wagner J., as he then was, in Lacasse, at para. 113). When considered from this perspective, the objectives of the minimum punishment set out in s. 259(1)(a) had already been met \u2014 and even surpassed. In such a context, granting credit to \u201creduce\u201d the length of the prohibition imposed on Ms. Basque does not conflict with s. 259(1)(a) because she has already served a driving prohibition period exceeding the one\u2011year minimum required by that provision. Crediting also addresses the considerations of fairness and justice touched on in Wust, including what Paciocco J.A. usefully described in an academic paper as \u201cthe aversion to double punishment\u201d (D. M. Paciocco, \u201cThe Law of Minimum Sentences: Judicial Responses and Responsibility\u201d (2015), 19 Can. Crim. L.R. 173, at p. 211).\n[10] In short, no conflict arises from the concurrent application of s. 259(1)(a) and the common law rule that allows credit to be granted. At the time of sentencing, the court is required to impose the one\u2011year mandatory minimum punishment, but there is nothing in the statute that prevents it from then granting credit. Similarly, granting credit is not contrary to the requirement set out in s. 719(1) Cr. C. because only the sentence has to commence when it is imposed, not the one\u2011year minimum punishment served under s. 259(1)(a). These statutory provisions therefore do not displace the discretion of sentencing judges that was recognized in Lacasse. Of course, Parliament remains free, within the constraints imposed by the Constitution, to limit this discretion, but it must do so through a \u201cclear provision to that effect\u201d (Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada, 2016 SCC 52, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 521, at para. 56). There is no such provision here, as s. 259(1)(a) is silent regarding the granting of credit.\n[11] Furthermore, the codification of the discretion to give credit for pre\u2011sentence custody in s. 719(3) Cr. C. has no impact on this appeal. Like s. 259(1)(a), s. 719(3) is unambiguous, and it is also silent with respect to driving prohibitions. Here, the absence of an analogous provision for driving prohibitions does not signify a positive intention by Parliament to eliminate the discretion recognized in Lacasse, a case which, I should add, was decided after s. 719(3) was enacted.\n[12] In light of the foregoing, and given that Ms. Basque has already been prohibited from driving for 21 months, the imposition of an additional one\u2011year prohibition period would amount to a kind of double punishment, contrary to the most fundamental requirements of justice and fairness. Conscious of this fact, the sentencing judge ordered a one\u2011year driving prohibition but found that Ms. Basque had already satisfied this condition. However, he backdated Ms. Basque\u2019s sentence to achieve this result. With respect, this was an error. He could quite properly have imposed the one\u2011year mandatory minimum punishment required by s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed under s. 719(1) Cr. C., and then granted credit for the pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period by exercising his common law discretion, which has not been displaced by the Criminal Code .\n[13] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. I would restore the judgment of the summary conviction appeal court and reinstate the sentencing judge\u2019s conclusions in part, for different reasons. I would specify that the appellant has already served the mandatory minimum prohibition provided for in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C.\nII. Facts\n[14] On the night of October 7, 2017, the appellant was driving her vehicle in downtown Moncton, New Brunswick. Constable Richard, who was patrolling the area, noticed that the vehicle was being driven erratically and stopped it. The interaction between the appellant and the police officer took place in French in keeping with the preference expressed by Ms. Basque. The constable had her take a breathalyzer test, which showed a blood alcohol level above the legal limit. Ms. Basque was then arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.\n[15] On November 30, Ms. Basque was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle. She was later charged with impaired driving under the former s. 253(1)(b) Cr. C.\n[16] Ms. Basque initially pleaded not guilty to the charge brought against her. The trial was scheduled for June 2018 but was later adjourned at her request. In October of that year, Ms. Basque pleaded guilty and stated that she intended to apply for a conditional discharge under s. 255(5) Cr. C. (now repealed).\n[17] At the sentencing hearing in the Provincial Court \u2014 delayed by adjournments \u2014 Ms. Basque waived her right to proceed in French and abandoned her application for a conditional discharge. Following discussion of her criminal history, it was determined that a prohibition applicable to a first offence was to be imposed on her under s. 259(1)(a). The Crown did not seek a term of imprisonment, and the parties reached an agreement on the amount of the fine to be set in her case.\n[18] Between her initial appearance and the date she was sentenced, Ms. Basque was subject to a driving prohibition for 21 months.\nIII. Judicial History\nA. New Brunswick Provincial Court (McCarroll Prov. Ct. J.)\n[19] The sentencing judge acknowledged Ms. Basque\u2019s difficult past, which included a very abusive childhood. He also noted that driving her vehicle was important to her. She had to travel to Fredericton to take part in hearings concerning the custody of her children, and the use of public transportation for that purpose placed her in a financially precarious position. Mindful of this reality, and taking account of the fact that Ms. Basque had been subject to a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition for 21 months, the judge granted her uncontested request that he not impose any further prohibition.\n[20] At the hearing, the judge commented as follows on the possible terms of the order he had to make: \u201c. . . I\u2019m not sure of whether to word it, driving prohibition one year which has been completed because of her two years of \u2013 of prohibited driving [as a result of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition], or simply say, no driving prohibition. I\u2019m inclined to take the first approach because the law obliges me to \u2013 to order [the prohibition] \u2013 but I think it might be safer to back \u2013 to order it and then back\u2011date it and say, you know, she\u2019s already been without the licence by a court order for \u2013 for over two years\u201d (A.R., vol. I, at p. 16). In the end, the judge chose to backdate the order prohibiting Ms. Basque from operating a vehicle to November 30, 2017 \u2014 the first day of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition \u2014 which meant that the prohibition had been completed in full by the date of the decision. He also imposed the minimum fine of $1,000.\nB. New Brunswick Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, 2020 NBQB 130, 65 M.V.R. (7th) 208 (Dysart J.)\n[21] The summary conviction appeal judge heard an appeal by the Crown, which argued that the sentencing judge had erred in law in backdating the sentence. Relying on the principles laid down by this Court in Lacasse and Wust, the appeal judge dismissed the appeal, finding that the sentencing judge could give credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition as long as such a prohibition was a condition of release and also part of the sentence later imposed (para. 28).\n[22] Illustrating his point using two decisions that relied on Lacasse \u2014 R. v. Bland, 2016 YKSC 61, 3 M.V.R. (7th) 112, and R. v. Edwards (2016), 382 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 225 (N.L. Prov. Ct.) \u2014 the appeal judge noted that the sentencing judge had not imposed a prohibition period that was less than the minimum provided for in the Criminal Code . Through his decision, the sentencing judge had imposed a driving prohibition on Ms. Basque for a total of one year, in accordance with s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., and then credited her for the pre\u2011sentence prohibition to which she had been subject (para. 29). It was not an error of law to do so. Finally, the appeal judge noted that the error of backdating the sentence had not affected the decision rendered, as no further driving prohibition was indicated in this case (para. 30).\nC. New Brunswick Court of Appeal, 2021 NBCA 50, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 1 (Richard C.J., Baird J.A. concurring; French J.A., dissenting)\n[23] The issue before the Court of Appeal was framed as follows: \u201cDid the summary appeal court judge err by affirming the Provincial Court Judge\u2019s jurisdiction to reduce the s. 259(1)[(a)] (now s. 320.24(2)(a)) mandatory driving prohibition below its one year minimum by giving credit for the time during which a pre\u2011sentence prohibition was served by the Respondent (\u2018Basque\u2019) as a release undertaking?\u201d (para. 10). Richard C.J. stated that the question was not whether the pre\u2011sentence prohibition period could reduce the post\u2011trial prohibition period, \u201cbut rather whether it may reduce this period below the one\u2011year minimum\u201d (para. 12 (emphasis in original)).\n[24] The Court of Appeal was divided on this question. The majority, in reasons written by the Chief Justice, granted the Crown\u2019s application for leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. While it is indeed possible to give credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition in certain circumstances, the majority wrote, there is no authority for giving such credit so as to depart from a mandatory minimum provided for by statute. The majority stated that Lacasse could not offer guidance in this case because it dealt with a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d driving prohibition that was not subject to a mandatory minimum (paras. 18\u201119). The purpose of a mandatory minimum is precisely to limit judicial discretion. The appeal before the Court of Appeal was also fundamentally different from Wust, which concerned the possibility of granting credit for pre\u2011sentence custody under s. 719(3). However, there is no equivalent to s. 719(3) for driving prohibitions.\n[25] Section 259(1)(a) is not ambiguous when interpreted in accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the majority stated, and no credit can be granted to make the prohibition imposed less than the minimum period provided for by that provision. Moreover, the interpretation proposed by Ms. Basque would render s. 719(3) meaningless because the exception it creates would then apply to all mandatory minimums and no longer solely to custodial sanctions as stated in the provision (para. 27). The majority rejected the argument that the unavailability of credit would lead to absurd results, noting that \u201c[w]hile mandatory minimums are sometimes unfair, it is not for this Court to call them absurd\u201d (para. 31). Since a sentence begins on the day it is imposed, such credit cannot be granted \u201c[b]arring a successful constitutional challenge or clear direction from the Supreme Court\u201d (para. 39). In the circumstances, the summary conviction appeal judge had erred in crediting Ms. Basque for the length of her pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition, thereby failing to impose the mandatory minimum.\n[26] French J.A., dissenting, wrote that there is no doubt that the law requires a driving prohibition to be imposed for not less than the applicable minimum period. However, he was of the view that the prohibition may be reduced \u201cto less than the applicable minimum\u201d by granting credit for a pre\u2011sentence prohibition period, as long as the total driving prohibition still exceeds the mandatory minimum (para. 58).\n[27] The dissenting judge found that while the language of s. 259(1)(a) is generally clear, it is ambiguous with respect to the possibility of granting credit. Quoting McDonald, and drawing an analogy with Wust, he noted that absurd results would flow from interpreting s. 259(1)(a) as preventing credit from being granted. Moreover, the absence of a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) Cr. C. for driving prohibitions does not mean that Parliament intended to prohibit the granting of such credit. In fact, this Court in Lacasse expressly recognized that it is possible to grant such credit in the context of a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition and that this principle \u201capplies generally\u201d (para. 121).\n[28] Finally, both the majority and the dissenting judge agreed that the execution of the order pertaining to Ms. Basque should be stayed. The release conditions in this case were unreasonable, even if she had not initially challenged them. The result of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition was that Ms. Basque had actually been treated more harshly before being sentenced than after. In the particular circumstances of this case, and in order to avoid committing an injustice and \u201cdisproportionately punish[ing]\u201d Ms. Basque, the Court of Appeal held that the execution of any further prohibition should be stayed (majority reasons, at para. 54; see also the dissenting judge\u2019s reasons, at para. 132).\nIV. Issue\n[29] Ms. Basque raises a number of issues in this Court. They can be summarized in the following manner: Can the appellant be granted credit for the time she spent subject to a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition notwithstanding the one\u2011year mandatory minimum prohibition period set forth in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C.?\nV. Analysis\nA. Key Statutory Provisions\n[30] At the time of the events, the former s. 259(1) Cr. C. made a driving prohibition order mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, including the summary conviction offence relevant to this case (similarly, see the current s. 320.24(2) Cr. C., enacted by S.C. 2018, c. 21). Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of s. 259(1) established a gradation of mandatory minimum prohibition periods that took into account the offender\u2019s previous convictions for such offences:\nMandatory order of prohibition 259 (1) When an offender is convicted of an offence committed under section 253 or 254 . . ., the court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, or from operating a vessel or an aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be,\nOrdonnance d\u2019interdiction obligatoire 259 (1) Lorsqu\u2019un contrevenant est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019une infraction pr\u00e9vue aux articles 253 ou 254 . . ., le tribunal qui lui inflige une peine doit, en plus de toute autre peine applicable \u00e0 cette infraction, rendre une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur dans une rue, sur un chemin ou une grande route ou dans tout autre lieu public, un bateau, un a\u00e9ronef ou du mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire :\n(a) for a first offence, during a period of not more than three years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than one year;\na) pour une premi\u00e8re infraction, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019un an et maximale de trois ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9;\n(b) for a second offence, during a period of not more than five years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than two years; and\nb) pour une deuxi\u00e8me infraction, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale de deux ans et maximale de cinq ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9;\n(c) for each subsequent offence, during a period of not less than three years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment.\nc) pour chaque infraction subs\u00e9quente, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale de trois ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9.\n[31] Section 718.3(2), which is in the division of the Criminal Code dealing with \u201cPunishment Generally\u201d, provides that the punishment to be imposed (\u201cpeine \u00e0 infliger\u201d in French) is in the court\u2019s discretion, subject to the limitations set out in the enactment prescribing the punishment in question:\nDiscretion respecting punishment [718.3](2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.\nAppr\u00e9ciation du tribunal [718.3](2) Lorsqu\u2019une disposition prescrit une peine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une infraction, la peine \u00e0 infliger est, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions contenues dans la disposition, laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal qui condamne l\u2019auteur de l\u2019infraction, mais nulle peine n\u2019est une peine minimale \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e telle.\n[32] The parties also focused attention on s. 719. Its first subsection is entitled \u201cCommencement of sentence\u201d (in French, the word \u201cpeine\u201d is used as the parallel term to \u201csentence\u201d in this context). Section 719(3) is entitled \u201cDetermination of sentence\u201d (\u201cInfliction de la peine\u201d in French). These provisions read as follows:\nCommencement of sentence 719 (1) A sentence commences when it is imposed, except where a relevant enactment otherwise provides. . . . Determination of sentence (3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.\nD\u00e9but de la peine 719 (1) La peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e, sauf lorsque le texte l\u00e9gislatif applicable y pourvoit de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. . . . Infliction de la peine (3) Pour fixer la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019une infraction, le tribunal peut prendre en compte toute p\u00e9riode que la personne a pass\u00e9e sous garde par suite de l\u2019infraction; il doit, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, restreindre le temps allou\u00e9 pour cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un maximum d\u2019un jour pour chaque jour pass\u00e9 sous garde.\n[33] It is appropriate at the outset to recognize that linguistic usage in this area of sentencing is often uneven, be it in legislation, jurisprudence or scholarship. In the title for s. 259(1) Cr. C., Parliament spoke of a \u201cmandatory order of prohibition\u201d \/ \u201cordonnance d\u2019interdiction obligatoire\u201d. In the English\u2011language reasons of the Court of Appeal in this case, the terms \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d, \u201cmandatory minimum sentence\u201d and \u201cmandatory driving prohibition\u201d are used. In the French\u2011language version of the reasons, \u201cpeine minimale obligatoire\u201d and \u201cp\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019interdiction\u201d predominate. In the Criminal Code more broadly, the terms \u201cminimum punishment\u201d \/ \u201cpeine minimale\u201d are frequently used as equivalents (see, e.g., R. v. Hilbach, 2023 SCC 3, at paras. 2 and 12, interpreting s. 344(1) Cr. C. and using both \u201cmandatory minimum sentence\u201d \/ \u201cpeine minimale obligatoire\u201d and \u201cmandatory minimum punishment\u201d \/ \u201cpeine minimale obligatoire\u201d). That said, as Arbour J. wrote in Wust, \u201c[w]hat is fundamental is less the words chosen, in the French or English version, but the concepts that they carry\u201d (para. 36).\nB. Grounds of Appeal\n[34] In this Court, the appellant concedes that the sentencing judge erred in backdating her sentence; she acknowledges that he should have made the sentence commence when it was imposed in accordance with s. 719(1) Cr. C. She also acknowledges that s. 259(1)(a) provides that a driving prohibition must be imposed for a period of not less than one year. However, she submits \u2014 essentially adopting the summary conviction appeal judge\u2019s position \u2014 that the prohibition imposed by the sentencing judge was not below the mandatory minimum. Based on the principles laid down by this Court in Lacasse, the appellant takes the view that credit for the prohibition period served prior to sentencing could be granted in this case.\n[35] The appellant\u2019s main argument is one of statutory interpretation. She submits that s. 259(1)(a) is silent about the possibility of granting credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period. Further, the common law judicial discretion to apply such credit has not been displaced by the relevant statutory provisions. Moreover, she says, the interpretation espoused by the majority of the Court of Appeal produces absurd results, including the imposition of prohibition periods that do not take account of the gradation established in s. 259(1), which could not be what Parliament had intended.\n[36] The respondent Crown, relying in particular on R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, argues that courts must carry out the clear intent of Parliament even if this leads to \u201cuncomfortable or absurd result[s]\u201d (respondent\u2019s condensed book, at p. 1). In its view, there is no ambiguity in ss. 259(1)(a) and 719(1): Parliament has told judges that they must impose a one\u2011year minimum prohibition period that must commence when the offender is sentenced. Absent a constitutional challenge to the applicable provisions, courts must give effect to Parliament\u2019s intent.\n[37] The respondent also points out that Parliament is presumed to know the necessary context for the implementation of its legislation. Here, it should be presumed that Parliament was aware that some accused persons are subject to pre\u2011sentence driving prohibitions. According to the respondent, there is every indication that Parliament, in enacting s. 259(1)(a), chose not to adopt a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for driving prohibitions. In this context, the respondent adds, the argument that Parliament\u2019s silence implies that the common law discretion remains intact should be rejected. It is clear from reading ss. 259(1)(a), 718.3(2), 719(1) and 719(3) that this common law discretion has been displaced through the combined effect of the mandatory minimum and the rule that a sentence commences when it is imposed.\n[38] Without taking a position on the outcome of the appeal, the Attorney General of Alberta intervenes in support of the interpretation advanced by the respondent. The intervener submits that Parliament\u2019s silence with respect to the possibility of granting credit cannot negate its clear intent to impose a mandatory minimum commencing on the day the offender is sentenced. The Attorney General says that Lacasse is of no assistance in this case because it did not concern a mandatory minimum.\nC. Analytical Framework: Coexistence of the Common Law and Legislation in Matters of Sentencing\n[39] Both parties agree that sentencing judges have a discretion to grant credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period. However, contrary to the appellant, the Crown argues that Parliament limited or displaced this common law discretion when it enacted the mandatory minimum set out in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. This appeal therefore raises the question of whether, as the appellant maintains, the common law rule can coexist in harmony with the mandatory minimum laid down by the Criminal Code .\n[40] This question requires the Court to consider the sometimes complex interactions that characterize the relationship between the common law and legislation. While legislation may prevail over the common law, the latter remains applicable insofar as it has not been displaced expressly or by necessary implication, a principle often justified by the importance of \u201cstability in the law\u201d (R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 21, per Cromwell J.). In Lizotte, Gascon J., writing for a unanimous Court, reiterated the general principle that applies to legislative departures from common law rules: \u201cThis Court has held that it must be presumed that a legislature does not intend to change existing common law rules in the absence of a clear provision to that effect . . .\u201d (para. 56). Professor Ruth Sullivan has written that this presumption \u201cpermits courts to insist on precise and explicit direction from the legislature before accepting any change. The common law is thus shielded from unclear or inadvertent legislative encroachment\u201d (The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at \u00a7 17.01.Pt1[2]; see also P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at Nos. 180\u201192).\n[41] Canadian criminal law is made up of both statute law and common law principles (M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Trait\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de preuve et de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at Nos. 1.17\u20111.24, citing, among others, D.L.W., at paras. 3, 15 and 57\u201159). The enactment of a criminal code in this country in 1892 did not have the effect of systematically displacing the common law as a source of law (D. H. Brown, The Genesis of the Canadian Criminal Code of 1892 (1989), at p. 126; G. H. Crouse, \u201cA Critique of Canadian Criminal Legislation: Part One\u201d (1934), 12 Can. Bar Rev. 545, at p. 565: \u201cOne fundamental principle of the Canadian Codification is that the common law is not superseded.\u201d). Today, the Criminal Code provides that, as a general rule, the common law is no longer a source of offences in Canada (s. 9(a)). It states, however, that common law defences continue in force except insofar as they are altered by statute (s. 8(3); R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 27; see also J. Fortin and L. Viau, Trait\u00e9 de droit p\u00e9nal g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (1982), at p. 18). As Vauclair and Desjardins explain, reference may be made to the common law to interpret a criminal provision codifying a common law offence (No. 3.20, citing R. v. Jobidon, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714).\n[42] This coexistence of statute and common law is a feature of the law of sentencing (see Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Structure in Canada: Historical Perspectives (1988), at p. 35). While Part XXIII of the Criminal Code codifies \u201cthe fundamental . . . principles of sentencing\u201d (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 1), courts can also take account of \u201cother principles and factors arising from the common law\u201d (D. Rose, Quigley\u2019s Criminal Procedure in Canada (loose\u2011leaf), at \u00a7 23:6). Legislation also prevails over the common law in this area if Parliament displaces it expressly or by necessary implication (see, e.g., R. v. Skolnick, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 47, at p. 58).\n[43] In Lacasse, this Court reiterated that courts must take account of a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period in exercising their discretion to give credit (paras. 111\u201114, per Wagner J.; see also paras. 176\u201178, per Gascon J., dissenting, but not on this point). It is true that Lacasse did not concern a mandatory minimum and that, under s. 259(2)(a.1) Cr. C., the sentence had begun at the end of the offender\u2019s incarceration. However, the judgment can guide us in this case, with the necessary modifications.\n[44] The granting of such credit is anchored in the common law; it is one example, in the context of a driving prohibition, of what Arbour J. called the \u201cwell\u2011established practice of sentencing judges [giving] credit for time served\u201d (Wust, at para. 31). In the words of Paciocco J., as he then was, this rule is part of the \u201ccentral principles of sentencing not statutorily expressed but still vibrant as \u2018general principles of sentencing\u2019\u201d (R. v. Pham, 2013 ONCJ 635, 296 C.R.R. (2d) 178, at para. 18). As Wagner J. later noted in Lacasse, this principle has not been codified. Although s. 719(3) Cr. C. does codify the principle that credit can be granted in the case of pre\u2011sentence custody, that provision has no statutory equivalent relating to pre\u2011sentence driving prohibitions. The respondent takes the position here that the principle to which the Court referred in Lacasse was displaced by Parliament\u2019s enactment of the mandatory minimum, a consideration that did not arise on the facts of that case.\n[45] The interaction between legislation and the common law in matters of sentencing and punishment is therefore at the heart of this appeal. The two\u2011step framework used to analyze this interaction is well settled. The first step is \u201canalysing, identifying and setting out the applicable common law\u201d; and then, at the second step, \u201cthe statute law\u2019s effect on the common law must be specified\u201d (2747\u20113174 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Quebec (R\u00e9gie des permis d\u2019alcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919, at para. 97, per L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J., citing Zaidan Group Ltd. v. London (City), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 593, and Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99; see also Urban Mechanical Contracting Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co., 2022 ONCA 589, 163 O.R. (3d) 652, at para. 45). I therefore begin by determining the content of the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. I then turn to interpreting s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., taking s. 719(3) into account, in order to determine whether s. 259(1)(a) either expressly or by necessary implication has the effect of limiting or displacing the common law rule.\n(1) The Common Law Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre\u2011sentence Driving Prohibition\n[46] It is well settled that the common law allows courts to grant credit for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition imposed on an offender (see, e.g., R. v. Goulding (1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 158 (S.C. (App. Div.)); R. v. Pellicore, [1997] O.J. No. 226 (QL), 1997 CarswellOnt 246 (WL) (C.A.); R. v. Williams, 2009 NBPC 16, 346 N.B.R. (2d) 164; Bilodeau v. R., 2013 QCCA 980; Lacasse). This common law discretion is a natural extension of an analogous principle that applies in the context of pre\u2011sentence custody. Courts have long recognized that they can \u201ctake into consideration, in imposing sentence, any period of incarceration which the accused has already undergone between the date of his arrest and the date of the sentence\u201d (R. v. Sloan (1947), 87 C.C.C. 198 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 198\u201199, citing R. v. Patterson (1946), 87 C.C.C. 86 (Ont. C.A.)).\n[47] The principle that credit can be granted for pre\u2011sentence custody serves to mitigate certain injustices arising from the application of the principle that a sentence may not be backdated, now codified in s. 719(1). While Canadian law does not permit courts to backdate a sentence in order to reduce it, courts may nevertheless consider the time spent in pre\u2011sentence custody in determining the period that must be served prospectively by an offender (Sloan, at pp. 198\u201199; see also Patterson; R. v. Wells (1969), 4 C.C.C. 25 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 36\u201137, per Bull J.A., dissenting; A. Manson, \u201cPre\u2011Sentence Custody and the Determination of a Sentence (Or How to Make a Mole Hill out of a Mountain)\u201d (2004), 49 C.L.Q. 292). The application of this common law rule allowing credit to be granted is therefore not equivalent to backdating a sentence.\n[48] While it is true that the rule allowing credit for pre\u2011sentence custody has now been codified, there is no statutory provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre\u2011sentence driving prohibitions. The respondent argues that the fact that Parliament did not enact a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre\u2011sentence driving prohibitions was deliberate and reflects its intention to displace the common law rule allowing for credit in this context. Specifically, the respondent submits that Parliament \u201cturned [its] mind\u201d to the possibility of recognizing an analogous exception for driving and implicitly rejected it (transcript, at p. 28). With respect, I do not share the respondent\u2019s view. The absence of a statutory provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre\u2011sentence prohibitions does not have the effect of displacing or limiting the common law rule allowing credit to be granted in such a context.\n[49] The view that Parliament may codify one common law rule in order to implicitly exclude another calls to mind the maxim of interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius, that is, \u201cto express one thing is to exclude another\u201d (Sullivan (2022), at \u00a7 8.09; see also A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilis\u00e9es en droit (4th ed. 2007), at p. 170; McClurg v. Canada, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1020). However, courts are cautious about accepting such arguments based on Parliament\u2019s intention to implicitly exclude a common law rule since the context does not always permit assumptions to be made about a legislature\u2019s unexpressed thinking (Sullivan (2022), at \u00a7 17.01.Pt1[2]). In Turgeon v. Dominion Bank, [1930] S.C.R. 67, Newcombe J. warned that if this rule is considered to be a principle of general application, it may be \u201ca dangerous master to follow\u201d because its usefulness depends on the context and it \u201cis not always in the mind of a draughtsman\u201d (p. 71). Accordingly, Cromwell J. wrote that \u201c[a]bsent clear legislative intention to the contrary, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law, including the common law\u201d (D.L.W., at para. 21). This recalls the principle stated by Professor C. K. Allen: \u201c. . . the Courts will not, if they can help it, allow any enactment to overrule existing Common Law by inference merely\u201d, but \u201c[i]t is quite otherwise when the provision of the statute is express, or when there is a general clear intention to change the law\u201d (Law in the Making (1992), at pp. 258\u201159 (emphasis in original)).\n[50] Here, s. 719(3) was enacted in the specific context of pre\u2011sentence custody. The legislative debates suggest that Parliament\u2019s intention in enacting this provision was to ensure that credit could still be granted when a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was imposed (Wust, at para. 31, quoting House of Commons Debates, vol. 3, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., February 5, 1971, at p. 3118). There is no indication that Parliament considered whether credit could be given for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. There is also nothing in the legislative debates to support the position that Parliament sought to displace, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the common law rule applicable to such prohibitions. In short, this is not a situation in which Parliament made clear its intention to displace or limit the applicable common law.\n[51] In light of the foregoing, I am of the view that the enactment of s. 719(3) Cr. C. did not have the effect of limiting the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition. This rule thus continues to be part of the positive law of sentencing. This being so, what remains to be determined is whether the rule has been displaced or limited by s. 259(1) Cr. C., which, as the respondent points out, establishes mandatory maximum and minimum prohibition periods.\n(2) Section 259(1)(a) Cr. C. Does Not Limit the Scope of the Common Law Rule That Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre\u2011sentence Driving Prohibition\n[52] Once the common law rule has been identified, the second step in the analysis is to consider the effect of the relevant statutory provision on that rule (2747\u20113174 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., at para. 97). For this purpose, the reach of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be understood using the modern approach to statutory interpretation (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559). Then it must be determined whether this provision has the effect of limiting or displacing the common law rule.\n[53] Before undertaking this analysis, it is important to have a clear understanding of the distinction, first accepted by this Court in Wust, between the concepts of punishment and sentence. This distinction, which is at the heart of this appeal, is essential to a proper interpretation of the reach of s. 259(1)(a).\n(a) Distinction Between the Concepts of Punishment and Sentence\n[54] The question before the Court in Wust was whether an offender could be credited for pre\u2011sentence custody if doing so meant that the sentence imposed would be shorter in length than the mandatory minimum provided for in the former s. 344(a) (now s. 344(1)(a)). Writing for a unanimous Court, Arbour J. answered that question in the affirmative. She noted at the outset that s. 719(3) had been enacted for the specific purpose of authorizing such credit in the context of a mandatory minimum. In addition, and importantly, she stated that no conflict resulted from the concurrent application of ss. 719(3) and 344(a). She explained that this absence of conflict flowed from the conceptual distinction between a punishment and a sentence.\n[55] This distinction was considered from the perspective of the English\u2011language terms \u201cpunishment\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d in McDonald by Rosenberg J.A., who relied on the work of the Canadian Sentencing Commission. The Commission clarified that the term \u201cpunishment\u201d refers to \u201cthe imposition of severe deprivation on a person guilty of wrongdoing\u201d (Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach (1987), at p. 109). It then stated that the word \u201csentence\u201d \u2014 which comes from the Latin sententia, meaning \u201copinion or the expression of an opinion\u201d \u2014 refers to a judicial statement ordering the imposition of a sanction and determining what it should be (p. 111).\n[56] It can therefore be said that the concept of punishment is fundamentally different from that of sentence, since the former reflects the global punishment imposed on an offender whereas the latter concerns only the portion of the punishment that the offender must serve after judgment is rendered. Nothing in the jurisprudence precludes this distinction from being applied in this case. I note that in R. v. Mathieu, 2008 SCC 21, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 723, a case concerning parole eligibility following time spent in pre\u2011sentence custody, the Court held that only the period after sentencing is to be considered in determining such eligibility, although it acknowledged that it had dealt with the question differently in Wust (para. 7). For the purposes of a conditional sentence, on the other hand, what must be considered is the global punishment imposed on the offender, including the pre\u2011sentence period (R. v. Fice, 2005 SCC 32, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 742). Similarly, where courts have had to determine the effect of a period of pre\u2011sentence custody in cases involving a statutory maximum term of imprisonment, some provincial appellate courts have found, like this Court in Wust and Fice, that the relevant consideration is the global punishment, not the sentence imposed (R. v. Walker, 2017 ONCA 39, 345 C.C.C. (3d) 497, at paras. 20\u201126; R. v. Severight, 2014 ABCA 25, 566 A.R. 344, at para. 32; R. v. LeBlanc, 2005 NBCA 6, 279 N.B.R. (2d) 121, at para. 63).\n[57] The distinction between \u201cpeine\u201d in the sense of punishment and \u201cpeine\u201d in the sense of a sentence is recognized in the French lexicon of Canadian law, taking into account the polysemy of the term \u201cpeine\u201d (Canadian Sentencing Commission (1987), at pp. 108 and 111). Indeed, depending on the context, this term may refer either to the global punishment imposed on an offender or to the sentence handed down to an offender (see the Quebec Court of Appeal\u2019s Lexique en droit p\u00e9nal (online)). This prompted the Commission to observe the fundamental difference between \u201cpeine\u201d, in the sense of punishment, and sentence. The Juridictionnaire, a Canadian jurilinguistic study published by the Centre de traduction et de terminologie juridiques of the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, also draws this distinction, noting that [translation] \u201c[t]he peine [in the sense of \u201cpunishment\u201d] is the sanction incurred, whereas the sentence is the judicial decision imposing a punishment\u201d (J. Picotte, Juridictionnaire: Recueil des difficult\u00e9s et des ressources du fran\u00e7ais juridique, October 15, 2018 (online), at p. 2035, para. 24 (emphasis in original)). In other words, whereas a sentence commences when it is handed down by a court, punishment encompasses [translation] \u201c[a]ny sanction imposed by a judicial authority in the application of a criminal statute\u201d (H. Dumont, P\u00e9nologie: Le droit canadien relatif aux peines et aux sentences (1993), at p. 47).\n[58] The double meaning of the French term \u201cpeine\u201d is illustrated in several places in the Criminal Code . For example, s. 718.3(2), which limits judicial discretion where a mandatory minimum punishment exists, uses the term \u201cpeine\u201d as the equivalent of the English \u201cpunishment\u201d. In contrast, s. 719(1), which states that \u201c[a] sentence commences when it is imposed\u201d, also uses the term \u201cpeine\u201d in French, but this time as the parallel to the English term \u201csentence\u201d. The identification of the exact English equivalent of the term \u201cpeine\u201d (be it \u201cpunishment\u201d or \u201csentence\u201d) depends on the context; this doublet may therefore give rise to interpretative difficulties in Canadian criminal law, where the rules for interpreting the bilingual legislative lexicon give each language version of an enactment an equal role in stating the law. Of course, this is not to say that the English word \u201csentence\u201d is exclusively used to refer to the judicial decision imposing a punishment. By way of example, the phrase \u201cfit sentence\u201d (often stated in French as \u201cpeine juste\u201d) typically refers to the idea of an appropriate global punishment (see, e.g., R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at para. 45).\n[59] In light of this reality, and beyond the terminology used, particular attention should be paid to the purpose and context of the relevant provisions (Wust, at para. 36). It is true that, as a general rule, Parliament can be expected to exercise [translation] \u201cdiscipline\u201d in legislative expression by not giving the same word different meanings in the same statute (G. Cornu, Linguistique juridique (3rd ed. 2005), at p. 105). In this vein, Professors C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Devinat refer to the [translation] \u201cprinciple of uniformity of expression\u201d with which Parliament strives to comply and which, in statutory interpretation, justifies a presumption that \u201ca word has the same meaning throughout\u201d a statute (Nos. 1142\u201143). They recognize, however, that this presumption [translation] \u201cmust give way when circumstances demonstrate that such was not the intention pursued by Parliament\u201d (No. 1146, quoting Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 61). In my view, this is such a case. The word \u201cpeine\u201d is used in different ways in the Criminal Code , sometimes to refer to a sentence, that is, a judicial decision, and sometimes to refer to a punishment. I note that most cases not involving pre\u2011sentence prohibition orders or custody do not hinge on the conceptual distinction between \u201csentence\u201d and \u201cpunishment\u201d.\n[60] With this distinction in mind, I observe that the appellant\u2019s position as set out in her factum could be a source of confusion. She suggests that granting credit results in the imposition of a prohibition period that is less than the statutory minimum. This approach reflects a line of cases, exemplified by R. v. Sohal, 2019 ABCA 293, 91 Alta. L.R. (6th) 48, in which courts appear not to distinguish between the concepts of punishment and sentence. This approach suggests, mistakenly in my respectful view, that the enactment of a mandatory minimum by Parliament requires a court to hand down a minimum sentence (see also R. v. Fox, 2022 ABQB 132, 89 M.V.R. (7th) 23; R. v. Froese, 2020 MBQB 11, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 1; R. v. Osnach, 2019 MBPC 1, 38 M.V.R. (7th) 257; R. v. Bryden, 2007 NBQB 316, 323 N.B.R. (2d) 119). According to this approach, there is no legal basis for reducing a mandatory minimum sentence because \u201c[t]he inherent discretion of the court must yield to statutory language\u201d (Sohal, at para. 15).\n[61] However, when the appellant clarified her position at the hearing, she rightly recognized \u2014 as did the dissenting judge in this case \u2014 that a court has no choice but to impose the mandatory minimum prohibition expressly provided for in s. 259(1)(a). But the imposition of that minimum does not prevent the court, under the common law rule, from taking into account the pre\u2011sentence prohibition period. Depending on the circumstances and at the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion, this period may form part of the punishment if the effect of the prohibition is \u201cthe same\u201d before and after the offender is sentenced (Lacasse, at para. 113). Otherwise, if the effect is not the same, the court may consider it only as a mitigating factor, not as a period that can be credited pursuant to the common law discretion (see MacPherson J.A.\u2019s reasoning on this point in R. v. Panday, 2007 ONCA 598, 87 O.R. (3d) 1, at paras. 32\u201135).\n[62] In this appeal, in light of the distinction reiterated by Arbour J. in Wust, it is therefore important to determine whether s. 259(1)(a) requires that a minimum punishment be imposed or that a minimum sentence be handed down. This interpretative exercise is what will decide the outcome of the appeal. If the minimum driving prohibition in s. 259(1)(a) is a minimum punishment, this section will not affect the applicability of the common law rule. Ms. Basque\u2019s pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition can then \u201creduce\u201d the ultimate length of her sentence in a manner consistent with Parliament\u2019s direction that the minimum punishment must be for one year. Conversely, if s. 259(1)(a) provides for a one\u2011year minimum sentence, Ms. Basque will have to serve an additional one\u2011year driving prohibition since this mandatory sentence will necessarily be prospective (s. 719(1) Cr. C.).\n(b) Section 259(1)(a) Provides for a Minimum Punishment, Not a Minimum Sentence\n[63] In accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the meaning of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be determined by considering its text, context and purpose (Rizzo, at para. 21; Bell ExpressVu, at para. 26; C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Devinat, at Nos. 165\u201170; E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). I propose to proceed as the Court did in Bell ExpressVu, that is, by looking first at the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words used in s. 259(1)(a) and then considering the provision\u2019s context and purpose.\n[64] First of all, the text of s. 259(1)(a) is silent about whether a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition period can be taken into account (Bland, at para. 22). It also does not clearly indicate whether the minimum driving prohibition it provides for is a punishment or a sentence. In this regard, I note that the word \u201corder\u201d used in s. 259(1) is defined as a \u201cdecision of a court or judge\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary (online)). A priori, this distinction may seem to link the word \u201corder\u201d to the concept of \u201csentence\u201d (Pham, at para. 9).\n[65] However, I would point out that the word \u201cpunishment\u201d appears in s. 259(1), which provides that \u201cthe court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle\u201d. It may be noted that the French version uses the word \u201cpeine\u201d as the parallel term for \u201cpunishment\u201d in this context. The wording of the provision in both languages thus suggests the view that the order to be made under s. 259(1)(a) is a punishment and not a sentence.\n[66] In any event, the modern approach to interpretation cannot be focused solely on the words of the provision (Rizzo, at para. 21; Bell ExpressVu, at para. 26). As Professors C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Devinat say, the text [translation] \u201cmust be construed in the light of the other indicia relevant to interpretation\u201d (No. 167). I now turn to an analysis of the context and purpose of s. 259(1)(a).\n[67] With regard to the context of this provision, I note that Parliament used different language in s. 109(2)(a) Cr. C., which deals with a prohibition against the possession of firearms. This latter provision states that \u201c[a]n order made under subsection (1) shall . . . prohibit the person from possessing . . . any firearm . . . during the period that (i) begins on the day on which the order is made, and (ii) ends not earlier than ten years after the person\u2019s release from imprisonment after conviction for the offence or, if the person is not then imprisoned or subject to imprisonment, after the person\u2019s conviction for or discharge from the offence\u201d (emphasis added). In enacting s. 109(2)(a), Parliament chose to specify the date on which the order ends in the plainest of terms, thereby limiting the court\u2019s discretion to \u201creduce\u201d the prohibition period going forward to less than the minimum period referred to in s. 109(2)(a). Moreover, the underlined passage shows that when Parliament wishes to impose a prospective prohibition for a specific length of time, it expresses this intention in clear language. However, there is nothing of the sort in s. 259(1)(a), which sets out neither a start date nor an end date for the one\u2011year minimum driving prohibition.\n[68] The purpose of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. also reinforces the idea that this provision establishes a minimum punishment and not a minimum sentence. Generally speaking, Parliament enacts mandatory minimums principally in order to deter and punish (see H. Parent and J. Desrosiers, Trait\u00e9 de droit criminel, t. III, La peine (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 507\u20118; see also Paciocco, at p. 177). After setting out a detailed typology of punishments in Canadian criminal law, Professor Dumont states that [translation] \u201cany coercive measure that affects a person\u2019s life, integrity, security, liberty or reputation or that interferes with the person\u2019s property and rights . . . is capable of being [a punishment] in the criminal law system\u201d (p. 489). As was stated in R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, for a coercive measure to constitute punishment, it must, among other things, have \u201ca significant impact on an offender\u2019s liberty or security interests\u201d and be \u201ca consequence of conviction\u201d (para. 41). This typology includes measures such as [translation] \u201cvictim compensation for certain crimes, a prohibition against driving or possessing a firearm [and] an inability to hold office or enter into a contract with the state\u201d (Dumont, at p. 489 (emphasis added)). I agree with the view expressed by Paciocco J. in this regard in Pham: a driving prohibition is a form of punishment because it \u201cis one of the arsenal of sanctions to which the accused may be liable upon conviction for a particular offence\u201d (para. 22, referring to R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at paras. 62\u201163).\n[69] While pre\u2011sentence custody or a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition may initially be based on a desire to protect the public, post\u2011conviction, this sanction can nevertheless ultimately have a punitive and deterrent effect on the offender and thus form part of the offender\u2019s punishment. On this point, Arbour J. wrote in Wust that \u201c[t]o maintain that pre\u2011sentencing custody can never be deemed punishment following conviction because the legal system does not punish innocent people is an exercise in semantics that does not acknowledge the reality of pre\u2011sentencing custody\u201d (para. 41 (emphasis in original)). She found that \u201cwhile pre\u2011trial detention is not intended as punishment when it is imposed, it is, in effect, deemed part of the punishment following the offender\u2019s conviction\u201d (para. 41).\n[70] These observations echo what Lamer C.J. said in Sharma, namely that the pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition imposed on the offender had interfered with his liberty, such that he had essentially already begun serving his sentence (pp. 817\u201118; see also Lacasse, at para. 113). In reality, in Ms. Basque\u2019s case, the pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition had the same punitive and deterrent effects as if it had been served after she was sentenced. Accordingly, viewing s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. as requiring the imposition of a one\u2011year punishment \u2014 that is, a global punishment, including the pre\u2011sentence period \u2014 is perfectly in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and punishment that underlie this provision (on this point, see Pham, at paras. 10 and 28). I note, moreover, that Parliament uses the word \u201cpunishment\u201d in s. 718.3(2) Cr. C. in delineating the court\u2019s discretion.\n[71] If s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required that a minimum sentence be handed down, the results could well be counterintuitive, if not absurd. For example, the imposition of an additional driving prohibition for a minimum of one year would amount to double punishment for an offender who had already served all or part of the minimum driving prohibition period while awaiting trial. Such a result would be contrary to the most fundamental interests of justice, raising the spectre of double punishment \u201cwithout the clearest of evidence to show that Parliament wanted to achieve such an outcome\u201d (Pham, at para. 10).\n[72] In addition, by analogy to what Arbour J. said in Wust, the appropriate difference between the punishments imposed on the most dangerous offenders and those imposed on the least dangerous offenders could be unduly eroded. A hardened offender \u201cwhose sentence exceeded the minimum would benefit from pre\u2011sentencing credit, while the first time offender whose sentence would be set at the minimum, would not receive credit for his or her pre\u2011sentencing detention\u201d (para. 42). Drawing on Arbour J.\u2019s comments, I am of the view that any interpretation \u201cthat would reward the worst offender and penalize the least offender\u201d (para. 42) must be avoided in this case. Finally, if s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required a minimum sentence to be handed down, it would undermine the precise gradation of minimum prohibition periods established by Parliament in s. 259(1)(a), (b) and (c), which French J.A., dissenting, noted (see C.A. reasons, at paras. 93\u201194 and 129). Indeed, an offender who merited only the one\u2011year minimum punishment imposed for a first offence could, like Ms. Basque, be subject to the same deprivation of liberty as a chronic offender who was not prohibited from driving while awaiting trial.\n[73] In keeping with the principles established by this Court, absent a clear intention to this effect, it must be presumed that Parliament did not intend to produce such absurd results (Rizzo, at para. 27, citing R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 88; Keatley Surveying Ltd. v. Teranet Inc., 2019 SCC 43, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 418, at para. 96, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown JJ., concurring).\n(c) Section 259(1)(a) Does Not Limit the Common Law Rule That Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre\u2011Sentence Driving Prohibition\n[74] There is every indication that s. 259(1)(a) provides for a minimum punishment, not a minimum sentence. There is no ambiguity in this provision, which is silent with respect to credit. In Bell ExpressVu, this Court reiterated that an ambiguity must be \u201creal\u201d, in the sense that the provision must be reasonably capable of more than one meaning (para. 29, quoting Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115). Reaching this conclusion requires a consideration of the entire context of the provision to ascertain whether there are \u201ctwo or more plausible readings, each equally in accordance with the intentions of the statute\u201d (CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at para. 14). In this case, s. 259(1)(a) can be read in only one way: it provides for the imposition of a mandatory minimum punishment (in French \u201cpeine\u201d, used in this latter sense).\n[75] Not only does this interpretation of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. leave room for the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to grant credit, but it is also in line with the recommendation made by Arbour J. in Wust that \u201cit is important to interpret legislation which deals . . . with mandatory minimum sentences, in a manner that is consistent with general principles of sentencing, and that does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system\u201d (para. 22).\n[76] Because s. 259(1)(a) requires that an order be made prohibiting the offender from driving during a period of not less than one year, the sentencing judge was able to satisfy this requirement by making an order imposing a punishment for a total of one year. Granting credit does not negate the imposition of the minimum punishment required by this provision. In this case, since the punishment had already been served in its entirety at the time of sentencing, no further prohibition was required.\nD. Court of Appeal\u2019s Stay of Execution of the Sentence\n[77] While not necessary in order to decide this appeal, I take note of the Crown\u2019s concession that it was inappropriate to ask that Ms. Basque\u2019s release be accompanied by a driving prohibition. The Court of Appeal was correct in its unanimous view that the release conditions imposed on Ms. Basque were unreasonable. She was ultimately prohibited from driving for 21 months and was thus treated more harshly than another offender not subject to a pre\u2011sentence driving prohibition in otherwise similar, or more serious, circumstances. It is therefore understandable that the Court of Appeal was concerned about justice and fairness when it stayed the execution of the sentence imposed on Ms. Basque. The same preoccupation finds expression in the lower courts\u2019 judgments, even though they decided the case differently. The unanimous concern of the Court of Appeal aligns, in substance if not in law, with the solution proposed here. But with all due respect for the contrary view, reaching this solution does not require staying the execution of Ms. Basque\u2019s sentence. From a legal standpoint, she has served the mandatory minimum punishment provided for in s. 259(1)(a).\nVI. Disposition\n[78] I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I would restore the judgment of the summary conviction appeal court and reinstate the Provincial Court\u2019s conclusions in part, while specifying that Ms. Basque\u2019s sentence should not be backdated. By the time she was sentenced, she had already served, on a pre\u2011sentence basis, the minimum driving prohibition set out in s. 259(1)(a). As a result, no further prohibition is needed in this case.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fowler Law P.C.

C. (S.C. 2018, c. 21), which is \u201calmost identical\u201d to s. 259(1)(a), as the majority of the Court of Appeal noted (2021 NBCA 50, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 1, at para. 13).\n"

C\u201146, ss. 244.2(1) (a), 244.2(3) (b).\nFollowing an incident in May 2014 where the accused shot at a car and at a residential home with a hunting rifle, the accused pled guilty to a number of offences, including intentionally discharging a firearm into or at a place, knowing that or being reckless as to whether another person is present in the place, contrary to s. 244.2(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . At the time, this offence carried a mandatory minimum sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment, set out in s. 244.2(3) (b). The accused brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter , arguing that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate and therefore constituted cruel and unusual punishment. His challenge relied on a hypothetical scenario, where a young person intentionally discharges an air\u2011powered pistol or rifle at a residence that is incapable of perforating the residence\u2019s walls.\nThe sentencing judge found that s. 244.2(3)(b) was grossly disproportionate in the hypothetical scenario relied on by the accused and concluded the infringement of s. 12 could not be justified under s. 1 of the Charter . He sentenced the accused to three and a half years of incarceration. The Crown appealed both the finding that s. 244.2(3)(b) infringed s. 12 of the Charter and the accused\u2019s sentence. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on both grounds. It set aside the sentencing judge\u2019s declaration of invalidity of the mandatory minimum sentence and imposed the minimum sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment.\nHeld (C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: The mandatory minimum sentence set out in s. 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code is grossly disproportionate. It infringes s. 12 of the Charter and is not saved by s. 1 . It is immediately declared of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 , and the declaration applies retroactively. The three\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011year sentence imposed on the accused by the sentencing judge is reinstated.\nSection 12 of the Charter grants individuals a right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the state. The underlying purpose of s. 12 is to prevent the state from inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment. It is meant to protect human dignity and respect the inherent worth of individuals. Section 12 has two prongs that are united by their shared animating purpose of safeguarding human dignity. First, s. 12 protects against the imposition of punishment that is so excessive as to be incompatible with human dignity. This prong is concerned with the severity of a punishment and queries whether the effects of an impugned punishment are grossly disproportionate to the appropriate punishment in a given case. Mandatory minimum sentences are analyzed under this prong of s. 12. Second, s. 12 protects against the imposition of punishment and treatment that are cruel and unusual because, by their very nature, they are intrinsically incompatible with human dignity. Under the second prong, the focus is on the method of punishment. The narrow class of punishments that fall within the second category will always be grossly disproportionate because these punishments are in themselves contrary to human dignity because of their degrading and dehumanizing nature.\nTo assess whether a mandatory minimum sentence violates s. 12 of the Charter , the Court has developed a two\u2011stage inquiry: a court must (1) assess what constitutes a fit and proportionate sentence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing; and (2) consider whether the impugned provision requires the imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate, not merely excessive, to the fit and proportionate sentence. This two\u2011part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (a) the actual offender before the court, or (b) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case or hypothetical scenario. Where the court concludes that the term of imprisonment prescribed by the mandatory minimum sentence provision is grossly disproportionate in either case, the provision infringes s. 12 and the court must turn to consider whether that infringement can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter if arguments or evidence to that effect are raised by the Crown.\nThe first stage of the s. 12 inquiry involves the individualized process of determining what a fit and proportionate sentence is for the particular (or representative) offender under consideration using the general sentencing principles set out by Parliament. It involves a complex and multifactorial assessment. To assist in this assessment, Parliament enacted s. 718 of the Criminal Code . Proper consideration is to be given to various objectives such as denunciation, deterrence, rehabilitation, providing reparations for harm done to victims, promoting a sense of responsibility and, when necessary, separating offenders from society. No sentencing objective should be applied to the exclusion of all others. Courts should also consider any aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender. Whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the objectives for sentencing in the Criminal Code , the resulting sentence must respect the fundamental principle of proportionality. Proportionality is a central tenet of Canada\u2019s sentencing regime, with roots that predate the recognition of it as the fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code . Founded in fairness and justice, the purpose of proportionality is to prevent unjust punishment for the sake of the common good and it serves as a limiting function to ensure that there is justice for the offender. The amount of punishment an offender receives must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s moral blameworthiness. The gravity of the offence refers to the seriousness of the offence and should be measured by taking into account the consequences of the offender\u2019s actions on victims and public safety, and the physical and psychological harms that flowed from the offence. The offender\u2019s moral culpability or degree of responsibility should be measured by gauging the essential substantive elements of the offence including the offence\u2019s mens rea, the offender\u2019s conduct in the commission of the offence, the offender\u2019s motive for committing the offence, and aspects of the offender\u2019s background that increase or decrease the offender\u2019s individual responsibility for the crime, including the offender\u2019s personal circumstances and mental capacity. Moreover, since sentencing is a highly individualized and discretionary endeavour, a sentencing judge cannot simply approximate a sentence or otherwise provide a range of penalties. The judge is expected to articulate an individual, specific and defined sentence.\nPunishments can be impugned not only on the basis that they infringe the s. 12 rights of a particular offender, but also on the basis that they infringe those of a reasonably foreseeable offender. Because it is the nature of the law that is at issue, not the claimant\u2019s status, it suffices for a claimant to allege unconstitutional effects in their case or on third parties. In crafting reasonable hypotheticals, a court is examining the scope of the impugned law and not merely the justice of a particular sentence imposed by a judge at trial. A reasonable hypothetical scenario needs to be constructed with care and should include five characteristics. First, the hypothetical must be reasonably foreseeable. It ought not to be a far\u2011fetched or marginally imaginable case, nor should it be a remote or extreme example. The appropriate approach is to construct a reasonably foreseeable offender with characteristics and in circumstances that are reasonably foreseeable based on judicial experience and common sense. What must be considered is how the provision impacts other persons who might reasonably be caught by it and the reasonably foreseeable situations in which the law may apply. Second, in defining the scope of the hypothetical scenario and the qualities of a reasonably foreseeable offender, courts may rely on reported cases since they not only illustrate the range of real-life conduct captured by the offence, they actually happened. However, courts may modify the facts of a reported case to illustrate reasonably foreseeable scenarios. Third, the hypothetical must be reasonable in view of the range of conduct in the offence in question. It needs to involve conduct that falls within the relevant provision. The scope of the offence can be explored and it is permissible to establish the breadth of the offence by reference to how it may be committed and by whom; however, straining each and every constituent element by fanciful facts is not helpful. Fourth, characteristics that are reasonably foreseeable for offenders, like age, poverty, race, Indigeneity, mental health issues and addiction, may be considered in crafting reasonable hypotheticals. Proportionality requires a consideration of the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s particular circumstances, which include their personal characteristics. Including such characteristics in hypothetical scenarios strengthens the analytical device by helping courts explore the reach of the mandatory penalty. However, the scenarios should not involve the most sympathetic offender but rather present a reasonably foreseeable offender. The hypothetical cannot be remote, far\u2011fetched or utterly unrealistic. A court should be wary of detailed scenarios that stack mitigating factors combined with an interpretation that stretches and strains the technical meaning of the offence. Fifth, reasonable hypotheticals are best tested through the adversarial process. Although it is up to the offender\/claimant to articulate and advance the reasonably foreseeable hypothetical which forms the basis for the claim that the impugned provision is unconstitutional, all parties should ideally be afforded a fair opportunity to challenge or comment upon the reasonableness of the hypothetical before making submissions on its constitutional implications. In doing so, parties can help the judge determine what type of hypothetical is reasonable in the circumstances. However, while testing the reasonable hypothetical through the adversarial process is to be encouraged, it is not mandatory in the sense that its absence represents a reviewable error.\nThe general sentencing principles applicable to an actual offender also apply when fixing a sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender. Sentencing judges are bound by the Criminal Code and they must consider the sentencing proposals argued by counsel and utilize the method of analysis endorsed in their jurisdiction (whether sentencing ranges or starting point\u2011sentences). As with cases involving an actual offender, courts should fix as narrowly defined a sentence as possible for a reasonably foreseeable offender. A court, however, may find it somewhat more difficult to fix a specific sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender, given that hypotheticals are advanced without evidence or detailed facts. Accordingly, some latitude in fixing the fit sentence may be necessary. Courts may specify, for instance, that a sentence would be around a certain number of months. Any estimate must be circumscribed and tightly defined.\nOnce the fit sentence has been determined at the first stage, the second stage requires a contextual comparison between the fit sentence and the impugned mandatory minimum to see whether the latter complies with the widely\u2011worded right set out in s. 12. Whether a mandatory minimum sentence is challenged based on its effect on the actual offender or on a reasonably foreseeable offender in a reasonable hypothetical, gross disproportionality is the applicable standard for invalidating it under s. 12 as cruel and unusual punishment. As the purpose of s. 12 is to safeguard human dignity, it protects offenders against grossly disproportionate terms of imprisonment. Furthermore, when comparing a mandatory minimum sentence to the fit sentence, the focus must be on the sentence itself. Courts must not consider parole eligibility as a factor reducing the actual impact of the impugned sentence, because the possibility of parole cannot cure a grossly disproportionate sentence.\nThe first part of the comparative task is to articulate what, if any, differences exist between the fit sentence identified at stage one and the mandatory minimum. Second, the punishment must be disproportionate in a manner or amount that is grossly so. This requires both the identification of any disparity between the sentences and an assessment of the mandatory minimum\u2019s effect and severity against constitutional standards. The process of assessing the existence and extent of any disparity between a fit punishment and the mandatory minimum imposed bears a resemblance to what occurs when a sentence is appealed and challenged as being demonstrably unfit. In such cases, there is a comparison between what would be fit and what has been imposed. However, gross disproportionality is a constitutional standard and a high bar. The elevated standard of gross disproportionality is intended to reflect a measure of deference to Parliament in crafting sentencing provisions. The word \u201cgrossly\u201d signals Parliament is not required to impose perfectly proportionate sentences, which would undermine the ability of Parliament to establish norms of punishment, including mandatory minimum sentences. This is because, in respect of mandatory minimums, there is likely to be some disproportion between the individually fit sentence and the uniform mandatory minimum. In this regard, a sentence may be demonstrably unfit in the sense that an appellate court would intervene, but nevertheless not meet the constitutional threshold of being grossly disproportionate.\nThree crucial components must be assessed when determining whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate. The first component is the scope and reach of the offence. The case law reveals that a mandatory minimum sentence is more exposed to challenge where it captures disparate conduct of widely varying gravity and degrees of offender culpability. The wider the scope of the offence, the more likely there is a circumstance where the mandatory minimum will impose a lengthy term of imprisonment on conduct that involves lesser risk to the public and little moral fault. A court must assess to what extent the offence\u2019s mens rea and actus reus capture a range of conduct as well as the degree of variation in the offence\u2019s gravity and the offender\u2019s culpability. It may consider whether the offence necessarily involves harm to a person or simply the risk of harm, whether there are ways of committing the offence that pose relatively little danger, and to what degree the offence\u2019s mens rea requires an elevated degree of culpability of the offender.\nThe second component in the gross disproportionality analysis is the effects of the penalty on the offender. Courts must aim to identify the precise harm associated with the punishment. This calls for an inquiry into the effects that the impugned punishment may have on the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender both generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities. The principle of proportionality implies that where the impact of imprisonment is greater on a particular offender, a reduction in sentence may be appropriate. For this reason, courts have reduced sentences to reflect the comparatively harsher experience of imprisonment for certain offenders, like offenders in law enforcement, for those suffering disabilities, or for those whose experience of prison is harsher due to systemic racism. A court should also consider the additional period of imprisonment imposed by the mandatory minimum, given the profound impact of imprisonment.\nThe last component of the analysis focuses on the penalty and its objectives. When assessing gross disproportion, courts assess the severity of the punishment mandated by Parliament to determine whether and to what extent the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives relevant to the offence while having regard to the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives. Denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific, are valid sentencing principles. However, deference to Parliament\u2019s decision to impose denunciatory sentences cannot be unlimited, as this purpose could support sentences of unlimited length. In enacting mandatory minimums, Parliament can prioritize some sentencing objectives over others, but within certain limits. Given the purpose of s. 12, the role given to rehabilitation when considering a mandatory minimum will help determine if the provision amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. While rehabilitation has no standalone constitutional status, there is a strong connection between the objective of rehabilitation and human dignity. A punishment that completely disregards rehabilitation would disrespect and be incompatible with human dignity and would therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12. In order to respect s. 12, punishment or sentencing must take rehabilitation into account. In addition, courts should assess whether the length of imprisonment legislated is too excessive in light of other potentially adequate alternatives. There is no mathematical formula to determine the specific number of years that would make a sentence in excess of a legitimate penal aim. The analysis, in all cases, must be contextual and there is no hard number above or below which a sentence becomes grossly disproportionate. A mandatory minimum sentence, however, will be constitutionally suspect and require careful scrutiny when it provides no discretion to impose a sentence other than imprisonment in circumstances where there should not be imprisonment, given the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s culpability. In addition, a minimum sentence can be grossly disproportionate where a fit and proportionate sentence would include a lengthy term of imprisonment. A mandatory minimum that adds to an offender\u2019s prison sentence may have a significant effect, given the profound consequences of incarceration on an offender\u2019s life and liberty. Courts should evaluate the punishment in light of the principles of parity and proportionality.\nIn the instant case, the hypothetical scenario raised by the accused is reasonably foreseeable. It falls within the scope of the offence and does not stretch or strain its constituent elements. The actus reus of the offence requires an offender to discharge a firearm into or at a place, which means any building or structure. A residence constitutes a place. As for whether an air\u2011powered rifle or pistol could constitute a firearm per s. 2 of the Criminal Code , the expert evidence revealed that there are numerous air\u2011powered rifles and pistols commonly available in Canada which meet the Criminal Code definition of a firearm, but are not capable of perforating a typical residential framed wall assembly. It is also reasonably foreseeable to imagine a young person firing a BB gun or a paintball gun at a house as part of a game, to pass time, or for a bit of mischief.\nAt the first stage of the s. 12 inquiry, a fit sentence for the hypothetical offender in the accused\u2019s proposed scenario would not involve imprisonment. Because the gravity of the offence and the culpability of the offender in this scenario are low, and the youthfulness of the offender acts as a mitigating factor, the fit and proportionate sentence is a suspended sentence of up to 12 months\u2019 probation. At stage two of the inquiry, the analysis leads to the conclusion that the four\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 244.2(3)(b) is grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence. It applies to an offence that captures a wide spectrum of conduct, ranging from acts that present little danger to the public to those that pose a grave risk. The mandatory punishment would have significant deleterious effects on youthful offenders, who are viewed as having high rehabilitative prospects. Therefore, the mandatory minimum\u2019s effect is extremely severe as it replaces a probationary sentence with four years of imprisonment. A four\u2011year custodial sentence is so excessive as to be significantly out of sync with sentencing norms and goes far beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing goals for this offence. Denunciation and deterrence cannot support the minimum punishment, nor does the minimum show any respect for the principles of parity and proportionality. It would outrage Canadians to learn that an offender can receive four years of imprisonment for firing a paintball gun at a home. As the Crown does not advance any argument or evidence to demonstrate that the punishment may be justified under s. 1, there is no need to address this issue.\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The four-year mandatory minimum sentence formerly imposed by s. 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code does not violate s. 12 of the Charter .\nThere is agreement with the majority\u2019s affirmation of the two\u2011stage inquiry for determining whether a mandatory minimum sentence violates s. 12. Courts must: (1) determine what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence, having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing; and (2) ask whether the mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate to the sentence that would be fit and proportionate, either for the actual offender or for another offender in a reasonable hypothetical case.\nHowever, there is disagreement with the majority\u2019s attempt to clarify the established framework through a new three-part test for gross disproportionality. The majority sets out three components to be assessed at stage two of the framework: (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects of the punishment on the offender; and (3) the penalty and its objectives. Each of these duplicates considerations relevant to determining the low end of the range of fit and proportionate sentences for the offence at stage one. At the second stage, whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate in relation to the length of the fit sentence \u2014 i.e., whether it is a sentence that is beyond merely excessive but so excessive as to outrage standards of decency \u2014 remains a normative judgment.\nThere is also disagreement with the majority\u2019s interpretation of s. 244.2(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . Parliament did not intend s. 244.2 to capture the reckless discharge of firearms in situations which present little danger to the public. Rather, it targeted offenders who specifically turned their mind to the fact that discharging their firearm would jeopardize the lives or safety of others. The actus reus of the offence, on its own, would extend to a wide range of conduct. But the scope of the offence is narrowed significantly by its mental element. The double mens rea requirement of s. 244.2(1) (a) captures only offenders who (1) intentionally discharge a firearm into or at a building or other place, with (2) knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants \u2014 and thus, who have turned their mind to the fact that shooting the firearm could put the lives or safety of others at risk. This interpretation, consistent with that of previous appellate courts, gives effect to the real intention of Parliament.\nProperly interpreted, mere probation is not a fit and proportionate sentence for the s. 244.2(1)(a) offence. The hypothetical air\u2011powered rifle scenario put forth by the accused at trial does not, without more, involve the kind of conduct that the law may reasonably be expected to catch. This scenario is crafted primarily on the offence\u2019s actus reus. There is no sufficient basis on which to conclude that the requisite mens rea would be satisfied. Missing from the hypothetical is whether the offender turned his mind to the presence of occupants, and the corresponding risk to lives or safety. The majority\u2019s position, which depends on the presence of a residential wall to protect occupants, ignores the possibility that bullets could go through a window or door, psychological effects on occupants or neighbours, and the risk of escalating violence. Intentionally shooting any firearm \u2014 which, by definition, must be capable of causing serious injury or death \u2014 into or at a building or other place, with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants, is highly dangerous and culpable conduct. The absence of serious injury or death will just be a matter of luck.\nA sentence of two years should properly be considered the low end of the range of fit and proportionate sentences in reasonably foreseeable applications of s. 244.2(1)(a). The minimum four\u2011year sentence imposed by s. 244.2(3)(b) would double this period of incarceration. The effects of this should not be minimized and may be devastating. However, as a constitutional matter, this additional period of imprisonment does not meet the high threshold established by the Court for cruel and unusual punishment. A mandatory minimum sentence oversteps constitutional limits when it is grossly disproportionate, beyond merely excessive. It is only on rare occasions that the Court has found a minimum sentence to violate s. 12, in contrast to punishments which are cruel and unusual by nature such as torture or castration. Parliament is within its rights to emphasize the objectives of deterrence and denunciation in the context of firearms offences. The Court has repeatedly affirmed the denunciatory role of minimum sentences for conduct which offends our society\u2019s basic code of values. The intentional shooting of a life\u2011threatening firearm into or at a building or other place, with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants, is a clear example of such conduct.\nThe hypothetical scenario relied on by the majority is unmoored from judicial experience and common sense. It has not resulted in a single conviction under s. 244.2(1)(a) \u2014 nor would it, on a proper interpretation of the offence. Section 244.2(1)(a) only captures intentional shootings which are highly blameworthy and antithetical to the peace of the community. A four\u2011year minimum sentence is not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency or incompatible with human dignity to rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\nApplied: R. v.

Introduction\n[1] This appeal, and the companion appeal of R. v. Hilbach, 2023 SCC 3, provide the Court with an opportunity to clarify the legal principles that govern when the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentencing provision is challenged under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . At issue in both appeals are three different offences under the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which involve the use of a firearm. In this appeal, the appellant, Jesse Dallas Hills, was convicted of discharging a firearm into or at a home under s. 244.2(1) (a). Mr. Hills challenges the four\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence previously imposed by s. 244.2(3) (b) for this offence. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 244.2(3) (b) was repealed after this appeal was heard. Despite this legislative change, the reasons examine the impugned mandatory minimum as previously enacted. In the companion case, Ocean William Storm Hilbach and Curtis Zwozdesky were convicted of armed robbery. They challenge, respectively, the five\u2011year mandatory minimum for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm under s. 344(1) (a)(i) and the former four\u2011year mandatory minimum for robbery with a firearm under s. 344(1) (a.1 ). The mandatory minimum sentence set out in s. 344(1) (a.1 ) was also repealed after the Hilbach appeal was heard.\n[2] In both appeals, the offenders argue that the prescribed mandatory minimum sentences constitute cruel and unusual punishment contrary to s. 12 of the Charter . They claim that these automatic sentences, which impose a stated minimum term of imprisonment, are grossly disproportionate to what would be a fit and appropriate punishment and therefore offend the Charter . Mr. Hills and Mr. Zwozdesky admit that the minimum sentences were warranted based on the facts of their cases, but nevertheless challenge the law based on how the sentencing provisions could reasonably apply to others for whom they claim the minimum penalties imposed would be constitutionally infirm punishments.\n[3] This is not the first time the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences has been before this Court. While these appeals reveal some of the challenges faced when determining whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate, there is no reason to upset sound and settled law and adopt the new approaches advocated by some parties, interveners and judges of the Alberta Court of Appeal. The principles for assessing whether a punishment is cruel and unusual are well established and were recently and unanimously affirmed in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23. In this decision, the Court seeks to provide further guidance, direction and clarity. These reasons offer a framework in response to submissions in both this appeal and in Hilbach. As such, I will not distinguish between submissions from counsel in both cases addressing suggested changes to the s. 12 framework.\n[4] In this appeal, I first set out the generally applicable framework and foundational principles for the s. 12 analysis and then apply them to Mr. Hills and, in Hilbach, to Mr. Hilbach and Mr. Zwozdesky. Whether a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate will depend upon the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the punishment on the offender, and the penalty and its objectives.\n[5] In respect of Mr. Hills, I conclude that s. 244.2(3)(b) is grossly disproportionate. Here, the evidence showed that numerous air\u2011powered rifles constituted \u201cfirearms\u201d, including air-powered devices like paintball guns, even though they could not perforate the wall of a typical residence. It is also reasonably foreseeable that a young person could intentionally discharge such a \u201cfirearm\u201d into or at a place of residence. This provision therefore applies to an offence that captures a wide spectrum of conduct, ranging from acts that present little danger to the public to those that pose a grave risk. Its effect at the low end of the spectrum is severe. The mandatory minimum cannot be justified by deterrence and denunciation alone, and the punishment shows a complete disregard for sentencing norms. The mandatory prison term would have significant deleterious effects on a youthful offender and it would shock the conscience of Canadians to learn that an offender can receive four years of imprisonment for firing a paintball gun at a home. As a result, s. 244.2(3)(b) imposes a mandatory minimum of four years\u2019 imprisonment for a much less grave type of activity such that it is grossly disproportionate and amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. The Crown did not argue that s. 244.2(3)(b) could be saved under s. 1 of the Charter . Accordingly, I would allow the appeal. I address s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1 ) in the companion case of Hilbach.\nII. Legislative Background\nA. The Challenged Mandatory Minimum\n[6] Mr. Hills was subject to the mandatory minimum at issue after he pled guilty to the offence in s. 244.2(1)(a):\n244.2 (1) Every person commits an offence\n(a) who intentionally discharges a firearm into or at a place, knowing that or being reckless as to whether another person is present in the place; or\n(b) who intentionally discharges a firearm while being reckless as to the life or safety of another person.\n(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), place means any building or structure \u2014 or part of one \u2014 or any motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, railway vehicle, container or trailer.\n(3) Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and\n(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of\n(i) five years, in the case of a first offence, and\n(ii) seven years, in the case of a second or subsequent offence; and\n(b) in any other case, is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years.\n[7] After leave to appeal was granted, Parliament introduced and passed An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15. The legislation received royal assent on November 17, 2022. It removed the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 244.2(3) (b). Mr. Hills\u2019 offence no longer attracts a mandatory minimum. The parties do not rely on Parliament\u2019s choice to remove this measure in their arguments. Further, the four-year mandatory minimum sentence was still in effect at the time of the hearing. While I acknowledge this legislative change, these reasons examine the provision as previously enacted with the applicable mandatory minimum term and as such, I will not address this issue further.\n[8] The actus reus of s. 244.2(1)(a) requires that an offender discharge a firearm into or at a \u201cplace\u201d (as defined by s. 244.2(2)). It is significant, for this appeal, that \u201cplace\u201d has a very wide meaning: it includes \u201cany building or structure\u201d, which encompasses anything from a windowless garden shed to a residential home. The mens rea for this offence contains two main components. First, the offender must intentionally discharge the firearm into or at a place. Second, in intentionally discharging the firearm into or at a place, the offender must know a person is present in the place or be reckless as to whether a person is present there (V\u00e9zina v. R., 2018 QCCA 739, at para. 27 (CanLII)). The actus reus does not require a person to be at the \u201cplace\u201d where the firearm is discharged, only that the firearm be discharged into or at a place (para. 46). Thus, there is no requirement for a person to even be present when the firearm is discharged.\n[9] Mr. Hills committed his offence using a hunting rifle, which is classified as an ordinary firearm. As a result, he was subject to the four\u2011year minimum for s. 244.2(1)(a) listed in s. 244.2(3)(b). To appreciate the scope of s. 244.2(1)(a) and the mandatory minimum sentence in question, it is necessary to review the meaning of a \u201cfirearm\u201d under the Criminal Code and Canada\u2019s regulatory scheme for firearms.\nB. The Applicable Firearms Regime\n[10] Parliament regulates firearms through a variety of legislation including the licensing and registration regime in the Firearms Act , S.C. 1995, c. 39 , and through criminal prohibitions in the Criminal Code (R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 6; Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783). This legislation forms the background to this appeal and given its complexity, it is important to appreciate its operation before turning to Mr. Hills\u2019 challenge.\n[11] To start, s. 244.2(1)(a) incorporates the Criminal Code definition of a firearm. Section 2 of the Criminal Code generally defines a \u201cfirearm\u201d as \u201ca barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other projectile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm\u201d. While firearms are defined as \u201cweapons\u201d, they do not need to meet the Criminal Code definition of a weapon (R. v. Dunn, 2013 ONCA 539, 117 O.R. (3d) 171, at para. 66, aff\u2019d 2014 SCC 69, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 490).\n[12] Courts rely on the \u201cpig\u2019s eye test\u201d to determine whether a barrelled weapon is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death and thus meets the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in the Criminal Code (Dunn, at paras. 8 and 40). The test asks whether a projectile fired from the device can rupture a pig\u2019s eye, which is physiologically similar to a human eye (para. 8). Since a ruptured eye is a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d, a \u201cfirearm\u201d is any barrelled, projectile\u2011firing device capable of putting someone\u2019s eye out (paras. 8 and 40). As the expert evidence on this appeal establishes, some air-powered devices, like BB guns, airsoft guns, and paintball guns, are capable of firing projectiles with enough velocity to rupture a pig\u2019s eye. As a result, they can be classified as firearms under the Criminal Code .\n[13] However, some air-powered devices that are \u201cfirearms\u201d for the purposes of the Criminal Code are not subject to the Firearms Act \u2019s licensing and registration regime. Indeed, the Criminal Code exempts some \u201cfirearms\u201d from the Firearms Act . Specifically, at issue in this appeal is the exemption in s. 84(3)(d)(i):\n(3) For the purposes of sections 91 to 95, 99 to 101, 103 to 107 and 117.03 of this Act and the provisions of the Firearms Act , the following weapons are deemed not to be firearms:\n. . .\n(d) any other barrelled weapon, where it is proved that the weapon is not designed or adapted to discharge\n(i) a shot, bullet or other projectile at a muzzle velocity exceeding 152.4 m per second or at a muzzle energy exceeding 5.7 Joules . . . .\n[14] Under s. 84(3)(d)(i), some air-powered devices that meet the pig\u2019s eye test and constitute firearms under the Criminal Code are nevertheless exempted from the Firearms Act , since their muzzle velocity falls at or below 152.4 metres per second. As a result, even though they are \u201cfirearms\u201d for the purposes of the Criminal Code , they can be freely possessed without a firearms licence.\n[15] The implication for this appeal is that some air-powered devices, which can be freely possessed in Canada, are \u201cfirearms\u201d for the purposes of s. 244.2(1)(a). Put simply, an offender could be convicted under s. 244.2(1)(a) for firing a BB gun or a paintball gun at a shed. This offender would then be subject to the four\u2011year mandatory minimum. While s. 244.2(1)(a) may typically apply where an ordinary firearm is used (like Mr. Hills\u2019 hunting rifle), it is possible for an offender to be convicted for using devices that are not known to inflict deadly force, like paintball guns. As I explain, this possibility underlies the constitutional frailty of the mandatory minimum at issue here.\nIII. Facts and Judicial History\n[16] During an incident on May 6, 2014, Mr. Hills attacked two vehicles and a residence. In the hours prior to the incident, Mr. Hills consumed a large volume of prescription medication and alcohol. Around midnight, while intoxicated, he left his home in Lethbridge, Alberta with a loaded .303 Enfield bolt action rifle and a baseball bat. The rifle was designed for big game hunting.\n[17] Mr. Hills proceeded to swing his bat at a passing car before firing a shot at it. The driver called 9\u20111\u20111. Before police arrived, Mr. Hills turned his attention to an unoccupied parked car, and smashed its windows with the bat. Mr. Hills then approached a new target: a residential home. He fired a round that went through the home\u2019s living room window and through a wall into a computer room before it stopped in a drywall stud and bookcase.\n[18] At the time Mr. Hills fired his shots, the home was occupied by two parents and their two children. The father was sitting in the computer room when Mr. Hills fired his first shot. The father left the computer room to investigate and heard another shot. He ran to alert the mother and pressed the panic alarm on his security system. He then heard what sounded like Mr. Hills trying to break through the front door. The father opened the door and yelled at Mr. Hills to get away. As the father grabbed an axe to defend himself, Mr. Hills fired again.\n[19] The father managed to retreat and call 9\u20111\u20111. He went to the basement with the rest of his family where they waited for police to arrive. When police arrived, they discovered several rounds had penetrated the home. The rounds were fired into areas of the home where a person could have been standing and hit.\n[20] After a preliminary inquiry, Mr. Hills pled guilty to four offences: discharging a firearm into or at a house contrary to s. 244.2(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , pointing a firearm at the occupant of a car, possession of a firearm without a licence, and mischief to property under $5,000. Mr. Hills was unable to recollect the events or the motive for his actions.\nA. Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, 2018 ABQB 945, 79 Alta. L.R. (6th) 161\n[21] At sentencing, Mr. Hills brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentence of four years of imprisonment for intentionally discharging a non-restricted firearm into or at a house imposed by s. 244.2(3)(b). He argued that such a mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate in reasonably foreseeable scenarios and, therefore, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\n[22] Mr. Hills relied on a scenario where the hypothetical culprit discharged a firearm that was incapable of penetrating a typical residential wall. A firearms expert, called on Mr. Hills\u2019 behalf, tested eight different types of air\u2011powered pistols or rifles and concluded that while they met the Criminal Code definition of a firearm, many of them were incapable of penetrating the wall of a house.\n[23] The sentencing judge, in light of the expert evidence, agreed that s. 244.2(3)(b) was grossly disproportionate in the reasonably foreseeable scenario where \u201ca young person intentionally discharges an air-powered pistol or rifle such as an airsoft pistol, BB gun, paintball marker, .177 calibre pellet rifle, a .22 calibre pellet pistol or pellet rifle at a residence\u201d (para. 14). The culprit in this situation clearly committed an offence of lesser gravity than the other conduct caught by the provision: the behaviour was of low moral blameworthiness and the risk of harm was also low. He concluded the infringement of s. 12 could not be justified under s. 1 of the Charter .\n[24] Having concluded the mandatory minimum was unconstitutional, in a subsequent oral decision, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of three and a half years of incarceration for Mr. Hills.\nB. Alberta Court of Appeal, 2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226\n[25] The Crown appealed both the finding that s. 244.2(3)(b) infringed s. 12 of the Charter and Mr. Hills\u2019 sentence. The Alberta Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on both grounds, with each justice writing separately.\n[26] Justice Antonio concluded the expert evidence was insufficient to establish the low gravity of the scenario considered by the sentencing judge. The expert did not exclude the possibility that rounds fired from an air-powered pistol or rifle could travel through a door or window. Nor had the sentencing judge accounted for the psychological harms flowing from the scenario. Regardless of the physical risk, psychological and social harm was inherent in the reckless use of a firearm. She distinguished Nur, reasoning that if it was not grossly disproportionate to impose a 40\u2011month sentence on a 19\u2011year\u2011old who possessed a loaded firearm in public, it was surely not grossly disproportionate to impose a 4\u2011year sentence where a firearm was actually discharged. In re-sentencing Mr. Hills, she concluded that the sentencing judge had underestimated the gravity of the offence and concluded an appropriate sentence was four and a half years of imprisonment. She, however, reduced the sentence to the minimum of four years to account for the time spent on appeal. She stayed the execution of the post-appeal portion of his sentence.\n[27] Justice O\u2019Ferrall agreed with Antonio J.A. that s. 244.2(3)(b) complied with the Charter and with Antonio J.A.\u2019s decision to impose the minimum sentence. Justice O\u2019Ferrall added that this Court\u2019s s. 12 jurisprudence ought to be revisited. He was troubled with the \u201cair of unreality\u201d associated with the use of \u201creasonable hypotheticals\u201d and reasoned the s. 12 analysis should proceed based solely on the offender before the court (para. 103). Further, he questioned whether a grossly disproportionate sentence was an adequate measure of cruel and unusual punishment. Proportionality is not the fundamental purpose of sentencing and it is foreseeable that a grossly disproportionate sentence could sometimes be justified.\n[28] Justice Wakeling joined O\u2019Ferrall J.A. in calling for the Court to revisit its s. 12 jurisprudence. Justice Wakeling concluded s. 12 protects only against cruel and unusual punishment. Put differently, it does not protect against \u201cusual\u201d punishments, like imprisonment. Consequently, a \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d prison sentence cannot engage s. 12. He criticized reasonable hypotheticals, reasoning that since s. 12 protects against an offender being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, its plain language means an offender can only challenge the particular sentence to which they are subject. He added the method of reasonable hypotheticals would leave Canadians \u201caghast\u201d that adjudicators rely on \u201cmake-believe\u201d scenarios to evaluate the constitutionality of a sentencing provision (para. 263). Justice Wakeling went on to note that the results of Canadian sentencing are irrational and indefensible, which militate in favour of a narrow construction of s. 12. Applying his own personal method of fixing sentences, he would have sentenced Mr. Hills to approximately 5.9 years of imprisonment.\nIV. Issues\n[29] This appeal raises two questions. First, whether the mandatory minimum sentence mandated by s. 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code constitutes cruel and unusual punishment such that it violates s. 12 of the Charter . Second, whether the Alberta Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider Mr. Hills\u2019 Gladue report and his M\u00e9tis status in re-sentencing him.\nV. Analysis\n[30] Mr. Hills concedes the mandatory minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate on the facts of his case. He argues, however, that this high bar is met in reasonably foreseeable scenarios in which other differentially situated reasonably foreseeable offenders are likely to be involved. In particular, he says it is met in the hypothetical case of a youthful offender who fires an air-powered pistol or rifle at a house. The Crown concedes this scenario is reasonably foreseeable, but maintains the mandatory minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate in this hypothetical. Before turning to Mr. Hills\u2019 arguments, I will clarify the applicable framework for a challenge to a mandatory minimum sentence under s. 12 and address the proposals for revising this framework advanced by the Crown, several interveners, and the Court of Appeal.\nA. The Protection Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment Under Section 12 of the Charter\n[31] Section 12 of the Charter grants individuals a right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the state. As a threshold issue, an impugned measure must initially qualify as \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d to fall within s. 12. State action amounts to punishment where it: \u201c(1) . . . is a consequence of conviction that forms part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect of a particular offence, and either (2) . . . is imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles of sentencing, or (3) . . . has a significant impact on an offender\u2019s liberty or security interests\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 57, citing R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 39, quoting R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 41). Despite the views of O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling JJ.A., s. 12 is engaged here. This Court has consistently held that imprisonment, the \u201cpenal sanction of last resort\u201d, clearly constitutes punishment (under both ss. 11 and 12 Charter jurisprudence) (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 36; see R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1077; Nur; R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 40).\n[32] The underlying purpose of s. 12 is \u201cto prevent the state from inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment. It is meant to protect human dignity and respect the inherent worth of individuals\u201d (Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, at para. 51). Dignity evokes the idea that every person has intrinsic worth and is therefore entitled to respect, irrespective of their actions (Bissonnette, at para. 59).\n[33] The analytical approach under s. 12 spans many years and has been used to address different types of legal issues. Mandatory minimum sentences have been considered in Smith, R. v. Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, Nur, and most recently in R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130. A mandatory victim surcharge which applied to all offences was struck down in Boudreault; a mandatory weapons prohibition order was upheld in R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895; and a sentence of life imprisonment with parole ineligibility of 10 years was upheld in R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3.\n[34] In Bissonnette, this Court invalidated the stacking of periods of parole ineligibility in cases of multiple murder convictions and reaffirmed and consolidated the well-established analytical approach under s. 12. Chief Justice Wagner, writing for a unanimous Court, emphasized the need for a purposive Charter interpretation which is generous and aimed at securing the full benefits of Charter protections for individuals (para. 98). Based on the purpose of s. 12 , he concluded that a sentence that entirely negates the penal objective of rehabilitation violates human dignity and, therefore, contravenes s. 12 in a manner which could not be saved under s. 1 (para. 8).\n[35] Bissonnette also confirmed that s. 12 has two prongs that are united by their shared animating purpose of safeguarding human dignity. First, s. 12 protects against the imposition of punishment that is \u201cso excessive as to be incompatible with human dignity\u201d (para. 60). This prong of cruel and unusual punishment is concerned with the severity of a punishment \u2014 it queries not whether an impugned punishment is excessive or disproportionate, but whether its effects are grossly disproportionate to the appropriate punishment in a given case (paras. 61 and 68; Nur, at para. 39; Morrisey, at para. 26). Under the first prong, it is not the nature or type of punishment that is at issue, but the amount or quantity of punishment imposed: the focus is whether its particular effects make it grossly disproportionate and thereby constitutionally infirm (Bissonnette, at para. 62).\n[36] Second, s. 12 protects against the imposition of punishment and treatment that are cruel and unusual because, by their very nature, they are \u201cintrinsically incompatible with human dignity\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 60). Under the second prong, the focus is on the method of punishment. The narrow class of punishments that fall within the second category \u201cwill \u2018always be grossly disproportionate\u2019 because . . . [t]hese punishments are in themselves contrary to human dignity because of their \u2018degrading and dehumanizing\u2019 nature\u201d (para. 64, quoting Smith, at p. 1073; 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., at para. 51).\n[37] Mandatory minimum sentences are analyzed under the first prong of s. 12. As their name suggests, Parliament has prescribed a minimum sentence which applies whenever a particular offence has been committed. They are \u201cmandatory\u201d in the sense that Parliament has not provided the safety valve of judicial discretion, exemptions, or escape clauses.\n[38] Despite this absence of discretion, mandatory minimum sentence provisions have not been found to be inherently or presumptively unconstitutional. As this Court stated in Smith, \u201c[t]he legislature may . . . provide for a compulsory term of imprisonment upon conviction for certain offences without infringing rights protected by s. 12 of the Charter \u201d (p. 1077; see also p. 1072). Nevertheless, the absence of any discretion, as well as the manner of their operation, expose their constitutional vulnerabilities. Mandatory minimums can \u201cfunction as a blunt instrument\u201d and \u201cdeprive courts of the ability to tailor proportionate sentences at the lower end of a sentencing range\u201d (Nur, at para. 44). In \u201cextreme cases\u201d, they may impose unjust sentences \u201cbecause they shift the focus from the offender during the sentencing process in a way that violates the principle of proportionality\u201d (para. 44). When the effects of the impugned punishment are grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate (Smith, at p. 1072), the punishment is cruel and unusual because it shows the \u201cstate\u2019s complete disregard for the specific circumstances of the sentenced individual and for the proportionality of the punishment inflicted on them\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 61).\n[39] I turn now to the framework this Court has developed to assess whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate.\nB. The Framework for Assessing Grossly Disproportionate Sentences\n(1) Overview\n[40] To assess whether a mandatory minimum violates s. 12 of the Charter , this Court has developed a two-stage inquiry that involves a contextual and comparative analysis (Bissonnette, at para. 62). A court must:\n1. Assess what constitutes a fit and proportionate sentence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code (Bissonnette, at para. 63; Boudreault, at para. 46; Nur, at para. 46).\n2. Consider whether the impugned provision requires the imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate, not merely excessive, to the fit and proportionate sentence (Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46; Smith, at p. 1072). The constitutional bar is set high to respect Parliament\u2019s general authority to choose penal methods that do not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\n[41] This two-part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (a) the actual offender before the court, or (b) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case or hypothetical scenario (Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 77).\n[42] Where the court concludes that the term of imprisonment prescribed by the mandatory minimum sentence provision is grossly disproportionate in either case, the provision infringes s. 12 and the court must turn to consider whether that infringement can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter if arguments or evidence to that effect are raised by the Crown (Boudreault, at para. 97; Nur, at para. 46).\n(2) Applying the Framework\n[43] Justices O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling, as well as several interveners, invite this Court to make several revisions to this accepted framework because they say it is difficult to apply and lacks cohesion. Many of their criticisms do not accept the principles of law contained in the majority judgments of this Court, but are instead grounded in dicta from dissenting opinions. Others endorse the existing framework and argue that those critical of it are really taking issue with the results it produces because they do not agree with them (see I.F., Canadian Civil Liberties Association, at paras. 27-32). These various criticisms and proposals will be considered in relation to the particular issues raised. I would, however, acknowledge from the outset that there are challenges and complexities which make it impractical to establish bright\u2011line rules that can be applied uniformly to mandatory minimum sentences under s. 12.\n[44] The first stage of the s. 12 inquiry involves the individualized process of determining what a fit and proportionate sentence is for the particular (or representative) offender under consideration using the general sentencing principles set out by Parliament. While this is a daily occurrence in courts across this country, it involves a complex and multifactorial assessment. Judges are tasked with crafting sentences that balance various sentencing objectives, account for aggravating and mitigating factors, and are proportionate to the gravity of each offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.\n[45] The second stage requires a contextual comparison between the fit sentence and the impugned mandatory minimum to see whether the latter complies with the widely-worded right set out in s. 12. Judges must consider the uniform and mandatory minimum sentence Parliament has selected for particular crimes. A mandatory minimum is a penal provision of a very different type in which Parliament has intentionally removed discretion and has instead given priority to certainty, deterrence, denunciation and sometimes removing the offender from society. It has not only specified a minimum penalty, it anticipates that the minimum penalty will apply automatically regardless of how the crime was committed or by whom. The same punishment or period of incarceration applies both to the full breadth of the conduct criminalized and to \u201ceveryone\u201d who commits it, no matter how diversely situated.\n[46] When comparing the sentence produced from the individual process under general sentencing principles with the uniform standard under the mandatory minimum, some mismatch or disproportion is very likely. As observed by Arbour J. in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 18: \u201cMandatory minimum sentences are not the norm in this country, and they depart from the general principles of sentencing expressed in the Code, in the case law, and in the literature on sentencing. In particular, they often detract from what Parliament has expressed as the fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Code: the principle of proportionality.\u201d\n[47] It is not therefore the existence of some disproportion which will offend the grossly disproportionate requirement of s. 12. Stated otherwise, the analysis of the grossly disproportionate standard poses the following question: is the difference between the fit sentence and the mandatory minimum sentence so grossly disproportionate that it violates human dignity such that it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment? According to well\u2011established jurisprudence, the challenged penalty may be unfit, excessive and disproportionate, but it only crosses the constitutional line when it becomes grossly disproportionate. This question raises the common challenge of distinguishing the gradations and demarcations between related legal standards and reaching a conclusion about which legal standard is met. While it is frequently difficult to gauge questions of degree or to measure when something that is otherwise permitted has become grossly disproportionate, many legal standards require just this type of analysis. Whether under s. 12 or s. 7 of the Charter , there will be a continuum between exact fit and gross disproportion, and a judge not only has the authority to make such a determination, but is recognized as being well placed to do so: \u201cThis is the sort of inquiry judges have consistently conducted in Charter review\u201d (Nur, at para. 60).\n[48] In addition, assessing gross disproportionality may be more challenging in certain circumstances. This is because sometimes the difference between stages one and two will involve penalties which are of different types or fall within distinct categories. For example, there may be cases in which a fine would be a fit sentence but the impugned provision imposes imprisonment, or cases in which a discharge or conditional sentence would be fit but instead a custodial sentence is mandated by law. The disparity in such cases is more readily apparent because the comparison involves two different types of punishment and the effects are often more extreme. Other cases may involve a comparison between the term of a proportionate period of incarceration and the term of imprisonment contained in the mandatory minimum. In such cases the type of punishment is the same: imprisonment. Such cases ask decision makers to engage in normative reasoning and make a judgment call about when a sentence is so long it becomes grossly disproportionate.\n[49] I do not accept that these challenges and complexities mean that the established framework has always been fundamentally flawed or has become unworkable. Indeed, many of the arguments accepted by O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling JJ.A. and advanced before us by the Attorney General of Ontario and others were also forcefully argued and firmly rejected by this Court in 2015 in Nur. Like the Court in that case, in my view, the jurisprudence continues to provide a principled approach to assess when the effects of a penalty are so undermining of human dignity that the penalty qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment. Elaborating on the multiple, sometimes nuanced, questions and normative standards that are\/may be considered within the framework, should help bring an end to the \u201cexaggerated debate\u201d sometimes applied to s. 12 (para. 61, per McLachlin C.J.). While no major methodological shifts are warranted, the Court seeks to provide greater clarity and more guidance.\nC. Stage One: Determining a Fit and Proportionate Sentence\n[50] In this section I outline the first stage of the s. 12 inquiry, which is how to determine a fit and appropriate sentence. I begin by addressing the situation in which the constitutional challenge involves the particular offender before the court. This will involve a familiar task: a full consideration of all relevant sentencing provisions in the applicable legislation and jurisprudence. Since proportionality in sentencing relates to the gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the individual before the court, there will necessarily be a consideration of the circumstances of the commission of the offence and the personal characteristics of the offender. The goal should be to determine as specific a punishment as would emerge from a traditional sentencing hearing \u2014 especially because this is the penalty that would be served if the mandatory minimum were declared unconstitutional.\n[51] I then turn to cases in which the constitutional challenge involves the presentation of reasonably foreseeable offenders by way of hypothetical scenarios. Since what is being challenged is a law of general application, this Court has repeatedly used and authorized the use of reasonable hypotheticals to test the law\u2019s scope, reach, nature and effects. I explain the purposes they serve and the limitations to which they are subject. They may include personal characteristics but they must be reasonable in the sense of being reasonably foreseeable and realistic. While a bit more flexibility is needed to determine what a proportionate sentence would be for a reasonably foreseeable offender, every attempt at precision is encouraged to ensure that the comparison under stage two may be conducted in a fair manner.\n(1) Sentencing an Individual Offender\n[52] When the constitutional challenge to a mandatory minimum proceeds on the basis of the particular circumstances of the individual offender charged and convicted, the task for the judge at stage one of the s. 12 inquiry set out in Nur is a familiar one: to determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the particular offender before the court. In this section I provide an overview of the relevant sentencing provisions and principles, with a focus on the need for a fit, proportionate and precise sentence, having regard to the offender\u2019s personal characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.\n(a) General Sentencing Principles\n[53] The general principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code and the common law govern when evaluating the just and appropriate sentence for the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender (Nur, at paras. 40-42). Each sentence must be selected based on the particular facts of the case and in light of existing case law (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43). Courts should employ sentencing tools and guides that are most relevant to their jurisdiction. In crafting a fit sentence, judges may reference sentencing ranges or starting points as appropriate to reach a proportionate sentence, so far as these tools align with established principles and objectives of sentencing (see R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 16).\n[54] To assist in evaluating what constitutes a just and appropriate punishment in a given case, Parliament enacted s. 718 of the Criminal Code (or s. 38 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act , S.C. 2002, c. 1 , where appropriate). Proper consideration is to be given to various objectives such as denunciation, deterrence, rehabilitation, providing reparations for harm done to victims, promoting a sense of responsibility and, when necessary, separating offenders from society. No sentencing objective should be applied to the exclusion of all others. Courts should also consider any aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender.\n[55] In addition, s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code provides a mandatory direction to consider the unique situation of Aboriginal offenders for all offences (Gladue, at para. 93; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at paras. 84-85). Sentencing judges must consider the systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before the court and the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for that offender. Sanctions other than imprisonment are to be considered. While this Court has not addressed the issue, certain provincial courts of appeal have found that, in the case of Black offenders and groups who experience systemic discrimination, social context evidence or background factors which may have contributed to the offender being before the court can also serve as a mitigating factor at sentencing (see, e.g., R. v. Morris, 2021 ONCA 680, 159 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras. 13 and 87-95; R. v. Anderson, 2021 NSCA 62, 405 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 114).\n(b) Proportionality\n[56] Proportionality is a \u201ccentral tenet\u201d of Canada\u2019s sentencing regime, with roots that predate the recognition of it as the fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code (Ipeelee, at para. 36, citing R. v. Wilmott (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 33 (Ont. C.A.); see R. v. Solowan, 2008 SCC 62, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 12; Nasogaluak, at paras. 40-42; R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at paras. 40-42). Indeed, \u201cwhatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the objectives [for sentencing prescribed in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code ], the resulting sentence must respect the fundamental principle of proportionality\u201d (Nasogaluak, at para. 40 (emphasis in original)).\n[57] The purpose of proportionality is founded in \u201cfairness and justice\u201d (R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at p. 546). It is to prevent unjust punishment for the \u201csake of the common good\u201d (p. 547) and it serves as a limiting function to ensure that there is \u201cjustice for the offender\u201d (Ipeelee, at para. 37). As the \u201csine qua non of a just sanction\u201d (para. 37), the concept expresses that the amount of punishment an offender receives must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s moral blameworthiness (R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at paras. 70-71; R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 51\u201154; Ipeelee, at paras. 36 and 38; Nur, at para. 43; C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at \u00a72.14).\n[58] The \u201cgravity of the offence\u201d refers to the seriousness of the offence in a general sense and is reflected in the potential penalty imposed by Parliament and in any specific features of the commission of the crime (R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 90). The gravity of the offence should be measured by taking into account the consequences of the offender\u2019s actions on victims and public safety, and the physical and psychological harms that flowed from the offence. In some cases where there is bias, prejudice or hatred, the motivation of the offender may also be relevant (see s. 718.2 (a)(i) of the Criminal Code ). The offender\u2019s moral culpability or degree of responsibility should be measured by gauging the essential substantive elements of the offence including the offence\u2019s mens rea, the offender\u2019s conduct in the commission of the offence, the offender\u2019s motive for committing the offence, and aspects of the offender\u2019s background that increase or decrease the offender\u2019s individual responsibility for the crime, including the offender\u2019s personal circumstances and mental capacity (Hamilton, at para. 91; Boudreault, at para. 68; Ipeelee, at para. 73).\n[59] Further, the sentence imposed must be commensurate with the responsibility and \u201cmoral blameworthiness of the offender\u201d (Ipeelee, at para. 37). The sentence must be no greater than the offender\u2019s moral culpability and blameworthiness (Nasogaluak, at paras. 40-42; M. (C.A.), at para. 40; R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645).\n[60] In setting out the two\u2011stage process in Nur, McLachlin C.J. said at para. 46:\nFirst, the court must determine what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code . Then, the court must ask whether the mandatory minimum requires the judge to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the fit and proportionate sentence.\nBased on this passage, some argue that the first stage is limited to consideration of a proportionate sentence solely for the offence. The claim is that only the nature of the offence governs and there is no room to take into account other aspects of proportionality, like moral blameworthiness or the personal characteristics of the offender.\n[61] With respect, this narrow reading is incomplete and suggests that McLachlin C.J. chose, without any explanation, to only reference half of the well\u2011known whole of proportionality. It is more sensible to read her reference to a \u201cproportionate sentence\u201d as incorporating both the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Her requirement that the sentence be assessed according to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code expressly acknowledges and incorporates the offender\u2019s personal characteristics and circumstances. Under those principles, there is no proportionate sentence that only takes into account the offence and ignores the offender. The sentencing contemplated at the first stage in Nur therefore encompasses both aspects of proportionality.\n(c) The Sentence Should Be Specific and Defined\n[62] Sentencing is a highly individualized and discretionary endeavour (R. v. Suter, 2018 SCC 34, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 496, at para. 4; M. (C.A.), at para. 92). Each sentence is to be custom tailored to match the particular offence, as well as the offender (R. v. Bottineau, 2011 ONCA 194, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 227; R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 728; R. v. Shoker, 2006 SCC 44, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 399). There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d penalty (R. v. Lee, 2012 ABCA 17, 58 Alta. L.R. (5th) 30, at para. 12), as sentencing is \u201can inherently individualized\u201d and \u201cprofoundly subjective process\u201d (M. (C.A.), at para. 92; R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46):\nThe determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.\n(M. (C.A.), at para. 91)\n[63] During the course of argument, counsel often argue for a punishment within a certain sentencing range, or courts of appeal establish ranges or starting points to pursue parity. Nevertheless, a sentencing judge cannot at the end of the day simply approximate a sentence or otherwise provide a range of penalties. The judge is expected to articulate an individual, specific and defined sentence. They cannot order that an offender be imprisoned for around two or three months, or that a sentence be \u201caround three years\u201d or \u201cfall within the range of time\u201d. Judges must exercise their discretion in each case and fix a specific and defined punishment.\n[64] Sentencing is not an exact science. It can be difficult for sentencing judges to select the exact fit punishment as there is often more than one correct sentencing response to a crime (Hamilton, at paras. 85 and 156; Ruby, at \u00a72.5; Shropshire, at para. 48, citing R. v. Muise (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119 (N.S.C.A.), at pp. 123-24). However, that is the burden sentencing judges confront daily. At this first stage of s. 12, while there may be reference to sentencing ranges and starting points for the offence to assist in the determination of the fit penalty, there should be no approximation in the final sentence. The key question is: what specifically is the fit sentence for this individual offender?\n[65] Precision and certainty about the legal penalty is required because all must know exactly what punishment was imposed and when it will end. Similarly, if the mandatory minimum falls, the sentence affixed by the judge at the first stage of Nur will be applied to the offender. Scrupulously selecting a precise and defined sentence also supports an analytically fair and principled result at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry.\n[66] When Lamer J. in Smith, at p. 1073, wrote that a court must first consider \u201cthe particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender\u201d, he was talking about how to assess gross disproportionality at the second stage of the analysis \u2014 not how to conduct a sentencing hearing. He did not say that setting the fit and proportionate sentence at the first stage could involve a \u201crange of sentences\u201d as urged upon us by some interveners. Even reasonably foreseeable offenders, for whom there is greater latitude, call for careful calibration of discretion and as specific a sentence as required in a traditional and typical sentencing proceeding.\n(2) Sentencing Reasonably Foreseeable Offenders and the Use of Reasonable Hypotheticals\n[67] In other cases, the courts will be asked to consider the circumstances of reasonably foreseeable offenders not before them. In these cases, the constitutional analysis will be supplemented by or conducted on the basis of reasonable hypothetical scenarios that raise realistic issues about the scope of the mandatory minimum and its application to everyone. Justices O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling propose that this Court abandon the use of reasonably foreseeable scenarios. In my opinion, this proposal runs counter to the jurisprudence of this Court and lacks merit. In this section, I explain that reasonably foreseeable hypotheticals are an accepted and appropriate tool to identify the scope and thus explore the constitutionality of an impugned provision. I address how to construct a reasonably foreseeable hypothetical; discuss why personal characteristics, including Indigeneity, are not excluded from consideration; and suggest that the hypothetical should be reasonable and is best tested through the adversarial process.\n(a) Reasonably Foreseeable Hypotheticals Are an Accepted and Appropriate Analytical Tool\n[68] As s. 12 jurisprudence has developed, this Court has consistently accepted that punishments can be impugned not only on the basis that they infringe the s. 12 rights of a particular offender, but also on the basis that they infringe those of a reasonably foreseeable offender. Beginning in Smith, this Court established the use of a reasonable hypothetical in assessing whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate. The majority in that case struck down a mandatory minimum of seven years for importing narcotics because such a sentence would be grossly disproportionate if applied to a hypothetical young person driving home to Canada with a small amount of marijuana.\n[69] Since Smith, reasonable hypothetical situations have been either expressly used by this Court to invalidate sentencing provisions (see Nur, at paras. 82-83; Lloyd, at paras. 32-33; Boudreault, at para. 55), or affirmed as a matter of principle where they were not relied upon (see Goltz, at p. 515; Morrisey, at paras. 31 and 51-53; Ferguson, at para. 30; Bissonnette, at para. 63). Importantly, in the three cases in which this Court has struck down mandatory minimums, it has done so on the basis of a reasonable hypothetical offender (Smith, Nur and Lloyd).\n[70] Beyond s. 12, the assessment of a law\u2019s scope based on reasonable hypotheticals is an accepted analytical inquiry in Charter challenges more generally. They have been relied upon as an analytical tool in s. 7 jurisprudence, resulting in successful Charter challenges (R. v. Heywood, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, at p. 799; R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at paras. 29-30 and 72-75; R. v. Ndhlovu, 2022 SCC 38, at paras. 87-88).\n[71] This Court in Nur set out certain binding principles about the use of reasonable hypotheticals. Chief Justice McLachlin said the use of reasonable hypotheticals was \u201cat the heart of th[e] case\u201d (para. 47) and placed them at the protected core of the s. 12 analysis. This Court firmly and clearly rejected the argument that reasonable hypotheticals should be abandoned and that the primary or exclusive focus ought to be on the offender before the court (paras. 48-64; see also C. Fehr, \u201cTying Down the Tracks: Severity, Method, and the Text of Section 12 of the Charter \u201d (2021), 25 Can. Crim. L.R. 235, at p. 240). Even as early as 2015, it was recognized that \u201cexcluding consideration of reasonably foreseeable applications of a mandatory minimum sentencing law would run counter to the settled authority of this Court and artificially constrain the inquiry into the law\u2019s constitutionality\u201d (Nur, at para. 49).\n[72] Foreclosing the consideration of the reasonably foreseeable impacts of an impugned law \u201cwould dramatically curtail the reach of the Charter and the ability of the courts to discharge their duty to scrutinize the constitutionality of legislation and maintain the integrity of the constitutional order\u201d (Nur, at para. 63). Because it is the \u201cnature of the law\u201d that is at issue, not the claimant\u2019s status, it suffices for a claimant to allege unconstitutional effects in their case or on third parties (para. 51, quoting R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 314). In crafting reasonable hypotheticals, a court is examining the scope of the impugned law and \u201cnot merely the justice of a particular sentence imposed by a judge at trial\u201d (Goltz, at p. 503; see Big M Drug Mart, at p. 314; Nur, at para. 60). Further, \u201c[i]f the only way to challenge an unconstitutional law were on the basis of the precise facts before the court, bad laws might remain on the books indefinitely\u201d (Nur, at para. 51).\n[73] The effective use of judicial resources also favours the use of reasonable hypotheticals as they allow one judge to consider an impugned mandatory minimum from multiple vantage points and they help reduce the number of challenges that will be heard in or among jurisdictions. Importantly, they promote the rule of law by underscoring how no one should be convicted or sentenced under an unconstitutional law (Lloyd, at para. 16). Hence, \u201callowing accused to employ reasonable hypothetical scenarios is more likely to further the purpose of the Charter : protecting citizens from abuse of state power\u201d (Fehr, at p. 236).\n[74] It is for these reasons that, to repeat McLachlin C.J., \u201c[t]his Court has consistently held that a challenge to a law under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 does not require that the impugned provision contravene the rights of the claimant\u201d (Nur, at para. 51; see also Goltz, at pp. 503-4). Under well-established case law, there is no need to wait for a \u201creal\u201d offender to appear to impugn the constitutionality of a provision of general application.\n[75] Justices O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling\u2019s desire to excise the use of reasonably foreseeable scenarios from this Court\u2019s s. 12 framework is thus completely contrary to both precedent and principle. They rely upon certain parts of dissenting judgments from this Court and fail to follow the repeated authoritative statements that reasonable hypotheticals are an established device courts use to measure whether a legislatively mandated sentence is cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 (S. Chaster, \u201cCruel, Unusual, and Constitutionally Infirm: Mandatory Minimum Sentences in Canada\u201d (2018), 23 Appeal 89, at p. 96).\n(b) Defining the Parameters of a Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical\n[76] A reasonable hypothetical scenario needs to be constructed with care. While it may be tempting to allow the word \u201chypothetical\u201d to overwhelm, it is the reasonableness of the scenario that must be underscored (Nur, at para. 57). While earlier case law did not often explain or explore what went into the construction of a reasonable hypothetical, or tended to consider hypotheticals more narrowly and at a higher level of generality, the more recent analytical approach in Nur, Lloyd, and Boudreault is broader and permits more detailed hypotheticals.\n[77] The characteristics of a reasonable hypothetical include the following:\n(i) The hypothetical must be reasonably foreseeable;\n(ii) Reported cases may be considered in the analysis;\n(iii) The hypothetical must be reasonable in view of the range of conduct in the offence in question;\n(iv) Personal characteristics may be considered as long as they are not tailored to create remote or far-fetched examples; and\n(v) Reasonable hypotheticals are best tested through the adversarial process.\n(i) The Hypothetical Must Be Reasonably Foreseeable\n[78] Throughout the case law there is a legitimate concern that the hypotheticals must be reasonable. They ought not to be \u201cfar-fetched or marginally imaginable cases\u201d, nor should they be \u201cremote or extreme examples\u201d (Morrisey, at para. 30, quoting Goltz, at pp. 506 and 515). In Goltz, the Court focussed on circumstances that \u201ccould commonly arise in day\u2011to\u2011day life\u201d (p. 516).\n[79] Greater flexibility was introduced in Nur when the Court held that the appropriate approach is to construct a reasonably foreseeable offender with characteristics and in circumstances that are reasonably foreseeable based on judicial experience and common sense (para. 62). Nur\u2019s selection and use of reasonable foreseeability is significant and goes beyond whether a projected application of the law is common or likely:\nThe reasonable foreseeability test is not confined to situations that are likely to arise in the general day\u2011to\u2011day application of the law. Rather, it asks what situations may reasonably arise. It targets circumstances that are foreseeably captured by the minimum conduct caught by the offence. Only situations that are \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cfar-fetched\u201d are excluded . . . . [para. 68]\n[80] Thus, what must be considered is how the provision impacts other persons who might reasonably be caught by it (Nur, at para. 47) and the reasonably foreseeable situations in which the law may apply.\n(ii) Reported Cases May Be Considered in the Analysis\n[81] In defining the scope of the hypothetical scenario and the qualities of a reasonably foreseeable offender, courts may rely on reported cases, as this Court did in Boudreault. While marginal cases may be excluded (Morrisey), in Nur, the Court affirmed that reported cases can be used because they not only illustrate the range of real\u2011life conduct captured by the offence, they actually \u201chappened\u201d (para. 72). Reported cases, while potentially helpful, should not be used as a licence or straitjacket and courts may modify the facts of a reported case to illustrate reasonably foreseeable scenarios (paras. 62 and 72). However, courts are not limited to hypotheticals from the cases available to them.\n(iii) The Hypothetical Must Be Reasonable in View of the Range of Conduct in the Offence in Question\n[82] Under s. 12, the reach, breadth and scope of the impugned law will figure prominently. It can be expected that the proffered hypotheticals will test the kind of conduct the impugned provision is reasonably expected to catch and the law\u2019s reasonably foreseeable effects (Nur, at para. 62).\n[83] To be reasonable, the hypothetical must be tailored to the offence in question. It needs to involve conduct that falls within the relevant provision. The scope of the offence can be explored and it is permissible to establish the breadth of the offence by reference to how it may be committed and by whom. However, straining each and every constituent element by fanciful facts is not helpful. Incredible combinations of bizarre behaviours tells a court more about the imagination of counsel than it does the true scope of the impugned provision. The total scenario must be reasonably foreseeable.\n(iv) Personal Characteristics May Be Considered as Long as They Are Not Tailored to Create Remote or Far-fetched Examples\n[84] Several interveners in this appeal and in Hilbach seek to curtail the use of personal characteristics in crafting reasonable hypotheticals. The Attorney General of Ontario, for instance, proposes that \u201cgeneric\u201d mitigating personal circumstances that are not \u201cspecific\u201d to the offence, like Indigeneity, should be excluded from reasonable hypotheticals (I.F., at paras. 13-20; transcript, at pp. 117-18). Counsel submits that immutable personal characteristics, like race, gender, age, or mental health factors do not contribute information that goes directly to the offence and therefore \u201cshould be excluded from the generalized inquiry\u201d (transcript, at p. 119). Counsel posits that it is not enough for a scenario to be \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d; it must also be \u201cexpected\u201d to arise (pp. 120-21). In the Attorney General of Ontario\u2019s view, characteristics like race or Indigeneity are not \u201cexpected\u201d characteristics appropriate for use in reasonable hypotheticals. In contrast, the Director of Public Prosecutions accepts that Indigeneity can be a proper part of a reasonable hypothetical.\n[85] Similar arguments were rejected in Nur when the Court held that such characteristics could not be abstracted out of the test. Instead, an \u201cinquiry into reasonably foreseeable situations the law may capture may take into account personal characteristics relevant to people who may be caught by the mandatory minimum\u201d (para. 76). In that case, the Court actually invalidated the law on the basis of a hypothetical involving a licensed and responsible gun owner who improperly and unwittingly stored a licensed weapon in a manner that infringed the statute (para. 82). Similarly, in Lloyd, the Court struck down the one\u2011year minimum sentence for certain drug-related offences on the basis of two different scenarios. The hypotheticals were detailed: one concerned a marginalized person who experienced poverty, completed rehabilitation for a substance use disorder and had a dated prior conviction. In the other hypothetical, a person shared a small quantity of drugs with a friend or spouse. In Boudreault, this Court realistically considered the varied life circumstances of individual offenders, including poverty, illness, disability, addiction or other disadvantages which could reduce an offender\u2019s moral blameworthiness, thus illustrating the actual and foreseeable characteristics of real offenders (paras. 55 and 58).\n[86] This Court should not depart from the methodology and approach affirmed in Nur, Lloyd, and Boudreault. As a rule, characteristics that are reasonably foreseeable for offenders in Canadian courtrooms, like age, poverty, race, Indigeneity, mental health issues and addiction, should not be excluded from consideration. Proportionality, a mandatory principle of sentencing under the Criminal Code , requires a consideration of the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s particular circumstances, which include their personal characteristics (Nasogaluak, at para. 42; Ipeelee, at para. 38). The assessment of a mandatory minimum\u2019s constitutionality should also be similarly rooted in the realities of people\u2019s lives.\n[87] Given mandatory sentencing provisions and modern realities, there is no principled reason why race and Indigeneity may not also be relevant legal personal characteristics for reasonable hypothetical scenarios. Section 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code is mandatory and was enacted to address the overincarceration of Indigenous people and their disproportionate representation in Canada\u2019s criminal justice system. The unfortunate truth is that Indigeneity is an offender characteristic that is more than \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d. Indigenous offenders are not only reasonably foreseeable in the sense contemplated by Nur, the statistics over the years demonstrate that Indigenous people are vastly overrepresented before the courts. The same is true for Black and other racialized offenders who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and whose experiences of historic and systemic disadvantage may reduce their moral blameworthiness (Ipeelee, at para. 73; Anderson, at para. 146; Morris, at para. 179).\n[88] The concern underlying the position of the Attorney General of Ontario is that if personal characteristics, like Gladue factors, are taken into account, then the fit sentence will be so reduced at the first stage that the disproportion would become greater at the second stage, thereby rendering mandatory minimums more constitutionally fragile (D. Stuart, \u201cBoudreault: The Supreme Court Strikes Down Mandatory Victim Surcharges to Protect Vulnerable Offenders\u201d (2019), 50 C.R. (7th) 276). I do not accept that any constitutional issue which may arise in such circumstances will be the result of the hypothetical proffered rather than the scope and legal effects of the mandatory minimum. As explained further under stage two, the constitutional bar is set high at gross disproportionality. Section 12 is not violated due to the absence or presence of one sentencing principle, even one as important as s. 718.2(e), and where the offence involves grave conduct, the personal characteristics and circumstances of the offender will necessarily carry less significance (Latimer, at para. 85).\n[89] Parliament is taken to know that the mandatory minimum it selects applies to \u201ceveryone\u201d, just like the s. 12 right against cruel and unusual punishment. That means all people, regardless of their personal characteristics, are to benefit from the protections of s. 12. Canada is a large and diverse country and people will have personal characteristics which may aggravate or mitigate their moral blameworthiness. It is appropriate that the effects of a mandatory minimum be scrutinized based not only on the reach of the law and the length of the sentence selected, but also on the breadth of the population to which it is made to apply.\n[90] Including immutable personal characteristics in hypothetical scenarios strengthens the analytical device by helping courts explore the reach of the mandatory penalty. Individuals with reduced culpability may find themselves subject to mandatory minimum penalties. It is possible Parliament set penalties with a certain offender in mind without fulsome consideration of how the mandatory penalty may apply to offenders with reduced moral blameworthiness due to their disadvantaged circumstances, including marginalization or systemic discrimination.\n[91] There is an important limit on the use of personal characteristics: the scenarios should not involve the most \u201csympathetic\u201d offender but rather present a reasonably foreseeable offender (Nur, at para. 75). The hypothetical cannot be remote, far-fetched or utterly unrealistic (para. 76). A court should be wary of detailed scenarios that stack mitigating factors combined with an interpretation that stretches and strains the technical meaning of the offence, like certain of Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s hypotheticals in the companion appeal to this case (Hilbach, at para. 89).\n[92] It makes little sense to evaluate scenarios that, based on common sense and judicial experience, appear outlandish. As Canadian courtrooms illustrate, on occasion truth may be stranger than fiction. That should not, however, become an invitation to consider every \u201csympathetic\u201d case on the theory that it could or might happen one day. There may be the rare case in which all of the factors are mitigating and operate to reduce the moral blameworthiness of the offender but judicial experience points to the need to ensure the scenario as a whole is reasonably foreseeable. As McLachlin C.J. wrote in Nur, \u201c[l]aws should not be set aside on the basis of mere speculation\u201d (para. 62).\n(v) Reasonable Hypotheticals Are Best Tested Through the Adversarial Process\n[93] It is up to the offender\/claimant to articulate and advance the reasonably foreseeable hypothetical which forms the basis for the claim that the impugned provision is unconstitutional. All parties should ideally be afforded a fair opportunity to challenge or comment upon the reasonableness of the hypothetical before making submissions on its constitutional implications. In this respect, it is commonplace for courts to question counsel about the content and contours of any scenario put forward as a reasonable hypothetical. This is a sound practice which brings transparency to the arguments and fairness to the process. I agree with Antonio J.A. that reasonable hypotheticals are best tested through the rigour of the adversarial process (para. 69). There are benefits to providing parties with the opportunity to make submissions on who constitutes a realistic and reasonably foreseeable offender. In this way, the parties can help the judge determine what type of hypothetical is reasonable in the circumstances. However, while testing the reasonable hypothetical through the adversarial process is to be encouraged, it is not mandatory in the sense that its absence represents a reviewable error.\n(c) Sentencing a Reasonably Foreseeable Offender\n[94] The same general sentencing principles apply when fixing a sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender. This means that sentencing judges will: be bound by the Criminal Code ; consider the sentencing proposals argued by counsel; and utilize the method of analysis endorsed in their jurisdiction (whether sentencing ranges or starting point-sentences). As with cases involving an actual offender, courts should fix as narrowly defined a sentence as possible for a reasonably foreseeable offender. A court, however, may find it somewhat more difficult to fix a specific sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender, given that hypotheticals are advanced without evidence or detailed facts. Accordingly, in fixing the fit sentence for reasonably foreseeable offenders, some latitude may be necessary. But while the court may not be able to necessarily arrive at a single figure, broad statements are not very helpful either. Stating, for instance, that the case law would support a sentence of three to five years does not answer the question of what sentence the offender would otherwise receive and does not assist the analysis. Courts may specify, for instance, that a sentence would be \u201caround\u201d a certain number of months. Fixing a sentence for reasonably foreseeable offenders requires essentially the same approach that judges take in the daily task of sentencing offenders in courtrooms across this country. Any estimate must be circumscribed and tightly defined.\n[95] Setting too wide a scope for what would be a fit sentence could skew the analysis and distort the gross disproportionality assessment by unfairly reducing the disparity between the sentence imposed and the mandatory minimum. Indeed, because the purpose of the reasonable hypothetical is to test the limits of the scope of application of a mandatory minimum, the lowest fit sentence that is reasonably foreseeable will figure prominently in the assessment. The large margin of appreciation embedded into the gross disproportionality standard means there is no need to build flexibility into the fit and proportionate sentence.\n[96] I will now turn to the second stage of the analysis.\nD. Stage Two: The Gross Disproportionality Standard\n[97] Once the fit sentence has been determined at the first stage, the inquiry turns into a comparative exercise under which the fit sentence is contrasted with the punishment imposed under the impugned provision. Whether a mandatory minimum sentence is challenged based on its effect on the actual offender or on a reasonably foreseeable offender in a reasonable hypothetical, gross disproportionality is the applicable standard for invalidating it under s. 12 as cruel and unusual punishment (Nur, at paras. 39 and 77; Lloyd, at para. 22; Smith, at p. 1073).\n[98] Below, I begin with two preliminary points: first, I explain why O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling JJ.A. erred in concluding that s. 12 does not apply to imprisonment, and second, I reaffirm that the comparison applies to the sentence imposed, without consideration of parole eligibility. I then turn to how the gross disproportionality assessment should be undertaken, explain why it remains the governing standard under s. 12, and set out the analytical framework to assess whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate. I canvass the markers of a grossly disproportionate sentence and reinforce how the focus should be on the offence in question, the punishment prescribed, and the effects both have on individuals subject to the prescribed minimum penalty.\n(1) Section 12\u2019s Protection Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment Applies to Cruel and Unusual Periods of Imprisonment\n[99] Justices O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling erred in their result and in their reasoning. Wakeling J.A. failed to follow binding authority from this Court on the interpretation of Charter rights, including s. 12 . He employed a personal and idiosyncratic approach to sentencing instead of the legal requirements set out in the Criminal Code and in this Court\u2019s authoritative jurisprudence.\n[100] Specifically, his conclusion that s. 12 is limited to both cruel and unusual punishments and that since imprisonment is not unusual, s. 12 does not protect against excessive terms of imprisonment is simply wrong. The phrase \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment is not that narrow. Rather, it represents a \u201ccompendious expression of a norm\u201d that draws on broader fundamental social and moral values (Smith, at pp. 1069 and 1072, per Lamer J., and p. 1088, per McIntyre J., dissenting, quoting Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, at p. 690).\n[101] Imprisonment is the harshest form of punishment in Canada (Gladue, at paras. 36 and 40), and \u201c[a]part from death, imprisonment is the most severe sentence imposed by the law\u201d (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 532, per Wilson J., concurring). Incarceration entails not only a complete removal of an offender\u2019s liberty, it also has a ripple effect that touches nearly every aspect of the offender\u2019s life and physical and mental health, employability, children, and community (R. Mangat, More Than We Can Afford: The Costs of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing (2014), at pp. 40\u201144).\n[102] As the purpose of s. 12 is to safeguard human dignity, it protects against grossly disproportionate terms of imprisonment. It ensures that offenders do not suffer completely unwarranted or utterly underserved punishment including grossly disproportionate and abusive periods of incarceration. Given the potentially devastating impacts of incarceration on an offender (Bissonnette, at para. 97), its heavy costs cannot be imposed without limit, scrutiny or justification. There is no reason for this Court to alter course and remove grossly excessive imprisonment from the reach of s. 12.\n(2) The Comparison Is Based on the Sentence, Without Considering Parole\n[103] The Crown argued that when assessing the disparity between a fit sentence and a mandatory minimum, a court should factor in the possibility of parole. This Court previously rejected this same argument in Nur, where it held that when comparing a mandatory minimum sentence to the fit sentence, the focus must be on the sentence itself. Accordingly, courts must not consider parole eligibility as a factor reducing the actual impact of the impugned sentence because the possibility of parole cannot cure a grossly disproportionate sentence (Nur, at para. 98).\n[104] Factoring in the possibility of parole into the comparison inappropriately tips the scales away from what should be an apples to apples comparison between sentences and introduces unwarranted speculation. Parole is \u201ca statutory privilege rather than a right\u201d that turns on a discretionary decision of the parole board (Nur, at para. 98). Hence, there is \u201cno guarantee that offenders will be granted parole when their ineligibility period expires\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 41). Parole also \u201cinvolves a process that is independent of and distinct from the sentencing process\u201d (para. 37). It is the role of the court, not that of the parole board, to ensure that a sentence imposed is not grossly disproportionate. The parole board\u2019s task is to determine whether an offender may safely be released into the community (Nur, at para. 98).\n[105] The constitutional obligation to ensure sentences are not grossly disproportionate should not be shifted from the judiciary onto a tribunal that operates in a different legal and constitutional context. Considering parole would require judges to wade into the complexities of the legislation governing parole and consider how to take into account, for example, the reports on how Indigenous and Black offenders are often released later in their sentences and experience lower parole grant rates (Department of Justice, Spotlight on Gladue: Challenges, Experiences, and Possibilities in Canada\u2019s Criminal Justice System (2017), at p. 7; Office of the Correctional Investigator, A Case Study of Diversity in Corrections: The Black Inmate Experience in Federal Penitentiaries (2013), at para. 84). Finally, even if granted, \u201c[t]he idea that parole puts an end to an offender\u2019s sentence is a myth. Conditional release only alters the conditions under which a sentence is served; the sentence itself remains in effect for its entire term\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 89, citing M. (C.A.), at para. 57).\n(3) What It Means for a Sentence to Be Grossly Disproportionate\n[106] For a punishment to offend s. 12, it must first be different from and disproportionate to a fit and proportionate sentence. The first part of the comparative task is to articulate what, if any, differences exist between a fit sentence (identified at stage one) and the mandatory minimum. Following this, courts must gauge the effects of this disparity.\n[107] Second, the punishment must be disproportionate in a manner or amount that is grossly so. This requires both the identification of any disparity between the sentences and an assessment of the mandatory minimum\u2019s effect and severity against constitutional standards.\n[108] The process of assessing the existence and extent of any disparity between a fit punishment and the mandatory minimum imposed bears a resemblance to what occurs when a sentence is appealed and challenged as being \u201cdemonstrably unfit\u201d. In such cases, there is a comparison between what would be fit and what has been imposed. Courts are comfortable with this standard (Parranto, at paras. 30 and 38). Considerations include the gravity of the offence, the moral blameworthiness of the offender, the objectives of sentencing and any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n[109] However, gross disproportionality is a constitutional standard. In using phrases such as \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; Wiles, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072), \u201cabhorrent or intolerable\u201d to society and \u201cshock the conscience\u201d of Canadians (Morrisey, at para. 26; Lloyd, at para. 33; Ferguson, at para. 14), this Court has repeatedly emphasized that gross disproportionality is a high bar (Lloyd, at para. 24; Steele v. Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417).\n[110] Whether a sentence \u201coutrage[s] standards of decency\u201d, is abhorrent or intolerable, \u201cshock[s] the conscience\u201d or undermines human dignity is a normative question (see Bissonnette, at para. 65). Such a conclusion does not turn on a court\u2019s opinion of whether a majority of Canadians support the penalty. Rather, the views of Canadian society on the appropriate punishment must be assessed through the values and objectives that underlie our sentencing and Charter jurisprudence.\n[111] The starting point is that proportionality is a basic tenet of punishment. This means the sentence imposed must bear a direct relationship to the offence committed. As Wilson J. explained:\n. . . it must be a \u201cfit\u201d sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender \u201cdeserved\u201d the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system.\n(Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at p. 533)\n[112] Proportionality is based in fairness and justice for the offender and does not permit unjust punishment for the \u201csake of the common good\u201d (Priest, at p. 547; see Ipeelee, at para. 37). While society can be understood to be deeply concerned with the criminal behaviour which gave rise to the conviction, people are also committed to fair and just punishments which are not cruel, unusual or grossly disproportionate to the sanction which was deserved.\n[113] In addition, the elevated standard of gross disproportionality is intended to reflect a measure of deference to Parliament in crafting sentencing provisions. The word \u201cgrossly\u201d signals Parliament is not required to impose perfectly proportionate sentences (Goltz, at p. 501; R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 344-45), which would undermine the ability of Parliament to establish norms of punishment, including mandatory minimum sentences (Lloyd, at para. 45). This is because, in respect of mandatory minimums, there is likely to be some disproportion between the individually fit sentence and the uniform mandatory minimum.\n[114] In this regard, a sentence may be demonstrably unfit in the sense that an appellate court would intervene, but nevertheless not meet the constitutional threshold of being grossly disproportionate. For example, in R. v. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), a 21\u2011year\u2011old person with an untreated manic\u2011depressive disorder pled guilty to using a firearm to commit a robbery and was sentenced to the 4\u2011year mandatory minimum for that offence. Justice Rosenberg expressed numerous serious concerns about the fitness of the sentence for this offender and opined that on the usual scale of appellate review he would find a sentence of three or four years to be demonstrably unfit. Nevertheless, he concluded at para. 72:\nHowever, that is not the same as gross disproportionality and I am not convinced that having regard to the objective gravity of any offence involving the use of a firearm, even an unloaded one, a sentence approaching four years shocks the conscience.\n[115] Courts \u201cshould be careful not to stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a constitutional violation\u201d as s. 12 is intended to police the \u201couter limit\u201d of sentencing (Smith, at p. 1072, per Lamer J., and p. 1091, per McIntyre J., dissenting, but not on this point). It is only on \u201crare and unique occasions\u201d that a sentence will infringe s. 12, as the test is \u201cvery properly stringent and demanding\u201d (Steele, at p. 1417; see also Goltz, at p. 502).\n(4) Gross Disproportionality Is the Governing Standard\n[116] The gross disproportionality standard has come under criticism from both sides and various sources. Justices O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling thought that gross disproportionality should not be a measure of cruel and unusual punishment because it is not the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of sentencing, which O\u2019Ferrall J.A. believed to be the protection of society and respect for the law (para. 117). Justice Wakeling wrote that proportionality has no relation to s. 12 because the drafters did not expressly include it in the text (paras. 229-30).\n[117] Others claim the bar is set too high. For example, an intervener argued that there \u201cis no such thing as a \u2018merely excessive\u2019 sentence\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny time an offender spends imprisoned that is not fit for their individual circumstance cannot be justified on the grounds that it is \u2018merely excessive\u2019\u201d (I.F., British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, at para. 19 (emphasis deleted); see also R. Cairns Way, \u201cA Disappointing Silence: Mandatory Minimums and Substantive Equality\u201d (2015), 18 C.R. (7th) 297).\n[118] However, in every s. 12 case, this Court has used gross disproportionality as the applicable standard and there is no reason to upset well-settled law. It represents a workable and balanced principle, well\u2011grounded in human dignity and basic sentencing norms. It also has the benefit of being a balanced standard which recognizes Parliament\u2019s authority to pursue sentencing objectives and options which do not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, the clarifications in this judgment about what qualifies as gross disproportion will, it is to be hoped, promote certainty and a greater ease of application. In the result, a mandatory term of imprisonment must be grossly disproportionate to what would have otherwise been a fit sentence in order to violate s. 12 (Smith, at pp. 1072-74).\n(5) Whether a Mandatory Minimum Sentence Is Grossly Disproportionate\n[119] The way courts have historically applied the grossly disproportionate standard to mandatory minimum sentences clarifies which factors or features inform the analysis. This Court has upheld the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences in 5 cases: (1) life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years for first degree murder in Luxton; (2) a mandatory sentence of 7 days of imprisonment and a $300 fine for a first conviction of driving while prohibited in Goltz; (3) a 4-year mandatory minimum sentence for criminal negligence causing death using a firearm in Morrisey; (4) the mandatory minimum sentence for second degree murder of life without possibility for parole for 10 years in Latimer; and (5) a 4\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence for manslaughter with a firearm in Ferguson.\n[120] This Court has also struck down mandatory minimum sentences on three occasions \u2014 including in two of its most recent cases. In Smith, this Court invalidated a seven\u2011year mandatory minimum for importation of drugs pursuant to s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-l. In Nur, the three- and five\u2011year mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for the possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm when the firearm is loaded or kept with readily accessible ammunition were declared of no force or effect. In Lloyd, the Court invalidated the one-year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking of a controlled substance provided by s. 5(3)(a)(i)(D) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c. 19 .\n[121] The ruling and reasoning in these cases provide helpful guidance about when a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate. The Court has, in certain cases, articulated various factors which may bear on the assessment, and certain helpful propositions and principles have emerged. For example, in Smith, this Court identified four factors to assess gross disproportionality in the context of a mandatory minimum: the gravity of the offence; the personal characteristics of the offender; the particular circumstances of the case; and the actual effect of the punishment on the offender. Goltz later added other factors. In Nur, this Court established the two\u2011part test for a s. 12 violation, and while McLachlin C.J. did not explicitly reference the above factors, she did consider the breadth of conduct the mandatory minimum captured; the seriousness of the impugned conduct as compared to the conduct targeted by the mandatory minimum; and whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose. In Boudreault, which did not deal with a mandatory minimum, but was built on the authorities which did, this Court explained that such factors do not form part of a required or \u201crigid\u201d test (para. 48; Latimer, at para. 75). Certain factors may highlight important considerations and remain salient.\n[122] However, there is merit to regrouping them to simplify the analysis and more directly focus on the three crucial components that must be assessed when considering the validity or vulnerability of mandatory minimum sentences: (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects of the penalty on the offender; and (3) the penalty, including the balance struck by its objectives.\n[123] These components have particular relevance to mandatory minimums. In selecting mandatory minimums as a sentencing tool, Parliament has decided to make the sentence uniform across a range of circumstances and has chosen to remove the constitutional safety valve of judicial discretion to deal with individual cases. It has defined the offence subject to a particular minimum sentence, and set its nature, gravity, scope and reach. It has determined who will be subject to the mandatory minimum \u2014 whether explicitly or implicitly by how the offence is defined or the penalty is imposed. And it has prescribed the penalty or sentence for each mandatory minimum it imposes.\n[124] The scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty are three main components that will have a bearing on the gross disproportionality analysis. In some cases, one alone could lead to a conclusion of gross disproportion. Other times it will be the combination of or interplay between these components which will contribute to a finding of gross disproportion or constitutional compliance. For example, a broad licensing offence with a small penalty may not undermine human dignity as much as a true criminal offence that attaches a significant penalty to less blameworthy conduct.\n(a) The Scope and Reach of the Offence\n[125] The scope and reach of the offence remains a major feature in the gross disproportionality analysis and it is important to explore the full implications of the impugned offence. The case law reveals that a mandatory minimum sentence is more exposed to challenge where it captures disparate conduct of widely varying gravity and degrees of offender culpability (Lloyd, at para. 24; Smith, at p. 1078). Indeed, mandatory minimum sentences for offences \u201cthat can be committed in many ways and under many different circumstances by a wide range of people are constitutionally vulnerable\u201d (Lloyd, at para. 3; see also paras. 24, 27 and 35-36). Thus, the wider the scope of the offence, the more likely there is a circumstance where the mandatory minimum will impose a lengthy term of imprisonment on conduct that involves lesser risk to the public and little moral fault (Nur, at para. 83). In those cases, the sentence is liable to capture conduct that clearly does not merit the mandatory minimum.\n[126] In Smith, this Court struck down a seven\u2011year mandatory minimum for importation of drugs under the Narcotic Control Act because the mandatory sentence applied regardless of the type of substance imported, the quantity imported and whether the purpose was for trafficking or personal use. The offence cast too wide a net and its effects were too broad. It caught the conduct of a hypothetical young person driving back to Canada with their first joint of marijuana: conduct that did not call for the mandatory minimum sentence.\n[127] In Nur, the Court invalidated the three\u2011 and five\u2011year mandatory minimums for the possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm when the firearm is loaded or kept with readily accessible ammunition because the offence \u201ccasts its net over a wide range of potential conduct\u201d (para. 82), including violations that created little risk of harm to the public and were instead little more than licensing infractions (para. 83). The actus reus of the offence involved possession and there was no proof of harm required (para. 84). The offence therefore caught, on the one end, an \u201coutlaw who carries a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm in public places as a tool of his or her criminal trade\u201d and, on the other end, a \u201clicensed and responsible gun owner who stores his unloaded firearm safely with ammunition nearby, but makes a mistake as to where it can be stored\u201d (para. 82). The latter involved little or no moral fault and little or no danger to the public (para. 83). The Court reasoned that \u201ca three-year term of imprisonment for a person who has essentially committed a licensing infraction is totally out of sync with the norms of criminal sentencing\u201d (para. 83). The impugned provision captured too broad a range of criminal behaviour and imposed lengthy terms of incarceration in circumstances where such lengthy prison sentences were not necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s otherwise valid penal purposes of protecting the public, discouraging other similar conduct or expressing moral condemnation (para. 104).\n[128] In Lloyd, the Court used reasonable hypotheticals to explore the actual reach of what appeared to be fairly narrowly drafted prohibitions against trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking under s. 5(3)(a)(i)(D) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act . The majority held that the legislation captured a wide breadth of potential conduct, including not only serious drug trafficking but also less blameworthy conduct (para. 27). It treated those who shared smaller amounts of narcotics among friends, spouses or people with substance use disorder as akin to commercial and professional drug dealers.\n[129] Thus, a court must assess to what extent the offence\u2019s mens rea and actus reus capture a range of conduct as well as the degree of variation in the offence\u2019s gravity and the offender\u2019s culpability. In characterizing the offence\u2019s scope, a court may consider whether the offence necessarily involves harm to a person or simply the risk of harm, whether there are ways of committing the offence that pose relatively little danger, and to what degree the offence\u2019s mens rea requires an elevated degree of culpability of the offender. In characterizing the breadth of the offence, one must also remember that s. 12 is not so exacting a standard that it requires a sentence to be perfectly tailored to every moral nuance of an offender\u2019s circumstance (Lyons, at pp. 344-45). However, as the Court cautioned in Lloyd, at para. 35: \u201cIf Parliament hopes to sustain mandatory minimum penalties for offences that cast a wide net, it should consider narrowing their reach so that they only catch offenders that merit the mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d\n[130] The nature of the offence, and the severity of the punishment in relation to the impugned offence, may influence the gross disproportionality analysis. In assessing the particular mandatory minimums before the court, the general range of criminal offences will provide necessary context. Minimum sentences can be and have been attached to various types of prohibitions: from licensing offences to true crimes. In the case of regulatory offences or licensing infractions, courts would expect corresponding penalties to be less severe. Conversely, courts may expect harsher punishment to attach to offences that result in serious harm or include a grave mens rea. For example, the provision in the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, that was upheld in Goltz required 7 days\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $300 for those convicted for the first time of driving while being prohibited from doing so. This was a regulatory and preventative provision which sought to ensure people who were prohibited from driving because of their unsafe driving records did not pose a risk of harm to others. The Court upheld the mandatory minimum in Goltz in part because the provision applied to a narrow set of culpable behaviours and the ultimate punishment was \u201clighter than might first appear\u201d (p. 514). The sentence could be designed to be served in a few weekends or in five days rather than the mandated seven through earned remission (p. 514). In addition, the administrative scheme governing the offence was enacted after extensive study by the Government of British Columbia\u2019s Motor Vehicle Task Force and the scheme specifically targeted drivers who exhibited open contempt of the law (pp. 507 and 511).\n[131] When the impugned minimum is attached to a provision that requires a particular act with a defined harm, the court will assess the scope of the provision and the seriousness of that harm in its gross disproportionality analysis. For example, Luxton concerned first degree murder and parole ineligibility. Ferguson dealt with manslaughter in which an RCMP officer shot a detainee. Latimer involved a father killing his child who had cerebral palsy, and Morrisey involved the death of a friend through horseplay with a firearm. The actus reus of these offences involved the death of a person: a specific realized harm, and one of the utmost gravity. This can be expected to carry significant weight in the assessment of gross disproportion.\n[132] Courts may also consider sentencing ranges and starting points for such offences, since these tools are useful in assessing proportionality and parity. They reflect judicial consensus on an offence\u2019s gravity, and advance parity by reducing substantial disparities in sentencing (Parranto, at para. 20, citing Lacasse, at para. 2; see also R. v. Stone, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 244; Nasogaluak, at para. 44; R. v. Smith, 2019 SKCA 100, 382 C.C.C. (3d) 455, at para. 126). Under s. 12, these tools can assist courts in evaluating a mandatory minimum\u2019s ultimate conformity with sentencing norms to measure whether the mandatory minimum is significantly out of sync with an otherwise fit sentence. Mandatory minimum sentences for similar offences may also assist in this inquiry.\n(b) The Effects of the Penalty on the Offender\n[133] The severity of the mandatory minimum sentence\u2019s effects on the people subject to it must be taken into account when assessing the degree to which the sentence is disproportionate. In measuring the overall impact of the punishment on the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender, courts must aim to identify the precise harm associated with the punishment. This calls for an inquiry into the effects that the impugned punishment may have on the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender both generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities. This component is central to the underlying purpose of s. 12. If the effect of a mandatory punishment is to inflict mental pain and suffering on an offender such that the offender\u2019s dignity is undermined, the penalty cannot stand (9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., at para. 51).\n[134] A court should certainly consider the additional period of imprisonment imposed by the mandatory minimum. Given the profound impact of imprisonment, the level and length of the sentence is of great personal and societal import. Hence, when quantitatively comparing the proportionate term of imprisonment to that which is mandated by the mandatory minimum sentence provision, it is important to keep in mind that the assessment is not merely some abstract mathematical calculation, but involves precious time that an offender may be unwarrantedly (and possibly unconstitutionally) spending in prison.\n[135] Courts should consider the effect of a sentence on the particular offender. The principle of proportionality implies that where the impact of imprisonment is greater on a particular offender, a reduction in sentence may be appropriate (Suter, at para. 48; B. L. Berger, \u201cProportionality and the Experience of Punishment\u201d, in D. Cole and J. Roberts, eds., Sentencing in Canada: Essays in Law, Policy, and Practice (2020), 368, at p. 368). For this reason, courts have reduced sentences to reflect the comparatively harsher experience of imprisonment for certain offenders, like offenders in law enforcement, for those suffering disabilities (R. v. Salehi, 2022 BCCA 1, at paras. 66-71 (CanLII); R. v. Nuttall, 2001 ABCA 277, 293 A.R. 364, at paras. 8-9; R. v. A.R. (1994), 92 Man. R. (2d) 183 (C.A.); R. v. Adamo, 2013 MBQB 225, 296 Man. R. (2d) 245, at para. 65; R. v. Wallace (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 100), or for those whose experience of prison is harsher due to systemic racism (R. v. A.F. (1997), 101 O.A.C. 146, at para. 17; R. v. Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114, 93 O.R. (3d) 643, at para. 37; R. v. Marfo, 2020 ONSC 5663, at para. 52 (CanLII)). To ensure that the severity of a mandatory minimum sentence is appropriately characterized under s. 12, it is necessary to consider the impact of incarceration in light of these individualized considerations (L. Kerr and B. L. Berger, \u201cMethods and Severity: The Two Tracks of Section 12\u201d (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 235, at pp. 238 and 244\u201145).\n[136] The effects of a sentence are not measured in numbers alone. They are \u201coften a composite of many factors\u201d and include the sentence\u2019s \u201cnature and the conditions under which it is applied\u201d (Smith, at p. 1073). Thus, as Lamer J. observed, a sentence of \u201ctwenty years for a first offence against property would be grossly disproportionate, but so would three months of imprisonment if the prison authorities decide it should be served in solitary confinement\u201d (p. 1073). When presented with a sufficient evidentiary record, courts should consider how the conditions of confinement \u2014 for example, the difference between the supports available while serving a non\u2011custodial conditional sentence versus serving a custodial sentence in a federal institution \u2014 would affect an individual offender. Trial courts have increasingly been of this view (see Adamo, at paras. 55 and 65; L. Kerr, \u201cSentencing Ashley Smith: How Prison Conditions Relate to the Aims of Punishment\u201d (2017), 32 C.J.L.S. 187, at p. 201).\n[137] In addition, this Court has repeatedly referred to longstanding doubts about whether mandatory minimum sentences, or incarceration writ large, are effective tools of deterrence (Nur, at paras. 113-14; Bissonnette, at para. 47; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 107; see also Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach (1987), at pp. 136-37). Though the certainty of criminal punishment may produce certain deterrent effects, empirical evidence indicates that mandatory minimum sentences do not deter crime any more than a less harsh, proportionate sentence would (Nur, at para. 114).\n(c) The Penalty and its Objectives\n[138] In relation to the penalty imposed under the mandatory minimum, Parliament sets the length of the minimum sentence based on its sentencing objectives. In turn, when assessing gross disproportion, courts assess the severity of the punishment mandated by Parliament to determine whether and to what extent the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives relevant to the offence while \u201chaving regard to the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives\u201d (Smith, at pp. 1099\u20111100).\n[139] Denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific, are valid sentencing principles (Bissonnette, at paras. 46-47 and 49-50). Denunciatory sentences express a \u201ccollective statement that the offender\u2019s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society\u2019s basic code of values\u201d (M. (C.A.), at para. 81), and the need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence (Ipeelee, at para. 37). Where the consequences of the offence clearly offend Canadians\u2019 \u201cbasic code of values\u201d and call for a strong condemnation, this Court has afforded Parliament greater deference in enacting a mandatory minimum (Morrisey, at para. 47). Likewise, general deterrence can support a stiffer sentence within a range of sentences that are short of \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment (Morrisey, at para. 45; Nur, at para. 45). General deterrence cannot, however, justify a mandatory minimum alone: no person can be made to suffer a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to what they deserve in order to deter others (Nur, at para. 45; Bissonnette, at para. 51). As Lamer J. wrote in Smith, it may be unnecessary to punish the \u201csmall\u201d offender in order to deter the \u201cserious offender\u201d (p. 1080).\n[140] Deference to Parliament\u2019s decision to impose denunciatory sentences cannot be unlimited, as this purpose could support sentences of unlimited length (Bissonnette, at para. 46, citing Ruby, at \u00a71.22). In enacting mandatory minimums, Parliament can prioritize some sentencing objectives over others, but within certain limits (Lloyd, at para. 45; Morrisey, at paras. 45-46). No single sentencing objective should be applied to the exclusion of all others (Nasogaluak, at para. 43). Each sentencing objective remains relevant to crafting a sentence that respects human dignity. Given the purpose of s. 12, the role given to rehabilitation in the mandatory minimum under consideration will help determine if the provision amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n[141] While rehabilitation has no standalone constitutional status, the strong connection between the objective of rehabilitation and human dignity was explained in Bissonnette (para. 83; Safarzadeh\u2011Markhali, at para. 71). The comments made in relation to offences which may be cruel and unusual by their nature also apply to mandatory minimums under this first prong of s. 12. Rehabilitation \u201creflects the conviction that all individuals carry within themselves the capacity to reform and re\u2011enter society\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 83; see Lacasse, at para. 4). The Court found that a punishment that completely disregards rehabilitation would disrespect and be incompatible with human dignity and would therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 (Bissonnette, at para. 85). Justice Gonthier\u2019s statement at para. 45 in Morrisey, that s. 12 is not violated due to the \u201cpresence or absence of any one sentencing principle\u201d, needs to be read in light of this Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]o ensure respect for human dignity, Parliament must leave a door open for rehabilitation, even in cases where this objective is of minimal importance\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 85).\n[142] The objective is not to have rehabilitation prevail over other sentencing objectives but rather to ensure it remains a component \u201cin a penal system based on respect for the inherent dignity of every individual\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 88). It follows then, that in order to be compatible with human dignity, and therefore respect s. 12, punishment or sentencing must take rehabilitation into account. As noted by one intervener: \u201cA person who has been found guilty of a crime is not simply a canvas on which to paint society\u2019s condemnation, but remains a human being and a rights-holder endowed with human dignity and legal rights\u201d (see I.F., Canadian Civil Liberties Association, at para. 25). The application of any mandatory minimum sentence that has the effect of excluding or completely disregarding rehabilitation will be grossly disproportionate as it is incompatible with human dignity.\n[143] Courts should assess whether the length of imprisonment legislated is too excessive in light of other potentially adequate alternatives. For example, if Parliament mandates a lengthy term of imprisonment when a conditional discharge would meet Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives or if Parliament mandates incarceration when a fine would constitute an adequate penalty. There is no mathematical formula to determine the specific number of years that would make a sentence in excess of a legitimate penal aim. The analysis, in all cases, must be contextual and there is no hard number above or below which a sentence becomes grossly disproportionate.\n[144] A mandatory minimum sentence, however, will be constitutionally suspect and require careful scrutiny when it provides no discretion to impose a sentence other than imprisonment in circumstances where there should not be imprisonment, given the gravity of the offence and the offender\u2019s culpability. That said, a minimum sentence can be grossly disproportionate where a fit and proportionate sentence would include a lengthy term of imprisonment. A mandatory minimum that adds to an offender\u2019s prison sentence may have a significant effect, given the profound consequences of incarceration on an offender\u2019s life and liberty. A mandatory minimum sentence that has such an effect cannot be categorically excluded from scrutiny under the s. 12 analysis, as O\u2019Ferrall and Wakeling JJ.A. suggest. Even if, in these cases, constitutional considerations are not between different types of sentences, mandatory minimum sentences still require the nuance of considering the extent of the periods of incarceration.\n[145] Courts should evaluate the punishment in light of the principles of parity and proportionality. As an expression of proportionality, parity assists courts in fixing a proportionate sentence (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 32\u201133). Where a mandatory minimum imposes a relatively shorter term of imprisonment, the mandatory minimum will still be grossly disproportionate if it represents an intolerable departure from the proportionate sentence. This would correspond to circumstances where even the smallest difference between the proportionate sentence and the mandatory minimum would outrage standards of decency and shock the conscience of Canadians.\n[146] What number Parliament sets as the mandatory minimum is also of significance. There will be some sentences where the length alone can establish gross disproportionality. For example, in Smith, Lamer J. observed that a sentence of \u201ctwenty years for a first offence against property would be grossly disproportionate\u201d. When the sentence is dramatically higher than what the range of sentences would otherwise be without the mandatory minimum, the provision risks imposing a large penalty on a range of conduct that may not merit it. Further, if the mandatory minimum is set at the top of the range for that offence, there is increased risk that it will impose a disproportionate penalty on those who commit the less serious forms of that offence.\n(6) Conclusion\n[147] The case law offers helpful guidance on factors that have informed the gross disproportionality assessment. However, courts need not adhere to a rigid test or fixed set of factors to determine whether a state\u2011sanctioned punishment constitutes a grossly disproportionate one. Instead, judges should focus on three essential components when evaluating the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences: the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty. The first inquiry will often centre on the scope of the offence and whether it captures a broad set of disparate conduct. An inquiry into the effects of the punishment on the individual or reasonably foreseeable offender lies at the heart of the gross disproportionality analysis. Courts should inquire into the actual effects the punishment may have on the offender: both the time period and the material conditions under which the sentence will be served. The interplay between each of the three components should drive courts\u2019 gross disproportionality analysis.\n[148] An inquiry into the sentence will often focus on whether the penalty at issue is excessive in relation to Parliament\u2019s legitimate sentencing objectives. This will often require an analysis of the primary sentencing principles animating the mandatory penalty to ensure no individual sentencing objectives are being applied to the exclusion of all others. Judges should remain aware of potentially adequate alternatives to the impugned punishment. Having set out the framework for gross disproportionality, I turn now to Mr. Hills\u2019 challenge to the mandatory minimum in s. 244.2(3)(b). It is also important to determine the circumstances of the offence in issue.\nE. Section 244.2(3)(b) Is Grossly Disproportionate\n[149] Mr. Hills fired several rounds from a hunting rifle into a residential home, knowing that or being reckless as to whether it was occupied. Mr. Hills concedes the four\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 244.2(3)(b) is not grossly disproportionate in his circumstances.\n[150] Instead, he says the minimum would be grossly disproportionate in a hypothetical scenario where a young person intentionally discharges an air\u2011powered pistol or rifle at a residence that is incapable of perforating the residence\u2019s walls (see Court of Queen\u2019s Bench decision, at para. 14). As I explain below, the scenario raised by Mr. Hills is reasonably foreseeable. Moreover, I agree with the sentencing judge that four years of imprisonment would be grossly disproportionate in this scenario. In my view, Antonio J.A. erred in overstating the gravity of the offence and the culpability of the offender involved in this realistic scenario.\n(1) Mr. Hills Raises a Reasonably Foreseeable Scenario\n[151] The Crown rightly conceded and the sentencing judge properly accepted that Mr. Hills advanced a reasonably foreseeable scenario. To begin, the scenario proposed by Mr. Hills falls within the scope of the offence and does not stretch or strain its constituent elements. The actus reus of the offence requires an offender to discharge a \u201cfirearm\u201d into or at a \u201cplace\u201d, which means \u201cany building or structure\u201d. There is no question that a residence constitutes a place. The sole question is whether an air\u2011powered rifle or pistol could constitute a \u201cfirearm\u201d per s. 2 of the Criminal Code , despite being incapable of perforating a residential wall. The expert evidence called by Mr. Hills resolved any doubt on this issue and cured the \u201cevidentiary gap\u201d which previously led some courts to decline to consider a similar scenario (see R. v. Oud, 2016 BCCA 332, 339 C.C.C. (3d) 379, at para. 46).\n[152] Specifically, the expert showed that eight air-powered rifles or pistols discharged a projectile with sufficient velocity to satisfy the \u201cpig\u2019s eye test\u201d but most of them were incapable of penetrating a residential wall. Those eight devices were (1) an airsoft pistol, (2) a Daisy Red Ryder model BB gun, (3) a paintball marker, (4) a youth sized pellet rifle, (5) an adult sized .177 calibre pellet rifle, (6) a .22 calibre pellet pistol, (7) a .22 calibre pellet rifle, and (8) a Ruger 10\/22 semi-automatic rifle. The expert concluded that there are \u201cnumerous air\u2011powered rifles and pistols commonly available in Canada which meet the Criminal Code definition of a firearm, but are not capable of perforating a typical residential framed wall assembly\u201d (A.R., at p. 393; see also Court of Queen\u2019s Bench decision, at para. 16).\n[153] The Crown accepted the expert\u2019s conclusion that some air-powered devices are firearms under s. 2 of the Criminal Code , yet are incapable of perforating a typical residential wall. I have no concern regarding the expert\u2019s conclusion either.\n[154] It is also reasonably foreseeable to imagine a young person firing a BB gun or a paintball gun at a house. As the sentencing judge wrote, it is \u201ceasy to conceive of situations where a young person might do just as posed in the hypothetical case\u201d (para. 17). The offender could do so as part of a game, to pass time, or for a bit of mischief. Thus, it is reasonably foreseeable that (1) a young person intentionally discharges a \u201cfirearm\u201d into or at a residence, (2) knowing that or being reckless as to whether a person is present, and that (3) the \u201cfirearm\u201d discharged is an air-powered pistol or rifle that is classified as a \u201cfirearm\u201d under s. 2 of the Criminal Code but is incapable of perforating a typical residential wall.\n(2) A Fit and Proportionate Sentence in a Foreseeable Scenario Would Not Involve Imprisonment\n[155] I turn to the first stage of the s. 12 inquiry in Nur and the question of a fit sentence for the reasonably foreseeable offender in such a situation. The usual deferential appellate standard of review for sentencing applies to a sentence imposed on the actual offender (Lacasse, at paras. 11-12). For sentences imposed on hypothetical offenders, however, the same rationale for deference carries less weight as the fit sentence is determined by supposing facts, and not through weighing actual evidence (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 18 and 74).\n[156] However, there is no need to set out when a reviewing court may come to its own conclusion about a fit sentence for reasonably foreseeable offenders, since I agree with the sentencing judge that a fit sentence for this hypothetical youthful offender would involve probation and that \u201ccertainly no such offender would receive a four-year penitentiary term or a sentence approaching anywhere near that\u201d (para. 19). Indeed, in light of the gravity of the act and the moral culpability of the offender in such an instance, the scenario is akin to a minor mischief offence where a suspended sentence or probation may be appropriate. The gravity of the offence and the culpability of the offender are low in this scenario, focusing on the offence\u2019s consequences and the offender\u2019s mens rea. Regarding the offence\u2019s gravity, the consequences for public safety are relatively low in this scenario. The actus reus for this offence does not require any person to be present at the \u201cplace\u201d where the firearm is discharged. Even if another person were present, the expert evidence establishes the minimal danger posed by the offender\u2019s actions, given the firearm\u2019s power is substantially reduced. In my view, Antonio J.A. erred in overstating the risks to the public in this scenario as a result.\n[157] I do not accept that the sentencing judge overlooked the risk of a projectile flying through an open window or striking a person walking nearby. A conviction does not require anyone to be where the projectile is shot and the sentencing judge was clearly alive to these risks, observing \u201cthe gravamen of the offence is the danger of potential harm, which can be caused by wildly shooting into or at a place. The danger should not depend on whether a person is shooting into a building, through a window or at a motor vehicle. The danger is always present\u201d (para. 41 (emphasis deleted)). The sentencing judge was evidently aware of the very risks that Antonio J.A. suggests were overlooked.\n[158] In my view, the sentencing judge concluded the firearms at issue posed a far lower risk relative to conventional firearms, even taking into account the risks raised by Antonio J.A. The sentencing judge found the expert \u201ccured\u201d the \u201cevidentiary gap\u201d in Oud (para. 26). Part of the \u201cgap\u201d in Oud was the lack of evidence to show whether a projectile fired from an air-powered rifle or pistol was \u201cfar less serious than discharging a regular gun\u201d (Oud, at para. 47).\n[159] Here, the expert evidence showed an air-powered device could be far less dangerous, with some incapable of causing damage beyond cracking the vinyl siding of a house. Moreover, some of the devices that the expert tested were, quite literally, designed to shoot projectiles at other people for sport. When these considerations are combined with the fact that no one needs to be near where the projectile is shot, I see no issue with the sentencing judge\u2019s conclusion that the risk to life and safety is low in Mr. Hills\u2019 hypothetical (para. 16). I fail to see any substantial harm, whether actual or potential, from an offender firing a paintball gun at a house when nobody is around, even though this conduct falls within the impugned section.\n[160] Turning to the offender\u2019s culpability, the Crown argues that the double mens rea tailors this offence to capture particularly blameworthy conduct. In my view, the double mens rea requirement does little to narrow the offence. To be convicted, an offender need only know of or be reckless as to the presence of others. No harm to others is required to ground the offence. Although recklessness requires the \u201cknowledge of a danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that the prohibited result will occur\u201d (Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584), the offender must only be thoughtless as to whether anyone is present at the place where the firearm \u2014 including a paintball gun, airsoft gun, or BB gun \u2014 is discharged. Recklessness as conceived in s. 244.2(1)(a) does not require an offender to explicitly turn their mind to the fact that they are placing others at risk. I agree with the sentencing judge that the scenario discloses immature behaviour and low moral blameworthiness (paras. 17 and 19).\n[161] Youth is a mitigating factor on sentencing. The hypothetical scenario is an example of criminalized conduct that may reflect a lack of guidance or supervision more than criminal intent on the part of the offender. In the context of youthful offenders, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation should come secondary to that of rehabilitation (R. v. Nassri, 2015 ONCA 316, 125 O.R. (3d) 578, at para. 31). In this scenario, general deterrence should play a limited role in crafting a fit sentence (Ruby, at \u00a71.36; R. v. Mohenu, 2019 ONCA 291, at paras. 12-13 (CanLII)). Instead, specific deterrence and rehabilitation should be the primary objectives when sentencing youthful first offenders (Priest, at pp. 543-44; R. v. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574, 268 O.A.C. 385, at para. 32; R. v. T. (K.), 2008 ONCA 91, 89 O.R. (3d) 99, at paras. 41-42).\n[162] As such, because the gravity of the offence and the culpability of the offender in this scenario are low, and the youthfulness of the offender acts as a mitigating factor, the fit and proportionate sentence is a suspended sentence of up to 12 months\u2019 probation.\n(3) The Mandatory Minimum Is Grossly Disproportionate\n[163] I turn now to stage two of the Nur analysis and consider whether the mandatory minimum at issue requires the court to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence. Based on this reasonable hypothetical, I conclude that the four\u2011year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed by s. 244.2(3)(b) is grossly disproportionate. It would \u201cshock the conscience\u201d of Canadians to learn that an offender can receive four years of imprisonment for an activity that poses more or less the same risk to the public as throwing a stone through the window of a residential home.\n[164] The first component is the offence. Like in Nur and Lloyd, the mandatory minimum sentence in this case applies to a wide spectrum of conduct. On one end of the spectrum, there is Mr. Hills\u2019 conduct, which poses a high risk of harm and demonstrates an elevated degree of culpability. On the other, there is the foreseeable scenario raised by Mr. Hills, which presents little danger to the public and little fault. The wide scope of the minimum is due mainly to the actus reus for s. 244.2(1)(a). As noted, the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d encompasses devices capable of inflicting lethal harm as well as those designed to shoot projectiles at other people in recreational sport. The definition of \u201cplace\u201d includes everything from a garden shed to a car, occupied or not. No person need be in the area where the firearm is shot. While I agree that firing a hunting rifle at a house is very severe and blameworthy conduct (as in Mr. Hills\u2019 case), the same cannot be said for the hypothetical scenario presented here. In the result, s. 244.2(1)(a) is at greater risk of being constitutionally infirm because it captures a broad range of disparate conduct that includes offences of varying gravity and degrees of offender culpability. The scope of the offence is wide.\n[165] The second component is the effects of the punishment on the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender. A four-year term of imprisonment would have significant deleterious effects on youthful offenders, who are viewed by our criminal law as having high rehabilitative prospects. It follows that sentences for youthful offenders are often largely directed at rehabilitation. To prioritize rehabilitation, youthful offenders should benefit from the shortest possible sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence (see R. v. Brown, 2015 ONCA 361, 126 O.R. (3d) 797, at para. 7; R. v. Laine, 2015 ONCA 519, 338 O.A.C. 264, at para. 85). This is because incarceration is often not a setting where the reformative needs of young people are met (Ruby, at \u00a75.191). Youthful offenders in federal penitentiaries are often bullied, recruited into adult gangs for protection and are vulnerable to placements in segregation (Office of the Correctional Investigator and Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, Missed Opportunities: The Experience of Young Adults Incarcerated in Federal Penitentiaries (2017)). For the youthful offender at bar, the difference between a reformatory sentence served in community and a four\u2011year period of incarceration would be profoundly detrimental.\n[166] The mandatory minimum\u2019s effect is extremely severe in this case. Like the minimums at issue in Nur and Lloyd, its effect is to replace a probationary sentence with four years of imprisonment. Not only does the minimum mandate the punishment of \u201clast resort\u201d, it imposes four years of incarceration. This weighs strongly against the minimum\u2019s constitutionality under s. 12.\n[167] The third component is the penalty. A four-year custodial sentence is so excessive as to be significantly out of sync with sentencing norms and goes far beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing goals for this offence. A four\u2011year minimum term of imprisonment for a youthful offender shooting a BB gun at a residence is draconian. It is a sentence that far exceeds what is necessary to protect the public, condemn the offender\u2019s behaviour or discourage others from engaging in similar conduct. The need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence (Ipeelee, at para. 37). Here, the offence\u2019s gravity is low and it is unreasonable to suggest an offender\u2019s conduct in this scenario greatly offends any basic moral values. General deterrence cannot support the minimum in this case either, since \u201ca person cannot be made to suffer a grossly disproportionate punishment simply to send a message to discourage others from offending\u201d (Nur, at para. 45). While this Court has generally noted the importance of denunciation and deterrence in firearms offences (Morrisey, at para. 46), this does not imply that these aims can be emphasized in cases involving firearms, particularly given the wide definition of firearms and where the offence poses little or no danger (as Nur itself illustrates, at paras. 82-84). Nor does the minimum show any respect for the principles of parity and proportionality. A four-year sentence for what is, at most, a minor form of mischief is totally out of sync with sentencing norms. Unlike the mandatory minimum sentences in Hilbach (see paras. 72-73 and 95), there is no justification for emphasizing denunciation and deterrence to a great extent in this scenario.\n[168] A comparison between punishments imposed for other crimes of similar gravity and the mandatory minimum set in this case reveals great disproportion. Consider, for example, R. v. Pretty, 2005 BCCA 52, 208 B.C.A.C. 79, R. v. Schnare, [1988] N.S.J. No. 118 (QL), 1988 CarswellNS 568 (WL) (C.A.), and R. v. Cheung, Gee and Gee (1977), 5 A.R. 356 (S.C. (Trial Div.)), where in each case firing a pellet gun at a property was charged as a mischief offence and the offender received a sentence far below the mandatory minimum sentence mandated under s. 244.2(3)(b) (suspended sentence in Pretty; two months of incarceration, two years of probation and restitution in Schnare; and a suspended sentence and restitution in Cheung). The appellant in Pretty was a youthful offender who held animosity towards his neighbour and fired a BB gun at his neighbour\u2019s home. The sentencing judge suspended the passing of sentence and placed the offender on probation for 12 months. The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the sentence appeal. In Schnare, the appellant was a young man who went on a shooting spree with a pellet gun and caused damage to several houses and moving vehicles. He was sentenced to two months of incarceration, two years of probation and several thousand dollars in restitution. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld his sentence. Finally, the three young defendants in Cheung were involved in the firing of a pellet gun at a business and nearby vehicles. Each received a 12-month suspended sentence and a restitution order. These comparable cases lead me to the same conclusion as the sentencing judge \u2014 a suspended sentence with up to 12 months\u2019 probation would be a fit sentence for the hypothetical offender (Court of Queen\u2019s Bench decision, at para. 19). A four\u2011year mandatory minimum would be a grossly disproportionate punishment considering the nature of the offence committed by the reasonably foreseeable offender as compared to other crimes of similar gravity.\n[169] For the above reasons, I find that s. 244.2(3)(b) is grossly disproportionate. It applies to an offence that captures a wide spectrum of conduct, ranging from acts that present little danger to the public to those that pose a grave risk. Its effect at the low end of the spectrum is as severe as the minimums in Nur and Lloyd. Denunciation and deterrence alone cannot support such a result. The punishment shows a complete disregard for sentencing norms and the mandatory prison term would have significant deleterious effects on a youthful offender. In light of these considerations, I agree with Mr. Hills that it would outrage Canadians to learn that an offender can receive four years of imprisonment for firing a paintball gun at a home.\n[170] As the Crown does not advance any argument or evidence to demonstrate that this is one of the rare cases in which cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 may be justified under s. 1 of the Charter , I need not address this issue.\nF. Did the Court of Appeal of Alberta Err in Failing to Consider Mr. Hills\u2019 Gladue Report and his M\u00e9tis Status in Re-Sentencing Him?\n[171] Mr. Hills argues that the Court of Appeal failed to consider his Gladue report and his M\u00e9tis status in re-sentencing him. He is asking this Court to reinstate the three\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011year sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.\n[172] As I conclude that the sentencing judge did not err in finding that s. 244.2(3)(b) was unconstitutional, I see no basis to interfere with the sentence imposed on Mr. Hills by the sentencing judge. The parties do not argue the sentencing judge\u2019s sentence is demonstrably unfit, nor that he made any other error in principle which impacts the sentence. Moreover, sentencing decisions are entitled to a high level of deference on appeal (Lacasse, at paras. 11 and 67). As the Court of Appeal interfered with the sentencing judge\u2019s sentence after having found that s. 244.2(3)(b) was constitutional, it is therefore unnecessary to address this part of its reasons.\n[173] In conclusion, the sentencing judge\u2019s sentence is reinstated and it is unnecessary to consider whether the Court of Appeal erred in failing to assess Mr. Hills\u2019 Gladue report and his M\u00e9tis status.\nG. Remedy\n[174] Having concluded that s. 244.2(3)(b) infringes s. 12 and the infringement is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter , the mandatory minimum set out in this provision is immediately declared of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 . The parties made no submissions on alternative remedies under the Charter when a breach of s. 12 occurs, such as those considered in Boudreault (at para. 103) and Bissonnette (at paras. 135\u201136).\nVI. Conclusion\n[175] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal. The judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal is set aside. The mandatory minimum set out in s. 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code is grossly disproportionate. It infringes s. 12 of the Charter and is not saved by s. 1 . It is immediately declared of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 , and the declaration applies retroactively. The three\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011year sentence imposed on Mr. Hills by the sentencing judge is reinstated.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[176] I agree with my colleague Martin J.\u2019s affirmation of the two\u2011stage framework for determining whether a mandatory minimum sentence violates s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . However, I respectfully disagree with her attempt to clarify the established framework through a new three\u2011part test for gross disproportionality. I further disagree with her interpretation of s. 244.2(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , and her application of it to the hypothetical scenario posed by Mr. Hills at trial. In my view, the four\u2011year mandatory minimum formerly imposed by s. 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code does not violate s. 12 .\nII. Legal Framework\n[177] The two\u2011stage inquiry for determining whether a mandatory minimum sentence violates s. 12 of the Charter is well\u2011established. It was affirmed eight months ago by a unanimous Court in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23. First, the court must determine \u201cwhat constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code \u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 63, quoting R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 46). Second, the court must ask whether the mandatory minimum requires the judge to impose a sentence that is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the sentence that would be fit and proportionate, either for the actual offender or for another offender in a reasonable hypothetical case (Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 23).\n[178] In these companion appeals, my colleague endorses this two\u2011stage \u201cNur\u201d framework (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 3 and 40; R. v. Hilbach, 2023 SCC 3, at para. 34). But in seeking to provide \u201cfurther guidance, direction and clarity\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 3), she has, in my respectful view, introduced regrettable uncertainty and confusion. At stage two of the Nur framework, my colleague sets out three \u201ccomponents that must be assessed\u201d: (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects of the punishment on the offender; and (3) the \u201cpenalty\u201d and its objectives (para. 122). Each of these considerations is relevant to determining a fit and proportionate sentence at stage one of the Nur framework. They do not tell us whether the statutorily\u2011imposed minimum sentence is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d, beyond merely excessive, in comparison to the length of what would be a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence.\n[179] First, if the \u201cscope and reach of the offence\u201d is broad, there will be a wider range of fit sentences. At issue, for constitutional purposes, is the lowest fit sentence for conduct which could reasonably be expected to fall under the impugned minimum. Indeed, in this case, the \u201cwide spectrum of conduct\u201d captured under my colleague\u2019s interpretation of s. 244.2(1)(a) leads to her conclusion that a non\u2011carceral sentence would be fit and proportionate for the hypothetical offender raised by Mr. Hills at trial (paras. 5, 164 and 169). But this is irrelevant to the subsequent determination, at stage two of the Nur framework, of whether four years is beyond merely excessive but \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d in relation to that specific sentence. The \u201cscope and reach of the offence\u201d simply establishes the low end of the range of fit and proportionate sentences for a particular offence.\n[180] Second, my colleague focuses on the effects of incarceration. Again, with respect, this is confusing for two reasons. The first is that these effects \u2014 and the objective of rehabilitation \u2014 are directly relevant to determining a fit and proportionate sentence at stage one of the Nur framework. Indeed, as my colleague states, \u201c[c]ourts should consider the effect of a sentence on the particular offender . . . where the impact of imprisonment is greater on a particular offender, a reduction in sentence may be appropriate\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 135 (underlining added)). This is simply stage one of the established framework. The second reason is that the effects of incarceration are considered not in isolation but in relation to a particular offence (see Bissonnette, at para. 49). That a \u201cfour\u2011year term of imprisonment would have significant deleterious effects on youthful offenders\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 165) is not disputed. But this may be equally true for those who commit murder or other more serious offences. We are willing to tolerate longer punitive sentences \u2014 despite what may be similarly devastating effects of imprisonment \u2014 for those who commit more severe crimes. As my colleague notes, \u201c[t]o prioritize rehabilitation, youthful offenders should benefit from the shortest possible sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence\u201d (para. 165 (emphasis added)).\n[181] Third, my colleague focuses on the \u201cpenalty\u201d and its objectives. I agree that courts should always consider the interplay between deterrence and denunciation and other sentencing objectives. But this third \u201ccomponent\u201d is the crux of the entire inquiry \u2014 to determine whether Parliament exceeded constitutional bounds in punishing certain offenders. In her analysis, my colleague largely returns to the same principles of sentencing that are directly relevant to determining the fit and proportionate sentence at stage one of the Nur framework, including the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (see para. 167). At the second stage, her conclusion still turns on whether the difference in length between the four\u2011year minimum and the lower \u201cfit\u201d sentence would \u201coutrage Canadians\u201d (para. 169).\n[182] As such, and while I appreciate the difficulty in deciding whether a minimum sentence rises to the level of being grossly disproportionate, my colleague\u2019s new three\u2011part approach does not assist in this determination. It simply duplicates considerations relevant to determining the low end of the range of fit and proportionate sentences at stage one of the Nur framework. At the second stage, whether a minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence \u2014 i.e., whether it is a sentence that is beyond merely excessive but \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1072, citing Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, at p. 688, per Laskin C.J.; Lloyd, at para. 24); would \u201cshock the conscience\u201d of Canadians (Lloyd, at para. 33); be \u201cabhorrent or intolerable\u201d to society (R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 126, citing Lloyd, at para. 24; Smith, at p. 1072; R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para. 26); or be \u201cincompatible with human dignity\u201d (Bissonnette, at para. 60) \u2014 remains a normative judgment (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 110).\n[183] This is exemplified in the companion appeal. Notwithstanding her new three\u2011part test, Martin J.\u2019s ultimate conclusions in Hilbach turn on whether the five\u2011 and four\u2011year minimums for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm or with an ordinary firearm, respectively, would \u201cshoc[k] the conscience\u201d or be \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d in comparison to the fit sentence of two to three years (Hilbach, at paras. 81 and 108). In contrast, Justices Karakatsanis and Jamal view the same gap differently. They find that it is \u201chard to fathom how a sentence nearly double the amount of a proportionate sentence would not shock the conscience of Canadians\u201d (Hilbach, at para. 145; see also paras. 118 and 161). On both sides, this is a matter of judgment as to when an additional period of imprisonment becomes so excessive that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n[184] I do not dispute that a four\u2011year sentence would be grossly disproportionate in relation to a non\u2011carceral sentence. I simply disagree that probation would ever be a proportionate sentence in a reasonably foreseeable application of s. 244.2(1)(a). Properly interpreted, and for the reasons below, s. 244.2(1)(a) does not capture conduct which involves \u201clittle danger to the public\u201d or \u201clittle moral fault\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 5, 125, 164 and 169; Nur, at para. 83). Rather, intentionally shooting a life\u2011threatening firearm into or at a building or other place, knowing of or being reckless as to occupants, is highly culpable and blameworthy conduct.\nIII. Analysis\n[185] Mr. Hills does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 244.2(3)(b) in relation to his own circumstances. Rather, he does so on the basis of a hypothetical offender put forth at trial. As such, it is necessary to begin by interpreting the scope of the charging provision, s. 244.2(1)(a), to determine the scope of conduct reasonably captured by the offence.\nA. Interpretation of Section 244.2(1)(a)\n[186] As this Court held in Nur, determining the reasonable reach of an impugned law is essentially a question of statutory interpretation (para. 61). For the majority, McLachlin C.J. elaborated:\nAt bottom, the court is simply asking: What is the reach of the law? What kind of conduct may the law reasonably be expected to catch? What is the law\u2019s reasonably foreseeable impact? Courts have always asked these questions in construing the scope of offences and in determining their constitutionality. [Emphasis added; para. 61.]\n[187] To determine the reasonable reach of s. 244.2(1)(a), I must read the words of the provision in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Criminal Code , its object, and the intention of Parliament (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at \u00a7 2.01(1)). This modern approach is supplemented by the presumption that Parliament intended to enact legislation in conformity with the Charter . If a provision can be read both in a way that is constitutional and in a way that is not, the former reading should be adopted (Sullivan, at \u00a7 16.01; R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 33). The \u201creal intention of the legislature must be sought, and the meaning compatible with its goals applied\u201d (R. v. Hasselwander, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 413, citing P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991); see also Sullivan, at \u00a7 2.01(2)).\n[188] Unlike s. 244.2(1)(b), the text of s. 244.2(1)(a) does not expressly require an offender to be \u201creckless as to the life or safety of another person\u201d. However, for the reasons below, I conclude that both offences under s. 244.2(1) require, at minimum, a subjective appreciation of potential harm or danger to others. Contrary to the broad interpretation favoured by my colleague, the impugned provision is sufficiently narrow in scope to exclude grossly disproportionate sentences for the kind of conduct the law may reasonably be expected to catch.\n(1) Legislative Intent\n[189] Section 244.2 of the Criminal Code was enacted in 2009, as part of Parliament\u2019s response to the intentional and reckless discharge of firearms. The Minister of Justice described the purpose of s. 244.2 as follows:\nWe also are proposing that a new offence be added to the Criminal Code which would target drive\u2011by and other intentional shootings involving reckless disregard for the life or safety of others.\n. . .\nCurrently offences available to prosecute these kinds of cases include careless use of a firearm or discharge of a firearm with intent to cause bodily harm. The negligence based offences do not appropriately capture the severity of a drive\u2011by scenario which involves consciously reckless conduct.\nSection 244 on the other hand requires proof that the firearm was discharged at a particular person with a specific intent to cause bodily harm, and this is not good enough. While more appropriate if the shooter does have a particular target, it can sometimes be difficult to prove a drive\u2011by shooting scenario where the intent is to intimidate a rival gang, or in many cases the shooter may just be firing wildly without any particular target.\nOur proposed offence [s. 244.2] will fill a gap in the Criminal Code and provide a tailored response to this behaviour. This new offence requires proof that the accused specifically turned his or her mind to the fact that discharging his or her firearm would jeopardize the life or safety of another person, and appreciating this fact, the accused still went ahead. Quite simply, these individuals just do not care. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 144, No. 29, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., March 12, 2009, at pp. 1687\u201188)\n[190] As such, Parliament intended to target an offender who \u201cspecifically turned his or her mind to the fact that discharging his or her firearm would jeopardize the life or safety of another person\u201d. This was confirmed throughout the legislative debates:\nThis offence is aimed at those who would intentionally discharge their firearm with a reckless attitude toward the life or safety of another person. In other words, it does not focus on any specifically intended consequences but rather targets the deliberate disregard for another person\u2019s safety.\nThere is something particularly disturbing to me about a situation in which someone specifically turns their mind to the fact that the shooting of a firearm would put the lives of others at risk, but in spite of this fact goes ahead and shoots anyway. This activity cries out for a strong response, and Bill C\u201114 delivers it. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, March 12, 2009, at p. 1702 (Ms. Dona Cadman))\nBill C\u201114 proposes amendments in four broad areas.\n. . .\nSecond, it creates a new offence to target reckless shootings involving the intentional disregard for the life or safety of another person. [Emphasis added.]\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 144, No. 45, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., April 24, 2009, at p. 2675 (Mr. Daniel Petit); see also similar comments made in Debates of the Senate, vol. 146, No. 31, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., May 5, 2009, at pp. 732\u201133 (Hon. John D. Wallace).)\n[191] As a preliminary matter, then, it is clear that Parliament did not intend s. 244.2 to capture the reckless discharge of firearms generally, or in situations which otherwise present \u201clittle danger to the public\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 5, 164 and 169). Rather, in both s. 244.2(1)(a) and s. 244.2(1)(b), it targeted shootings involving the \u201cintentional disregard\u201d for the lives or safety of others, in situations that \u201cput the lives of others at risk\u201d.\n(2) The Elements of Section 244.2(1)(a)\n[192] Against this legislative backdrop, I turn to the elements of s. 244.2(1)(a). The actus reus of the offence is not disputed, requiring that an offender discharge a firearm into or at a \u201cplace\u201d, broadly defined in s. 244.2(2) to include any building or structure. I agree with Martin J. that the actus reus does not require any person to be present at the \u201cplace\u201d where the firearm is discharged (paras. 8 and 156\u201159). However, we part ways on the \u201cwide\u201d scope of the offence, which she says is \u201cdue mainly to the actus reus\u201d (para. 164). In my view, the scope of the offence is narrowed significantly by the accompanying mental element, as I explain below.\n(a) Double Mens Rea\n[193] Section 244.2(1)(a) has a double mens rea requirement: (1) the intentional discharge of a firearm; and (2) knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants. Accordingly, an offender cannot know, or even think, that \u201cnobody is around\u201d or be \u201cthoughtless as to whether anyone is present\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 159\u201160 (emphasis in original deleted)) when he intentionally discharges a firearm into or at a building or other place. Rather, he must know it is occupied or be reckless, which requires \u201cknowledge of a danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that the prohibited result will occur\u201d (Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584). The culpability in recklessness is justified by consciousness of risk and proceeding in the face of it, a positive state of mind compared to negligence\u2011based offences or \u201cthoughtless[ness]\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 160). At minimum, then, an offender under s. 244.2(1)(a) must have knowledge of the risk of occupants and nonetheless proceed, in the face of that risk, to intentionally shoot into or at a building or other place.\n[194] The double mens rea required under s. 244.2(1)(a) must also be interpreted in light of the object and purpose of the section. Through s. 244.2(1), Parliament intended to capture the discharge of firearms in situations which jeopardized the lives or safety of others. It did so by enacting two offences, in paras. (a) and (b): first, where an offender intentionally shoots into or at a building or other place, knowing of or being reckless as to the presence of occupants; and second, in other situations where an offender intentionally shoots while being reckless as to the lives or safety of others. In my view, s. 244.2(1)(a) is an enumerated example of a shooting \u2014 into or at a building or other place, with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants \u2014 which jeopardizes the lives or safety of others.\n[195] A subjective appreciation of potential harm or danger may be easier to establish in classic \u201cdrive\u2011by\u201d scenarios, or when an offender otherwise intentionally shoots into or at a building or other place under s. 244.2(1)(a), than in the case of reckless shootings generally under s. 244.2(1)(b). But it would be nonsensical, and contrary to Parliament\u2019s expressly stated intent, to interpret s. 244.2(1)(a) to apply to shootings where an offender does not, at minimum, subjectively and recklessly disregard the possibility of risk to the lives or safety of others. In my view, knowledge of or recklessness as to the mere presence of occupants is insufficient to attract liability. Rather, both prongs of s. 244.2(1) were intended to target shootings in which the offender has turned his mind to the fact that he is placing others at risk.\n(b) Previous Interpretations of Section 244.2(1)(a)\n[196] My interpretation of the scope of s. 244.2(1)(a), narrower than that of my colleague, is consistent with that of appellate courts which have considered the provision. In R. v. Oud, 2016 BCCA 332, 339 C.C.C. (3d) 379, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that the offence targets \u201call intentional discharges of firearms in situations highly dangerous to others, with knowledge or recklessness\u201d (para. 35 (emphasis added)). While it is true that the court did not have the benefit of expert firearms evidence to evaluate a hypothetical scenario similar to that posed by Mr. Hills in this case, it nonetheless interpreted the elements of the offence restrictively, finding that s. 244.2(1)(a) is \u201csufficiently specific in its application\u201d and that it \u201cdoes not cast an overly broad net\u201d (para. 32). I could not agree more.\n[197] My colleague Martin J. focuses on the import of the expert evidence introduced in this case, which, according to the sentencing judge, \u201ccured\u201d the \u201cevidentiary gap\u201d in Oud; namely, whether firing a projectile from a pellet or air\u2011powered gun is far less serious than discharging a regular gun (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at paras. 151 and 158). However, the court in Oud concluded that \u201c[t]he offence is narrowly cast and the gravity of the offence puts this mandatory minimum sentence within the range of proportionate sentences for every reasonabl[y] foreseeable hypothetical\u201d (para. 51 (emphasis added)).\n[198] Similarly, in R. v. Itturiligaq, 2020 NUCA 6, the Nunavut Court of Appeal held that a four\u2011year sentence was not grossly disproportionate for a man who intentionally fired a hunting rifle at the roofline of a house he knew to be occupied. The single bullet exited the roof and caused no injuries. As in Oud, the court found the offence to be targeted at the \u201cdeliberate and dangerous conduct of firing a gun into an open space or place . . . knowing, or being reckless as to whether, others may be present\u201d (para. 48 (CanLII)). Parliament\u2019s purpose was to \u201ccreate an offence that prohibited the intentional discharge of a firearm in circumstances where the shooter turned their mind to the fact that firing the gun could put the life or safety of other persons at risk\u201d (para. 47 (emphasis added)).\n(3) Conclusion on the Ambit of Section 244.2(1)(a)\n[199] In my view, s. 244.2(1) should not be interpreted to capture a person \u201cfiring a paintball gun at a house when nobody is around\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 159 (emphasis in original)). With respect, this broad interpretation of the scope of the conduct falling within s. 244.2(1) is divorced from the legislative context and the object and purpose of the provision. Interpreted correctly, the double mens rea requirement of s. 244.2(1)(a) captures only offenders who intentionally discharge a firearm into or at a building or other place with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants \u2014 and thus, who have turned their mind to the fact that shooting the firearm could put the lives or safety of others at risk. This interpretation gives effect to the presumption of constitutional compliance and the real intention of Parliament, which explicitly targeted offenders with a subjective appreciation of the fact that discharging their firearm would jeopardize lives or safety.\n(4) Effect of the Crown\u2019s Concession\n[200] Before applying my interpretation of s. 244.2(1)(a) to the hypothetical posed by Mr. Hills at trial, I wish to briefly address the nature of the concession made by the Crown during the voir dire submissions:\n. . . I think it\u2019s fair to say, without -- as my friend puts it -- without outright conceding that the hypothetical itself could give rise -- I think it\u2019s fairly clear that the hypothetical proposed a young person with a pellet gun shooting at a structure where homeless people are known to sometimes be, it would be a grossly disproportionate sentence in the circumstances in light of the expert evidence which was presented by my friend.\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 252)\n[201] The Crown further noted that the defence, through its firearms expert, had \u201cperfected the loose hypothetical as was before the Court in British Columbia in the Oud case\u201d, which it summarized as \u201cnot supported in the evidence in terms of whether or not that would constitute a firearm at law, what the likelihood of harm from that weapon would be\u201d (p. 252).\n[202] In my view, the Crown clearly conceded the validity of the hypothetical: that \u201cthere are classes of firearms [as defined in the Criminal Code ] which are incapable of penetrating a very simple structure\u201d (p. 252), based on the accepted evidence of the defence expert. As an evidentiary matter, it stated that there was \u201cno further evidence that needs to be presented in order to further establish the hypothetical\u201d (p. 253). However, the Crown did not, in my view, concede that the elements of the offence would be established in the defence\u2019s hypothetical. The Crown subsequently clarified that the \u201cCrown\u2019s submission, obviously, is that it can be dealt with by reading down\u201d (p. 254).\n[203] As such, whether the Crown conceded that shooting at a barn \u201cwhere homeless people are known to sometimes be\u201d may result in a grossly disproportionate four\u2011year sentence is largely irrelevant, and not disputed. The primary effect of the concession was the Crown\u2019s acceptance of the fact that certain firearms could not penetrate a residential wall. However, I do not view the Crown\u2019s position to be that the mens rea of the offence would be established in the barn scenario, without more, or that such a scenario would be a reasonably foreseeable application of s. 244.2(1)(a). Regardless, on a proper interpretation of s. 244.2(1)(a), shooting at a barn would be excluded absent knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants, and thus a subjective appreciation of a risk to the lives or safety of others.\nB. Application of the Two\u2011Stage Nur Framework\n(1) What Is a Fit and Proportionate Sentence for the Section 244.2(1)(a) Offence?\n[204] For the reasons below, I would reject Martin J.\u2019s view that a \u201csuspended sentence of up to 12 months\u2019 probation\u201d (para. 162) would ever be a fit and proportionate sentence under s. 244.2(1)(a). The question becomes whether, on a proper interpretation of the elements of the offence, s. 244.2(1)(a) nonetheless captures reasonably foreseeable cases for which a four\u2011year sentence would be grossly disproportionate (Oud, at para. 50). I conclude that it does not. While potentially excessive, the impugned minimum is not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency or be abhorrent or intolerable to Canadian society.\n(a) Mere Probation Is Not a Proportionate Sentence\n[205] Martin J.\u2019s disposition of this appeal turns on the hypothetical case put forth by Mr. Hills at trial described as a \u201cyoung person intentionally discharg[ing] an air\u2011powered pistol or rifle . . . at a residence\u201d (2018 ABQB 945, 79 Alta. L.R. (6th) 161, at para. 14). She would find this to be a reasonably foreseeable scenario within the scope of s. 244.2(1)(a), for which a sentence of probation would be appropriate. I disagree. This scenario, without more, does not involve the kind of conduct that the law may reasonably be expected to catch (Nur, at para. 61). I say this for three reasons.\n[206] First, the young offender put forth by Mr. Hills is crafted primarily on the offence\u2019s actus reus. There is no sufficient basis on which to conclude that the requisite mens rea would be satisfied. Missing from the hypothetical is whether the offender turned his mind to the presence of occupants, and the corresponding risk to lives or safety, when choosing to intentionally shoot at a building. I do not dispute that the actus reus, on its own, would extend to a wide range of conduct, including the air\u2011powered pistol or rifle hypothetical framed by defence counsel. But it is s. 244.2(1)(a)\u2019s double mens rea requirement that serves to limit the scope of conduct properly caught within its ambit. This double mens rea renders offenders highly culpable and blameworthy.\n[207] Second, the majority\u2019s position is premised on the notion that the \u201cforeseeable\u201d scenario raised by Mr. Hills presents \u201clittle danger to the public\u201d. I disagree. On a proper interpretation of s. 244.2(1)(a), an offender must have turned his mind to the fact that discharging the firearm would jeopardize the lives or safety of others. Moreover, a firearm, by definition, must be \u201ccapable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person\u201d (Criminal Code , s. 2 ). Regardless of whether firearms include certain air\u2011powered devices, s. 244.2(1) (a) targets only the use of those air\u2011powered rifles or pistols which are capable of inflicting serious or deadly consequences. As discussed, it does not capture a person \u201cfiring a paintball gun at a house when nobody is around\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 159), which an accused does not know when he pulls the trigger. The seriousness of the offence, aimed at deliberately reckless conduct, would be entirely different if an accused knew at the time of commission of the offence that he was shooting at an empty building.\n[208] My colleague\u2019s position depends, in effect, on the presence of a residential wall to protect occupants. With respect, this ignores or minimizes other risks inherent when a person chooses to intentionally discharge a life\u2011threatening firearm at a building. At the Court of Appeal, Antonio J.A. discussed these risks, including the possibility that bullets could go through a window or door, psychological effects on occupants or neighbours, the risk of a violent reaction from a target or bystander, and more broadly, the impact on the feeling of safety in communities (2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226, at paras. 80\u201182). In the companion case of Hilbach, my colleague cites similar risks, including the \u201crisk of life\u2011altering physical injury when air\u2011powered firearms are used in the course of a robbery\u201d, and states that the \u201crisk of psychological trauma arising from the use of an air\u2011powered rifle remains similar to that of a conventional firearm\u201d (para. 98). She further notes the possibility of escalating violence and the difficulty in distinguishing between air\u2011powered and conventional weapons. In my view, these same considerations apply in cases of intentional shootings under s. 244.2(1)(a).\n[209] My colleague concedes that \u201cfiring a hunting rifle at a house is very severe and blameworthy conduct\u201d, as in Mr. Hills\u2019 case (para. 164). In my view, this is true irrespective of whether a bullet from that rifle could, in fact, go through the wall of a given home. The relevance of the residential wall distinction is undercut by the fact that even conventional weapons, including commonly used hunting rifles, may not be able to penetrate typical brick\u2011based walls. In this case, the defence expert\u2019s report dealt \u201cexclusively with wood\u2011framed wall assemblies\u201d, but appended was a prior study which concluded that \u201ctypical walls constructed with brick or a brick veneer are highly resistant to bullet perforation from all conventional firearms, including handguns and common hunting rifles\u201d (A.R., vol. I, at p. 393 (emphasis added)). These brick\u2011based walls \u201ccould only be perforated with the very largest of conventional firearms\u201d, such as a .50 calibre Browning machine gun (p. 393). While air\u2011powered rifles are undoubtedly less dangerous than conventional firearms, they remain capable of inflicting serious injury or death. Whether certain firearms can in fact penetrate a particular residential wall should not be the dispositive factor in assessing the constitutionality of s. 244.2(1)(a).\n[210] Third, despite my colleague\u2019s focus on the \u201cyouthful\u201d nature of the hypothetical offender (at paras. 161 and 165), the mandatory minimum punishments in the Criminal Code do not apply to youth offenders under the Youth Criminal Justice Act , S.C. 2002, c. 1 , that is, offenders under the age of 18. While age may be a mitigating factor in determining a fit and proportionate sentence, and while rehabilitation remains an important principle in sentencing, my colleague\u2019s focus on \u201cyouthful offenders\u201d must be placed in context.\n[211] At bottom, intentionally shooting any firearm \u2014 which, by definition, must be capable of causing serious injury or death \u2014 into or at a building or other place, with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants, is highly dangerous and culpable conduct. In such cases, the absence of serious injury or death will just be a matter of luck (Oud, at para. 61). I reject the notion that an offence committed under s. 244.2(1)(a), properly interpreted, could be \u201cat most, a minor form of mischief\u201d or that the offence otherwise poses \u201clittle or no danger\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 167), given the requisite mens rea and the gravity of the conduct.\n[212] For these reasons, I conclude that mere probation is not a fit and proportionate sentence in a reasonably foreseeable application of s. 244.2(1)(a).\n(b) A Fit and Proportionate Sentence Requires, at Minimum, a Period of Incarceration\n[213] In the case of hypothetical offenders, courts need not, and cannot possibly, fix a sentence or range at a specific point. Rather, courts should \u201cconsider, even implicitly, the rough scale of the appropriate sentence\u201d (Lloyd, at para. 23). The inquiry into cases that s. 244.2(1)(a) may reasonably be expected to capture must be grounded in judicial experience and common sense (Nur, at para. 62). This excludes the use of far\u2011fetched or remote examples and the use of personal characteristics to construct the most innocent and sympathetic case imaginable (para. 75).\n[214] On a proper interpretation of the impugned provision, I have difficulty conceiving of a reasonably foreseeable case in which less than a multi\u2011year sentence would be fit and proportionate based on \u201cthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender\u201d under s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code . The fundamental principle of sentencing, proportionality, requires a sentence that is severe enough to denounce the offence but that does not exceed what is just and appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence (Bissonnette, at para. 50). Regardless of the ultimate consequences, s. 244.2(1) (a) targets deliberately reckless and dangerous shootings, with firearms that are by definition capable of causing life\u2011threatening injury. It is the recklessness of the behaviour \u2014 the potential for harm, whether or not that risk materializes \u2014 which is severe and highly blameworthy, and which makes a period of incarceration a proportionate sentence.\n[215] My colleague\u2019s comparison to the sentences imposed in R. v. Pretty, 2005 BCCA 52, 208 B.C.A.C. 79, R. v. Schnare, [1988] N.S.J. No. 118 (QL), 1988 CarswellNS 568 (WL) (C.A.), and R. v. Cheung, Gee and Gee (1977), 5 A.R. 356 (S.C. (Trial Div.)), helps illustrate the difference between s. 244.2(1)(a) and \u201cmischief\u201d offences which date back decades. It is more than unclear whether the pellet guns used in those cases would ever be classified as firearms and, more importantly, whether the offenders would satisfy the double mens rea required by s. 244.2(1)(a). Properly interpreted, s. 244.2(1)(a) captures only an accused who \u201cspecifically turned his or her mind to the fact that discharging his or her firearm would jeopardize the life or safety of another person, and appreciating this fact . . . still went ahead\u201d (House of Commons Debates, March 12, 2009, at pp. 1687\u201188). I cannot agree that this constitutes a \u201cminor form of mischief\u201d (Martin J.\u2019s reasons, at para. 167). There is no indication that offenders similar to those in Pretty, Schnare, or Cheung have ever been charged under s. 244.2(1)(a), nor would they be, on a proper interpretation of the elements of the offence.\n[216] By way of more recent reference, the 19\u2011year\u2011old accused in Nur was sentenced to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment for mere possession of a loaded prohibited firearm (R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, aff\u2019d 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773). This is, understandably, lower than the s. 244.2(1)(a) sentences upheld in recent years by appellate courts for the intentional shooting of firearms in Itturiligaq (four years), R. v. McMillan, 2016 MBCA 12, 326 Man. R. (2d) 56 (four years), Oud (five years) and R. v. Lyta, 2013 NUCA 10, 561 A.R. 146 (five years). Those offences were all committed with conventional firearms. However, substituting air\u2011powered firearms would not reduce the gravity of the offences and the culpability of the offenders sufficiently to justify a sentence less than half the length of that deemed to be fit and proportionate in Itturiligaq, McMillan, Oud and Lyta. By definition, all firearms must be capable of causing serious bodily injury or death.\n[217] In my view, a sentence of two years should properly be considered the low end of the range of fit and proportionate sentences in reasonably foreseeable applications of s. 244.2(1)(a).\n(2) Is a Four\u2011Year Sentence Grossly Disproportionate to the Fit and Proportionate Sentence?\n[218] The minimum four\u2011year sentence imposed by s. 244.2(3)(b) would, at the floor of the range of fit and proportionate sentences, double the period of incarceration in reasonably foreseeable cases. The effects of this should not be minimized and may be devastating. However, I cannot conclude, as a constitutional matter, that this additional period of imprisonment would meet the high threshold established by this Court for cruel and unusual punishment.\n[219] A sentence oversteps constitutional limits when it is grossly disproportionate, not merely excessive (Bissonnette, at para. 61). The sentence must be \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Smith, at p. 1072, citing Miller, at p. 688, per Laskin C.J.; Lloyd, at para. 24), and \u201cabhorrent or intolerable\u201d to society (Boudreault, at para. 126, citing Lloyd, at para. 24; Smith, at p. 1072; Morrisey, at para. 26). As Chief Justice Wagner, writing for a unanimous Court, held more recently in Bissonnette, it must be \u201cso excessive as to be incompatible with human dignity\u201d (para. 60).\n[220] As a result, it is only on rare and unique occasions that a court will find, and has found, a sentence to be so grossly disproportionate that it violates s. 12 of the Charter (see Steele v. Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417, per Cory J.; Boudreault, at paras. 127\u2011128, per C\u00f4t\u00e9 J., dissenting, but not on this point; Bissonnette, at para. 70). Courts must properly show deference to Parliament\u2019s policy decisions with respect to sentencing (Bissonnette, at para. 70; Lloyd, at para. 45). In an oft\u2011cited passage, Borins Dist. Ct. J. discussed such deference:\nIt is not for the court to pass on the wisdom of Parliament with respect to the gravity of various offences and the range of penalties which may be imposed upon those found guilty of committing the offences. Parliament has broad discretion in proscribing conduct as criminal and in determining proper punishment. While the final judgment as to whether a punishment exceeds constitutional limits set by the Charter is properly a judicial function, the court should be reluctant to interfere with the considered views of Parliament and then only in the clearest of cases where the punishment prescribed is so excessive when compared with the punishment prescribed for other offences as to outrage standards of decency.\n(R. v. Guiller (1985), 48 C.R. (3d) 226 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), at p. 238)\n[221] In my view, a four\u2011year sentence cannot be said to be \u201cso excessive\u201d as to \u201cbe incompatible with human dignity\u201d or otherwise \u201coutrage standards of decency\u201d. The s. 12 threshold is necessarily high in cases where the issue is the length of the punishment, in contrast to punishments which are cruel and unusual by nature, such as torture or castration. I agree with Martin J., writing in the companion appeal in Hilbach, that Parliament is within its rights to emphasize the objectives of deterrence and denunciation in the context of firearms offences (para. 73). A firearm presents the \u201cultimate threat of death to those in its presence\u201d (R. v. Felawka, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 199, at p. 211). This Court has repeatedly affirmed the denunciatory role of minimum sentences for conduct which offends our society\u2019s \u201cbasic code of values\u201d (Morrisey, at para. 47; R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81). The intentional shooting of such a life\u2011threatening firearm into or at a building or other place, with knowledge of or recklessness as to the presence of occupants, is a clear example of conduct which offends Canadian society\u2019s basic code of values.\n[222] I agree with the conclusions of the Nunavut Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, respectively, that s. 244.2(1)(a) \u201cdoes not go beyond that which is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose\u201d (Itturiligaq, at para. 95) and \u201conly captures conduct that in all circumstances will be highly blameworthy and antithetical to the peace of the community\u201d (Oud, at para. 44). In emphasizing the high threshold under s. 12, La Forest J. explained that the word \u201cgrossly\u201d reflects \u201cthis Court\u2019s concern not to hold Parliament to a standard so exacting . . . as to require punishments to be perfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of every crime and every offender\u201d (R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 344\u201145). I agree. In this case, I am \u201cwary of second\u2011guessing the [policy] choices of our elected representatives\u201d (Nur, at para. 144, per Moldaver J., dissenting) based on a hypothetical scenario that is, in my view, unmoored from judicial experience and common sense.\n[223] To my knowledge, the hypothetical scenario posed by the appellant has not resulted in a conviction under s. 244.2(1)(a) \u2014 nor would it, on my interpretation of the offence, unless the accused had turned his mind to the fact that discharging the firearm would jeopardize the lives or safety of others. The hypothetical is \u201cmore imaginary than real\u201d and is not a sound basis on which to nullify Parliament\u2019s considered response to a serious and complex issue (see Nur, at para. 133, per Moldaver J., dissenting).\nIV. Legislative Amendments\n[224] Before concluding, I wish to briefly comment on An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15. The legislation, which received royal assent on November 17, 2022, amended the text of s. 244.2(3) (b) and repealed s. 344(1)(a.1 ) of the Criminal Code (at issue in Hilbach), thereby removing the four\u2011year minimum at issue in this appeal for s. 244.2(1) offences committed with non\u2011restricted or non\u2011prohibited firearms.\n[225] This legislation reflects a policy choice by the government which is not relevant in determining whether the former law infringed s. 12 of the Charter ( Canada (Attorney General ) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, at para. 104). While the Minister of Justice acknowledged generally, in the context of introducing the legislation, that certain mandatory minimums have the potential to lead to sentences that may be viewed as grossly disproportionate, I agree with the Director of Public Prosecutions that this cannot be seen as an acknowledgment that any specific provision or minimum is or was not Charter \u2011compliant. As with the original enactment of s. 244.2 in 2009, it is within Parliament\u2019s mandate to regulate firearms\u2011related offences as it sees fit. This includes balancing objectives of deterrence and denunciation with those of rehabilitation, proportionality, and judicial discretion in sentencing.\nV. Conclusion\n[226] Properly interpreted, s. 244.2(1)(a) captures offenders who intentionally shoot a firearm into or at a building or other place, knowing of or being reckless as to the presence of occupants, and who have thus turned their mind to the fact that discharging their firearm could jeopardize the lives or safety of others. In my view, a four\u2011year minimum sentence for such conduct is not \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d or \u201cincompatible with human dignity\u201d to rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12. I would dismiss Mr. Hills\u2019 appeal.\nAppeal allowed, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McKay Ferg, Calgary; TingleMerrett, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Nova Scotia: Public Prosecution Service (NS) \u2014 Appeals and Special Prosecutions, Halifax.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Regina.\nSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association (Ontario): Goddard & Shanmuganathan, Toronto; Addario Law Group, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Bar Association: Peck and Company, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Stockwoods, Toronto.\n"

C\u201146, ss. 344(1) (a)(i), (a.1 ).\nAfter robbing a convenience store, H, an Indigenous 19\u2011year\u2011old, pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm contrary to s. 344(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code . Section 344(1) (a)(i) prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for a first offence conviction of robbery committed with a restricted or prohibited firearm. At sentencing, H brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentence, arguing that it was a grossly disproportionate sentence in regards to his circumstances and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The sentencing judge concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate and contravened s. 12 . He decided that a fit and proportionate sentence for H was two years less a day.\nIn an unrelated case, Z robbed a convenience store and pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm, contrary to s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code . At that time, s. 344(1) (a.1 ) imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment for a conviction of robbery where an ordinary firearm was used. At sentencing, Z brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentence, relying on a set of hypothetical scenarios. The sentencing judge concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate for Z. However, she concluded that it was grossly disproportionate in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios, and declared s. 344(1)(a.1 ) of no force or effect. She sentenced Z to three years\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe Crown\u2019s appeals in the cases of H and Z were heard together. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions, but added a year to H\u2019s sentence, concluding that three years\u2019 imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence. It declined to interfere with Z\u2019s sentence. The Crown appeals the declarations of unconstitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions to the Court.\nHeld (Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The mandatory minimum sentences set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are constitutional and do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nIn the companion appeal of R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, the Court affirmed and developed the framework applicable to challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under s. 12 of the Charter . In accordance with that framework, determining whether the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery are grossly disproportionate requires a two\u2011stage inquiry. A court must first determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code . The court must then ask whether the impugned provision requires it to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate when compared to the fit and proportionate sentence. Whether a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate will depend upon the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty and its objectives. This two\u2011part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (a) the actual offender before the court, or (b) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case.\nIndigeneity should factor into the s. 12 analysis of gross disproportionality. Section 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code provides mandatory direction to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders for all offences in sentencing. Sentencing judges must consider the unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Indigenous offender before the courts and the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for that offender. When engaged, s. 718.2 (e) applies at three different parts of the s. 12 analysis. First, courts must consider Gladue when sentencing the individual offender; the failure to consider Gladue factors is an error that can lead to a finding that a sentence is unfit. Second, when crafting reasonably foreseeable hypotheticals, a court may consider scenarios involving Indigenous offenders. Lastly, Indigeneity is relevant at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry. The assessment of whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate depends, in part, on the penalty\u2019s effect on individual offenders, including Indigenous offenders, and its reflection of valid penal purposes and recognized sentencing principles, which include Gladue\u2019s framework for applying s. 718.2(e).\nIn H\u2019s case, the five\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter . With respect to the first stage of the inquiry, determining a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence, three years\u2019 imprisonment is a fit and proportionate sentence for H. It is the starting point adopted for an unsophisticated armed robbery of small commercial establishments and in the absence of physical harm. H\u2019s offence not only involved a prohibited firearm, but also resulted in physical harm to store clerks. Moreover, H pointed the rifle at two employees. He was on probation and was subject to a prohibition order at the time of the offence, and he involved a 13\u2011year\u2011old youth in a violent crime. The two\u2011year sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, which was a full year below the starting point, was demonstrably unfit.\nWith respect to the second part of the two\u2011stage inquiry, determining whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate, the mandatory minimum sentence, while harsh and close to the line, is not grossly disproportionate in H\u2019s case. First, considering the scope and reach of the offence, the minimum sentence is not so wide that it encompasses conduct that poses relatively little risk of harm. The gravity of the robbery offence and the culpability of offenders convicted of it is relatively high. Robbery is a serious offence based on the requisite actus reus of the use or threat of violence or force in stealing or attempting to steal property. Adding a firearm to the equation simply increases the gravity of the offence. The harmful consequences of using a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery are readily identified: there is the risk of death or life\u2011altering physical injury for victims and bystanders, and, even if the weapon is not fired, exposure to this threat carries the risk of profound psychological harm. The use of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offence\u2019s gravity, as the presence of a firearm creates a highly volatile and dangerous situation. The mental elements required for the minimum sentence to apply suggest a relatively high degree of culpability. An offender who commits robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm must intend to steal and intend to use violence or force (or the threat thereof). The offence does not involve an inadvertent decision to put public safety at risk but a conscious choice to put another person\u2019s safety at great risk. Though H\u2019s personal circumstances attenuate his culpability somewhat, his actions constitute a grave offence with high moral blameworthiness.\nSecond, considering the effects of the penalty on the offender, a five\u2011year term of imprisonment would have detrimental implications for H\u2019s rehabilitation, given the sentencing judge\u2019s finding that a penitentiary term increased the likelihood that H would re\u2011entrench in gang involvement. Many Indigenous offenders may serve harder time as Indigenous offenders are often more severely affected by incarceration and treated in discriminatory ways in custodial environments. Further, incarceration itself can be a culturally inappropriate consequence for wrongdoing for Indigenous offenders. These effects must carry significant weight.\nWith respect to the penalty and its objectives, courts must first consider which sentencing objectives Parliament prioritized in enacting the mandatory minimum penalty and, second, assess whether the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its objectives. In H\u2019s case, Parliament\u2019s decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justifiable. The mandatory minimum sentence captures conduct that clearly warrants deterrence and the strong denunciation that a substantial prison sentence signals. Parliament is entitled to enact mandatory minimum sentences that signal that a disregard for the life and safety of others in handling firearms is simply not acceptable. There is also a need for general deterrence when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm. H\u2019s actions are precisely the conduct that Parliament sought to deter. Greater deference to Parliament\u2019s choice to enact a minimum sentence is therefore warranted. Further, the mandatory minimum sentence in H\u2019s case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature. While a five\u2011year mandatory minimum arguably sits above what H would receive, it does not far exceed what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing objectives. The difference between the mandatory minimum sentence and H\u2019s individual circumstances does not outrage standards of decency.\nIn Z\u2019s case, five hypothetical scenarios have been advanced. However, these scenarios are insufficient to establish that s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. The mandatory minimum does not shock the conscience or is not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. While the punishment is severe, the high threshold for gross disproportionality is not met.\nFirst, of the five scenarios, only two are reasonably foreseeable. Reasonably foreseeable scenarios are situations that may reasonably be expected to arise as a matter of common sense and judicial experience, as outlined in Hills. The first reasonably foreseeable scenario involves a 21\u2011year\u2011old Indigenous man who suffers from alcoholism and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, is extremely intoxicated and face down in a snowbank when a good Samaritan stops to help him. He grabs the woman, reaches into his waistband, flashes a BB gun, and snatches her purse. The BB gun is operable and capable of taking an eyeball out, but it is unloaded. The second reasonably foreseeable scenario involves a 26\u2011year\u2011old Indigenous man who suffers from a drug addiction and schizophrenia and has a short criminal record. When meeting his drug dealer in a parking lot, he produces an airsoft pistol, points it as his dealer, and takes some methamphetamines.\nIn addition, two hypotheticals drawn from reported decisions are reasonably foreseeable. Both cases involved youthful offenders involved in convenience store robberies: an 18\u2011year\u2011old Indigenous woman, who pled guilty as a party to the robbery where the principal used an imitation firearm; and an 18\u2011year\u2011old youthful offender who used a BB gun in the commission of a robbery and pled guilty.\nWith respect to the first stage of the inquiry, two years\u2019 to two and a half years\u2019 imprisonment is a fit and proportionate sentence in these reasonably foreseeable scenarios. These scenarios involved street muggings, an offence with a sentencing range around 12 to 18 months, along with the use of a weapon and, in particular, a firearm, which is an aggravating factor. Furthermore, they involved the application of force to the victim, a degree of planning and a prior criminal record. There is also the serious public safety risk involved in using a firearm to settle a drug dispute, a consideration that supports a significant sentence. Nevertheless, the moral blameworthiness of offenders is attenuated when mental health and addiction issues underlay their actions, as well as any applicable Gladue considerations.\nWith respect to the second part of the two\u2011stage inquiry, the mandatory minimum is not grossly disproportionate in these reasonably foreseeable scenarios. Regarding the scope and reach of the offence, the scenarios do not demonstrate the mandatory minimum sentence casts too broad of a net and captures offenders with low culpability. The offence\u2019s mens rea and actus reus apply to a relatively narrow set of violent behaviours, and conviction requires a deliberate and specific act with a defined harm. From the standpoint of public safety, there is not a dramatic difference between robbing a person with a conventional firearm and an air\u2011powered firearm. Z\u2019s scenarios do not establish s. 344(1)(a.1) applies in circumstances involving little or no danger to the public or little or no fault. The distinctions between the lethality of the firearms involved, or the fact of party liability, do not establish dramatically different degrees of severity in the context of this offence. In all these scenarios, in order to steal, an offender makes a conscious choice to place another person at risk of life\u2011altering injury and significant psychological trauma. However, the effects of the penalty on the offender are severe. The individual circumstances of the hypothetical offenders indicate the period of incarceration required under s. 344(1)(a.1) would likely result in severe detrimental effects. Finally, an inquiry into the penalty and its objectives reveals the analysis for s. 344(1)(a.1) and s. 344(1)(a)(i) is similar. Parliament chose to impose the strong moral condemnation that a substantial prison sentence signals, which is reasonable given the offenders\u2019 choice to put public safety at risk offends basic moral values. Greater deference to Parliament\u2019s decision to enact the mandatory minimum is therefore warranted.\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.: There is agreement with the majority\u2019s disposition of the appeal. However, for the reasons outlined in the dissent in Hills, there is disagreement with the majority\u2019s new three\u2011part test for gross disproportionality at the second stage of the established framework. Applying this established legal framework, the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) and s. 344(1)(a.1) are not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency or shock the conscience of Canadians.\nPer Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Sections 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code violate the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Charter . They cannot be saved under s. 1 , and should be declared of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 .\nThe five\u2011year sentence set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) is grossly disproportionate for H. The sentencing judge correctly considered the facts, case law, and relevant sentencing objectives to determine that two years less a day was a fit and proportionate sentence in H\u2019s circumstances. This determination is owed deference. In assessing a fit sentence, courts must not indiscriminately adhere to starting points, completely eliminate the prospect of rehabilitation, or distort the gravity of the offence by dismissing relevant facts (such as whether a firearm was loaded). The sentencing judge balanced the serious aggravating factors on H\u2019s sentence against his tragic personal circumstances, including abandonment by his parents, being raised by his paternal grandparents (both residential school survivors), and a childhood and adolescence marked by poverty, a fractured family unit, physical abuse, and substance dependency. These circumstances are precisely the kind of background or systemic factors that the Court has recognized as having a mitigating effect in sentencing, and it is imperative that sentencing judges appropriately consider the unique social issues facing Indigenous peoples in Canada. It shocks the conscience to send a youthful Indigenous offender to prison for five years when, as the sentencing judge determined, doing so would harm both the offender and society. Moreover, a sentence that is double or nearly double a fit sentence is grossly disproportionate in violation of s. 12 of the Charter . It is hard to fathom how such a sentence would not shock the conscience of Canadians. A five\u2011year sentence does not accord with a purposive reading of s. 12 , nor is it alive to the profound consequences of any incarceration on an offender\u2019s life and liberty, let alone the secondary impacts on the offender and the offender\u2019s family. Even if a fit sentence for H were three years in jail, a sentence of five years would still be grossly disproportionate.\nThe four\u2011year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1) is also grossly disproportionate. It is unconstitutionally broad and foreseeably applies to a wide range of situations, including those where the offender may be young, substance dependent, assisting the principal offender, or using a firearm like a BB gun. Applying that mandatory minimum in some of these situations would be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. A four\u2011year sentence reaches beyond the classic instance of robbery with a firearm and captures less egregious conduct. While the objective gravity of robbery with a firearm is always serious, the gravity of the particular offence committed depends on the circumstances surrounding the offence and varies considerably. A wide range of people commit armed robberies. Considering personal characteristics and circumstances sheds light on the reasonably foreseeable scope of the law and reflects the inherently individualized nature of sentencing and how proportionality involves an assessment of both the gravity of the offence and the blameworthiness of the offender. This ensures that s. 12 responds to the everyday composition of offenders in the criminal justice system. Given the breadth of the definition of a firearm (including BB guns, paintball guns, and nail guns), the range of conduct captured by the offence (including the degree and nature of involvement in the crime, the level of violence, and the level of sophistication), as well as the prevalence of important, often intersecting, personal circumstances (including Indigeneity, youth, substance dependency, and rehabilitation efforts), it is reasonably foreseeable that a four\u2011year penitentiary sentence would be grossly disproportionate for some offenders.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\nApplied: R. v.

Introduction\n[1] This appeal questions whether the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery imposed in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , constitute cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Specifically, Mr. Hilbach challenges the minimum of five years\u2019 imprisonment prescribed under s. 344(1)(a)(i) where a robbery is committed with a restricted or prohibited firearm, arguing that it is a grossly disproportionate sentence in regards to his circumstances. Mr. Zwozdesky relies on a set of hypothetical scenarios to challenge the minimum of four years\u2019 imprisonment previously imposed by s. 344(1)(a.1 ) where an ordinary firearm is used. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 344(1)(a.1 ) was repealed after this appeal was heard. Despite this legislative change, these reasons examine the impugned mandatory minimum as previously enacted.\n[2] In the companion appeal R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, this Court affirmed and developed the framework applicable to challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under s. 12 of the Charter . Whether a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate will depend upon the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty and its objectives. Under this rubric, classic features of offences that lie at either end of the spectrum can be discerned and may provide guidance. For example, some offences, while potentially very serious, can be committed in a wide range of circumstances by a wide range of offenders, including circumstances that are all but innocuous and offenders who are all but morally blameless. As such, they fall within a class of offences for which mandatory minimum sentences are particularly vulnerable to being struck down under s. 12 of the Charter as cruel and unusual punishment. This is so because the prescribed mandatory minimum punishment may, in some instances, be so severe and the effects so pronounced, that it results in a grossly disproportionate sentence to the appropriate sentence in a given case (see, e.g., Hills; R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045; R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130).\n[3] By contrast, some offences that may carry with them significant mandatory minimum sentences, such as four to five years of imprisonment, are framed in such a way that they cannot be committed in innocuous circumstances by offenders who are all but morally blameless. On the contrary, they are almost always serious and committed by offenders who bear a high degree of moral blameworthiness. Offences that come within this class are narrowly defined and limited in scope, subject and mens rea. They regularly involve acts of violence, threats of violence, or conduct that is inherently dangerous, in circumstances that give rise to a real risk of death or serious bodily harm. Additionally, they require a high level of moral blameworthiness on the part of offenders, be they principals or parties, to sustain a conviction.\n[4] For this class of offences, the mandatory minimum sentence could, applying normal sentencing principles, be considered to be too high and demonstrably unfit in some cases. For these offences there is, however, little risk of imposing a sentence that would meet the test for gross disproportionality so long as the mandatory minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate to sentences that would be appropriate, applying normal sentencing principles, for conduct that could reasonably be expected to fall within its ambit (see, e.g., R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90; R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96; R. v. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.); R. v. Lapierre (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 332 (Que. C.A.); R. v. McIvor, 2018 MBCA 29, [2018] 5 W.W.R. 139).\n[5] Of course, not all offences will fall neatly into one or the other of these two classes of offences, and they are not intended to establish any preconditions. Rather, these categories may serve as departure points when deciding whether a particular mandatory minimum sentence is or is not constitutional.\n[6] This appeal, and its companion appeal, provide classic examples of these two classes of offences. In Hills, the impugned provision imposed a mandatory minimum of four years\u2019 imprisonment for an offence that can be committed in a wide range of circumstances by a wide range of offenders. By contrast, the present offence is narrowly defined and limited in scope, subject and mens rea. The impugned mandatory minimum sentences apply to conduct that poses a significant risk to the safety of victims and the public. The risk of violence and psychological trauma from any robbery involving a firearm is acute. Unlike the offence that was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence at issue in Hills, the spectrum of conduct captured by robbery with a firearm is not so wide that the minimums apply in circumstances that involve little danger or moral fault.\n[7] Applying the framework in Hills, I conclude that neither s. 344(1)(a)(i) nor the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are grossly disproportionate. In enacting the mandatory minimum sentences here, Parliament was free to prioritize deterrence and denunciation. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in respect of each provision.\nII. Legislative Background\n[8] The respondents bring challenges under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1 ) of the Criminal Code . The mandatory minimum sentences at issue arise from the commission of the offence of robbery contrary to s. 343 of the Criminal Code . Section 343 of the Criminal Code defines four ways that the offence of robbery can be committed:\n343 Every one commits robbery who\n(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property;\n(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person;\n(c) assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or\n(d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.\n[9] While there are four ways in which robbery may be committed, the actus reus and mens rea requirements make robbery rather distinct: as an offence, it combines an offence against property with one against the person, despite the fact it is included in Part IX of the Criminal Code , \u201cOffences Against Rights of Property \u201d. In terms of actus reus, the use of violence or force is a prerequisite to a conviction under s. 343 (a) to (c), and s. 343 (d) requires that the offender be \u201carmed\u201d with an \u201coffensive weapon\u201d. Moreover, three of the four ways in which robbery may be committed (s. 343 (a), (b) and (d)) require actual stealing. Its elements thus tend to restrict the offence to a relatively narrow range of serious conduct, which is generally treated severely in sentencing (M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at \u00b622.59).\n[10] As for its mental elements, robbery carries a double mens rea requirement. First, the offender must intend to use violence or force, and in the case of s. 343(d) intend to carry the offensive weapon in question (R. v. Pelletier (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 438 (Que. C.A.), at pp. 441-42; R. v. Strong (1990), 111 A.R. 12 (C.A.), at para. 33; R. v. Nadolnick, 2003 ABCA 363, 339 A.R. 348, at para. 21; R. v. Roberts, 2016 NLTD(G) 18, 377 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 174, at paras. 152-54). Second, whether the robbery involved actual stealing (s. 343(a), (b) and (d)) or simply an intent to steal (s. 343(c)), the offender must have had the requisite mens rea for theft given that s. 2 of the Criminal Code defines \u201csteal\u201d as \u201cto commit theft\u201d. The mens rea requirement for theft involves a fraudulent intent, an absence of any colour of right over the property, and the intent to deprive an owner of their property (Lafrance v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 201; R. v. Dorosh, 2003 SKCA 134, [2004] 8 W.W.R. 613, at para. 14).\n[11] Aside from s. 343(d), s. 343 does not create a distinct offence of \u201carmed robbery\u201d. However, where a firearm is used in a robbery under any of the modes in s. 343, s. 344(1) is engaged. Specifically, where a restricted or prohibited firearm is used, an offender is subject to a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment in the case of a first offence (s. 344(1)(a)(i)). Before recent amendments to the Criminal Code were enacted in 2022, where the firearm was neither restricted nor prohibited, a mandatory four-year term of imprisonment applied (s. 344(1) (a.1 )):\n344 (1) Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of\n(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and\n(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;\n(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and\n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.\n[12] A question which affects the scope of the impugned section arises as to whether s. 344(1) is an offence-creating provision or whether it relates to sentencing alone (R. v. Watson, 2008 ONCA 614, 240 O.A.C. 370, at para. 24; R. v. D. (A.), 2003 BCCA 106, 173 C.C.C. (3d) 177, at para. 30). While nothing turns on this issue here, based on its wording and origins, Parliament appears to have modeled s. 344(1) on s. 85(1) of the Criminal Code , which makes it an offence to commit an indictable offence using a firearm, and s. 85(3) , which previously prescribed a mandatory minimum punishment of one year of imprisonment. The mandatory minimum sentences in s. 344(1) must be interpreted similarly to s. 85(1) as a result. Section 85(1) reads as follows:\nUsing firearm in commission of offence\n85 (1) Every person commits an offence who uses a firearm, whether or not the person causes or means to cause bodily harm to any person as a result of using the firearm,\n(a) while committing an indictable offence, other than an offence under [certain sections, including] 344 (robbery) . . . .\n[13] Before s. 344\u2019s enactment, robbery with a firearm was typically prosecuted by charging an offender with a principal offence, for example armed robbery under the former s. 302, and s. 83 (the then equivalent of s. 85, using a firearm in the commission of the robbery offence; see, e.g., Lapierre; R. v. Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725). Section 85(1) was enacted to ensure stiff penalties for offences commonly committed with firearms, like robbery (s. 85(3) of the Criminal Code ; McGuigan v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284, per Dickson J. (as he then was), at pp. 316-17 and 319, referring to the former s. 83 ).\n[14] However, in 1995, after s. 344 was enacted, robbery was exempted from the list of indictable offences that could ground a conviction under s. 85(1) (Firearms Act , S.C. 1995, c. 39 , ss. 139 and 149). Evidently, Parliament concluded that a penalty even harsher than the one-year minimum term prescribed by s. 85(3) was warranted where a firearm was used to commit robbery. Section 85 \u2019s text reinforces the conclusion that it served as the model for s. 344, considering the language of the two provisions is similar. Specifically, s. 85(1) refers to a \u201cperson . . . who uses a firearm . . . while committing an indictable offence\u201d, while s. 344(1) applies where firearms are \u201cused in the commission of [robbery]\u201d.\n[15] Given Parliament modelled s. 344 on s. 85, the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm ought to be defined consistently across ss. 344 and 85. In R. v. Steele, 2007 SCC 36, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 3, this Court observed that an offender \u201cuses\u201d a firearm within the meaning of s. 85(1) where the weapon is in the physical possession of the offender or readily at hand, and \u201cto facilitate the commission of an offence or for purposes of escape, the offender reveals by words or conduct the actual presence or immediate availability of a firearm\u201d (para. 32 (emphasis in original)).\n[16] The requirement to \u201cuse\u201d a firearm further narrows the scope of s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) and applies only where a firearm is used to threaten violence or force in a robbery. Mere possession of a firearm does not constitute \u201cusing\u201d a firearm (Steele, at paras. 25-28). This precludes, for instance, the mandatory minimum sentences from applying where an offender merely possessed the firearm and was technically \u201carmed\u201d within the meaning of s. 343(d). Moreover, \u201cuse\u201d implies a degree of subjective fault. The offender must intend to use the firearm while committing, or escaping after committing, the offence (R. v. Purcell, 2007 ONCA 101, 220 O.A.C. 207, at paras. 16-18).\n[17] In addition, s. 344 incorporates the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in the Criminal Code , as well as the terms \u201cprohibited firearm\u201d and \u201crestricted firearm\u201d. A \u201cfirearm\u201d is defined at s. 2 to mean \u201ca barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other projectile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person\u201d. \u201cProhibited firearms\u201d and \u201crestricted firearms\u201d are two specific classes of firearms subject to strict regulation under both the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code . Prohibited firearms include short-barrelled handguns, sawed-off rifles and shotguns, and automatic firearms (Criminal Code , s. 84(1) ; Nur, at para. 7). The possession of a prohibited firearm is unlawful, unless the individual possessed the firearm before the prohibition coming into force (Firearms Act , s. 12 ; Nur, at para. 7). Restricted firearms are \u201cinherently dangerous and are commonly used in criminal activity\u201d. They include any handgun that is not a prohibited firearm, some semi-automatic firearms, and some firearms that are less than a specified length (Nur, at para. 7; Criminal Code , s. 84(1) ).\n[18] Firearms that are neither prohibited nor restricted fall into a residual category of firearms that can be possessed with fewer constraints. This residual category includes ordinary firearms, like hunting rifles, that are subject to the licensing regime in the Firearms Act . Others are exempted from the Firearms Act under s. 84(3) of the Criminal Code , owing to their reduced muzzle velocity. Some exempted firearms include air-powered devices like paintball guns and BB guns. These air-powered devices constitute \u201cfirearms\u201d within the meaning of the Criminal Code since they can still cause serious bodily injury (Hills, at paras. 13-14). The distinctions within Canada\u2019s regulatory scheme for firearms underlie the arguments advanced by the parties before this Court on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimums.\n[19] Having set out the legislative background of the mandatory minimum sentences at issue, I turn to the facts and judicial history that led to this appeal.\nIII. Judicial and Legislative History\nA. R. v. Hilbach, Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, 2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359\n[20] On June 9, 2017, Mr. Hilbach and a 13-year-old accomplice robbed a convenience store in Edmonton with an unloaded sawed-off rifle. With his face concealed, Mr. Hilbach pointed the rifle at two employees and demanded cash while his accomplice punched one employee and kicked the other. They left with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended shortly after. At the time of the offence, Mr. Hilbach was 19 years old, on probation, and subject to a firearms prohibition order, having been convicted of and sentenced for several other offences 3 months earlier. In January 2018, Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm contrary to s. 344(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code and to violating s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code , which makes it an offence to possess a firearm while prohibited from doing so by a court order. At sentencing, Mr. Hilbach brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed pursuant to s. 344(1)(a)(i). Mr. Hilbach claimed the impugned provision was grossly disproportionate in his particular circumstances as an offender before the court.\n[21] Mr. Hilbach is Indigenous. He is a member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Before the sentencing judge, Mr. Hilbach filed a pre-sentence report and Gladue report, which established that his family had a history of residential school attendance, struggled with addictions to alcohol or other substances, and suffered financial difficulties. He has a Grade 10 education, had worked in the construction industry, and was working with an organization for youth and young adults at risk of gang involvement and criminal activity. He has a daughter, who was 18 months old at the time of sentencing. He acknowledged an alcohol addiction and a criminal record for several offences, including uttering threats, assault, mischief, and breaches of recognizance. His personal history is marked by physical abuse, family violence, chronic unemployment, and gang involvement.\n[22] The sentencing judge decided that a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Hilbach was two years less a day. In assessing gross disproportionality, the sentencing judge concluded that while the gravity of the offence was high, and deterrence and denunciation were important, the effects of a five-year penitentiary sentence were \u201csevere\u201d, as a longer sentence increased the likelihood of \u201ca life of criminal and other anti-social behaviour\u201d (para. 14). Mr. Hilbach\u2019s rehabilitation was best served with a short period of incarceration. Further, his youth was mitigating and Gladue factors contributed to the offence. The most basic was Mr. Hilbach\u2019s poverty, which prompted his actions and related to systemic factors that led to lower incomes among Indigenous peoples. The sentencing judge was satisfied these considerations would justify a sentence less than the three-year starting point established by the Alberta Court of Appeal for unsophisticated armed robbery for commercial outlets in R. v. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183. Since a five-year sentence was more than double a fit and proportionate sentence, and because a penitentiary sentence was \u201cqualitatively\u201d different, he concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate (para. 43). The Crown made no argument under s. 1 of the Charter , so the sentencing judge declined to consider it (para. 5).\nB. R. v. Zwozdesky, Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, 2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386\n[23] On September 13, 2016, Mr. Zwozdesky and two masked accomplices robbed a convenience store in Caslan, Alberta. One of the accomplices pushed an employee, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her, and demanded cash. A shot was fired into a shelf. Mr. Zwozdesky was not the principal offender. He did not enter the store during the robbery, but drove the vehicle that brought his accomplices to and from the store. Mr. Zwozdesky pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm contrary to s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code , as well as a charge of robbery contrary to s. 344(1) (b) of the Criminal Code arising from a second incident. At sentencing, Mr. Zwozdesky brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the four-year mandatory minimum sentence in s. 344(1)(a.1 ).\n[24] Mr. Zwozdesky was almost 56 years old at sentencing. He had a Grade 9 education and no criminal record. He was injured in several motor vehicle accidents, the last significant one having occurred in 2000. As a result, he suffered severe post\u2011traumatic cognitive dysfunction, fibromyalgia, nerve damage and chronic pain and was incapable of working. To manage his pain, he relied on prescription drugs, along with hard and soft illegal drugs. He had no memory of the robbery on September 13, 2016, as he was under the influence of drugs. The sentencing judge found he may have participated in the robberies to support his addictions that resulted from chronic pain.\n[25] The sentencing judge concluded that the impugned mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky, since a sentence of three to four years was fit and proportionate for his offence. She went on to conclude, however, that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios. Armed robberies could be committed in a wide variety of circumstances and by a wide range of offenders. The minimum sentence could be grossly disproportionate where offenders were young, Indigenous and\/or suffering from addiction issues. In support of this conclusion, the sentencing judge referenced R. v. Hilbach, 2018 ABQB 526. As the Crown made no submissions under s. 1 of the Charter , the sentencing judge declined to consider whether the infringement was justified in a democratic and free society and declared s. 344(1)(a.1 ) of no force and effect. Having struck down the mandatory minimum sentencing provision, she sentenced Mr. Zwozdesky to three years\u2019 imprisonment for robbery with a firearm.\nC. Alberta Court of Appeal, 2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245\n[26] The Alberta Court of Appeal heard the Crown\u2019s appeals in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s and Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s cases together. The majority, Strekaf and Feehan JJ.A., dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeals on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions, but added a year to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s sentence. Wakeling J.A. wrote in dissent, concluding that both mandatory minimum sentence provisions were constitutional and the sentences imposed on each offender were inadequate.\n[27] The majority concluded that a sentence of two years less a day was demonstrably unfit for Mr. Hilbach and instead concluded three years\u2019 imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence. Three years was the starting point for convenience store robberies established in Johnas, and a sentence of this length suited the gravity of Mr. Hilbach\u2019s offence. In going below three years\u2019 imprisonment, the sentencing judge had overemphasized Mr. Hilbach\u2019s Gladue factors and placed insufficient weight on deterrence and denunciation, as well as the offence\u2019s aggravating factors. However, s. 344(1)(a)(i) was still grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, as it precluded considering mitigating factors and elevated \u201cdenunciation and deterrence to such an extent as to minimize objectives of rehabilitation, the imposition of a just sanction, and special considerations for Indigenous offenders\u201d (para. 53).\n[28] The majority agreed with the sentencing judge that three years\u2019 imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Zwozdesky and declined to interfere with his sentence as a result. The majority, however, also agreed s. 344(1)(a.1) was grossly disproportionate in five reasonably foreseeable scenarios, including where the offender was young, Indigenous, suffering from mental health issues and addiction, and committed the robbery with an air-powered pistol. In these scenarios, the mandatory minimum might be more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. The Crown did not advance an argument to save the legislation under s. 1 of the Charter .\n[29] Wakeling J.A. in dissent would have set aside the declarations that ss. 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) are grossly disproportionate. Wakeling J.A. reiterated his view, expressed in R. v. Hills, 2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226, that this Court\u2019s s. 12 jurisprudence is unsound and ought to be revisited. Even so, Wakeling J.A. noted that these are not \u201cone of those extraordinary cases\u201d (para. 89) that satisfies the test for gross disproportionality developed in Smith. Wakeling J.A. would have also increased Mr. Hilbach\u2019s and Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s sentences beyond the mandatory minimums.\n[30] In September 2021, Mr. Zwozdesky passed away after the Court granted leave to the Crown to appeal. After Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s counsel applied to continue the appeal pursuant to s. 76 of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26 , the Court granted standing to his counsel to appear as amici curiae under r. 92 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR\/2002-156.\nD. Legislative Amendments\n[31] After leave to appeal was granted, Parliament introduced and passed An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15. The legislation received royal assent on November 17, 2022, and repealed the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 344(1) (a.1 ). When an ordinary firearm is used to commit robbery, it no longer attracts a mandatory minimum. While I acknowledge this legislative change, these reasons examine the provision as previously enacted with the applicable mandatory minimum terms. The parties do not rely on Parliament\u2019s choice to repeal this measure in their arguments and as such, I will not address this issue further.\nIV. Issue\n[32] The issue on this appeal is whether the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment prescribed in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) of the Criminal Cod e infringe s. 12 of the Charter .\nV. Analysis\n[33] In the reasons for judgment in Hills, rendered simultaneously with this case, this Court reiterated the well-established s. 12 framework and provided further clarity as to how it applies in respect of a challenge to a mandatory minimum sentence provision. I begin with a brief restatement of those principles before applying those principles in this appeal.\nA. The Test for an Infringement of Section 12\n(1) The Framework\n[34] Determining whether the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery are grossly disproportionate requires a two-stage inquiry. A court must first determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code (Hills, at para. 40; R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 63; R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 46; Nur, at para. 46). The court must then ask whether the impugned provision requires it to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate when compared to the fit and proportionate sentence (Hills, at para. 40; Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46; Smith, at p. 1072). This two-part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (1) the actual offender before the court, as it will for Mr. Hilbach, or (2) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case, as proposed by Mr. Zwozdesky (Hills, at para. 41; Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46).\n[35] At both stages of the analysis, courts are called upon to be scrupulous (Hills, at paras. 50-52). Analytical rigour at the first stage, and fixing as specific a sentence as possible, ensures that the comparative exercise at the second stage is not distorted. In some cases, the evaluation of gross disproportionality may be more apparent where the fit sentence fixed at the first stage is not carceral in nature \u2014 for example, where it would have involved probation rather than imprisonment as was the case in Hills (para. 156). But the same principled process of comparison applies when comparing terms of imprisonment to determine if and when the length of a carceral sentence becomes grossly disproportionate.\n[36] The framework for the second stage of the s. 12 analysis is outlined in the companion case, Hills, beginning at para. 122, and involves consideration of the scope and reach of the offence, the effects on the offender, and the penalty. Either one component alone or the combination of multiple components may lead to a finding of gross disproportionality. Mandatory minimum penalties that capture a range of conduct of varying gravity and differing levels of offender culpability will be constitutionally suspect (Hills, at para. 125; Lloyd, at para. 24; Boudreault, at para. 45; Smith, at p. 1078). The broader the scope of the offence, the more likely the mandatory minimum may prescribe a grossly disproportionate term of imprisonment on conduct that involves low risk to public safety and low moral culpability (Hills, at para. 125; Nur, at para. 83). In these circumstances, the minimum penalty is more likely to capture conduct that is grossly disproportionate.\n[37] At the second component, courts must also take into account the impacts that the mandatory minimum may have on the individual offender. This analysis requires an inquiry into how the punishment may affect the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender \u2014 both generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities (Hills, at para. 133). Offender characteristics including Indigeneity, race, gender, age and mental health factors may be relevant to this component (Hills, at para. 135).\n[38] The third component requires an analysis of the penalty imposed under the mandatory minimum (Hills, at para. 138). Courts must assess the severity of the sentence imposed and ask whether the prescribed penalty goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives \u201chaving regard to the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives\u201d (Smith, at pp. 1099-1100). Parliament may mandate sentences according to its punishment objectives, including those of denunciation and deterrence, within constitutional limits. However, no individual sentencing objective can be applied to the exclusion of all others (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43). Rehabilitation must form part of the calculus of all criminal punishment, as a punishment that completely disregards rehabilitation is incompatible with human dignity (Bissonnette, at para. 85; Hills, at para. 141). Courts should examine whether there are alternatives to the mandatory penalty that would also fulfill Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives. Where a mandatory minimum provides no discretion to impose a sentence other than imprisonment where imprisonment is not required, the penalty will be constitutionally suspect and require careful scrutiny (Hills, at para. 144). All punishment should be considered in light of the principles of parity and proportionality (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 32-33; Hills, at para. 145).\n(2) Mandatory Minimum Sentences and Indigenous Offenders\n[39] Section 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code provides mandatory direction to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders for all offences in sentencing (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 93; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at paras. 84-85). It directs that \u201call available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.\u201d The principles relating to the consideration of Gladue reports are settled: these considerations must be applied in all cases where they are relevant, including where the offence charged is serious. Sentencing judges must consider the unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Indigenous offender before the courts and the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for that offender (Ipeelee, at paras. 59-60).\n[40] Certain parties and interveners raised questions regarding the way Indigeneity should factor into the s. 12 analysis of gross disproportionality. The Attorney General of Ontario, for instance, submitted that it should be treated as a \u201cgeneric\u201d mitigating circumstance that is excluded from the scope of reasonable hypotheticals. These arguments were rejected in Nur when the Court found \u201cthe inquiry into reasonably foreseeable situations the law may capture may take into account personal characteristics relevant to people who may be caught by the mandatory minimum\u201d (para. 76).\n[41] When engaged, s. 718.2(e) applies at three different parts of the analysis.\n[42] First, in conducting a s. 12 analysis, courts must consider Gladue when sentencing the individual offender. The failure to consider Gladue factors is an error that can lead to a finding that a sentence is unfit (Ipeelee, at paras. 86-87). Hence, where the offender is Indigenous, like Mr. Hilbach, a court will necessarily need to take into account Gladue principles in order to fix a sentence that is fit and proportionate at the first stage.\n[43] Second, a court may consider scenarios involving Indigenous offenders in crafting reasonably foreseeable hypotheticals (Hills, at para. 86). Given the statistics concerning the imprisonment of Indigenous persons, it is reasonably foreseeable that a hypothetical offender could be Indigenous, and the consideration of a hypothetical offender\u2019s Indigeneity, in the context of a reasonable hypothetical scenario, aligns with the imperative statutory guidance provided by Parliament in s. 718.2(e). Indigenous people dealing with poverty, precarious housing, or disabilities and addictions appear with \u201cstaggering regularity in our provincial courts\u201d and are therefore reasonably foreseeable (Boudreault, at para. 55).\n[44] Lastly, Indigeneity is relevant at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry. This Court has long affirmed that the assessment of whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate depends, in part, on its reflection of valid penal purposes and recognized sentencing principles (Boudreault, at para. 48; Smith, at p. 1072; R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at p. 500; R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 86; Morrisey, at para. 28). Gladue\u2019s framework for applying s. 718.2(e) has been a core part of Canada\u2019s sentencing principles since 1999. The methodology called for under s. 718.2(e), as well as the norms it embodies, are well-established components of our sentencing jurisprudence, as much as parity and proportionality. Section 718.2(e) is necessarily relevant in a s. 12 framework that requires courts to assess the effects of mandatory minimum sentences in light of sentencing norms and objectives. Moreover, as Boudreault illustrates, the impact of a punishment on Parliament\u2019s objectives in s. 718.2(e) can support striking down a sentencing measure under s. 12. Accordingly, there is no reason to exclude consideration of s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code from either stage of the gross disproportionality framework.\n[45] The types of considerations that may be raised under s. 718.2(e) in a s. 12 challenge to a mandatory minimum sentence include, for instance, whether a probationary sentence would have otherwise been a valid alternative to incarceration as a result of Gladue principles. Or, as in Boudreault, the effects of a sentencing measure may be particularly severe when circumstances affecting Indigenous offenders are considered (para. 94). This Court has identified, for instance, that Indigenous offenders may be more adversely affected by incarceration than non-Indigenous offenders (Gladue, at para. 68). Courts may identify these concerns as grounds that support the conclusion that a minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, keeping in mind that a breach of s. 12 remains a high threshold to meet and a punishment is not grossly disproportionate due to the presence or absence of a single sentencing principle.\n[46] I turn now to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s and Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s s. 12 challenges.\nB. Application\n[47] I first address Mr. Hilbach\u2019s appeal, in which he argues that s. 344(1)(a)(i) is grossly disproportionate as it concerns his own actual circumstances. I will then turn to Mr. Zwozdesky, who concedes the proportionality of the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by s. 344(1)(a.1) as it applies to his case, but relies on a set of hypotheticals to challenge the mandatory minimum sentence provision.\n(1) Application to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s Case\n[48] The Crown submits that the Court of Appeal majority erred in concluding s. 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, as they overlooked the gravity of Mr. Hilbach\u2019s offence and failed to recognize deterrence and denunciation were valid penal goals as a result. I agree. The mandatory minimum sentence as applied to Mr. Hilbach is a harsh punishment. However, upon consideration of (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects of the punishment on the offender; and (3) the penalty, I am not satisfied the mandatory minimum reaches the high threshold of gross disproportionality.\n(a) Three Years\u2019 Imprisonment Is a Fit and Proportionate Sentence for Mr. Hilbach\n[49] The Court of Appeal majority overturned the sentencing judge\u2019s sentence of two years less a day and instead concluded that a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach was three years\u2019 imprisonment. Neither party challenges the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that a three-year sentence is a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Hilbach. No reasonable hypothetical was proffered at first instance, and we need not create one here. The s. 12 analysis will proceed based solely on the facts of Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case.\n[50] By imposing a sentence that was a full year below the starting point for offences of this nature in Alberta, the sentencing judge failed to adequately weigh the gravity of the offence and the significant aggravating factors in this case. As the majority stated (at paras. 11 and 46), three years\u2019 imprisonment was the starting point adopted for an unsophisticated armed robbery of small commercial establishments \u201cwith modest or no success\u201d and \u201cin the absence of actual physical harm\u201d recognized in Johnas, at para. 19 (emphasis added). Mr. Hilbach\u2019s offence not only involved a prohibited firearm, but also resulted in physical harm as his accomplice was physically violent with both store clerks in the course of the robbery. Moreover, Mr. Hilbach pointed the rifle at two employees. He was on probation and was subject to a prohibition order at the time of the offence. He also involved a 13-year-old youth in a violent crime. These are aggravating factors that could support a sentence above the starting point in Johnas. While I accept the mitigating factors identified by the sentencing judge, I agree with the Court of Appeal majority that a sentence that is a full year below the starting point in Johnas would be demonstrably unfit.\n(b) The Mandatory Minimum Is Not Grossly Disproportionate in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s Case\n[51] This Court has repeatedly affirmed that the threshold for establishing a grossly disproportionate sentence under s. 12 is high (Lloyd, at para. 24). The mandatory minimum sentence must be more than merely excessive, unfit or disproportionate. It must be \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). It is only on \u201crare and unique occasions\u201d that a sentence will infringe s. 12, as the test is \u201cvery properly stringent and demanding\u201d (Steele v. Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417). As I explain below, a mandatory minimum of five years, while harsh and close to the line, is not grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case. The minimum sentence at issue is not so wide that it encompasses conduct that poses relatively little risk of harm. Though Mr. Hilbach\u2019s personal circumstances attenuate his culpability somewhat, his actions constitute a grave offence with high moral blameworthiness. While the effects of imprisonment on Mr. Hilbach, an Indigenous offender, will be severe, five years\u2019 imprisonment in his case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms. As a result, proportionality and parity are not compromised to the extent seen in Nur, Lloyd and Hills. Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives and decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justified for this offence. Greater deference to Parliament\u2019s choice to enact a minimum sentence is therefore warranted.\n(i) The Scope and Reach of the Offence\n[52] As this Court has repeatedly affirmed, mandatory minimum sentences are more vulnerable constitutionally where they apply to a wide range of circumstances (Nur, at paras. 81-82; Lloyd, at paras. 3, 24, 27 and 35-36). The wider the scope of the offence subject to the minimum sentence, the more likely there is a circumstance where the minimum will impose a lengthy term of imprisonment on conduct that involves little risk to the public and little moral fault (Hills, at para. 125; Nur, at para. 83). Thus, a court should consider the variation in the offence\u2019s gravity and the culpability involved and consider whether the sentence captures conduct that does not merit the mandatory minimum.\n[53] Here, the robbery offence does not cast too broad of a net as to capture conduct that carries low moral fault or little risk to public safety. The gravity of the offence and the culpability of offenders convicted of it is relatively high. To start, even when committed without a firearm, robbery is a serious offence based on the requisite actus reus of the use or threat of violence or force in stealing or attempting to steal property. Adding a firearm to the equation simply increases the gravity of the offence. Further, mere possession of the firearm is not sufficient for conviction. The offender must use the firearm in the commission of the offence. As this Court wrote in R. v. Felawka, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 199, when a firearm is used to threaten or intimidate, it \u201cpresents the ultimate threat of death to those in its presence\u201d (p. 211). Prohibited firearms are among the most potent tools in the commission of crime. For example, sawed-off rifles are capable of deadly force, while being easier to conceal, transport, and maneuver in close quarters, like convenience stores.\n[54] The harmful consequences of using a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery are readily identified. There is the risk of death or life-altering physical injury for victims and bystanders if the weapon is discharged. Even if the weapon is not fired, exposure to this threat carries the risk of profound psychological harm. It can be expected that store clerks who are victims of offences like the one perpetrated by Mr. Hilbach will suffer psychological harm. In R. v. Al-Isawi, 2017 BCCA 163, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 524, the accused used an imitation firearm to rob 10 small pharmacies and was convicted of 10 counts of robbery pursuant to s. 85(2) of the Criminal Code . Five of the victims reported feelings of hypervigilance, trauma and fear for their personal safety (para. 29). Beyond the immediate threats to victims, there are wider risks to the community. Wielding a firearm in a store can reasonably provoke force in response, either by police responding to the robbery in progress or bystanders who attempt to intervene. The risk of escalating violence is, as a result, acute.\n[55] The use of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offence\u2019s gravity. The presence of a firearm, even an unloaded one, \u201cin and of itself creates a highly volatile and dangerous situation\u201d (Al-Isawi, at para. 57 (emphasis in original)). A loaded firearm can easily be mistaken for an unloaded firearm, not least by the offenders themselves. A sentencing discount for wielding unloaded firearms also overlooks the very real risk of an offender accidentally discharging a firearm the offender believed was unloaded. It also, for practical reasons, overlooks the difficulty of proving whether or not a firearm was loaded, even if the firearm in use was recovered. Moreover, an unloaded firearm is used for the same reason as a loaded firearm: to instill \u201cthe ultimate threat of death to those in its presence\u201d (Felawka, at p. 211). Victims of robbery offences do not know whether the firearm is loaded or unloaded. The same is true for bystanders or police responding to robberies (R. v. Stewart, 2010 BCCA 153, 253 C.C.C. (3d) 301, at para. 37; R. v. Uniat, 2015 ONCA 197, at para. 5 (CanLII)). Regardless of whether the firearm is capable of deadly force at the time of the offence, \u201c[t]he use of a firearm in the commission of a crime exacerbates its terrorizing effects, whether the firearm is real or a mere imitation. Indeed, they share that very purpose\u201d (Steele, at para. 23). The psychological trauma involved in a robbery with an unloaded firearm is therefore comparable to a robbery with a loaded one (R. v. Breese, 2021 ONSC 1611, at para. 34 (CanLII); R. v. John, 2016 ONSC 396, at para. 27 (CanLII); R. v. Stoddart, [2005] O.J. No. 6076 (QL), 2005 CarswellOnt 6523 (WL) (S.C.J.), at para. 6, aff\u2019d 2007 ONCA 139, 221 O.A.C. 108; R. v. Asif, 2020 ONSC 1403, at para. 40 (CanLII); R. v. Charley, 2019 ONSC 6490, at para. 45 (CanLII)). So too is the risk of escalating violence.\n[56] The mental elements required for the minimum to apply suggest a relatively high degree of culpability. An offender who commits robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm must intend to steal and intend to \u201cuse\u201d violence or force (or the threat thereof). A conscious choice must be made to employ violence or force. For the mandatory minimum sentence to apply, that choice extends to the decision to use a particular firearm to commit the offence \u2014 the offender must intend to employ the weapon. The offence does not involve an inadvertent decision to put public safety at risk but a conscious choice to put another person\u2019s safety at great risk.\n[57] There is some breadth to the offence. At the high end of the spectrum, s. 344(1)(a) captures, for example, offenders who organize elaborate, coordinated robberies on large institutions using automatic weaponry and cause serious injuries or death. On the low end of the spectrum, the section captures individuals like Mr. Hilbach, conducting unsophisticated hits on gas stations using unloaded prohibited firearms. This range in gravity and levels of culpability are appropriately reflected in differing sentencing outcomes above the minimum. However, the thread that connects each case is the intent to both steal and to benefit from the deep terror that comes with the threat of a firearm at a proximate range. In each case, the offender uses a firearm to induce fear for their victim in service of their own benefit. While the individual circumstances of the accused and the motivations for their conduct vary, these two elements remain constant. It is this specificity of conduct that Justice Proulx referred to in Lapierre, which aggravates the offence and subjects offenders to this minimum (p. 344).\n[58] Unlike the hypotheticals considered in Nur, individuals who offend s. 344(1)(a) commit \u201ctrue crime[s]\u201d (R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at paras. 205-6, aff\u2019d 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773). It is not the case that the offence involves little or no moral fault and little or no danger to the public (Nur, at paras. 82-83). Individuals found guilty under this section are not akin to the hypothetical proffered in Smith, of a young person caught with their first \u201cjoint of grass\u201d on their way home to Canada (p. 1053). Unlike the hypothetical scenario relied upon to invalidate the provision at issue in Hills \u2014 namely, a situation involving a young person using a paintball gun that could not perforate the wall of a typical residence \u2014 there is no removing the immediacy of personal threat that is inherent to the offence. The nature and scope of the offence requires the presence of victims. Indeed, there are two real victims of Mr. Hilbach\u2019s offence. For this reason, it has not been demonstrated that this mandatory minimum is so wide that it extends to circumstances that pose relatively little risk of harm (as in Smith, Nur, Lloyd or Hills).\n(ii) The Effects of the Penalty on the Offender\n[59] The second component requires courts to consider the effects of the mandatory penalty on the particular offender. If it inflicts mental pain and suffering on an offender through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment, the punishment is constitutionally vulnerable to the extent that the offender\u2019s dignity is undermined (Hills, at para. 133; Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 SCC 32, at para. 51).\n[60] In assessing the effects \u2014 and therefore the impact \u2014 that flow from the prescribed sentence on the actual or hypothetical offender, a court should consider the additional years of imprisonment imposed by the mandatory minimum sentence. Section 12, however, involves a contextual analysis and there is no hard number above or below which a sentence becomes grossly disproportionate. A court may consider the conditions experienced by the offender in serving the mandatory sentence, including whether the mandatory minimum sentence substitutes imprisonment for a probationary sentence, as well as any characteristics or circumstances that enhance the severity of the punishment in the offender\u2019s case (Hills, at para. 133). It bears repeating that the focus is on the sentence, not the possible availability of parole into the assessment of a minimum\u2019s effects (Hills, at para. 104, citing Bissonnette, at paras. 37 and 41, and Nur, at para. 98).\n[61] The sentencing judge identified two significant effects. At five years, the mandatory minimum sentence was more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. The sentence was also qualitatively worse, given it was to be served in a penitentiary.\n[62] I accept the sentencing judge\u2019s conclusion that the effects of the five-year mandatory minimum sentence are \u201csevere\u201d in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case. A five-year term of imprisonment would have detrimental implications for Mr. Hilbach\u2019s rehabilitation, given the sentencing judge\u2019s finding that a penitentiary term increased the likelihood that Mr. Hilbach would re-entrench in gang involvement. It is reasonable in this case to conclude that a five-year mandatory minimum sentence is relatively more severe and, like many Indigenous offenders, Mr. Hilbach would serve harder time as a result (Gladue, at para. 68). Indigenous offenders are more severely affected by incarceration and are often treated in discriminatory ways in custodial environments. Indigenous people are more likely to experience use-of-force incidents in federal penitentiaries and are provided limited access to culturally appropriate programming (Office of the Correctional Investigator, Annual Report 2021-2022 (2022)). Further, incarceration itself is often a culturally inappropriate consequence for wrongdoing for Indigenous offenders (Gladue, at para. 68).\n[63] These considerations ultimately support the conclusion that a fit and proportionate sentence would fall below the mandatory minimum sentence, notwithstanding the serious violence involved in his offence. Assessed from a purely quantitative standpoint, additional imprisonment beyond a fit and proportionate sentence is not negligible. Indeed, this Court in Lloyd struck down a mandatory minimum sentence of one year\u2019s imprisonment (para. 6). No one would reasonably volunteer for an extra year or two years in jail beyond what a judge considers just as such additional periods of incarceration will result in significant hardship for an offender and their loved ones. These effects must therefore carry significant weight.\n(iii) The Penalty and Its Objectives\n[64] In this component, courts must first consider which sentencing objectives Parliament prioritized in enacting the mandatory minimum penalty and, second, assess whether the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its objectives (Hills, at para. 138). Denunciation and deterrence are established sentencing principles that Parliament may use to demonstrate the state\u2019s disapproval of serious offences (Hills, at para. 139). While forms of punishment that completely disregard rehabilitation are incompatible with human dignity and violate s. 12 (Bissonnette, at para. 85), no single sentencing objective can be applied to the exclusion of all others (Nasogaluak, at para. 43).\n[65] So long as Parliament does not completely exclude rehabilitation from its calculus, the legislature may justifiably prioritize some objectives, like denunciation and deterrence, over others in enacting a minimum sentence. Denunciatory sentences express a \u201ccollective statement that the offender\u2019s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society\u2019s basic code of values\u201d (R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81). Where the consequences of the offences clearly offend Canadians\u2019 \u201cbasic code of values\u201d and call for strong condemnation, this Court has afforded Parliament greater deference in enacting a mandatory minimum sentence that prioritizes denunciation (Hills, at para. 139, citing Morrisey, at para. 47). The need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence (Hills, at para. 139, citing Ipeelee, at para. 37). Likewise, while deterrence cannot prevent a mandatory minimum sentence from being cruel and unusual on its own, it can \u201csupport a sentence which is more severe while still within the range of punishments that are not cruel and unusual\u201d (Morrisey, at para. 45).\n[66] That said, deterrence and denunciation cannot be prioritized at all costs. Such an approach would justify sentences of unlimited length (Hills, at para. 140). Consequently, in assessing the mandatory minimum sentence\u2019s valid penal purpose and its respect for sentencing objectives, a court should consider the extent to which the impugned sentence adheres to principles of proportionality and parity (Hills, at para. 145).\n[67] Parity requires that a sentence \u201cbe similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances\u201d (s. 718.2(b)). Sentencing ranges and starting points are useful tools in assessing proportionality and parity as they reflect judicial consensus on an offence\u2019s gravity and help reduce substantial disparities in sentencing (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 20, citing R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 2). Mandatory minimum sentences, as well as the range of sentences set out by Parliament, for similar offences may also assist in this inquiry.\n[68] In this case, the sentencing judge recognized that while deterrence and denunciation were important considerations, the mandatory minimum sentence put far too great an emphasis on these goals over rehabilitation and Gladue considerations. The Court of Appeal majority agreed, drawing an analogy to mandatory victim surcharges in Boudreault.\n[69] Both the sentencing judge and the Court of Appeal majority erred in concluding there was no valid penal purpose in this case. Mandatory minimum sentences, by their nature, emphasize deterrence, denunciation, and retribution over rehabilitation and other sentencing purposes (Nur, at para. 44). The question, therefore, is not simply whether the minimum sentence prioritizes these purposes. Instead, a court should consider whether the extent to which Parliament chose to prioritize denunciation and deterrence in setting the penalty is justified. In Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, Parliament\u2019s decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justifiable.\n[70] As noted, the need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence and the need to communicate our society\u2019s condemnation of acts that infringe our basic moral values (M. (C.A.), at para. 81; Ipeelee, at para. 37). Parliament is afforded deference in enacting denunciatory mandatory minimums where conduct, like robbing an individual at gunpoint, clearly offends our most basic values.\n[71] In this case, the mandatory minimum sentence captures conduct that clearly warrants deterrence and the strong denunciation that a substantial prison sentence signals. As the sentencing judge acknowledged, denunciation and deterrence were \u201cimportant\u201d considerations in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, given the gravity of the offence (para. 20). The use of a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery poses grave risk to public safety. As this Court wrote in Morrisey, Parliament is entitled to enact mandatory minimum sentences that signal that a disregard for the life and safety of others in handling firearms is \u201csimply not acceptable\u201d (para. 47 (emphasis in original)). The mandatory minimum sentence therefore applies to a category of conduct that calls for strong condemnation.\n[72] General deterrence also has a role here. As this Court recognized in Morrisey, \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that there is a need for general deterrence\u201d when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm (para. 46). Like the mandatory minimum sentence in that case, this minimum sentence \u201cdictates that those who pick up a gun must exercise care when handling it\u201d (Morrisey, at para. 46). While Smith notes there may be little need to punish the \u201csmall\u201d offender in order to deter the serious offender (at p. 1080), there are no \u201csmall\u201d offenders in the way this Court conceived in Nur, Smith, and Lloyd. Mr. Hilbach\u2019s actions, for example, are precisely the conduct that Parliament sought to deter. Consequently, short of cruel and unusual punishment, general deterrence can support a sentence which is more severe while still within the range of punishments that are not cruel and unusual (Morrisey, at para. 45; Nur, at para. 45).\n[73] My conclusion that Parliament was entitled to prioritize deterrence and denunciation here is consistent with the sentencing jurisprudence on robbery, which bears out the importance of these purposes in sentencing for this offence (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at \u00a723.494). It is also compatible with the greater emphasis on these purposes by courts in sentencing where a firearm is used to commit acts of interpersonal violence (see, e.g., R. v. Jones, 2012 ONCA 609, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. Maytwayashing, 2018 MBCA 36, at para. 40 (CanLII); R. v. Agin, 2018 BCCA 133, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 258, at para. 67; R. v. D. (Q.) (2005), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 78; R. v. Marshall, 2015 ONCA 692, 340 O.A.C. 201, at para. 49; R. v. Bellissimo, 2009 ONCA 49, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745, 277 O.A.C. 233, at paras. 13-14). In this context, courts have emphasized the need for denunciation and deterrence both to convey our society\u2019s abhorrence of gun violence and to communicate to potential offenders that a significant sentence accompanies the use of a gun to commit violence (D. (Q.), at paras. 77-78; Jones, at para. 12; R. v. Mark, 2018 ONSC 447, at para. 24 (CanLII); R. v. Thavakularatnam, 2018 ONSC 2380, at para. 21 (CanLII)).\n[74] In the case of offenders like Mr. Hilbach, with reduced moral culpability due to, for example, developmental delays or a substance use disorder, the five-year mandatory minimum may exceed what is necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s sentencing objectives (Hills, at para. 138). In Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, a five-year minimum term in custody is a harsh punishment considering his personal circumstances.\n[75] Nevertheless, the sentencing judge overlooked that this case is distinguishable from Nur, Smith and Lloyd insofar as a substantial carceral sentence is a proportionate sentence in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case. Indeed, as noted, the defence does not challenge that three years\u2019 imprisonment is a fit sentence. Thus, unlike Nur, Smith and Lloyd, the mandatory minimum sentence here does not impose a lengthy term of imprisonment, the punishment of \u201clast resort\u201d, when such a sentence would not otherwise be possible, or even common. Mandatory minimum sentences are necessarily more vulnerable when they replace a probationary sentence with lengthy prison terms. While it nevertheless remains important to compare two sentences involving long terms of imprisonment, it can be more difficult to establish gross disproportionality in this scenario than those at issue in Nur and Lloyd.\n[76] The mandatory minimum sentence for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature. To begin, sentences below two years\u2019 imprisonment are relatively rare for robbery, which has no mandatory minimum sentence where it is committed with no weapon or a weapon other than a gun (Ruby, at \u00a723.498). Where a weapon (other than a gun) is used in robberies of commercial establishments, as is the case here, the low end falls in the one-to-two-year range, with a mid-range between three and five years, and a high end of around eight years (Ruby, at \u00a7\u00a723.521, 23.528 and 23.532). Even without a mandatory minimum sentence, the sentencing range for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm would skew higher, since the use of such a dangerous weapon is an aggravating factor. Thus, while a five-year mandatory minimum arguably sits above what Mr. Hilbach would receive and the low end that would likely otherwise develop, the minimum does not far exceed what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing objectives.\n[77] Thus, Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case does not show the mandatory minimum sentence departs from the principle of parity to the same extent as the minimums in Smith, Nur, Lloyd and Hills. As noted, substantial, multi-year carceral sentences are the norm for this offence. This distinguishes this case from Nur, where the mandatory minimum sentence at issue imposed three-year prison terms for what were essentially licensing infractions, a result that was \u201ctotally out of sync\u201d with sentencing practices for licensing offences (para. 83). It cannot be said that, as in Nur, there is a \u201ccavernous disconnect\u201d between the mandatory minimum and Mr. Hilbach\u2019s conduct (para. 83). Given the relationship between parity and proportionality, this supports a finding that the minimum sentence in this case is not grossly disproportionate.\n[78] Moreover, the mandatory minimum sentence here is not wholly analogous to the mandatory victim surcharges considered in Boudreault. In that case, the penal purpose of mandatory victim surcharges was to raise funds for victim services and increase the accountability of offenders to individual victims and the community generally (para. 62). Neither penal purpose was likely to be realized for impecunious or impoverished offenders, who had no funds to spare (para. 63). Here, the penal purposes associated with the mandatory minimum are not unlikely to be realized, given Mr. Hilbach\u2019s conduct is precisely what Parliament intended to denounce and deter. Moreover, proportionality and parity were compromised to a greater extent in Boudreault, since the surcharges effectively imposed indeterminate sentences on impecunious offenders, although such punishment is reserved only for Canada\u2019s worst offenders (para. 79). The minimum here is more in line with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature.\n[79] That said, as in Boudreault, the minimum does not advance Parliament\u2019s intention to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prison, embodied in s. 718.2(e). Nor does it promote the objective of rehabilitation. A sentence that undermines Mr. Hilbach\u2019s ability to avoid gang life, and increases the likelihood of his recidivism as a result, does not foster rehabilitation. Though the minimum sentence may not aid Mr. Hilbach\u2019s rehabilitation, I do not find that the minimum completely disregards rehabilitation as a sentencing principle (Hills, at para. 34). Parliament has not selected a minimum punishment that prioritizes denunciation and deterrence to the exclusion of rehabilitation in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case.\n[80] Despite its effect viewed through the lens of s. 718.2(e), I am unable to conclude that the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament\u2019s purpose such that it fails to reflect rehabilitation entirely and undermines human dignity. As noted, Parliament was justified in prioritizing denunciation and deterrence over rehabilitation, given the nature of this offence. And while the minimum sentence departs from principles of parity and proportionality in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, it does not result in a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the sentencing norms for this offence.\n[81] I reiterate that gross disproportionality is measured at a high threshold: the sentence must be \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; Wiles, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). Only on \u201crare and unique occasions\u201d does such a label attach to a sentence as the standard is \u201cvery properly stringent and demanding\u201d and intended to reflect a measure of deference to Parliament in crafting sentencing provisions (Hills, at para. 115, citing Steele v. Mountain Institution, at p. 1417). The standard of gross disproportionality under s. 12 does not require the punishment to be \u201cperfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of every crime and every offender\u201d (R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 344-45). The difference between the mandatory minimum sentence and Mr. Hilbach\u2019s individual circumstances does not \u201coutrage standards of decency\u201d. Concluding that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate in the circumstances of Mr. Hilbach would erode away the high standard at the core of this Court\u2019s s. 12 jurisprudence.\n[82] For these reasons, the five-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter . Since Mr. Hilbach does not propose any reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios where s. 344(1)(a)(i) is allegedly grossly disproportionate, I turn next to Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s challenge to s. 344(1)(a.1 ).\n(2) Application in Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s Case\n[83] The amici curiae for Mr. Zwozdesky concede that the impugned mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate in his case. Instead, they advance five scenarios where they maintain the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. The Crown maintains that several of these scenarios are not reasonably foreseeable and, in any event, they do not illustrate the minimum is grossly disproportionate. In support of its claims, the Crown relies on the same concerns it raises in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, pointing out the gravity of the offence and the related need for denunciation and deterrence.\n[84] The scenarios advanced by the amici raise circumstances not addressed in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, including party liability, unplanned or impulsive robberies, and the use of air-powered firearms. While these circumstances introduce a degree of reduced gravity and culpability compared to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, they are insufficient to establish that s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. Parliament could justifiably prioritize deterrence and denunciation in these circumstances as well and, as in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, they do not show four years\u2019 imprisonment for robbery with a firearm is totally out of sync with sentencing norms. I begin with the scenarios advanced by Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s amici.\n(a) What Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios Involve the Impugned Mandatory Minimum Sentence Provision?\n[85] The amici raise five detailed scenarios where the mandatory minimum is allegedly grossly disproportionate. In each scenario, the offender pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm. The scenarios are as follows:\n(1) Eric, a \u201cknuckleheaded\u201d 18-year-old hunter, confronts two other hunters skinning a deer on his land, whom he suspects of poaching based on \u201ctown gossip\u201d about one of the hunters. The trespassers have tags for the deer. Eric raises his rifle at the hunters but does not directly point it at the two. The two hunters opt to leave the deer, and Eric finishes skinning the deer and takes it home.\n(2) Danielle, a 19-year-old street youth with a drug addiction, is trafficked in sex work by her boyfriend. Her boyfriend carries a gun, which she knows as he has recently used it to threaten her. They decide to shoplift cheese and razors from a grocery store. When stopped by a security guard, Danielle shouts, \u201cOut of our way \u2014 he\u2019s got a gun!\u201d The gun is not produced, but police find the weapon in her boyfriend\u2019s waistband when the pair are later arrested.\n(3) Chahid, a 19-year-old youth and refugee from a war-torn country, has learning difficulties and post-traumatic stress disorder. On a walk, his friend approaches two people at a bus stop, flashes a handgun in his waistband and demands their cellphone, which they turn over. Chahid was unaware his friend had a gun before this moment and unaware that his friend planned a robbery. Nevertheless, he keeps a \u201cnervous lookout\u201d. As it happens, the police are nearby and move to intercede. Chahid tells his friend to run, but the two are arrested. At sentencing, Chahid has completed high school, entered a post-secondary trade program, and supports himself with manual labour. A sentence above six months would place him at risk of deportation. He pleads guilty as a party to the offence.\n(4) Brian, a 21-year-old Indigenous man, suffers from alcoholism and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, is extremely intoxicated and face down in a snowbank when a good Samaritan stops to help him. He grabs the woman, reaches into his waistband, flashes a BB gun, and snatches her purse. The BB gun is operable and capable of taking an eyeball out, but it is unloaded.\n(5) Adam, a 26-year-old Indigenous man, suffers from a drug addiction and schizophrenia, and had a short criminal record. When meeting his drug dealer in a parking lot, he produces an airsoft pistol, points it at his dealer, and takes some methamphetamines. Before sentencing, he receives treatment for schizophrenia and his drug addiction.\n[86] Of the five, the Court of Appeal majority concluded that Adam and Brian were reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios for the purposes of a s. 12 analysis and the others were not. I agree. Brian is based on a \u201creal\u201d offender, the facts of which are reported in R. v. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266. As for Adam, the robbery of a drug dealer is a reasonably foreseeable scenario. That this offence would be committed by someone suffering mental health and addiction challenges is clearly foreseeable. While an air-powered pistol may be a relatively uncommon firearm to use for this offence, they are undoubtedly used in robberies (see, for instance, R. v. Lodoen, heard together with the appeal in Johnas).\n[87] The scenarios involving Eric, Danielle and Chahid do not qualify as reasonable hypotheticals. As their name suggests, reasonably foreseeable scenarios are situations that may reasonably be expected to arise as a matter of common sense and judicial experience (Nur, at para. 74). The following are characteristics of a reasonable hypothetical as outlined in Hills, at para. 77:\n(i) The hypothetical must be reasonably foreseeable;\n(ii) Reported cases may be considered in the analysis;\n(iii) The hypothetical must be reasonable in view of the range of conduct in the offence in question;\n(iv) Personal characteristics may be considered as long as they are not tailored to create remote or far-fetched examples; and\n(v) Reasonable hypotheticals are best tested through the adversarial process.\n[88] As this Court reiterated in Hills, reasonable hypothetical scenarios ought not to be \u201cfar-fetched or marginally imaginable cases\u201d, nor should they be \u201cremote or extreme examples\u201d (Hills, at para. 78, citing Morrisey, at para. 30, citing Goltz, at pp. 506 and 515). Personal characteristics such as age, Indigeneity, mental health issues, and addiction are potentially relevant as they are common to offenders in Canadian courtrooms. However, such characteristics ought not be used to construct the most sympathetic offender imaginable (Hills, at para. 91; Nur, at para. 75). Common sense and judicial experience counsels that offenders with only mitigating personal characteristics are rare, and it is even more improbable to see such offenders in the most unlikely scenarios falling within the scope of an offence. Stacking mitigating factors and stretching every constituent element of an offence produces a hypothetical scenario that is fanciful and not reasonably foreseeable (Hills, at para. 91). A court is not obliged to address every hypothetical presented by counsel if it finds that some do not qualify as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d scenarios.\n[89] While technically within the scope of s. 344(1)(a.1), Eric\u2019s scenario is far\u2011fetched and marginal. Chahid barely satisfies the criteria of an aider or abettor under s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code and stretches the constituent elements of the offence (R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 18). The scenario involves conduct that would likely fall outside the ambit of the provision. This Court in Hills found that while the scope of the offence may be tested to explore the breadth of the offence, straining every constituent element of the offence is not helpful (para. 83). The scenarios involving Danielle and Chahid stack multiple mitigating personal characteristics alongside the most marginal iterations of the offence to construct the \u201cmost sympathetic offender\u201d imaginable. These hypotheticals may serve to demonstrate \u201cmore about the imagination of counsel\u201d than the true scope of the provision (Hills, at para. 83). There is little use in evaluating the impugned provision based on outlandish scenarios on the theory that the imagined scenarios may happen one day. Therefore, the scenarios involving Eric, Danielle and Chahid are not reasonably foreseeable.\n[90] The majority also concluded two hypotheticals drawn from reported decisions, R. v. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, and Lodoen, were reasonably foreseeable. Both cases dealt with youthful offenders involved in convenience store robberies. Link concerned an 18-year-old Indigenous woman, who pled guilty as a party to a convenience store robbery where the principal used an imitation firearm (paras. 1 and 7-22). The offender in Lodoen was an 18-year-old youthful offender who used a BB gun in the commission of a robbery and pled guilty (Johnas, at para. 68). Neither Link nor Lodoen involved the minimum sentence at issue here. I accept they are foreseeable, provided they are modified to fit within the scope of the minimum sentences.\n(b) Two Years\u2019 to Two and a Half Years\u2019 Imprisonment Is a Fit and Proportionate Sentence in Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios\n[91] This leads me to the fit and proportionate sentences for Adam, Brian and the offenders in the scenarios based on Link and Lodoen. The Court of Appeal majority concluded that a fit and proportionate sentence for the reasonably foreseeable scenarios identified above would be around two years\u2019 imprisonment (para. 70). Neither the Crown nor the defence challenge the majority\u2019s conclusion on this point. I, too, see no basis to interfere.\n[92] Adam\u2019s and Brian\u2019s offences involved street muggings, an offence with a sentencing range around 12 to 18 months. Evidently, the use of a weapon and, in particular, a firearm is an aggravating factor in each case. Brian\u2019s offence also involved the application of force to the victim, while Adam\u2019s involved a greater degree of planning and a prior criminal record. In Adam\u2019s case, as well, there is the serious public safety risk involved in using a firearm to settle a drug dispute, a consideration that supports a significant sentence (R. v. Delchev, 2014 ONCA 448, 323 O.A.C. 19, at para. 20). This could support sentences significantly above this range. Nevertheless, the moral blameworthiness of both offenders is attenuated given the mental health and addiction issues that underlay their actions, as well as any applicable Gladue considerations. I therefore agree a sentence around two years would be fit and proportionate in these cases.\n[93] Scenarios based on Link and Lodoen would similarly support sentences around 18 months\u2019 to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. They are each convenience store robberies involving young, first-time offenders, so the three-year starting point from Johnas applies. While the offender in Link received a conditional sentence of 18 months, the offence involved an imitation firearm (para. 120). Further, the sentencing judge concluded she had no fault in using the firearm, as she was \u201cshocked and surprised when a gun was produced\u201d (para. 117). A carceral sentence would therefore be warranted had Ms. Link gone into the robbery knowing a real firearm would be used. Lodoen resulted in a sentence of 18 months (para. 70). Assuming the gun meets the definition of a firearm, a sentence above 18 months may be warranted, given it is an aggravating factor. Thus, a sentence in around 18 months to 2 years would be appropriate.\n(c) The Mandatory Minimum Is Not Grossly Disproportionate in Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios\n[94] The Court of Appeal majority concluded s. 344(1)(a.1) was grossly disproportionate in Adam\u2019s and Brian\u2019s cases, as well as in scenarios similar to Link and Lodoen, noting the minimum sentence resulted in roughly more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. In my view, the majority is in error. As with s. 344(1)(a)(i), having regard to (1) the scope and reach of the offence, (2) the effects of the penalty on the offender and (3) the penalty and its objectives, the four-year mandatory minimum for robbery does not \u201coutrage standards of decency\u201d.\n[95] Regarding the scope and reach of the offence, as in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, the scenarios raised here do not demonstrate the mandatory minimum sentence casts too broad of a net and captures offenders with low culpability. Mr. Zwozdesky advances three main factors that render these scenarios relatively less severe compared to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case: they involve air-powered pistols, they are unplanned (as in Brian\u2019s case), and they involve a party to the offence (as in Ms. Link\u2019s case). None of these considerations, in my opinion, establishes the minimum is so wide it applies in circumstances involving little fault and little danger.\n[96] Provincial appellate courts have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery, even in the face of sympathetic accused, because the offence\u2019s mens rea and actus reus apply to a relatively narrow set of violent behaviours, and conviction requires a deliberate and specific act with a defined harm (Hills, at para. 131; R. v. McIntyre, 2019 ONCA 161, 429 C.R.R. (2d) 346; McIvor; Lapierre; R. v. Wust (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43 (B.C.C.A.); McDonald; R. v. Bernarde, 2018 NWTCA 7). Further, in McDonald, Justice Rosenberg found a four-year sentence would likely be a manifestly unfit sentence for the accused on an appellate review standard. However, the sentence did not reach the high threshold of being grossly disproportionate as it was open to Parliament to legislate harsh punishments for firearm offences. Considering the objective gravity of the offence, Justice Rosenberg found a four-year prison sentence did not shock the conscience or outrage standards of decency (pp. 666 and 669).\n[97] Robbery constitutes a grave offence even when committed without a weapon, given the offence involves the use or threat of violence in stealing property. Moreover, each of the scenarios involves the use of a firearm. As discussed above, \u201cfirearm\u201d in this context encompasses ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns subject to the Firearms Act \u2019s licensing regime to barrelled devices that can be purchased without a licence, such as air-powered weapons like BB guns and airsoft pistols. Nevertheless, to qualify as a firearm, at bottom, these devices must be capable of inflicting serious bodily injury, such as rupturing a person\u2019s eye. As I noted in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, the use of a firearm \u201cpresents the ultimate threat of death to those in its presence\u201d (Felawka, at p. 211). That is equally true where an ordinary firearm is used, such as a hunting rifle and shotgun. While an air-powered rifle may be incapable of inflicting a fatal injury, an offender who uses such a device to intimidate exploits the fear that conventional firearms provoke and, at the very least, threatens to inflict life-altering injury. I am not satisfied that since the minimum sentence applies where an offender merely uses a firearm, as opposed to a restricted or prohibited one, there is little risk to public safety.\n[98] It is important to consider the offence from the standpoint of the victims in the scenarios raised by Mr. Zwozdesky. Here, there is always a person placed at serious risk of injury, regardless of whether a conventional or air-powered firearm is used. For victims, there remains the risk of life-altering physical injury when air-powered firearms are used in the course of a robbery, a risk that is not present with imitation firearms. Further, the risk of psychological trauma arising from the use of an air\u2011powered rifle remains similar to that of a conventional firearm. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal found in Al-Isawi, \u201cwhether an offender uses a real or imitation firearm does not impact the harm to the victim who would not know the difference\u201d (para. 39). I am not persuaded that victims of a robbery, like the ones in Adam\u2019s and Brian\u2019s cases, will ordinarily have the presence of mind to distinguish between an air-powered rifle and a conventional one, any more than they can differentiate between a loaded or unloaded shotgun. There is, as a result, the risk of escalating violence, as such an apparent deadly threat risks a dangerous response from bystanders and police responding to an incident. From the standpoint of public safety, as a result, there is not a dramatic difference between robbing a person with a conventional firearm and an air-powered firearm.\n[99] The ever-present threat to victims and public safety distinguishes this offence from the one at issue in Hills. An essential element of robbery with or without the use of a firearm is the use of actual violence or the threat of violence to a person in the commission of the offence. There is an immediacy to the threat that distinguishes the offence from the hypothetical scenario raised in Hills. The offender must intend to strike fear in the heart of his victim. The offender chose to use a firearm, knowing that he may gain a material benefit due to the universal fear that firearms invoke for the public. In assessing the gravity of the offence, the threat to victims and the public in these scenarios cannot be downplayed or overlooked.\n[100] Moreover, the culpability central to this offence does not profoundly differ from that of s. 344(1)(a)(i) and is consistent for all individuals charged under the offence. In order for s. 344(1)(a.1) to apply, an offender must intend to steal and intend to use violence or force (or the threat thereof). The offender must also intend to use the firearm. As a result, a conscious choice must be made to threaten a person\u2019s safety using a firearm. That is true whether or not the offence is perpetrated using a conventional or air-powered firearm. Like Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, while there are undoubtedly mitigating personal circumstances that reduce an offender\u2019s culpability in Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s scenarios, there remains an essential degree of fault arising from the choice to threaten the safety of others.\n[101] Mr. Zwozdesky nevertheless raises the possibility that parties to the offence may have reduced culpability, citing the example of Link. However, I am not persuaded that Link illustrates the notion that parties to the offence have little moral fault relative to principal offenders. The question of whether an offender\u2019s role as an aider or abettor plays a mitigating factor in sentencing is highly contextual (R. v. Overacker, 2005 ABCA 150, 367 A.R. 250, at paras. 23-26; R. v. Hennessey, 2010 ABCA 274, 490 A.R. 35, at para. 47). A sentencing discount purely because a party was an aider or abettor would go against the purpose of the party liability provisions in s. 21, which ensure an \u201cindividual will bear the same responsibility for the offence regardless of which particular role he or she played\u201d (R. v. Vu, 2012 SCC 40, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 411, at para. 58 (emphasis added), citing R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at pp. 689-90). Where there is a disparity between the criminal records of the principal and the aider or abettor, or where there are aggravating circumstances, like assaultive behaviour, that apply to the principal but not the aider or abettor, then the latter offender\u2019s sentence may be lower than that of the principal (McIvor, at para. 29; R. v. Price (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 54-56). However, both are jointly responsible for the commission of the index offence. As a matter of principle and policy, finding otherwise would encourage offenders to act as aiders or abettors. Thus, the minimum sentence\u2019s mere application to aiders and abettors fails to establish its constitutional infirmity.\n[102] For s. 344(1)(a.1) to apply, an aider or abettor under s. 21(1) must have knowledge or its equivalent in relation to the firearm\u2019s use. As noted, s. 344 is modelled on s. 85 of the Criminal Code . Nothing in the wording of s. 344 implies an intention on the part of Parliament to extend its application to offenders whose culpability was less than required for a conviction under s. 85 . The \u201cusual rules of complicity\u201d for parties under s. 21 apply to s. 85 (Steele, at para. 33; see also McGuigan, at pp. 307-8). Thus, in a scenario like Link, the aider must intend to assist the principal knowing (or at least wilfully blind) that the principal intended to use the firearm in committing the robbery (Briscoe, at paras. 15-18). That is to say, one must consciously choose to provide assistance to the principal with knowledge or its equivalent that a firearm is used. For this reason, the oblivious offender in Link was not subject to the minimum. When this element is made out, I am not persuaded the offender has little culpability. As a party to the offence, the aider benefits from the threat of violence that emanates from the firearm. It offers each party protection and ensures the cooperation of victims, a result that benefits the aider and abettor as much as the principal.\n[103] Moreover, without the contribution of each party, the robbery could not be pulled off at all, a result that supports treating principals and aiders alike. As the English Court of Appeal observed,\nthere is no distinction in a crime of this kind to be drawn [in sentencing] between those who actually use the violence and those who stand outside and though not using violence are ready to drive away, to kidnap, or perform whatever other task may be appropriate. If this Court or a trial judge is dealing with a case of armed robbery of a bank at gunpoint or with iron bars, or of a security van carrying large quantities of notes to a branch of a bank, it does not normally stop to consider whether a particular prisoner actually held up the cashier or held up the guard, had a gun or had an iron bar or was the driver standing outside ready to drive away. All are equally guilty because without each playing his full part the crime could not be perpetrated.\n(R. v. Church (1985), 7 Cr. App. R. (S.) 370, at p. 372)\n[104] Mr. Zwozdesky also relies on the possibility of unplanned robberies. In Brian\u2019s case, for instance, the intention to commit the offence was not formed until the good Samaritan attempted to offer assistance. The degree of planning behind an offence can act as an aggravating factor in sentencing. In Brian\u2019s case, however, the lack of planning cannot be equated with a lack of culpability. The scenario involves the intentional use of force, snatching a purse, and threatening violence while brandishing a BB gun, which the offender opted to carry with him in public. What Brian shares with all other offenders charged under this section is that he saw the opportunity to benefit financially from another person\u2019s fear of firearms and capitalized on it. As a result, the essential element of culpability that I noted above equally applies to Brian. This scenario is, again, an instance where an offender chose to threaten the safety of others using a firearm.\n[105] For these reasons, Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s scenarios do not establish s. 344(1)(a.1) applies in circumstances involving little or no danger to the public or little or no fault. I am not persuaded the distinctions between the lethality of the firearms involved, or the fact of party liability, establish dramatically different degrees of severity in the context of this offence. At bottom, in all these scenarios, in order to steal, an offender makes a conscious choice to place another person at risk of life-altering injury and significant psychological trauma. Like Mr. Hilbach\u2019s offence, they are \u201ctrue crime[s]\u201d.\n[106] The effects of the penalty on the offender are severe. For Indigenous offenders, the effects have the potential to be as severe as the mandatory minimum sentence in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case. These effects, as in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, are significant and can be neither ignored nor minimized. As was noted in Hills, youthful offenders are subject to bullying, are susceptible to gang recruitment and are more vulnerable to segregation placements (para. 165). A term of imprisonment can result in a more severe penalty for an accused with a mental illness than it may for others. Courts have noted that individuals may not have access to appropriate treatment while incarcerated and, for some mentally ill offenders, any period of incarceration may be extremely harmful to their mental state (R. v. Wallace (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 100; R. v. Folino (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at paras. 29-32). The individual circumstances of the hypothetical offenders indicate the period of incarceration required under s. 344(1)(a.1) would likely result in severe detrimental effects.\n[107] An inquiry into the penalty and its objectives reveals the analysis for s. 344(1)(a.1) and s. 344(1)(a)(i) is similar. Parliament chose to impose the strong moral condemnation that a substantial prison sentence signals, which is reasonable given the offenders\u2019 choice to put public safety at risk offends basic moral values. Greater deference to Parliament\u2019s decision to enact the mandatory minimum is therefore warranted. As in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s case, general deterrence has a role, as \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that there is a need for general deterrence\u201d when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm (Morrisey, at para. 46). At the same time, it is true that Parliament\u2019s prioritization of general deterrence departs more seriously from sentencing norms in the case of offenders like Adam, who suffer from mental disorders, because these types of offenders are inappropriate mediums by which to discourage others (Ruby, at \u00a75.316; R. v. Dedeckere, 2017 ONCA 799, 15 M.V.R. (7th) 177, at para. 14; R. v. Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114, 93 O.R. (3d) 643, at para. 38). Even so, ultimately the minimum is not \u201ctotally out of sync\u201d with sentencing norms for this offence, given the sentencing ranges discussed for robbery above. However, as the dissent noted, the mandatory minimum is effectively double what a fit and proportionate sentence would likely be for the hypothetical offenders had the mandatory penalty not applied.\n[108] Nevertheless, as with s. 344(1)(a)(i), the disconnect between the mandatory minimum sentence and the individual circumstances of the offenders here does not render the sentence grossly disproportionate. I echo my comments that the gross disproportionality standard is a high bar that applies in rare instances. If the punishment at bar was being evaluated on the appellate standard, I would find the four\u2011year minimum demonstrably unfit for the reasonable hypotheticals proffered by Mr. Zwozdesky. However, I am not persuaded that the mandatory minimum in this case \u201cshock[s] the conscience\u201d (Lloyd, at para. 33) or is \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; Wiles, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). While the punishment is severe, the high threshold for gross disproportionality is not met here. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the four-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter .\n[109] Having concluded neither mandatory minimum infringes s. 12 of the Charter , it is unnecessary to address whether the infringement may be saved under s. 1 .\nC. Conclusion\n[110] The Crown\u2019s appeal is allowed. The mandatory minimum sentences set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are constitutional and do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments on this ground are set aside. No order is necessary in respect of Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s sentence, owing to his passing.\n[111] In respect of Mr. Hilbach\u2019s sentence, I am of the view that it is appropriate in this case to stay the execution of the post-appeal portion of the sentence. This was the approach taken by the Court of Appeal majority. In rare cases where appellate courts have imposed custodial sentences to comply with mandatory provisions of the Criminal Code , including mandatory minimum sentences, they have stayed the execution of the post-appeal portion of the sentence. A stay for a post-appeal sentence may be available where there is extenuating delay in the legal process, particularly at the appellate stage, through no fault of the offender (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61; R. v. McMillan, 2016 MBCA 12, 326 Man. R. (2d) 56; R. v. Shi, 2015 ONCA 646). Given over four years have lapsed since Mr. Hilbach was sentenced, I am satisfied this is such a case.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\n[112] I agree with my colleague Martin J.\u2019s disposition of the Crown\u2019s appeal. However, for the reasons outlined in my dissent in the companion appeal R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, I respectfully disagree with her new three\u2011part test for gross disproportionality at the second stage of the established framework set out in R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, and recently affirmed in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 63.\n[113] Applying this established legal framework, I agree that the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , do not meet the high threshold for cruel and unusual punishment. While they have the potential to be excessive in reasonably foreseeable cases, they are not so excessive as to \u201coutrage standards of decency\u201d (R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1072) or \u201cshock the conscience of Canadians\u201d (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 33). I would allow the appeal.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nKarakatsanis and Jamal JJ. \u2014\n[114] Mandatory minimum sentences reflect Parliament\u2019s determination that a crime is so serious that it must be met with a minimum punishment, regardless of the particular circumstances of the offence or the offender. When in place, there is no judicial discretion to impose a lesser sentence.\n[115] Mandatory minimum sentences are, however, subject to scrutiny under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which guarantees everyone \u201cthe right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\u201d. They are more constitutionally vulnerable when they apply to an offence that can be committed in various ways, under a broad array of circumstances, and by a wide range of people (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 3). Such provisions will be unconstitutional where they are, or could be on a reasonably foreseeable basis, grossly disproportionate to what would otherwise be a fit sentence in the circumstances.\n[116] Between this appeal and its companion case, R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, three mandatory minimum sentences are at issue. We agree with the reasons of our colleague Justice Martin in Hills. Section 244.2(3) (b) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which imposes a four-year mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted of intentionally discharging a firearm into or at a place, contrary to s. 244.2(1) (a), violates s. 12 of the Charter and has not been justified under s. 1 .\n[117] We part company, however, with our colleague\u2019s conclusion on the constitutionality of the provisions at issue in this appeal: s. 344(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , which imposes a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for a first offence of robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm; and s. 344(1) (a.1 ) of the Criminal Code , which imposes a four-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offence of robbery with a firearm. We note that Parliament recently repealed s. 344(1) (a.1 ) (An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15).\n[118] Armed robbery is a grave offence that typically warrants a penitentiary sentence. But in our view, the mandatory minimum sentences under both provisions cast an unconstitutionally wide net, capturing reasonably foreseeable cases for which the mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate. For these cases, the mandatory minimum sentences are \u201cso excessive as to outrage standards of decency\u201d (Lloyd, at paras. 24 and 87, citing Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, at p. 688, per Laskin C.J.), violating the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Charter . They cannot be saved under s. 1 , and therefore should be declared of no force and effect.\n[119] We would, accordingly, dismiss the Crown\u2019s appeal.\nI. Background\nA. Ocean William Storm Hilbach\n[120] Mr. Hilbach is an Indigenous man from the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Nineteen years old and without the money to travel from the city to his reserve, he and his 13-year-old accomplice robbed a convenience store with an unloaded sawed-off rifle. Mr. Hilbach covered his face with his shirt and pointed the gun at two store clerks, demanding cash. His accomplice punched one of the store clerks, and kicked the other. They fled with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended soon afterwards.\n[121] Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery while using a prohibited or restricted weapon (s. 344(1)(a)) and possession of a firearm while prohibited (s. 117.01(1)). The sentencing judge held that a fit and proper sentence for Mr. Hilbach was two years less a day. He concluded that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s circumstances, contrary to s. 12 of the Charter , because it was more than double the length of a fit sentence and it would be served in a federal rather than provincial institution. Accordingly, he declared the provision of no force and effect (2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359).\n[122] The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal in part. It held that the sentence imposed on Mr. Hilbach was unfit and substituted a sentence of three years for the robbery charge. But the court still concluded that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate for Mr. Hilbach, breaching s. 12. It could not be saved under s. 1 and was thus declared of no force and effect (2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245).\nB. Curtis Zwozdesky\n[123] At the time of the offence, Mr. Zwozdesky was 53 years old, unemployed, and struggling with drug addiction. He was the \u201cgetaway driver\u201d for two robberies of rural convenience stores in Alberta. During the first robbery, he went inside the convenience store before returning to his car. Shortly after, his accomplices went inside with a modified shotgun. An accomplice pointed the gun at the clerk, demanded she fill a bag with money, and fired the shotgun into a shelf. No one was injured. The next robbery occurred a week later. Mr. Zwozdesky waited in the car as the two principal offenders went inside the store, brandished a shotgun, and sprayed a clerk with pepper spray before leaving, cash and cigarettes in hand.\n[124] Mr. Zwozdesky confessed to the police and entered a guilty plea to one count of robbery with a firearm (s. 344(1)(a.1)), and one count of robbery simpliciter (s. 344(1)(b)).\n[125] The sentencing judge concluded that the four-year sentence mandated by s. 344(1)(a.1) would not be grossly disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky. However, in considering other reasonably foreseeable applications of the law, she observed that armed robbery can occur in a wide variety of circumstances, including by youthful offenders acting impulsively, offenders with mental health issues, and offenders who played a more peripheral role in the offence. Reasoning that the mandatory minimum sentence could constitute cruel and unusual punishment for reasonably foreseeable offenders, and that it could not be saved under s. 1, she declared s. 344(1)(a.1) of no force and effect (2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386).\n[126] The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed that s. 344(1)(a.1) could result in grossly disproportionate punishments and dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal.\nII. Analysis\n[127] Mr. Hilbach challenged the mandatory five-year sentence for robbery with a prohibited or restricted firearm (s. 344(1)(a)(i)), while Mr. Zwozdesky challenged the mandatory four-year sentence for robbery with a non-restricted firearm (s. 344(1)(a.1)). In our view, both provisions violate s. 12 of the Charter . In evaluating whether a mandatory minimum sentence infringes s. 12 of the Charter , a court engages in a two\u2011step inquiry (Hills, at para. 40).\n[128] First, the court must determine what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code , including the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1 : \u201cA sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\u201d In assessing an offence\u2019s gravity, courts may consider the consequences of the offender\u2019s actions on victims and public safety, the harm caused by the offence, and, in some cases, the offender\u2019s motivations (Hills, at para. 58). In assessing the degree of responsibility of the offender, a court should gauge \u201cthe essential substantive elements of the offence including the offence\u2019s mens rea, the offender\u2019s conduct in the commission of the offence, the offender\u2019s motive for committing the offence, and aspects of the offender\u2019s background that increase or decrease the offender\u2019s individual responsibility for the crime, including the offender\u2019s personal circumstances and mental capacity\u201d (Hills, at para. 58, citing R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 91; R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 68; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 73).\n[129] Second, the court must ask whether the mandatory minimum requires the judge to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the otherwise fit sentence. In considering whether the mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, a court must assess \u201cthree crucial components\u201d: (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects on the offender, \u201cboth generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities\u201d; and (3) the penalty and the balance struck by its objectives (Hills, at paras. 122-38).\n[130] If the court concludes that a sentence is not grossly disproportionate for the offender in question, the court must then consider whether it would be grossly disproportionate in other reasonably foreseeable cases (R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 65).\n[131] In applying this framework, neither s. 344(1)(a)(i) nor s. 344(1)(a.1) pass constitutional scrutiny. The sentencing judge correctly considered the facts, case law, and relevant sentencing objectives to determine that two years less a day was a fit and proportionate sentence in Mr. Hilbach\u2019s circumstances. This determination is owed deference. In assessing a fit sentence, courts must not indiscriminately adhere to starting points, completely eliminate the prospect of rehabilitation, or distort the gravity of the offence by dismissing relevant facts (such as whether a firearm was loaded). Moreover, whether a fit sentence is two years or \u2014 as our colleague concludes \u2014 three years, a sentence that is double or nearly double a fit sentence is grossly disproportionate in violation of s. 12 of the Charter .\n[132] The mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1) is also grossly disproportionate. It is unconstitutionally broad and foreseeably applies to a wide range of situations, including those where the offender may be young, substance dependent, assisting the principal offender, or using a firearm like a BB gun. Applying the mandatory minimum sentence in some of these situations would be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and thus would be unconstitutional (see Lloyd, at paras. 24 and 87).\n[133] Neither provision can be saved under s. 1.\n[134] We address each provision in turn.\nA. Section 344(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code\n[135] Section 344(1)(a)(i) applies when the offender commits robbery using a restricted or prohibited firearm. This appeal raises the question of whether the five-year sentence is grossly disproportionate for Mr. Hilbach or another reasonably foreseeable offender. We agree with both courts below and conclude that it would be for Mr. Hilbach. It is therefore unnecessary to consider other reasonably foreseeable applications of the law.\n[136] We turn, then, to address a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach. Although both courts below agreed that a mandatory five-year sentence was grossly disproportionate in light of the fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach, they disagreed on what would be a fit sentence. The sentencing judge concluded two years less a day was fit, with reference to the three-year starting point for convenience store robberies in R. v. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183 (C.A.), at para. 19; while the Court of Appeal concluded that three years was fit, placing more emphasis on denunciation and deterrence. As we will explain, we see no reason to disturb the sentencing judge\u2019s assessment.\n[137] The seriousness of the crime is evident from the circumstances, a fact not lost on the sentencing judge. He noted that Mr. Hilbach committed a \u201cserious violent offence\u201d with \u201cthe potential for great harm\u201d, which would have a lasting impact on the victims and the community more broadly (para. 9). He also recognized that Mr. Hilbach\u2019s prior criminal record and the breaches of his probation and firearm prohibition were serious aggravating factors on his sentence (paras. 10 and 12-13). These features made denunciation and deterrence \u201cimportant considerations\u201d (para. 20).\n[138] The sentencing judge balanced these considerations against Mr. Hilbach\u2019s tragic personal circumstances. Abandoned by his parents as an infant, Mr. Hilbach was raised by his paternal grandparents, both residential school survivors. His childhood and adolescence were marked by poverty, a fractured family unit, physical abuse, and substance dependency. These circumstances shaped Mr. Hilbach\u2019s course in life, and this crime was no different. For instance, Mr. Hilbach\u2019s conduct was driven by poverty \u2014 he needed money to get home to his reserve but had none (para. 35). As the sentencing judge observed, \u201chis personal, family and community history played a role in his actions that day\u201d (para. 35).\n[139] These circumstances are precisely the kind of background or systemic factors that this Court has recognized as having a mitigating effect in sentencing (Ipeelee, at para. 73; R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688). Endemic poverty on reserves, intimately tied to the legacy of colonialism, is a common cause of crime for Indigenous peoples (Gladue, at para. 65). As the number of Indigenous offenders behind bars in Canada continues to soar, it is imperative that sentencing judges appropriately consider the unique social issues facing Indigenous peoples in Canada (see R. Mangat, More Than We Can Afford: The Costs of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing (2014), at pp. 30-34; I.F., Canadian Bar Association, at para. 24). The sentencing judge did not err in doing so.\n[140] The sentencing judge also correctly considered the effect of the sentence on the offender and concluded that \u201cany period of incarceration will have a profound impact on Mr. Hilbach\u201d due to his youth and history of gang affiliation (para. 14). A five-year penitentiary sentence, in other words, would undermine Mr. Hilbach\u2019s rehabilitation, with counterproductive implications for public safety down the line. Although rehabilitation is not a principle of fundamental justice, removing it altogether from consideration can result in gross disproportionality. As this Court unanimously held in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, \u201c[t]o ensure respect for human dignity\u201d \u2014 and therefore compliance with s. 12 of the Charter \u2014 \u201cParliament must leave a door open for rehabilitation, even in cases where this objective is of minimal importance\u201d (para. 85). When a mandatory minimum compromises, rather than advances, the prospect of rehabilitation \u2014 as the sentencing judge found here \u2014 the result is a penalty unmoored from a basic tenet of our criminal justice system: respect for the inherent dignity of every individual (Bissonnette, at paras. 87-88). And quite simply, it shocks the conscience to send a youthful Indigenous offender to prison for five years when, according to the sentencing judge, doing so would harm both the offender and society (paras. 14 and 21).\n[141] The Court of Appeal, however, concluded that the sentencing judge had erred in principle in failing to give sufficient weight to denunciation and deterrence and by overemphasizing Gladue factors (para. 49). The court concluded that an appropriate sentence was three years when appropriate weight was ascribed to those factors (para. 50).\n[142] However, \u201can appellate court may not intervene simply because it would have weighed the relevant factors differently\u201d (R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 49; see also Lloyd, at paras. 52-53). We agree that denunciation and deterrence are important considerations, but there is no reason to interfere with the sentencing judge\u2019s conclusion that a two-year prison sentence for a first-time offender would serve those objectives. Indeed, as this Court observed in Bissonnette, \u201cthe objectives of denunciation and deterrence are not better served by the imposition of excessive sentences\u201d (para. 94). Moreover, this Court recognized in Boudreault that denunciation and deterrence should not be elevated over the principle of proportionality, the objective of rehabilitation, and Parliament\u2019s intent to ameliorate the overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prison under s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code (paras. 81-83). We would defer to the discretion of the sentencing judge as to which sentencing objectives in s. 718 (such as denunciation, deterrence, and rehabilitation) to prioritize \u2014 and how much weight to afford to the secondary sentencing principles in s. 718.2 (such as parity and restraint) (Lacasse, at paras. 54\u201155). We are not persuaded that he erred in exercising that discretion.\n[143] Our colleague disagrees. She accepts that three years, or higher, would be fit and concludes that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence that was a full year below the starting point for offences of this nature (paras. 50-51). But starting points do not answer the key question at this first stage, which is, in our colleague\u2019s words: \u201c. . . what specifically is the fit sentence for this individual offender?\u201d (Hills, at para. 64). And starting points are tools, not straitjackets (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 37; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 36-37; Lacasse, at para. 57). Deviation from a starting point \u2014 \u201cno matter the degree of deviation\u201d \u2014 does not in itself justify appellate intervention (Parranto, at para. 29). By defaulting to the starting point in Johnas, our colleague\u2019s approach departs from the recent jurisprudence of this Court in Parranto, Friesen, and Lacasse.\n[144] Our colleague also notes that the \u201cuse of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offence\u2019s gravity\u201d (para. 55). While the use of an unloaded firearm may not substantially reduce an offence\u2019s gravity \u2014 because either weapon inspires fear and is used for coercion \u2014 the two situations are not equivalent in terms of gravity or moral culpability. The use of an unloaded firearm necessarily poses a much lower risk to public safety. It is far more blameworthy to enter public spaces with a loaded gun, as this suggests an intention to resort to lethal force if necessary. The two situations, for the purpose of sentencing, cannot be equated.\n[145] Even if our colleague and the Court of Appeal were correct and a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach were three years in jail, we would still conclude, as did the Court of Appeal, that a sentence of five years was grossly disproportionate (para. 54). Our colleague\u2019s conclusion otherwise is, with respect, untenable. It is hard to fathom how a sentence nearly double the amount of a proportionate sentence would not shock the conscience of Canadians. This does not accord with a purposive reading of s. 12, nor is it alive to the profound consequences of any incarceration on an offender\u2019s life and liberty, let alone the secondary impacts on the offender and the offender\u2019s family.\n[146] Ultimately, we would not disturb the determination that a five-year penitentiary sentence would be grossly disproportionate in the circumstances. Since the mandatory minimum would be unconstitutional for Mr. Hilbach, it is unnecessary to consider reasonably foreseeable applications of the law.\nB. Section 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code\n[147] The four-year mandatory minimum under s. 344(1)(a.1) applies if an offender commits robbery using a non-restricted or non-prohibited firearm. Before the Court of Appeal and this Court, Mr. Zwozdesky concedes that a four-year sentence was fit in his case. The question, then, is whether a four-year sentence is grossly disproportionate in other reasonably foreseeable cases. We conclude that it is.\n[148] A four-year sentence reaches beyond the classic instance of robbery with a firearm and captures less egregious conduct. Section 344(1)(a.1) requires the offender to \u201cuse\u201d the firearm during the offence. In R. v. Steele, 2007 SCC 36, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 3, this Court observed that the term \u201cuse\u201d, in the context of other firearm offences, has been interpreted to include a wide range of behaviour including discharging the firearm, pointing the firearm, or even just revealing with words that a firearm is present (para. 27). To be \u201cused\u201d, the firearm need not have accessible ammunition (R. v. Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725, at p. 730), nor does it have to be in the offender\u2019s physical possession if it is readily at hand (Steele, at para. 32).\n[149] And not all firearms are highly regulated weapons. The definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d captures any barrelled, projectile-firing device that can rupture an eye, which is the standard for determining whether the firearm can cause serious bodily injury or death (R. v. Dunn, 2013 ONCA 539, 117 O.R. (3d) 171, at para. 40, aff\u2019d 2014 SCC 69, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 490). This includes firearms \u2014 like BB guns, paintball guns, or even nail guns \u2014 that can be obtained with relative ease at local commercial outlets.\n[150] Thus, while the objective gravity of robbery with a firearm is always serious, the gravity of the particular offence committed \u2014 which depends on the circumstances surrounding the offence \u2014 varies considerably (see Friesen, at para. 96). For instance, just as s. 344(1)(a.1) captures offenders brandishing shotguns who invade a home and steal from its occupants (R. v. Matwiy (1996), 178 A.R. 356 (C.A.)), it would also capture an offender who snatches a purse from a stranger while armed with a BB gun (C.A. reasons, at para. 64; see also R. v. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266).\n[151] Further, a wide range of people commit armed robberies. At one end of the spectrum stands the seasoned criminal, who, motivated by greed and contempt, serially orchestrates sophisticated robbery heists undeterred by criminal sanction. At the other end of the spectrum stands the first-time offender with a tragic upbringing, who, fuelled by drug addiction, turns to robbery once to satisfy his need for a quick fix, and then successfully rehabilitates before sentencing. A four-year penitentiary sentence may be proportionate, or even lenient, in the former example, but may well be grossly disproportionate in the latter.\n[152] Considering such personal characteristics and circumstances sheds light on the reasonably foreseeable scope of the law (Hills, at paras. 58-61). It reflects the inherently individualized nature of sentencing and how proportionality involves an assessment of both the gravity of the offence and the blameworthiness of the offender (Nur, at para. 43).\n[153] Such an approach also reflects common sense. Given the vast overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in our justice system, for example, cases involving such offenders are, as a matter of logic, reasonably foreseeable (Hills, at paras. 86-87). Indeed, mandatory minimum sentences disproportionately impact Indigenous offenders (Mangat, at pp. 30-34). Similarly, offenders who are poor, precariously housed, substance dependent, mentally ill, or disabled \u201cappear with staggering regularity in our provincial courts\u201d (Boudreault, at paras. 49-55). Consideration of these personal characteristics can ensure s. 12 of the Charter responds to the everyday composition of offenders in the criminal justice system (I.F., Canadian Bar Association, at para. 24).\n[154] That said, the types of foreseeable offenders a court may consider must not be stretched beyond reason to create far-fetched examples (Nur, at paras. 73-76). Extremely detailed hypotheticals, like those advanced by Mr. Zwozdesky, are ultimately unhelpful for this reason. Laws should not be set aside based on speculation. But so long as such examples are reasonable, this inquiry is central to the analysis: testing the reasonably foreseeable scope of a given punishment ensures that no individual is subject to an unconstitutional law, which in turn, allows s. 12 to be faithful to its purpose.\n[155] Mr. Hilbach\u2019s circumstances provide a reasonable hypothetical example. His conviction under s. 344(1)(a)(i) is more serious because it involved a prohibited firearm. But even then, the sentencing judge\u2019s conclusion was that a fit sentence would have been two years less a day \u2014 half of the mandatory four-year sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1), which would be served in a federal penitentiary. Even were we to accept our colleague and the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that three years would have been fit, it follows that Mr. Hilbach should have received a lesser sentence had he used a non\u2011prohibited firearm and been convicted under s. 344(1)(a.1). While the court \u201cneed not fix the sentence or sentencing range at a specific point, particularly for a reasonable hypothetical case framed at a high level of generality\u201d, it is helpful for the court to \u201cconsider, even implicitly, the rough scale of the appropriate sentence\u201d (Lloyd, at para. 23). At most, a reformatory term would have been fit if Mr. Hilbach had committed his crime with a non-prohibited firearm. It follows that a four-year mandatory minimum would be more than merely excessive in the circumstances.\n[156] Additionally, it is not uncommon for crimes, like robbery, to be committed by more than one offender \u2014 one need only consider, for instance, the \u201cgetaway driver\u201d (as in this case) or the \u201clookout\u201d. And because \u201cCanadian criminal law does not distinguish between the principal offender and parties to an offence in determining criminal liability\u201d (R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 13), someone who assists or encourages the principal offender is guilty of the same offence and faces the same mandatory minimum sentence. This is so even if their assistance or encouragement was not preplanned or significant.\n[157] Aiders and abetters may not automatically be entitled to a sentencing discount. But just because a party is criminally liable for the same offence as a principal offender does not mean they deserve the same sentence. As always, what constitutes a proportionate sentence will depend on the circumstances (Hills, at para. 58), most notably the offender\u2019s degree of participation. Considering this context in sentencing does not undermine the party liability provisions, nor incite offenders to assist or encourage crime. Rather, it reflects the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1: a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\n[158] The Court of Appeal in Hilbach points out that secondary liability dramatically expands the scope of the offence even more, and further reveals that s. 344(1)(a.1) is constitutionally infirm (paras. 61 and 68). We agree that R. v. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, is illustrative.\n[159] Ms. Link, an Indigenous woman, was barely 18 years old and had no prior criminal record when she agreed to participate in a convenience store robbery. Her battle with drug and alcohol addiction began at age 13, and led her to become enmeshed in a \u201cdestructive set of friends\u201d (para. 32). At the time of the offence, she was homeless and in her words \u201cstealing to survive\u201d (para. 53). Unbeknownst to Ms. Link, her accomplice had an imitation handgun in his possession, which he pointed at a clerk during the robbery. She continued to stuff cartons of cigarettes into her bag after the gun was produced. The clerk described her as an \u201caccomplice maybe?\u201d and \u201cflustered, not really involved\u201d (para. 15). She was cooperative with police, remorseful, and turned her life around after the incident. The sentencing judge imposed an eight\u2011month conditional sentence order.\n[160] The Crown argues that Link is not a reasonably foreseeable application of the law: s. 344(1)(a.1) did not apply because an imitation handgun is not a \u201cfirearm\u201d, and Ms. Link did not know her accomplice had the firearm on his person before the robbery. In our view, this argument misses the mark. The issue is whether the characteristics of the offender and their conduct can assist the court in its inquiry into reasonably foreseeable circumstances. While certain aggravating elements may have been missing in Ms. Link\u2019s circumstances, we agree that the sentence imposed in Ms. Link\u2019s case illuminates the nature of the offence of armed robbery, its broad sentencing range, and the kinds of people who commit it.\n[161] Whether or not the mens rea could have been established, or whether a handgun is real or an imitation, the circumstances of Link are not far-fetched. And the difference between an imitation handgun and a real handgun cannot account for the wide gulf between an eight-month sentence served in the community and a four-year penitentiary sentence. Ms. Link\u2019s example is further demonstration that a reformatory sentence \u2014 if not less \u2014 could be a proportionate sanction under s. 344(1)(a.1). Four years in a federal institution would be grossly disproportionate in comparison.\n[162] Given the breadth of the definition of a firearm (including BB guns, paintball guns, and nail guns), the range of conduct captured by the offence (including the degree and nature of involvement in the crime, the level of violence, and the level of sophistication), as well as the prevalence of important, often intersecting, personal circumstances (including Indigeneity, youth, substance dependency, and rehabilitation efforts), it is reasonably foreseeable that a four-year penitentiary sentence would be a grossly disproportionate sentence for some offenders.\n[163] As a result, based on the reasonably foreseeable application of the law, we agree with the courts below that the mandatory minimum in s. 344(1)(a.1) contravenes s. 12 of the Charter .\nC. Section 1\n[164] The Crown does not advance any argument on s. 1 of the Charter and therefore has not discharged its burden of justifying the s. 12 infringement. The provisions cannot be saved under s. 1 .\nIII. Disposition\n[165] We would thus declare ss. 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 . We would dismiss the Crown\u2019s appeal and maintain the orders of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed, Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent Ocean William Storm Hilbach: Moreau & Company, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office \u2014 Criminal, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Regina.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Stockwoods, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Bar Association: Peck and Company, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Vancouver.\n"

By virtue of his position, he held diplomatic immunity. Following the discovery by another member of the CAF posted in Washington of two audio recording devices in her residence, the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (\u201cCFNIS\u201d) investigated the matter and concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe M had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications. CFNIS sought the assistance of the Alexandria police for the purpose of obtaining a warrant under Virginia law. The Canadian Embassy waived M\u2019s immunity with respect to his residence and property and the Alexandria police obtained a warrant to search his residence and objects found therein, including electronic devices, and to analyze the seized items.\nWhen CFNIS and Alexandria police executed the search warrant, forensic investigators scanned the contents of some electronic devices found in M\u2019s residence to determine which items to seize. They discovered evidence relating to unforeseen offences, including a sexual assault. The investigators seized the devices, removed them to Canada, and obtained Canadian warrants from the Court Martial for further analysis of their contents. M was arrested. He brought a motion in the Court Martial, arguing that the search and seizure of his electronic devices contravened s. 8 of the Charter , and seeking exclusion of the evidence. The military judge dismissed the motion, holding that the Charter did not apply extraterritorially, and that, in any event, the search and seizure were consistent with Charter standards. He subsequently convicted M of voyeurism, possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual assault, and disgraceful conduct. The Court Martial Appeal Court affirmed the military judge\u2019s decision. It agreed that the Charter did not apply, and held that the evidence did not affect trial fairness at common law. It further concluded that even if the Charter applied, the search did not infringe M\u2019s s. 8 rights.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: CFNIS did not infringe M\u2019s rights under s. 8 of the Charter . There is no need to consider the extraterritorial applicability of the Charter .\nA search is reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable. Digital searches involve unique and heightened privacy interests in personal data. A presumptive requirement of specific, prior authorization applies to digital searches of electronic devices that store personal data.\nIn the instant case, authorization to gain entry into and search M\u2019s residence and property could be granted only by a local magistrate under the law of Virginia. CFNIS communicated with local authorities and availed itself of the only legal mechanism open to it: it first obtained a waiver of the inviolability of M\u2019s private residence and property from the Canadian Embassy, and the Alexandria police then obtained a search warrant from a local magistrate. The Virginia warrant meets the requirement for specific, prior authorization for digital searches, and it expressly authorized the search and analysis of the electronic devices found in M\u2019s residence. There were grounds to search the electronic devices as they could reasonably be expected to contain evidence of the voyeurism offence. The search of M\u2019s devices was authorized by law.\nFurthermore, the search was reasonable pursuant to Charter standards. It was not more intrusive than necessary. The warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences, but the unforeseen evidence was discovered in the process of triaging electronic devices at the scene, as was expressly authorized by the warrant. Seizing the incriminating devices and obtaining Canadian warrants before further analyzing their contents was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter . The plain view doctrine applies to the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault. This doctrine requires that the police officers must have a legitimate prior justification for intrusion into the place where the seizure occurred and that the evidence must be in plain view in that it is immediately obvious and discovered inadvertently. Both requirements are satisfied in the present case. The investigators had a legitimate justification for their inspection of the files containing evidence of sexual assault. The files were discovered while looking for the types of files specifically sought and authorized. In addition, the files were in plain view, given their inadvertent discovery and immediately apparent unlawfulness. Devices containing these files were set aside for seizure and further analysis back in Canada and there was no need to closely examine the files to ascertain their incriminating nature. The application of the plain view doctrine is necessary because the police had no other basis to justify seizing the sexual assault evidence.\nThe scope of application of the Charter is delineated in s. 32(1) . The Court\u2019s decision in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter under s. 32(1) . The interveners invited the Court to decide whether Hape should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled, and drew on academic criticism of the Hape framework. This is not an appropriate case in which to reconsider the extraterritorial application of the Charter . First, the parties simply debate Hape\u2019s application to the facts at hand. The Court should not overrule a precedent without having been asked to do so by a party. Second, reconsidering Hape would make no difference to the outcome of the appeal. Third, academic criticism is not a sufficient reason not to apply the principles of stare decisis. Therefore, it is preferable to leave for another day any reconsideration of the Hape framework.\nPer Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.: There is agreement that the appeal should be dismissed. CFNIS did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter and the evidence is admissible.\nThe extraterritorial application of the Charter is squarely before the Court and it is an issue that arises infrequently, may easily escape judicial review, and has been subject to significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law. It was clearly the primary and threshold issue argued by the parties and multiple interveners, it was the reason leave to appeal was sought, and the Court received full submissions on both constitutional and international law. Accordingly, it is appropriate to comment on the central question at issue: whether the Charter applies, pursuant to s. 32 , to Canadian authorities\u2019 investigative actions abroad in M\u2019s circumstances.\nA purposive reading of s. 32(1) of the Charter supports the conclusion that the Charter applies extraterritorially to the conduct of CFNIS officials while fulfilling their investigative duties in a foreign state and that a Canadian court may assess that conduct for Charter compliance. It is well\u2011established that the interpretation of the Charter should be purposive, generous, and aimed at securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter \u2019s protections. The Charter\u2019s text and purpose support extraterritorial application. Nothing in s. 32 imposes or suggests any territorial limitation. It expressly limits to whom and to what the Charter applies but not where the Charter applies. Limiting the Charter \u2019s scope to all matters within the authority of Parliament and the legislatures does not implicitly impose a territorial limit. Those words merely reference the division of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 . Section 32(1) \u2019s silence as to the Charter \u2019s territorial boundaries was a deliberate choice which must be respected. If s. 32(1) were meant to distinguish between acts of state actors on Canadian soil or abroad, such a distinction could have easily been drawn expressly, as was done elsewhere in the Charter . The purpose of s. 32 was to constrain government action and to permit state action abroad that is not constrained by the Constitution would be inconsistent with Canada\u2019s constitutional structure, which is premised on preventing arbitrary state conduct.\nThe majority in Hape likewise concluded that s. 32 contained no express territorial limit, but, looking to prohibitive rules of customary international law, concluded that the Charter generally could not be applied to the actions of Canadian officials conducted as part of an investigation occurring abroad. This aspect of Hape has been the subject of significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law. Three main flaws in Hape have been identified: (1) Hape applied improper interpretive principles, including jurisdictional principles of international law and a principle of statutory interpretation, to its interpretation of s. 32(1); (2) Hape mischaracterized the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction; and (3) Hape\u2019s three exceptions are inadequate. These are significant concerns. They go to the core of the Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the Charter , to the practical implications of its application, and to the ensuing lack of consistency and predictability of this area of the law. Though the decision in Hape remains important in many respects, these concerns leave Hape\u2019s framework for the extraterritorial application of the Charter ripe for reconsideration. However, given the majority\u2019s decision not to address it, the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided should be left to another day.\nThe Court\u2019s rules and guidance to the profession place certain limits upon what interveners may argue but those limits were not exceeded in this case. Moreover, any limitation on the role of interveners in no way limits the jurisdiction of the Court to decide issues in a manner other than that proposed by the parties. The role of the Court, as an apex court, is oriented to the development of the jurisprudence by dealing with questions of public importance, and much of the Court\u2019s work necessarily goes beyond what is essential for the disposition of the particular case. While interveners must not introduce new issues, the role of interveners is to provide their own view of the legal issues by providing useful and different submissions, thus bringing broader perspectives before the Court to help the Court fulfill its institutional role. Several interveners in this case did precisely that when they asked the Court to revisit Hape: they proposed a different view of the core legal issue of whether the Charter applied to the conduct of the CFNIS officers.\nAssuming that, pursuant to s. 32(1) , the Charter applied to the conduct of the officers during their investigation, M\u2019s s. 8 rights were not infringed. A search is reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law is reasonable, and if the search is conducted reasonably; in addition, specific prior authorization is required to search computers. Those requirements are met in the instant case. The warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate specifically authorized the search of computers and electronic devices and M\u2019s diplomatic immunity was waived. The law that authorized the search was reasonable in light of Charter standards and the search was conducted reasonably, as the warrant expressly authorized the process of triaging the electronic devices at the scene.\nApplying the plain view doctrine is not necessary in the present case. This doctrine permits seizure without a warrant but M did not dispute seizure; rather, he argued that the search breached s. 8. The investigators did not intentionally search for files beyond the scope of what the warrant authorized. When they discovered that the devices contained evidence of other offences, they set those devices aside for seizure and further analysis after obtaining a Canadian warrant and they continued their search for evidence of voyeurism, as permitted by the warrant. Discovering evidence of an unrelated offence did not require them to entirely cease their search as to what the warrant authorized them to search for. The Court need not and should not decide in this case the complex question of when a particular file on a device is seized, as opposed to when the device itself is seized; neither M nor any of the interveners made any submissions on this issue. Moreover, the assumption that the sexual assault files were seized when they were initially seen by police is highly questionable. For the purposes of the instant case, it is sufficient that the initial triage and seizure of the laptop containing the sexual assault evidence was justified by the Virginia warrant and the subsequent search and seizure of its files was justified by the Canadian warrant. The investigators\u2019 conduct did not exceed the bounds of prior judicial authorization and the plain view doctrine need not be relied upon.\nPer Rowe J.: There is agreement with the entirety of C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.\u2019s analysis. There is disagreement, however, with Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.\u2019s approach to Hape, which goes beyond the issues raised by the parties and seeks, effectively, to overturn Hape at the invitation of interveners. The parties disputed whether the Charter applies in the instant case, assuming the application of Hape as precedent. No party challenged Hape. Rather, they sought to apply it, and its exceptions, to the facts of their dispute. Both lower courts treated this case as an unremarkable application of the Hape framework. The issue of whether Hape should continue to govern was not before the lower courts, nor is it before the Court.\nThe purpose of an intervention is to present the Court with submissions which are useful and different based on the intervener\u2019s experience and expertise. Interveners provide additional perspectives on the legal issues raised by the parties and on the broader implications of the Court\u2019s decision. Interveners can often make important contributions. In order to do so, interveners must operate within recognized limits. These constraints reflect a sound understanding of the interveners\u2019 place within the litigation and of the role of the Court. The parties control their case and decide which issues to raise. Interveners should not take a position on the outcome of the appeal; they must not raise new issues or widen or add to the points in issue; and they must not adduce further evidence or otherwise supplement the record without leave.\nInterveners who stray beyond their proper role cause prejudice to the parties by usurping control of the litigation. The potential for inaccuracy increases where interveners invite the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions or a full evidentiary record. Improper interventions undermine the leave to appeal process, which is based on careful consideration of the existing record and the issues raised by the parties. Finally, when interveners expand the issues, would\u2011be interveners who decided not to intervene are deprived of the opportunity to present their perspectives to the Court.\nRaising the new issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is an improper intervention. It undercuts the parties\u2019 control of their litigation and runs contrary to their submissions. It undermines the leave to appeal process and excludes would\u2011be interveners. It invites the Court to reason in the abstract. Whether Hape should continue to govern is not before the Court and to revisit Hape as precedent in this case exacerbates the harms created by improper interventions and undermines the limits that preclude the introduction of new issues.\nCases Cited\nBy C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.\nReferred to: R. v.

Overview\n[1] This appeal arises from a criminal investigation conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (\u201cCFNIS\u201d) in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. The subject of the investigation, Cpl. McGregor, argues that the search and seizure of his electronic devices contravened s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and he seeks to exclude the evidence obtained from them.\n[2] In the Court Martial, Cpl. McGregor brought a motion to exclude the impugned evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter . He was unsuccessful. The military judge convicted him on counts of voyeurism, possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual assault, and disgraceful conduct. That decision was affirmed by the Court Martial Appeal Court.\n[3] In this appeal, the Court is invited to examine the extraterritorial application of the Charter pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter . Both parties rely on this Court\u2019s decision in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, which is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter . Cpl. McGregor takes the position that the Charter applied to the actions of the CFNIS, whereas the Crown argues that Hape dictates the opposite outcome. For their part, the interveners have focused their submissions on whether the Hape framework should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled.\n[4] In the final analysis, I find it unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality to dispose of this appeal. This is so because the CFNIS did not violate the Charter . Working within the constraints of its authority in Virginia, the CFNIS sought the cooperation of local authorities to obtain and execute a warrant under Virginia law. The warrant which issued authorized the search, seizure, and analysis of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s electronic devices expressly. The evidence of sexual assault was discovered inadvertently by the investigators in the process of triaging the devices at the scene of the search; its incriminating nature was immediately apparent. Although the warrant did not contemplate such evidence, the digital files in issue fell squarely within the purview of the plain view doctrine. Furthermore, the CFNIS obtained Canadian warrants before conducting an in\u2011depth analysis of these devices. It is difficult to see how the CFNIS investigators could have acted differently to attain their legitimate investigative objectives. I conclude that they did not infringe Cpl. McGregor\u2019s rights under s. 8 of the Charter .\n[5] This is not the right case for any reconsideration of the Hape framework. In light of my conclusion that the actions of the CFNIS conformed to the Charter , reconsidering Hape would make no difference to the outcome of this appeal. Furthermore, the parties have not asked this Court to reconsider Hape, but rather, as noted above, have based their submissions on how it should apply to the facts of this case. Therefore, I do not decide below whether the Charter applies in this case; instead, I show that even if it were to apply, I would still dismiss the appeal.\nII. Background\n[6] Between August 2015 and March 2017, Cpl. McGregor was a non\u2011commissioned member of the regular Canadian Armed Forces posted to the Canadian Defence Liaison Staff at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. By virtue of his position in the United States, Cpl. McGregor held diplomatic agent status with immunity in respect of his person, property, and residence pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Can. T.S. 1966 No. 29.\n[7] In 2017, another member of the Canadian Armed Forces posted in Washington, D.C., discovered two audio recording devices in her residence. She believed that Cpl. McGregor had placed them there, and she reported the discovery to her chain of command. Upon investigating the matter, the CFNIS concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe Cpl. McGregor had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications.\n[8] The Commanding Officer could not issue a warrant under s. 273.3 of the National Defence Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. N\u20115 , to authorize the search of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence, as it was not located on the property of the Canadian Armed Forces. M.CPl. Patridge, the lead CFNIS investigator, sought the assistance of the Alexandria Police Department for the purpose of obtaining a warrant under Virginia law authorizing the search of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence in Alexandria.\n[9] The Alexandria Police Department advised the CFNIS that it could not apply for a warrant due to Cpl. McGregor\u2019s diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention. This led to the issuance of a diplomatic note to the American Department of State, in which the Canadian Embassy acknowledged that the \u201cCFNIS is cooperating with local authorities in Virginia and would like to seek a search warrant to enter Corporal McGregor\u2019s staff quarters in the company of local police to obtain evidence for the purposes of their investigation\u201d (A.R., vol. I, at p. 128). In the note, the Embassy waived Cpl. McGregor\u2019s immunity with respect to his \u201cprivate residence, as well as his papers, correspondence and property\u201d, pursuant to Article 30 of the Vienna Convention, but it expressly retained his \u201cpersonal inviolability and immunity from arrest or detention\u201d (p. 128).\n[10] With the waiver of diplomatic immunity in hand, the Alexandria Police Department obtained a warrant from a local magistrate under the law of Virginia. The warrant authorized the search of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence in Alexandria as well as objects found therein \u2014 including electronic devices. The warrant further authorized the analysis of seized items.\n[11] On February 16, 2017, three CFNIS members and the Alexandria Police Department executed the search warrant. The Alexandria Police Department breached the door, secured the premises, and invited the CFNIS officers to conduct the search. The latter took control of the search. Two forensic investigators, one from the CFNIS and one from the Alexandria Police Department, triaged most of the electronic devices found in the residence, scanning their contents to determine which items to seize.\n[12] In the triage process, the investigators discovered evidence relating to unforeseen offences \u2014 namely sexual assault and what they believed to be child pornography.[1] CFNIS\u2019s forensic investigator, Lieut. Rioux, saw a video file depicting Cpl. McGregor filming himself while sexually touching a woman who appeared to be lying unconscious on a floor.\n[13] The investigators did not triage all of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s devices in executing the search due to the time constraints set out in the warrant. The Alexandria Police Department seized the devices containing incriminating evidence as well as those that were not triaged at the scene. The items seized at Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence included three fake smoke alarm cameras, two remote controls for these cameras, two personal audio recorders, an oval camera alarm clock, a small square camera alarm clock with a remote, laptops, storage devices, and compact discs.\n[14] The Alexandria Police Department made a return before the Virginia magistrate to account for the seized devices, although the CFNIS had them in its custody at all times. Following these events, the CFNIS removed the devices to Canada and obtained Canadian warrants from the Court Martial for further analysis of their contents. A CFNIS investigator arrested Cpl. McGregor in Washington, D.C., and informed him of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter .\nIII. Judicial History\n[15] At first instance, the military judge held that the Charter did not apply extraterritorially. He concluded that the search and seizure were in any event consistent with Charter standards, and he noted that the evidence of sexual assault fell within the plain view doctrine. The military judge therefore admitted the evidence relating to the offence of sexual assault (2018 CM 4023). He subsequently convicted Cpl. McGregor of two counts of voyeurism, one count of possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, one count of sexual assault, and one count of disgraceful conduct (2019 CM 4015).\n[16] In a unanimous opinion, the Court Martial Appeal Court affirmed the military judge\u2019s decision. It agreed with his conclusion that the Charter did not apply, and it held that the evidence did not affect trial fairness at common law. Furthermore, the Court Martial Appeal Court concluded that even if the Charter applied, the result would be the same because the search did not infringe Cpl. McGregor\u2019s s. 8 rights (2020 CMAC 8, 8 C.M.A.R. 481).\nIV. Issues\n[17] This appeal raises two main issues:\n(i) Did the Charter apply extraterritorially to the CFNIS investigators in the search of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence in Alexandria, Virginia?\n(ii) Did the CFNIS investigators infringe Cpl. McGregor\u2019s Charter rights and, if so, should the resulting evidence be excluded?\nV. Analysis\nA. Extraterritorial Application of the Charter\n[18] The starting point of the analysis is the text of the Constitution. The scope of application of the Charter is delineated in s. 32(1) :\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\nThis Court\u2019s decision in Hape is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter under s. 32(1) . Under the Hape framework, the Charter generally cannot apply to Canadian authorities involved in an investigation conducted abroad. This general rule is qualified by two exceptions: (1) consent by the foreign state to the application of Canadian law (para. 106); and (2) Canadian participation in a process that violates Canada\u2019s international law obligations (paras. 51\u201152 and 101; see also Canada (Justice) v. Khadr, 2008 SCC 28, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 125, at paras. 18\u201119).\n[19] Unlike ordinary Canadian citizens, members of the Canadian Armed Forces bear the burden of the extraterritorial application of Canadian criminal law (National Defence Act , ss. 67 and 163.5 ). Moreover, the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, Can. T.S. 1953 No. 13 \u2014 to which Canada and the United States are signatories \u2014 governs the legal status under international law of military forces deployed for official purposes. The Agreement provides that the sending state can exercise criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction over its military forces. However, the Agreement does not confer jurisdiction on the sending state to execute searches of residences located outside of military camps or establishments.\n[20] Cpl. McGregor contends that the Charter applied extraterritorially to the search and seizure of his electronic devices by Canadian military authorities. He emphasizes that he was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces required to be on foreign soil and that he was the target of a Canadian\u2011led investigation pursuant to the National Defence Act and the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 . In Cpl. McGregor\u2019s view, when the National Defence Act applies extraterritorially, so too should the Charter as a matter of principle. To be clear, at the hearing before our Court, Cpl. McGregor confirmed that he is asking the Court to apply the Charter only to the actions of the Canadian authorities in executing the search.\n[21] As a preliminary matter, the parties agree that the issue of extraterritoriality should be resolved on the basis of the existing jurisprudence on s. 32(1) of the Charter . The interveners, however, invite our Court to decide whether Hape should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled. Many of their submissions draw on an extensive body of academic criticism in which the Hape framework is challenged on various constitutional and international law grounds.[2]\n[22] To be sure, this Court has taken notice of scholarly writings in reconsidering the soundness of its own precedents (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 39 and 209; Nishi v. Rascal Trucking Ltd., 2013 SCC 33, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 438, at para. 28; Canada v. Craig, 2012 SCC 43, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 29; Ontario (Attorney General) v. Fraser, 2011 SCC 20, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 86\u201188, 146\u201148 and 235\u201146; R. v. Robinson, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683, at para. 39; Tolofson v. Jensen, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, at p. 1042; R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at pp. 765\u201171; London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299, at pp. 421\u201123; R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, at pp. 865\u201168). This is not to say, of course, that the judiciary is bound to adopt the prevailing approach proffered in the scholarship or that academic criticism is a sufficient reason not to apply the principles of stare decisis (see Fraser, at para. 86; R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at paras. 28\u201129; Friesen v. Canada, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103, at paras. 56 and 58; B. (K.G.), at pp. 774\u201177). It is helpful to recall what I wrote with my colleagues Brown and Rowe JJ. in R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 248: criticism per se is not a reason to overrule one of our own judgments, but it may help a party make the case for overruling it on appropriate grounds.[3]\n[23] I do not believe that this is an appropriate case in which to reconsider the extraterritorial application of the Charter . The parties do not contend that the Hape framework should be revisited; they simply debate its application to the facts at hand. As a rule, which the Court should depart from only in rare and exceptional circumstances, we should not overrule a precedent without having been asked to do so by a party. In this instance, only some interveners ask us to overturn Hape; in doing so, they go beyond their proper role. Doing what they are asking would mean deciding an issue that is not properly before us. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the extraterritorial application of the Charter has no bearing on the disposition of the present appeal. Indeed, the actions of the CFNIS conformed to the Charter , as the s. 8 analysis below makes clear. Simply put, I would dismiss the appeal even if I were to accept Cpl. McGregor\u2019s argument that the Charter applies extraterritorially in the present context.\n[24] It is thus preferable to leave for another day any reconsideration of the Hape framework. A restrained approach is amply supported by our jurisprudence. As Sopinka J. emphasized in Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, \u201cThis Court has said on numerous occasions that it should not decide issues of law that are not necessary to a resolution of an appeal. This is particularly true with respect to constitutional issues\u201d (para. 6; see also R. v. Yusuf, 2021 SCC 2, at paras. 3\u20115; Canada (Attorney General) v. Federation of Law Societies of Canada, 2015 SCC 7, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 86; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, at pp. 381\u201182; The Queen in Right of Manitoba v. Air Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 303, at p. 320; Attorney General (Que.) v. Cumming, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 605, at pp. 610\u201111; Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd., [1951] S.C.R. 887, at p. 901, per Rinfret C.J., rev\u2019d in part [1954] A.C. 541 (P.C.); John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton, [1915] A.C. 330 (P.C.), at p. 339; Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons (1881), 7 App. Cas. 96 (P.C.), at p. 109; Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 301\u20112, per La Forest J., dissenting). There are no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d (Cumming, at p. 611) that warrant departing from this general rule in the present appeal. Therefore, I decline the interveners\u2019 invitation to reconsider the proper approach to the extraterritorial application of the Charter . I would add that, as my colleagues Brown and Rowe JJ. noted in R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 75, it is inappropriate for interveners to supplement the evidentiary record at the appellate level. In the s. 8 analysis which follows, I show that even if the Charter were to apply to the actions of the CFNIS, the appeal should still be dismissed.\nB. Section 8 Analysis\n[25] Cpl. McGregor argues that the search of his electronic devices violated his rights under s. 8 of the Charter , either because it was unauthorized by law or because it was conducted in an unreasonable manner. For the reasons outlined below, I reject both arguments and conclude that the conduct of the CFNIS investigators was consistent with the requirements of the Charter .\n(1) Digital Searches: General Principles\n[26] Section 8 of the Charter guarantees \u201cthe right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\u201d. A search is reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 \u201cif it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable\u201d (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278; see also R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 10; R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 21; R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at paras. 21\u201123; Wakeling v. United States of America, 2014 SCC 72, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 549, at para. 41; R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 12; Goodwin v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles), 2015 SCC 46, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 48; R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518, at para. 36; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 46). This Court has established a presumption that \u201ca search requires prior authorization, usually in the form of a warrant, from a neutral arbiter\u201d (R. v. M. (M.R.), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393, at para. 44, referring to Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 160\u201162; see also Vu, at para. 22; R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, at pp. 238\u201139).\n[27] In recent years, courts have grappled with the challenges posed by technological innovations in developing the law of search and seizure. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence on digital searches has consistently highlighted the \u201cunique and heightened privacy interests in personal computer data\u201d (R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at para. 35; see also Fearon, at paras. 74, 132 and 197; R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 50; Vu, at paras. 40\u201141 and 47; R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 47; R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at paras. 105\u20116).\n[28] In Vu, the Court recognized that the \u201cparticular nature of computers\u201d (para. 39) warrants specific constraints under s. 8 of the Charter on both the authorization and the reasonable performance of digital searches. In unanimous reasons written by Cromwell J., the Court established a presumptive \u201crequirement of specific, prior authorization\u201d applicable to digital searches, as summarized at para. 3:\nIn practical terms, the requirement of specific, prior authorization means that if police intend to search computers found within a place with respect to which they seek a warrant, they must satisfy the authorizing justice that they have reasonable grounds to believe that any computers they discover will contain the things they are looking for. If, in the course of a warranted search, police come across a computer that may contain material for which they are authorized to search but the warrant does not give them specific, prior authorization to search computers, they may seize the device but must obtain further authorization before it is searched.\nThis requirement, I add, extends to other electronic devices that have a \u201cmemory capacity akin to a computer\u201d (para. 38). This broad category includes, for example, devices that store personal data, such as cellphones (Fearon, at para. 52).\n[29] The fact that a search of an electronic device is expressly authorized by warrant does not mean that any file contained therein may be analyzed \u2014 even where no search protocol has been imposed. Cromwell J. stressed in Vu that police officers are \u201cbound, in their search, to adhere to the rule that the manner of the search must be reasonable\u201d (para. 61). Consequently, they cannot \u201cscour the devices indiscriminately\u201d (para. 61) but must limit their search to the types of files that are \u201creasonably necessary to achieve [the warrant\u2019s] objectives\u201d (para. 22). Should \u201cthe officers realiz[e] that there was in fact no reason to search a particular program or file on the device, the law of search and seizure would require them not to do so\u201d (para. 61; see also Fearon, at paras. 57 and 78; Reeves, at para. 35).\n(2) Authorization of the Search\n[30] In the circumstances of the present case, prior authorization to gain entry into Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence could be granted only by a local magistrate under the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Neither the Criminal Code nor the National Defence Act provides for the issuance of warrants authorizing the search of private residences located abroad.\n[31] Given the limited reach of Canadian law, the CFNIS communicated with local authorities and availed itself of the only legal mechanism open to it. The CFNIS first obtained the following diplomatic note from the Canadian Embassy:\n. . . the Embassy has to [sic] honour to waive the inviolability of Corporal McGregor\u2019s private residence, as well as his papers, correspondence and property under article 30 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, for the exclusive purpose of executing a search warrant obtained for the purposes of the CFNIS investigation. Similarly, the Embassy has the honour to waive Corporal McGregor\u2019s immunity from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the United States of America to the limited extent necessary to allow the court of jurisdiction to issue the warrant required for this exclusive purpose. The Embassy expressly retains any other applicable immunities, including his personal inviolability and his immunity from arrest or detention. [Emphasis added.]\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 128)\nAt the request of the CFNIS, the Alexandria Police Department then obtained a search warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate. I note that the Virginia warrant meets the requirement of \u201cspecific, prior authorization\u201d for digital searches established in Vu. It expressly authorized not only the search of Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence but also the search and analysis of the electronic devices found therein:\nYou are hereby commanded in the name of the Commonwealth to forthwith search the following place, person or thing either in day or night\n. . .\nfor the following property, objects and\/or persons:\nCamera, video recorder, other electronic audio\/photo\/video recording devices, computer, cell phone, other internet access devices, internet services devices, external electronic storage devices, and analysis of the seized items. Photographing of the premise and\/or seized items. [Emphasis added.]\n(R.R., at p. 2)\n[32] Nevertheless, Cpl. McGregor asserts that the CFNIS\u2019s participation in the search was not authorized by law. His first argument in this regard is that the search did not comply with s. 8 of the Charter because Vu requires a separate warrant to authorize the search of electronic devices, that is, a warrant apart from the one authorizing the search of the residence itself. However, the Court Martial Appeal Court was correct to hold that the substance of Vu is directed not at the form the search warrant takes but rather at the requirement of having independent grounds to search the electronic devices (Vu, at para. 48). There were such grounds in this case, as the devices could reasonably be expected to contain evidence of the voyeurism offence.\n[33] Cpl. McGregor\u2019s main argument regarding authorization is that the search fell outside the scope of the waiver of diplomatic immunity granted by Canada under the Vienna Convention. This is so, in his view, because the waiver of diplomatic immunity did not contemplate the search and seizure of his electronic devices, as it referred only to his residence in Alexandria, Virginia.\n[34] I would not give effect to this argument. Accepting that the authority to conduct the search of the devices depended on the Vienna Convention, I find that on any reasonable interpretation of the Canadian Embassy\u2019s diplomatic note, the waiver encompassed the search of both Cpl. McGregor\u2019s private residence and his electronic devices. The express reference to \u201cCorporal McGregor\u2019s . . . property\u201d in the diplomatic note plainly contradicts his submission that \u201c[t]he waiver was limited to [his] residence . . . . It did not target the contents of electronic devices\u201d (A.F., at para. 187). Cpl. McGregor\u2019s argument that the search of his devices was unauthorized by law thus fails.\n(3) Reasonableness of the Search\n[35] Cpl. McGregor further contends that the search was unreasonable pursuant to Charter standards in that it was more intrusive than necessary. He argues that the investigators unjustifiably expanded the search of the electronic devices to offences of sexual assault and (what they believed to be) child pornography, whereas the warrant contemplated only the offences of breaking and entering, mischief, interception, harassment, and voyeurism. In his view, once the investigators discovered this unanticipated evidence, the Charter required them to stop the search, seize the electronic devices, and obtain a subsequent warrant permitting the analysis of the files in question.\n[36] I cannot accept this argument. It is uncontroversial that the Virginia warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences. But the discovery of unforeseen evidence does not invalidate the authorization to conduct a search for the purposes outlined in the original warrant. This principle is an old one, and it renders Cpl. McGregor\u2019s argument meritless, at least as regards the evidence sought (see, for instance, Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley, [1921] 2 A.C. 417 (P.C.), at pp. 424\u201125). Here, the investigators discovered the impugned evidence when they were in the process of triaging Cpl. McGregor\u2019s electronic devices at the scene of the search, as was expressly authorized by warrant. The investigators set aside the incriminating devices for seizure and further analysis. Indeed, the CFNIS obtained Canadian warrants before further analyzing their contents. In my view, this investigative process was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter .\n[37] Nor does the admission of the unanticipated evidence found in the triage process infringe Cpl. McGregor\u2019s s. 8 rights. Key to my reasoning is the application of the plain view doctrine to the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault. This common law doctrine defeats the presumption that seizures must be judicially authorized. Our Court\u2019s jurisprudence teaches that two requirements must be satisfied for the plain view doctrine to apply: (1) the police officers must have a legitimate \u201cprior justification for the intrusion into the place where the \u2018plain view\u2019 seizure occurred\u201d (R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 37); and (2) the incriminating evidence must be in plain view in that it is \u201cimmediately obvious\u201d and \u201cdiscovered inadvertently\u201d by the police (R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, at para. 27; see also Buhay, at para. 37). Concerns have been expressed about the plain view doctrine in relation to electronic seizures (e.g., L. J\u00f8rgensen, \u201cIn Plain View?: R v Jones and the Challenge of Protecting Privacy Rights in an Era of Computer Search\u201d (2013), 46 U.B.C. L. Rev. 791). In light of the way this case was argued, I feel it is unnecessary to express a settled opinion on the limits of the doctrine. However, I am satisfied that it does apply in some form to electronic devices (R. v. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241). In the case at bar, there can be no doubt that the doctrine applies.\n[38] A warrant usually provides a legitimate prior justification for the intrusion, thereby satisfying the first requirement of the plain view doctrine. This is not the case, however, where police officers carry out a search unreasonably. In the context of digital searches, the prior justification extends only to the types of files that are \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the proper execution of such a search (Vu, at para. 22). In other words, there must be a reasonable nexus between the files examined and the purposes of the warrant for a search to satisfy the first requirement of the plain view doctrine.\n[39] Even where police officers are initially justified in examining a digital file, the unanticipated evidence contained therein is not necessarily in plain view. This Court\u2019s reasoning in Law offers a useful illustration of the second requirement of the plain view doctrine. In that case, a police officer conducted a cursory examination of the documents in question and found \u201cnothing facially wrong with [them]\u201d (para. 27). The officer failed to \u201cdetec[t] anything incriminating through the unaided use of his senses\u201d, as the incriminating nature of the evidence \u201ccame to light only after he examined, translated and photocopied several documents\u201d (para. 27; see also Buhay, at para. 37; R. v. Gill, 2019 BCCA 260, at para. 59 (CanLII)). Consequently, this Court rejected the argument that the documents were in plain view, since they \u201cwere neither discovered inadvertently nor immediately evident\u201d (Law, at para. 10).\n[40] Applying the foregoing principles, I conclude that both requirements of the plain view doctrine are satisfied in the present case. The application of the plain view doctrine to digital searches may undoubtedly give rise to intricate issues, but this is a straightforward case. The military judge correctly determined that the plain view doctrine applies to the evidence of sexual assault stored in Cpl. McGregor\u2019s devices.\n[41] First, the investigators had a legitimate justification for their inspection of the files containing evidence of sexual assault at the scene of the search. As mentioned above, the Virginia warrant meets the Vu requirement of specific, prior authorization applicable to digital searches. Moreover, the military judge found that \u201c[t]he discovery of files relating to a potential sexual assault . . . occurred while looking for the types of files specifically sought and authorized\u201d (voir dire decision, at para. 25 (CanLII)). The investigators \u201cdemonstrat[ed] care to limit the impact of the search through screening and conduct of a targeted search that involved a minimum of personal information\u201d (para. 27). In these circumstances, the initial search leading to the discovery of the files in issue satisfies the requirement of prior justification.\n[42] Second, the digital files disclosing evidence of sexual assault were in plain view, given their inadvertent discovery and immediately apparent unlawfulness. The investigators came upon these files in the triage process, which was designed to quickly identify evidence of interception and voyeurism. The military judge rejected \u201cthe submissions to the effect that the investigators continued to look into files they had no authority to look at under the terms of the warrant\u201d (para. 25). He further noted that \u201cany device that was assessed to contain potential child pornography and sexual assault files [was] set aside for seizure and further analysis back in Canada\u201d (para. 25). Moreover, there was no need to closely examine the files to ascertain their incriminating nature \u2014 in contrast to the documents in Law, which were not facially unlawful. I thus conclude that the impugned evidence was in plain view and that its seizure during the triage process did not violate s. 8, either as part of a search carried out unreasonably or as an unreasonable seizure.\n[43] With respect for the contrary view of my colleagues Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., I believe that the application of the plain view doctrine is necessary in this case. I do not see on what basis the police could justify seizing either the devices containing, or the actual data constituting, the sexual assault evidence without resort to this doctrine. I agree that the devices were searched pursuant to the Virginia warrant, but that warrant did not authorize the seizure of evidence of sexual assault. After all, it had been issued to search for and seize evidence of voyeurism. A warrant in and of itself is not authority to search for or seize anything which might afford evidence of any offence whatsoever; the plain view doctrine and\/or s. 489 of the Criminal Code could authorize such seizures, but only if their requirements are met. Therefore, to be clear, I disagree with my colleagues Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., and I see no need to discuss further their reasons on this issue.\n[44] In sum, the CFNIS demonstrably observed the requirements of the Charter . The investigators discovered the incriminating evidence in the execution of a digital search expressly authorized by a valid warrant. The evidence of sexual assault, although not contemplated in the original warrant, fell squarely within the purview of the plain view doctrine. The CFNIS seized the evidence in accordance with that doctrine and subsequently obtained Canadian warrants before conducting an in\u2011depth analysis of the files in issue. Even on Cpl. McGregor\u2019s view of the law, it is difficult to see how the CFNIS could have more fully complied with the Charter . In light of my conclusion that the investigative process was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter , it is unnecessary to address Cpl. McGregor\u2019s argument that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) .\nVI. Conclusion\n[45] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and affirm Cpl. McGregor\u2019s convictions.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nKarakatsanis and Martin JJ. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[46] In this case a member of the Canadian Armed Forces facing trial in a Canadian court seeks to invoke the protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms against actions taken by Canadian officials abroad. Corporal McGregor asks to exclude the contents of certain electronic devices seized from his home by Canadian and American officials in the State of Virginia. He argues that s. 8 of the Charter applies and his Charter rights were breached because under Canadian law a further warrant was required to search his devices.\n[47] While we agree that the appeal should be dismissed, we also comment on the central question directly at issue in this appeal: does the Charter apply, pursuant to s. 32 , to Canadian authorities\u2019 investigative actions abroad in these circumstances? This was clearly the primary and threshold issue argued by the parties and multiple interveners, it was the reason leave to appeal was sought, and we received full submissions on both constitutional and international law. The extraterritorial application of the Charter is squarely before the Court and it is an issue that arises infrequently, may easily escape judicial review, and has been subject to significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law.\n[48] While the extraterritoriality of the Charter may arise in many different types of situations, we comment only on the particular question before us: that is, whether the Charter applies for those people subject to Canadian criminal law for acts committed abroad \u2014 whether by virtue of military service or otherwise \u2014 and for Canadian officials whose investigations of offences transcend Canada\u2019s borders.\n[49] We begin by interpreting s. 32(1) of the Charter and conclude that the required purposive reading supports the conclusion that the Charter applies extraterritorially to the conduct of Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (\u201cCFNIS\u201d) officials while fulfilling their investigative duties in a foreign state and that a Canadian court may assess that conduct for Charter-compliance. This was also the reading of s. 32 endorsed by the majority in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292. However, they were further of the view that international law principles of jurisdiction required a more restrictive reading of s. 32. We say that this restrictive reading is ripe for reconsideration as Hape departed from and overruled previous authority without full argument on international law principles. Further, according to scholars in the field, Hape misapplied certain key principles of international law in reaching the conclusions it did. While we agree as a matter of error correction that the result is the same whether or not the Charter applies, the application of the Charter to Canadian officials investigating Canadians abroad is a pressing issue squarely raised in this appeal. While there are significant questions about the correctness of Hape\u2019s conclusion that the Charter does not apply to such investigative action, given the majority\u2019s conclusion, we leave the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided to another day.\nII. Interpretation of Section 32(1) of the Charter\n[50] It is well established that the interpretation of the Charter should be purposive, generous, and aimed at securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter \u2019s protections (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344; Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156). Under this approach, the Charter \u2019s text and purpose support extraterritorial application and the conclusion that the Charter applies to Canadian authorities conducting investigations abroad.\n[51] Nothing in the text of s. 32 imposes or even suggests any territorial limitation. It expressly limits to whom the Charter applies: the federal and provincial governments and legislatures. Section 32(1) also expressly limits to what the Charter applies: \u201c. . . all matters within the authority . . .\u201d of Parliament and the legislatures. Importantly, s. 32(1) imposes no express limitation on where the Charter applies (Hape, at para. 161, per Bastarache J.).\n[52] Nor can it be said that s. 32(1)\u2019s limitation of the Charter \u2019s scope to \u201call matters within the authority\u201d of Parliament and the legislatures implicitly imposes a territorial limit on the Charter \u2019s reach. According to Wilson J. (with whom Dickson C.J. agreed on this point) in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, this phrase in s. 32(1)(a) , \u201clike the corresponding words \u2018within the authority of the legislature of each province\u2019 . . ., [was] merely a reference to the division of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 \u201d (pp. 455 and 463\u201164). It simply describes \u201cthe subject\u2011matters in relation to which the Parliament of Canada may legislate or the government of Canada may take executive action\u201d (p. 464). In the context of s. 32(1) , therefore, those words do not imply or impose any territorial limitation to or on the Charter . To read them in that manner would not only be inconsistent with precedent (see C. Sethi, \u201cDoes the Charter Follow the Flag? Revisiting Constitutional Extraterritoriality after R v Hape\u201d (2011), 20 Dal. J. Leg. Stud. 102, at p. 113; R. J. Currie and J. Rikhof, International & Transnational Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 633-34), but would also fail to acknowledge that Canada has the constitutional authority to make laws with extraterritorial application (Statute of Westminster, 1931 (U.K.), 22 Geo. 5, c. 4, s. 3; Reference re Offshore Mineral Rights of British Columbia, [1967] S.C.R. 792, at p. 816; Hape, at paras. 66 and 68; see also Interpretation Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 8(3) ).\n[53] If s. 32(1) were meant to distinguish between acts of state actors on Canadian soil or abroad, such a distinction could have easily been drawn expressly, as was done elsewhere in provisions like ss. 3 , 6 and 23 of the Charter , which draw distinctions based on citizenship (A. Attaran, \u201cHave Charter, Will Travel? Extraterritoriality in Constitutional Law and Canadian Exceptionalism\u201d (2008), 87 Can. Bar Rev. 515, at p. 523; see also L. West, \u201cCanada Stands Alone: A Comparative Analysis of the Extraterritorial Reach of State Human Rights Obligations\u201d (U.B.C. L. Rev., forthcoming), at pp. 8-10). Taking into account what is not in s. 32(1) \u2019s text, but is elsewhere in the Charter , confirms that no territorial limitation was intended. Section 32(1) \u2019s silence as to the Charter \u2019s territorial boundaries when other sections are based on citizenship or are specifically confined to Canada was not an omission or the result of happenstance. It was instead a deliberate choice to not limit the Charter \u2019s territorial reach which must be respected.\n[54] The purpose of s. 32 was to constrain state action within the newly established constitutional democracy. As this Court has acknowledged, the words of s. 32(1) \u201cgive a strong message that the Charter is confined to government action. . . . [T]he Charter is essentially an instrument for checking the powers of government over the individual\u201d (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 261). To permit state action abroad that is not constrained by the Constitution would be inconsistent with our constitutional structure, which is premised on preventing arbitrary state conduct (Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 70). The sole claim of government, including the executive, to exercise lawful authority \u201crests in the powers allocated to them under the Constitution, and can come from no other source\u201d (para. 72). Accordingly, there can be no lawful state action without corresponding constitutional limitations \u2014 no matter where the conduct takes place. As one commentator put it, \u201c[t]he executive cannot act outside the Constitution and still act within the rule of law. When it is invited to play on the international scene, it must come as it is: as a constitutional government \u2014 not an arbitrary one. It has no license to act arbitrarily away from home\u201d (M. Webb, \u201cThe Constitutional Question of Our Time: Extraterritorial Application of the Charter and the Afghan Detainees Case\u201d (2011), 28 N.J.C.L. 235, at p. 256).\n[55] Thus, a purposive interpretation of s. 32(1) leads to the conclusion that the provision draws no distinction between domestic and extraterritorial application. Rather, it sends a strong message that the Charter is an instrument for checking the powers of the government over the individual and preventing state action that is inconsistent with the rights and freedoms it enshrines (McKinney, at p. 261; see also Hape, at para. 91). As a result, based on such an interpretation of s. 32(1) , the Charter would apply to constrain Canadian authorities conducting investigations, whether that conduct takes place inside or outside Canada.\nIII. The Hape Decision\n[56] In Hape, LeBel J., for the majority, also began with the text of s. 32(1) of the Charter and likewise concluded that it contained no express territorial limit (paras. 32 and 94). However, in that case, the majority of the Court held the Charter did not apply to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s search and seizure of banking documents in Turks and Caicos Islands (paras. 2-14). The majority overturned R. v. Cook, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 597, and set out a new two-stage framework for determining whether a remedy is available for extraterritorial Canadian state conduct alleged to have violated the Charter . At the first stage, the court must determine if the activity in question falls under s. 32(1) by asking: (1) whether the conduct at issue is that of a Canadian state actor; and (2) if so, whether, on the facts, there is an exception to the principle of sovereignty that would justify applying the Charter to the state actor\u2019s extraterritorial activities. If there is no exception and the Charter does not apply, then at the second stage the court must ask if the evidence should be excluded from the trial because its admission would render the trial unfair (para. 113).\n[57] LeBel J. chose to look to prohibitive rules of customary international law to aid in the interpretation of s. 32 of the Charter (paras. 35-39). Customary international law is composed of norms that meet the two requirements of state practice and opinio juris: states must actually follow the norm and must view it as legally binding (para. 46). The majority in Hape looked to the principle of sovereign equality, which rests upon respect for territorial sovereignty and is \u201cinseparable\u201d from the principle of non-intervention, and which provides that all states are sovereign and equal (paras. 40 and 45-46). The majority relied on the doctrine of adoption to conclude that the principles of non-intervention and territorial sovereignty should be relied on to interpret the Charter \u2019s scope. They also applied the presumption of conformity, a principle of statutory interpretation that legislation will be presumed to conform with international law, unless its wording compels otherwise (paras. 39, 46 and 53). They held that in interpreting the Charter \u2019s scope, the Court should seek to ensure compliance with Canada\u2019s binding obligations under international law where the Charter \u2019s express words are capable of supporting that construction.\n[58] The majority found that the comity of nations \u2014 defined as \u201cthe deference and respect due by other states to the actions of a state legitimately taken within its territory\u201d \u2014 was another interpretive principle that aids in interpreting the Charter \u2019s extraterritorial reach (paras. 32-33, 47, 50 and 53-56, quoting Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at p. 1095). LeBel J. observed that comity encourages states to cooperate with each other to investigate transnational crime and, where one state assists another, to respect how assistance is given within a state\u2019s territory. However, he made clear that comity \u201cdoes not offer a rationale for condoning another state\u2019s breach of international law\u201d and that comity\u2019s deference \u201cends where clear violations of international law and fundamental human rights begin\u201d (paras. 51-52).\n[59] Having set out these additional interpretive principles, the majority reviewed and applied jurisdictional principles of international law. LeBel J. observed there are three forms of jurisdiction: prescriptive, enforcement, and adjudicative. Prescriptive jurisdiction \u201cis the power to make rules, issue commands or grant authorizations that are binding upon persons and entities\u201d (para. 58). Enforcement jurisdiction \u201cis the power to use coercive means to ensure that rules are followed, commands are executed or entitlements are upheld\u201d (ibid.). Finally, adjudicative jurisdiction \u201cis the power of a state\u2019s courts to resolve disputes or interpret the law through decisions that carry binding force\u201d (ibid.). He also summarized several bases upon which a state may exercise its jurisdiction, including the territoriality, nationality, and universality principles (paras. 59-61).\n[60] The majority proceeded to discuss principles pertaining to extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Canadian context. They stated that \u201cit is a well-established principle that a state cannot act to enforce its laws within the territory of another state absent either the consent of the other state or, in exceptional cases, some other basis under international law\u201d (para. 65). Observing that, pursuant to the Statute of Westminster, 1931, Canada has the authority to make laws having extraterritorial operation (para. 66), they noted that Parliament\u2019s ability to pass extraterritorial legislation is also informed by the above-mentioned interpretive principles. They concluded that while Parliament can enact legislation inconsistent with these interpretive principles, any Canadian law can only be enforced abroad with the consent of other states (paras. 67-68).\n[61] With these principles in mind, the majority turned to a review of this Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence and explained why Cook, the Court\u2019s previous decision allowing extraterritorial application of the Charter to the actions of Canadian police abroad, ought to be revisited. In Cook, the Court had determined that the Charter applied to the taking of the accused\u2019s statement by Canadian police in the United States in connection with an investigation of an offence to be prosecuted in Canada.\n[62] The majority raised three criticisms of Cook. First, they noted that the decision failed to distinguish prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction (paras. 84-85). As they viewed the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an exercise of enforcement jurisdiction, and since extraterritorial enforcement of Canadian laws is not possible (without consent), they concluded that extraterritorial application of the Charter is impossible (para. 85).\n[63] Second, they noted practical and theoretical difficulties arose when the Cook approach was applied to different facts, such as those in Hape, where a warrant for the impugned search was not necessary under Turks and Caicos law (paras. 86-92). The majority concluded that, both theoretically and practically, the Charter cannot apply to searches and seizures conducted abroad (paras. 86-92).\n[64] Third, they found that Cook failed to give proper consideration to the wording of s. 32(1) (paras. 93-95). Interpreting s. 32(1) in light of the interpretive principles discussed above, they concluded that extraterritorial enforcement actions were outside the scope of the Charter . Section 32(1) states the Charter applies to \u201cmatters within the authority of\u201d Parliament or the provincial legislatures. Having found that Parliament and the provincial legislatures do not have jurisdiction to authorize enforcement abroad, the majority concluded that activities such as criminal investigations abroad are not \u201cmatters within the authority of\u201d Parliament or the provincial legislatures and are thus not captured by s. 32(1) (para. 94).\n[65] Despite finding that the Charter generally could not be applied to the actions of Canadian officials conducted as part of an investigation occurring abroad, Hape identified three exceptions pursuant to which Charter protections might apply. First, the Charter could apply extraterritorially where the foreign state consented to the Charter \u2019s application (para. 106). Second, the principle of comity \u201cmay give way\u201d where the participation of Canadian officers in the investigative activities would violate Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations (para. 101). Third, ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter could operate to exclude evidence obtained by Canadian officials abroad, if admitting the evidence would result in an unfair trial (paras. 107-12).\nIV. Criticisms of Hape\n[66] The decision in Hape and its approach has been the subject of significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law.4 Three main flaws in Hape have been identified: (1) Hape applied improper interpretive principles, including jurisdictional principles of international law and a principle of statutory interpretation, to its interpretation of s. 32(1); (2) Hape mischaracterized the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction; and (3) Hape\u2019s three exceptions are inadequate. LeBel J.\u2019s reliance on and misapplication of these international law principles has generated the level and type of cogent criticism and doctrinal instability which calls for a reconsideration of this aspect of the Hape decision. We look at each of these three main criticisms in turn.\n[67] First, a fundamental underpinning of Hape was that s. 32(1) ought to be interpreted in a way that ensures compliance with rules of international law that are binding on Canada, which in this case led to a more restrictive reading of s. 32 (para. 56). Methodologically, imposing international law principles as an overlay to limit the scope of the Charter undermines the purposive approach to Charter interpretation (West, \u201cCanada Stands Alone\u201d, at pp. 9-10; Cook, at para. 147, per Bastarache J.). Rather, international law should generally be used to support or confirm an interpretation arrived at through the purposive approach (R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 98; H. S. Fairley, \u201cInternational Law Comes of Age: Hape v. The Queen\u201d (2008), 87 Can. Bar Rev. 229, at p. 236). Moreover, jurisdictional principles of international law are not an appropriate basis for limiting the meaning of \u201cauthority\u201d in s. 32(1) as a matter of domestic constitutional law. Parliament\u2019s authority is plenary within the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and extends to extraterritorial enforcement action, including actions that violate international law itself (Statute of Westminster, 1931, s. 3 ; Croft v. Dunphy, [1933] A.C. 156 (P.C.), at p. 163; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at para. 141, per LeBel J.; J. H. Currie, \u201cKhadr\u2019s Twist on Hape: Tortured Determinations of the Extraterritorial Reach of the Canadian Charter \u201d (2008), 46 Can. Y.B. Int\u2019l L. 307, at pp. 318-19; Hape, at paras. 39, 53 and 68; G. van Ert, \u201cCanadian Cases in Public International Law in 2006-7\u201d (2007), 45 Can. Y.B. Int\u2019l L. 527, at p. 551; West, \u201cCanada Stands Alone\u201d, at pp. 13-14). As well, concerns over international comity and the policy goal of increasing international cooperation between police forces should not be permitted to overtake a proper purposive interpretation or used to insulate state conduct from judicial review (Currie and Rikhof, at pp. 628-29).\n[68] Additionally, Hape applied the presumption of conformity \u2014 a principle of statutory interpretation (para. 53) \u2014 to its interpretation of s. 32(1) (Currie (2008), at p. 315; Sethi, at p. 113; J. H. Currie, \u201cInternational Human Rights Law in the Supreme Court\u2019s Charter Jurisprudence: Commitment, Retrenchment and Retreat \u2014 In No Particular Order\u201d (2010), 50 S.C.L.R. (2d) 423, at pp. 441\u201143 and 453\u201154). The presumptions used in Charter interpretation are different from those used in statutory interpretation (Hunter, at p. 155). Rather than presuming conformity, in the Charter context we presume that the Charter \u201cprovide[s] protection at least as great as that afforded by similar provisions in international human rights documents which Canada has ratified\u201d, creating a floor \u2014 but not a ceiling \u2014 for Charter protections based on binding international human rights instruments (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, at p. 349, per Dickson C.J.; Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1056, quoted in Hape, at para. 55; L. West, \u201c\u2018Within or Outside Canada\u2019: The Charter\u2019s Application to the Extraterritorial Activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service\u201d (2023), 73 U.T.L.J. 1, at p. 39; Currie (2008), at p. 321). Hape\u2019s application of international law principles and statutory interpretation principles to its interpretation of s. 32(1), contrary to the established purposive approach, suggests the need for reconsideration.\n[69] Second, according to international law scholars, this portion of Hape mischaracterizes the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction. We agree with Hape that Canadian officials conducting an investigation abroad are exercising extraterritorial enforcement jurisdiction (Hape, at paras. 58, 64-65 and 105; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 98). But, academics contend that when jurisdictional principles are properly applied, it becomes clear that requiring Canadian officials to comply with the Charter when abroad and allowing Canadian courts to assess their conduct for such compliance are exercises of prescriptive and adjudicative jurisdiction respectively, neither of which violate international law nor interfere with the sovereign authority of another state (van Ert, at p. 552; J. Crawford, Brownlie\u2019s Principles of Public International Law (9th ed. 2019), at p. 462; see also Currie (2008), at p. 317). These criticisms leave Hape\u2019s analysis ripe for reconsideration.\n[70] Furthermore, Hape equated the application of the Charter with a requirement that Canadian procedure govern the investigation (paras. 84, 86 and 98), which muddied the analysis. Applying the Charter to the conduct of Canadian officials acting abroad is not the same thing as requiring Canadian laws of criminal procedure to govern the foreign investigation (Currie and Rikhof, at p. 634). The Charter does not govern the activities of foreign officials and Canadian officials engaging in enforcement activities in another state are required to comply with that state\u2019s laws (R. v. Terry, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 207, at para. 19; R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 15). State sovereignty is respected by gaining consent to participate in the investigation and by requiring that Canadian officers conducting duties abroad comply with the laws of the foreign state. Requiring Canadian authorities to also abide by the Charter does not preclude the need to respect foreign law prerequisites.\n[71] In addition, scholarship and foreign case law suggest comity concerns are minimal. States routinely apply their domestic law to the actions of their officials abroad, without seeking the consent of the territorial state (M. Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (2011), at p. 65; see, e.g., United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990), at p. 283, fn. 7, per Brennan J., dissenting; C. McLachlan, Foreign Relations Law (2014), at paras. 5.154-5.156; Smith v. Ministry of Defence, [2013] UKSC 41, [2014] A.C. 52, at paras. 46\u201149; Kaunda v. President of the Republic of South Africa, [2004] ZACC 5, 2005 (4) S.A. 235, at paras. 42-44 and 228-29; Young v. Attorney-General, [2018] NZCA 307, [2018] 3 N.Z.L.R. 827, at paras. 28-30; Smith v. R., [2020] NZCA 499, [2021] 3 N.Z.L.R. 324, at para. 92; Afghan Nationals v. Minister for Immigration, [2021] NZHC 3154, [2022] 2 N.Z.L.R. 102, at para. 39; Federal Intelligence Service \u2014 foreign surveillance, BVerfG, 1 BvR 2835\/17, Decision of May 19, 2020 (Germany), at paras. 91, 93-94, 101 and 104). This reality of state practice suggests that no norm of customary international law prohibits a state from regulating the actions of its officials abroad through its domestic law. And it indicates that comity is in no way offended by applying domestic law to state officials\u2019 actions abroad because states do not view this as any breach of rules of courtesy or any violation of international law.\n[72] Moreover, Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations support applying the Charter extraterritorially. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47, which is ratified by and therefore binding on Canada, \u201ccovers much of the same ground\u201d and is \u201crelevant to the interpretation of the Charter \u201d (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at \u00a7 36:28; Bissonnette, at para. 99). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has been interpreted as imposing extraterritorial obligations on state parties (Article 2(1) ; Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 136, at paras. 108-11; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31: The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, U.N. Doc. CCPR\/C\/21\/Rev.1\/Add.13, May 26, 2004, at para. 12; Munaf v. Romania, Communication No. 1539\/2006, U.N. Doc. CCPR\/C\/96\/D\/1539\/2006 (2009), at para. 14.2; Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay, Communication No. 52\/1979, U.N. Doc. CCPR\/C\/13\/D\/52\/1979 (1981), at para. 12.3; Currie (2010), at pp. 440\u201141). Because the Charter is presumed to provide protections at least as great (Slaight, at p. 1056), it would follow that the Charter should also extend to the actions of state officials when abroad.\n[73] Third, critics contend that Hape\u2019s three exceptions \u2014 consent, violations of international human rights obligations, and trial fairness \u2014 are inadequate. They fail to provide the same robust protections as expressly contained in the Charter . This is cause for concern and suggests the need to revisit Hape\u2019s conclusion.\n[74] Scholars have pointed out that the consent exception proves illusory in many circumstances (Attaran, at pp. 534-36 and 538-39; West, \u201cWithin or Outside Canada\u201d, at pp. 37-39). Moreover, if the extraterritorial application of the Charter is not an exercise of enforcement jurisdiction (as international law scholars contend), the consent exception is based on: (1) the unsustainable notion of Canadian officials asking for other states\u2019 permission to apply Canada\u2019s constitutional limits to Canada\u2019s own conduct; and (2) the assumption that the territorial state would understand the question or should control the answer (van Ert, at p. 555).\n[75] Academics have noted that the human rights exception leaves gaps where Charter protections exceed the rights guaranteed in international human rights instruments (West, \u201cWithin or Outside Canada\u201d at p. 39; Currie (2008), at pp. 320-21). That gaps will arise is a given in light of the presumption that the Charter provides protections at least as great as those provided for under Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations (Slaight, at p. 1056). As well, it is illogical for the nature of the breach to determine the application of the rights-protecting instrument (Attaran, at p. 520; see also Amnesty International Canada v. Canada (Chief of the Defence Staff), 2008 FC 336, [2008] 4 F.C.R. 546, at paras. 312-13, aff\u2019d 2008 FCA 401, [2009] 4 F.C.R. 149). Doctrinally, the exception is inconsistent with the principle that treaties, the key source of Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations, do not take effect in Canadian law directly unless they have been implemented through legislation and fails to recognize that the Charter is the means by which Canada has implemented many of these obligations (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 69; van Ert, at p. 553; J. H. Currie, \u201cWeaving a Tangled Web: Hape and the Obfuscation of Canadian Reception Law\u201d (2007), 45 Can. Y.B. Int\u2019l L. 55, at pp. 80-81; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 636; see also K. Sun, \u201cInternational Comity and the Construction of the Charter \u2019s Limits: Hape Revisited\u201d (2019), 45 Queen\u2019s L.J. 115, at p. 145). And the \u201ccurious\u201d result of the exception \u2014 that international human rights law, rather than the Charter , is used to assess the actions of Canadian officials acting abroad (van Ert, at p. 553) \u2014 creates uncertainty for Canadian state actors acting abroad who are unlikely to be familiar with Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations (Amnesty International, at para. 314; Hape, at para. 173, per Bastarache J.).\n[76] Finally, critics suggest the trial fairness exception also leaves gaps because it does not apply when an individual\u2019s Charter rights are breached in a manner that does not result in obtaining evidence that would place the fairness of the trial in question or when the Charter-infringing state conduct never leads to a criminal trial in Canada (K. Roach, \u201cR. v. Hape Creates Charter-Free Zones for Canadian Officials Abroad\u201d (2007), 53 Crim. L.Q. 1, at p. 2; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 634). And, as originally outlined in Harrer, the exception was intended to apply to circumstances where evidence was collected by foreign authorities to whom the Charter does not apply. It was not intended to address the gap created by failing to apply the Charter to Canadian authorities. More significantly, in our view, the exception only provides the protections contained in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter . These two rights alone are insufficient to guarantee a fully Charter-compliant trial. Attempting to supercharge ss. 7 and 11(d) so that they can stand in the stead of all the other rights contained in the Charter defeats the very purpose of the Charter : to guarantee all the rights and freedoms set out within it.\nV. Conclusion on Hape\n[77] The decision in Hape remains important in many respects, such as its pronouncements on the incorporation of customary international law by the common law (see Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166, at para. 86; van Ert, at p. 555), on state sovereignty and sovereign equality, and on the interpretative principle that statutes are presumed to operate in conformity with Canada\u2019s international obligations (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 114; van Ert, at p. 555).\n[78] The Court, however, had received no submissions on international law, and it departed from the theoretical foundation of this Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence on the application of the Charter abroad even though no parties or interveners before the Court in Hape had asked for the previous jurisprudence to be revised or overruled (paras. 182, 184-86 and 189, per Binnie J.). Numerous theoretical and practical problems have unfortunately followed Hape, as highlighted by the wealth of judicial and academic criticisms that have emerged in the last 15 years.\n[79] These are significant concerns. They go to the core of our jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the Charter , to the practical implications of its application, and to the ensuing lack of consistency and predictability of this area of the law. These concerns leave this portion of Hape ripe for reconsideration. However, given the majority\u2019s decision not to address it, we would leave the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided to another day.\n[80] Because we do not reach a conclusion as to whether Hape was wrongly decided, we need not elaborate how the Charter should apply abroad \u2014 an issue that was also not a major focus of the submissions in this appeal. However, we note that in our view the Charter is sufficiently flexible to take foreign context and the associated concerns raised by the Hape majority into account in the analysis, on a case-by-case basis. As Bastarache J. recognized in Hape (para. 125), the Charter \u201cis a flexible document, amenable to contextual interpretation and permitting reasonable justifications of limitations to fundamental rights\u201d. Such flexibility could exist at both the breach and remedial stages. Foreign laws and procedures may be relevant in assessing whether there was a Charter breach. And operational concerns arising from differences between Canadian and foreign procedures might be addressed through a flexible application of remedial discretion under s. 24 .\n[81] In conclusion, we would add that while this Court\u2019s rules and guidance to the profession do place certain limits upon what interveners may argue, we disagree with our colleagues that the interveners went beyond their proper role in this case. While interveners must not introduce new issues, the role of interveners is to provide their own view of the legal issues by providing \u201cuseful . . . and different\u201d submissions, thus bringing \u201cbroader perspectives\u201d before the Court (Supreme Court of Canada, Notice to the Profession: November 2021 \u2013 Interventions, November 15, 2021, (online)). Several interveners in this case did precisely that when they asked this Court to revisit Hape: they proposed a different view of the core legal issue of whether the Charter applied to the conduct of the CFNIS officers. Indeed, these interveners were granted leave to intervene on this basis: when seeking leave, they all clearly signaled their intent to criticize Hape and suggest revisions to its framework, with the Canadian Constitution Foundation specifically stating Hape must be revisited (memorandum of argument, at para. 10). To hold that we cannot engage with this different view, simply because the parties themselves did not propose it, ignores the purpose of intervener submissions as set out in the Notice to the Profession and runs contrary to this Court\u2019s past practice in decisions that have relied on the frameworks proposed by interveners.\n[82] More importantly, any limitation on the role of interveners in no way limits the jurisdiction of this Court to decide issues in a manner other than that proposed by the parties. Indeed, Hape itself demonstrates that this Court can overturn precedent without any invitation from the parties or interveners (para. 187, per Binnie J.). Such a restriction also runs counter to the role of this Court, which is not merely one of error correction. Rather, the role of the Court, as an apex court, is oriented to the \u201cdevelopment of the jurisprudence\u201d by \u201cdeal[ing] with questions of \u2018public importance\u2019\u201d, and much of the Court\u2019s work \u201cnecessarily [goes] beyond what [is] essential for the disposition of the particular case\u201d (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 53; Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6, 2014 SCC 21, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 86). By \u201cbringing broader perspectives before the Court than those advanced by appellants and respondents\u201d, and by advancing their own views on legal issues before the Court, interveners help the Court fulfill this institutional role (Notice to the Profession).\nVI. Application\n[83] Assuming that, pursuant to s. 32(1) , the Charter applied to the conduct of the officers during their investigation, Cpl. McGregor\u2019s s. 8 rights were not infringed.\n[84] A search is reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law is reasonable, and if the search is conducted reasonably (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). In R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, this Court decided that specific prior authorization was required to search computers (paras. 3 and 47). This means \u201cthat if police intend to search any computers found within a place they want to search, they must first satisfy the authorizing justice that they have reasonable grounds to believe that any computers they discover will contain the things they are looking for\u201d (para. 48).\n[85] We conclude, as does our colleague C\u00f4t\u00e9 J., that those requirements are met in this case. First, the warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate specifically authorized the search of computers and electronic devices. As well, the reference to \u201cCorporal McGregor\u2019s . . . property\u201d (A.R., vol. I, at p. 128) in the diplomatic note brings the authorization under the waiver of diplomatic immunity. Second, the law that authorized the search was reasonable in light of Charter standards developed in our jurisprudence: as noted by both courts below, the grounds relied upon to obtain the warrant would have been sufficient in Canada. Third, the search was conducted reasonably, as the warrant expressly authorized the process of triaging the electronic devices at the scene.\n[86] We disagree that applying the plain view doctrine is necessary in this case. The plain view doctrine permits seizure without a warrant in defined circumstances. Cpl. McGregor does not dispute seizure before this Court. Rather, he argued that the search was unauthorized by law or conducted in an unreasonable manner (A.F., at para. 185). He maintained that \u201conce investigators had come across evidence of what they believed to be child pornography they ought to have ceased searching, seized the electronic devices, and obtained a subsequent warrant outlining same\u201d (para. 200). They breached s. 8, he argued, by instead \u201ccontinu[ing] to search through the devices on scene for additional evidence\u201d, in the course of which they viewed the files containing sexual assault evidence (ibid.). In sum, his argument is that \u201c[o]nce evidence of a new offence has been discovered in the execution of a search, in order to continue searching devices, investigators must obtain a subsequent warrant for that offence\u201d (para. 199).\n[87] The Court Martial rejected Cpl. McGregor\u2019s submissions that the police had \u201ccontinued looking for child pornography and sexual assault files\u201d, rather than for files relating to the offences covered by the Virginia warrant (2018 CM 4023, at para. 25 (CanLII) (emphasis added)). In this regard, the Court Martial noted that the instant case was a \u201ccompletely different situation than what transpired in [R. v. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241], where investigators, while looking for files relating to an alleged fraud, inadvertently discovered child pornography and from that point started looking for completely different kinds of files than what was envisaged by their initial warrant\u201d (ibid. (emphasis added)).\n[88] Because the police in Jones \u2014 unlike in this case \u2014 intentionally searched for files beyond the scope of what the warrant authorized, they needed an alternate justification for that unwarranted search and attempted to rely on the plain view doctrine (Jones, at para. 26). In addition to improperly expanding the scope of the search, in Jones police continued searching the individual hard drive that contained the evidence of child pornography after that evidence was discovered. Here, by contrast, police did not continue a search for evidence of crimes other than those covered by the warrant. Rather, they continued their search for evidence of voyeurism, as permitted by the warrant. And, they did not continue searching the devices that contained evidence of other offences. Rather than continuing to search those devices, they \u201cset aside for seizure and further analysis\u201d, after obtaining a Canadian warrant, \u201cany device that was assessed to contain potential child pornography and sexual assault files\u201d (voir dire decision, para. 25). Cpl. McGregor\u2019s arguments that the search was unlawful or unreasonable must therefore fail. The search was authorized by the Virginia warrant and the police did not inappropriately expand the scope of their search.\n[89] As such, reliance on the plain view doctrine is unnecessary. The parties have not argued any seizure issue. And, in any event, the initial seizure of the device containing sexual assault evidence was judicially authorized by the Virginia warrant, which allowed seizure of devices that may contain evidence of voyeurism. Continued seizure and search of the device was judicially authorized by the subsequent Canadian warrant. Because police set aside any devices that contained evidence of unrelated offences rather than continuing to search them, it is unnecessary to decide in this case whether continuing to search a particular device even after discovering evidence of an unrelated offence on that device could violate s. 8. To the extent that Cpl. McGregor argues that discovering evidence of an unrelated offence on one device required police to not just cease searching that device, but also to refrain from searching any other devices (even for evidence of offences covered by the warrant), we reject that argument. Discovering evidence of an unrelated offence neither authorizes police to begin searching for evidence pertaining to that unrelated offence nor requires them to entirely cease their search as to what the warrant authorized them to search for. That conclusion is all that is required to resolve the s. 8 issue that Cpl. McGregor actually raised: the reasonableness of continuing to triage other devices after discovering evidence of child pornography.\n[90] In concluding that applying the plain view doctrine is necessary, the majority assumes that the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault were seized when they were seen by police, even though they were conducting a lawful search on the computer for voyeurism under a valid warrant. Cpl. McGregor never raised such an argument, nor did any of the interveners. Our Court has never decided the issue of when a particular file on a device is seized, as opposed to when the device (e.g., a laptop) itself is seized. This Court should not decide it in this case. Unintended consequences may flow from deciding the issue without the benefit of any submissions. And it is unnecessary to a resolution of the case.\n[91] Further, the assumption that the files were seized when they were initially seen by police is highly questionable under existing precedent. In R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, this Court offered general guidance on the \u201cline between a seizure and a mere finding of evidence\u201d, which we articulated as \u201cthe point at which it can reasonably be said that the individual had ceased to have a privacy interest in the subject matter\u201d (p. 435). In our view, simply seeing the file at Cpl. McGregor\u2019s home did not likely constitute a seizure because he did not \u201cceas[e] to have a privacy interest in\u201d it in the required sense (ibid.), as evidenced by the need for the subsequent Canadian warrant. Additionally, finding that a file is seized when it is \u201cviewed\u201d conflates merely seeing a file with seizing it. To analogize to physical files, this would suggest that the police seize every piece of paper that they view during the search of a file cabinet.\n[92] Rather than deciding this complex question without the benefit of submissions, we would conclude that the initial seizure of the laptop was justified by the Virginia warrant \u2014 as Cpl. McGregor accepts (A.F., at paras. 200-201) \u2014 and the subsequent search and seizure of its files was justified by the Canadian warrant. The Virginia warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences and the officers discovered the file relating to the alleged sexual assault only while looking for the types of files specifically authorized by the warrant (voir dire decision, at para. 25). The Virginia warrant did, however, authorize seizure of the electronic devices which may have contained evidence of voyeurism. The Virginia warrant also authorized the search of the laptop\u2019s files for evidence of voyeurism, which explains how the police found the sexual assault file and why they were acting lawfully when they saw it. At this point, the police chose a sound approach in the circumstances: they set aside the (already seized) laptop and subsequently obtained a Canadian warrant that authorized them to search the content of the computers and electronic devices for the purpose of obtaining evidence of sexual assault (para. 20; A.R., vol. I, at p. 100). Accordingly, their conduct did not exceed the bounds of prior judicial authorization and the plain view doctrine need not be relied upon.\n[93] In addition to being in lawful possession of the computer under the Virginia warrant, we note that when the police discovered the sexual assault file, they may also have been authorized to take physical control of the laptop \u201ctemporarily, and for the limited purpose of safeguarding potential evidence of a crime until a search warrant\u201d specific to sexual assault \u201ccould be obtained\u201d (R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 65 (emphasis deleted)). Vu likewise contemplated seizure of computers so as to preserve evidence of an offence, even where the warrant did not provide authorization to search the computer for evidence of that offence, \u201cassuming it may reasonably be thought to contain the sort of things that the warrant authorizes to be seized\u201d (paras. 3 and 49). Here, the police reasonably thought the laptop may have contained evidence of voyeurism and so were justified under the Virginia warrant to seize the laptop in order to preserve the integrity of the data.\n[94] Not only is reliance on the plain view doctrine superfluous and dependent on questionable assumptions regarding when a file is seized, whether or not to extend the plain view doctrine to the search of the content of a computer is a fraught issue that has not been addressed by this Court. We have never endorsed the application of the doctrine to electronic files as set out by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Jones. The search and seizure of personal computers marks an incredibly intrusive, extensive and invasive search of one\u2019s privacy (R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at paras. 2-3). To that end, we have required specific authorization for the search and seizure of computers (Vu) and modified the common law approach to searches incident to arrest in the case of cell phones (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621). There are special considerations associated with electronic data which suggest we should not assume that the plain view doctrine applies, or that it applies without modification. Additionally, we did not receive any submissions on the issue. We would leave that issue for another day.\n[95] As such, the police did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter and the evidence is admissible. We would dismiss the appeal.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\nRowe J. \u2014\n[96] I have read the reasons of Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9, and agree with the entirety of her analysis. To be clear, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s reasons state the opinion of a majority of this Court.\n[97] I have also read the reasons of Justices Karakatsanis and Martin. My colleagues use their reasons, at length, to criticize a precedent of this Court, R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292. Their treatment of Hape implies that its merits as a precedent can properly be questioned on this appeal.\n[98] I disagree with their approach, which goes beyond the issues raised by the parties and seeks, effectively, to overturn Hape at the invitation of interveners. This invitation, as I explain below, exceeds the well-established limits on interveners. To be clear, I neither endorse nor refute my colleagues\u2019 criticisms of Hape; I take no position on the substantive merits of the Hape framework. Rather, I object to my colleagues\u2019 methodology, which has led them to state an opinion on an issue that is not properly before this Court.\n[99] While my colleagues are correct that the applicability of the Charter was argued at length by the parties, their reasons do not explain the litigation fully: the parties disputed whether the Charter applies in this case, assuming the application of Hape as precedent. No party \u2e3a not at trial, or before the Court Martial Appeal Court, or before this Court \u2e3a challenged Hape. Rather, they sought to apply it, and its exceptions, to the facts of their dispute. Counsel for the respondent argued that this case was a \u201cstraightforward application of Hape\u201d (R.F., at para. 51) and, in oral submissions, urged the Court not to revisit Hape (transcript, at pp. 118-19). The appellant\u2019s submissions focused on the applicability of the exceptions set out in Hape (A.F., at paras. 86-181). The appellant did not ask this Court to overturn Hape, nor did he lead evidence at the lower courts to support overturning a precedent. The military judge and the Court Martial Appeal Court treated this case as an unremarkable application of the Hape framework.\n[100] My colleagues\u2019 insistence, then, that neither they nor the interveners have strayed from the issue before the Court is untenable. The arguments on the merits of Hape were advanced solely by interveners at this Court, thereby introducing a new issue. This Court\u2019s practice direction, on which my colleagues rely (para. 82), cautions against this situation: interveners are to advance their own view of a legal issue before the Court; they must not introduce new issues; and the Court always retains a discretion to take any steps it sees fit to prevent unfairness to the parties (see Notice to the Profession: November 2021 \u2014 Interventions, November 15, 2021 (online) (\u201cNotice of November 2021\u201d)).\n[101] To that end, I disagree with my colleagues\u2019 suggestion that the interveners\u2019 submissions are simply a different perspective on a legal issue that is before the Court. This would effectively mean that any time a governing precedent is relevant to deciding a case, interveners could insert themselves before this Court to call for it to be overturned, thereby \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d onto the parties\u2019 dispute what amounts to a reference on a judicial decision which the interveners wish to overturn. Such an approach does not accord with the rules of this Court. In addition, as an important policy consideration, it runs the risk that this Court will make ill-advised decisions, as they would be made without the benefit of lower court analysis, a proper evidentiary record, or submissions from those who would be affected (including vulnerable groups) but who had no notice that the issue would be placed before the Court. It is this simple: the issue of whether Hape should continue to govern was not before the lower courts, nor is it before this Court. In light thereof, I seek to explain the proper place of interveners relative to the discharge of this Court\u2019s adjudicative role.\n[102] While the discussion that follows is directed to the place of interveners, I note a separate methodological point. My colleagues rely heavily on what they perceive to be academic consensus that is critical of Hape. I will not repeat what was set out at length in the concurring reasons in R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, save to highlight that primarily relying on such an approach undermines stare decisis and leads to doctrinal instability (paras. 246-49). Academic criticism can be persuasive where it demonstrates a recognized basis to overturn precedent, but this Court cannot depart from precedent \u201csimply because a chorus of voices, even well-informed voices, expresses disagreement with our decisions\u201d (para. 247, referring to Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 274, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring). Moreover, I am concerned by my colleagues\u2019 insistence that this Court is free to depart from precedent at will, a fortiori, to do so without submissions or an evidentiary record (para. 82). Adherence to precedent \u201cfurthers basic rule of law values such as consistency, certainty, fairness, predictability, and sound judicial administration\u201d (R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, at para. 64). Departing from precedent in the absence of proper methodology necessarily jeopardizes those qualities of our legal system. Indeed, applying my colleagues\u2019 implicit criteria, it would be hard to imagine a judgment of the Court that could be considered secure. Having made this point, I now return to the place of interveners.\nI. The Place of Interveners at the Supreme Court of Canada\n[103] The purpose of an intervention is to \u201cpresent the court with submissions which are useful and different from the perspective of a non\u2011party who has a special interest or particular expertise in the subject matter of the appeal\u201d (R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 462, at p. 463; see also R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 52; Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR\/2002-156, r. 57(2)(b)). Interveners provide additional perspectives on the legal issues raised by the parties and on the broader implications of the Court\u2019s decision. Depending on the context, interveners might highlight relevant jurisprudence, present insightful arguments, or clarify the potential analytical paths to resolving the issues placed before the Court. Interveners may also enhance accuracy by representing diverse cross-sections of the Canadian public and furnishing an analysis informed by their particular experience or specialized expertise. Since the cases heard by this Court are frequently matters of public importance, such experience and expertise can \u201cassist the court in deciding complex issues that have effects transcending the interests of the particular parties before it\u201d (Barton, at para. 52). Through their submissions, interveners inform the Court of the direct and indirect consequences of the dispute on various stakeholders and on other areas of law. In this way, interveners can often make important contributions. In order to do so, however, interveners must operate within recognized limits. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada clearly state these limits, and this Court has issued practice directions, more than once, to remind potential interveners of the boundaries they must respect (see Notice of November 2021; Notice to the Profession: March 2017 \u2014 Allotting Time for Oral Argument, March 2, 2017 (online)).\n[104] These constraints reflect a sound understanding of interveners\u2019 place within the litigation and of the role of this Court. While the Court is often tasked with deciding issues that have implications extending beyond the parties, it remains an adjudicative body. The polycentric nature of a legal issue does not turn the Court into a legislative committee or a Royal Commission (J.H. v. Alberta (Minister of Justice and Solicitor General), 2019 ABCA 420, 54 C.P.C. (8th) 346, at paras. 25-27). The Court\u2019s process also remains firmly grounded in the adversarial system: the parties control their case and decide which issues to raise. This does not change when the parties argue before the Supreme Court. Indeed, the importance of this principle only increases: as an apex court, this Court\u2019s role is to adjudicate disputes with the benefit of trial-level findings of fact and appellate-level reasons on the issues fully argued by the parties.\n[105] Such considerations help explain the specific limits placed on interventions. First, interveners are not parties. The purpose of an intervention is not to support a party \u2014 by which I mean the appellant(s) and respondent(s) \u2014 but to put forward the intervener\u2019s own view of a legal issue already before the Court. Despite the involvement of interveners, the appeal remains a dispute between the parties (Notice of November 2021, at point 2). Consequently, interveners should not take a position on the outcome of the appeal (Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 42(3); Notice of November 2021, at point 3).\n[106] Secondly, interveners must not raise new issues or \u201cwiden or add to the points in issue\u201d (Morgentaler, at p. 463; Reference re Goods and Services Tax, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 445, at p. 487; Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 59(3); Notice of November 2021, at point 4). Interveners may, however, present their own legal arguments on the existing issues and make submissions on how those issues affect the interests of those whom they represent (see, e.g., Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, at para. 40; Canada (Justice) v. Khadr, 2008 SCC 29, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 143, at para. 18; Barton, at para. 52).\n[107] Interveners must be careful to distinguish between developing a permissible legal argument and adding prohibited new issues; the two are conceptually distinct. A fresh perspective or legal argument on an existing issue is not the same as the introduction of a new issue, outside the scope of the appeal or, even further, in contradiction to the parties\u2019 submissions regarding the scope of the appeal. The former may assist the Court\u2019s deliberation, while the latter detracts from it. While in rare cases it may be difficult to distinguish between the two, this appeal is not such a case. By asking this Court to overturn Hape, certain interveners, upon whom Justices Karakatsanis and Martin rely, have introduced what is clearly a new issue.\n[108] Finally, interveners must not adduce further evidence or otherwise supplement the record without leave (Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 59(1)(b)). They may, of course, use their submissions to explain the impact of the appeal on the group(s) they represent; this represents an appropriate exercise of their role. But they must take the case and the record as they find it, or seek leave to tender new material, such as supplementary legislative facts or contested studies (see, e.g., D. L. Watt et al., Supreme Court of Canada Practice 2022 (2022), at pp. 369-70, referring to R.J.R. MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), Bulletin of Proceedings, June 10, 1994, at p. 990, and Anderson v. Amoco Canada Oil and Gas, Bulletin of Proceedings, March 19, 2004, p. 453). This Court, as always, retains a discretion to take any steps it sees fit where an intervener presents new evidence without leave or otherwise makes improper submissions (see Notice of November 2021, at point 6).\n[109] In sum, an intervener can make useful contributions when it respects the rules, practice directions, and jurisprudence of this Court. By contrast, it exceeds its role when it seeks to alter the nature of the litigation by usurping the role of the parties, expanding the issues before the Court, or presenting new evidence. An intervention that contravenes these settled rules is improper, and has negative consequences for the parties, potential interveners, and the administration of justice.\nII. The Consequences of Improper Interventions\n[110] Interveners who stray beyond their proper role, first of all, cause prejudice to the parties by usurping control of the litigation. The parties \u2014 not interveners \u2014 are meant to control their own litigation. They define the issues and the relief sought. Proper intervention is consistent with this distribution of responsibilities because it is responsive to the issues the parties have raised. Improper intervention jeopardizes fairness by forcing the parties to respond to issues on which they did not adduce evidence at trial and by \u201ctak[ing] the litigation away from those directly affected by it\u201d (Attorney-General of Canada v. Aluminum Co. of Canada (1987), 35 D.L.R. (4th) 495 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 507; M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 4-5; see also R. v. N.S., 2021 ONCA 605, 497 C.R.R. (2d) 75, at para. 49). Practical forms of unfairness may also befall the parties as a result of improper intervention, including increased legal costs, delays in responding to intervener submissions, or being forced to bring motions to strike parts of an intervener\u2019s submissions.\n[111] Secondly, and most fundamentally, interveners who improperly add to or expand the issues on appeal may cause deleterious effects to the proper administration of justice. The potential for inaccuracy increases where interveners invite the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions or a full evidentiary record.\n[112] Thirdly, improper interventions undermine the leave to appeal process. The Court decides whether to grant or deny leave upon careful consideration of the existing record and the issues specifically raised by the parties. Where an intervener\u2019s arguments fall outside of the set of issues for which leave has been granted, the Court\u2019s careful consideration at the leave stage is frustrated.\n[113] Finally, potential interveners, whether organizations or Attorneys General, decide whether to intervene based on the issues placed before the Court by the parties. Where interveners expand that set of issues, would-be interveners who have decided not to intervene are prejudiced. They might have decided differently had they been made aware that new issues would be raised (see Morgentaler, at pp. 463-64). By the time interveners have introduced the new issues, however, it is too late: the would-be interveners have already been deprived of the opportunity to present, and the Court has been deprived of the opportunity to receive, valuable perspectives on these new issues.\n[114] The present appeal illustrates these serious consequences. Raising the new issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is an improper intervention. It undercuts the parties\u2019 control of their litigation and, in fact, runs contrary to their submissions that this Court should apply Hape. It undermines the leave to appeal process and excludes would-be interveners who could make useful submissions on the extraterritorial application of the Charter . And, rather than further the accuracy of decision making, it invites the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions, a full evidentiary record, or submissions from the parties.\n[115] This Court\u2019s rules, practice directions, and jurisprudence are carefully designed to avoid these consequences, while ensuring that interveners properly assist the Court. It is therefore critical for interveners to adhere to these limits. When they do so, they can make useful contributions grounded in their expertise and experience. However, that is not what occurred in the present case, as certain interveners overstepped the well-established limits on their role. The issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is not before the Court. Neither party has called this framework into question; indeed, both the appellant and respondent have relied on it. I therefore reject my colleagues\u2019 decision to accept the invitation from certain interveners and revisit Hape as precedent. Their reasons exacerbate the harms created by improper interventions and undermine the limits that preclude the introduction of new issues. In light of the foregoing, I endorse the reasons of Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9.\nAPPENDIX\nRelevant Legislation and Treaties\nAgreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, Can.

Neither of the two victims of the robbery clearly saw the perpetrators, who were masked. The Crown\u2019s case to identify the accused as a participant in the robbery relied entirely on two pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the accused\u2019s DNA found on a cigarette butt in the vehicle of one of the victims, which was stolen from the scene and found abandoned after the robbery; and (2) the testimony of that same victim that he may have heard the accused\u2019s last name spoken by one of the perpetrators during the robbery. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused\u2019s conviction appeal. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and substituted acquittals on the basis that the verdicts of guilt were unreasonable.\nHeld (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The convictions should be set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted. The verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.\nThe DNA evidence alone was not sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At best, it permitted an inference that the accused was in the vehicle at some point in time prior to its recovery, but there was no evidence indicating when and why he may have been in the vehicle.\nThe victim\u2019s testimony that he heard the accused\u2019s last name during the robbery was fraught with frailties. The trial judge\u2019s acceptance of the reliability of the victim\u2019s evidence cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence. The trial judge misapprehended an aspect of the victim\u2019s testimony and failed to meaningfully address many of the concerns surrounding the victim\u2019s physical or mental state.\nConsidering the totality of the evidence, no trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused\u2019s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available. In light of the evidentiary weaknesses, this is not an instance in which the accused\u2019s decision not to testify at trial can be raised against him.\nPer C\u00f4t\u00e9 and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed and the accused\u2019s convictions upheld. The trial judge could reasonably be satisfied that the accused\u2019s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence.\nFirst, it was open to the trial judge to consider the total absence of any reasonable explanation for the presence of the accused\u2019s DNA in the stolen vehicle. The trial judge did not consider the DNA evidence in a vacuum but relied on additional evidence to eliminate the possibility that the cigarette butt could have gotten into the stolen vehicle before or outside of the robbery. This evidence cried out for an explanation that only the accused\u2019s testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent.\nSecond, the trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the identification evidence. His finding that the victim was a credible and reliable witness is entitled to deference. Whether a different trier of fact may have reached a different conclusion does not justify appellate interference. The combined effect of the identification evidence and strong DNA evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience, allowed the judge to infer guilt on the underlying robbery.\nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\nReferred to: R. v.

No. 79 (QL), 2022 CarswellAlta 187 (WL), affirming the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting.\nJennifer Ruttan and Danielle Gregoire, for the appellant.\nTom Spark, for the respondent.\nThe reasons for judgment of Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ. were delivered by\nRowe J. \u2014\n[1] The appellant, Shawn Metzger, appeals as of right from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissing his appeal from convictions by a judge sitting alone for a number of offences arising from a home invasion robbery: 2022 ABCA 16. Identity was the sole issue at trial. Neither of the two victims of the robbery clearly saw the perpetrators, who numbered three or four, as the perpetrators were masked. The Crown\u2019s case to identify the appellant as a participant in the robbery relied entirely on two pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the appellant\u2019s DNA found on a cigarette butt in the vehicle of one of the victims, Mr. Iten, which was stolen from the scene and found abandoned approximately 11 hours after the robbery; and (2) the testimony of Mr. Iten that he may have heard the name \u201cMetzger\u201d spoken by one of the intruders during the robbery. On this evidence, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the robbery. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant\u2019s conviction appeal. Veldhuis J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and substituted acquittals on the basis that the verdicts of guilt were unreasonable.\n[2] I am of the view that the verdicts were unreasonable and that the appeal should be allowed. Even accounting for the privileged position of the trial judge, I am satisfied that the guilty verdicts cannot be supported by the evidence: R. v. Brunelle, 2022 SCC 5, at para. 7.\n[3] The trial judge acknowledged that the DNA evidence, standing alone, would not be sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I agree with that conclusion. The DNA evidence at best permitted an inference that the appellant was in the vehicle at some point in time prior to its recovery by the police. There was no evidence indicating when and why the appellant may have been in the vehicle, which was unaccounted for during the 11 hours between the robbery and its recovery. Mr. Iten also routinely left the keys in the vehicle prior to the robbery. As the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal noted, there were also pieces of clothing and other items in the vehicle that the forensic identification officer acknowledged were not sent for DNA analysis. In these circumstances, the DNA evidence alone could not have established a case to meet against the appellant with respect to participation in the robbery.\n[4] The other piece of circumstantial evidence that supported the DNA evidence was Mr. Iten\u2019s testimony that he had heard the name \u201cMetzger\u201d during the robbery. However, that evidence was fraught with frailties. Mr. Iten was struck on the head with a baseball bat at the outset of the robbery and was fading in and out of consciousness. In his testimony, he actively questioned his own recollection of what he had heard. He did not mention to the police during his initial interviews that he had overheard the name \u201cMetzger\u201d; rather, an investigating officer first mentioned the name to Mr. Iten during a telephone interview, months or possibly years after the robbery. When asked at trial whether he recalled hearing the name before that telephone interview, Mr. Iten said that he did; he indicated this was based on discussions that he had after the robbery with the second victim, Mr. Rivard, who Mr. Iten believed shared the same recollection. However, this was not corroborated by Mr. Rivard in his testimony. Mr. Iten also contemplated that his recollection of hearing the name may have been a false memory due to childhood trauma arising from personal associations with the German word \u201cmetzger\u201d, meaning \u201cbutcher\u201d, which is Mr. Iten\u2019s lifetime vocation.\n[5] Although no issue is raised with respect to Mr. Iten\u2019s honesty, in my view, this is one of the rare instances where the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of the reliability of Mr. Iten\u2019s evidence cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence: R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7; Brunelle, at para. 8. The trial judge wrongly concluded that \u201c[n]othing turns\u201d on the inconsistency between Mr. Iten\u2019s and Mr. Rivard\u2019s evidence because they were in different rooms and may have heard different things; the trial judge misapprehended the fact that Mr. Iten testified they had the same recollection. The trial judge also failed to meaningfully address many of the concerns surrounding Mr. Iten\u2019s physical or mental state during and after the robbery.\n[6] Considering the totality of the evidence \u2014 including the frailties in Mr. Iten\u2019s evidence and the absence of any other inculpatory evidence except for the presence of the appellant\u2019s DNA on the cigarette butt \u2014 I am satisfied that no \u201ctrier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused\u2019s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available\u201d: R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 55. The verdicts were therefore unreasonable.\n[7] In light of the evidentiary weaknesses of both the DNA evidence and Mr. Iten\u2019s recollection, I respectfully disagree with the view that this is an instance in which the appellant\u2019s decision not to testify at trial can be raised against him. As the dissenting judge noted, quoting from R. v. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, at para. 69,\nthis was not a case in which the evidence cried out for an explanation that only the appellant\u2019s testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent. It was a very weak Crown case built on identification. The failure of the accused to testify does not undermine his argument that the verdict was unreasonable.\n(C.A. reasons, at para. 87 (CanLII))\n[8] It is not necessary to address the appellant\u2019s additional arguments concerning the doctrine of recent possession.\n[9] I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and substitute verdicts of acquittal.\nThe reasons of C\u00f4t\u00e9 and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. were delivered by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 J. \u2014\n[10] The appellant, Shawn Metzger, appeals as of right from his convictions for robbery and break and enter arising from a home invasion on June 24, 2017. Identity was the sole issue at trial. Neither of the victims was able to see the three or four intruders, who were masked. After the robbery, the intruders drove away in a truck owned by one of the occupants, Mr. Valentin Iten. The truck was found abandoned and locked roughly 11 hours later. A cigarette butt was found under the driver\u2019s seat and sent for DNA analysis, which returned a single profile matching the appellant.\n[11] The main issue in this appeal is whether it was unreasonable for the trial judge to convict the appellant based on (1) the presence of his DNA in the stolen truck; and (2) Mr. Iten\u2019s testimony that he heard the appellant\u2019s last name, \u201cMetzger\u201d, used during the robbery. The majority of the court below dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal, finding that the verdicts were not unreasonable (2022 ABCA 16). I agree. In my view, the trial judge could reasonably be satisfied that the appellant\u2019s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence (R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 55).\n[12] In the circumstances, there was no reasonable explanation for why the appellant\u2019s DNA was found on a cigarette butt under the driver\u2019s seat of the stolen truck, if not for his involvement in the robbery less than 12 hours earlier. The trial judge did not consider the DNA evidence in a vacuum. Rather, he relied on additional evidence to eliminate the possibility that the cigarette butt could have gotten into the stolen truck before or outside of the robbery. It is undisputed that Mr. Iten did not know the appellant. It is important to emphasize that \u201c[n]obody else used the truck\u201d around the time of the robbery (trial reasons, reproduced in A.R., at p. 21). Mr. Iten and his roommate both heard the truck start at the end of the robbery. The truck was found locked and showed no signs of forced entry. The cigarette butt was found under the driver\u2019s seat, and the DNA matched only the appellant\u2019s profile. Taken together, this evidence \u201ccried out for an explanation that only the appellant\u2019s testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent\u201d (R. v. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, at para. 69; see also R. v. George\u2011Nurse, 2019 SCC 12, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 570, at para. 1). It was open to the judge to consider the \u201ctotal absence of any kind of reasonable explanation\u201d (R. v. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 73; see also R. v. Noble, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at para. 103) for the presence of the appellant\u2019s DNA in a stolen truck found mere hours after the robbery and a short distance away from the victims\u2019 residence.\n[13] While some may view the \u201cMetzger\u201d identification evidence as weaker, the trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the evidence (R. v. Brunelle, 2022 SCC 5, at para. 9, citing R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 62). The question is whether his findings were [translation] \u201csufficiently supported by the evidence and involve[d] no palpable and overriding error\u201d (Brunelle, at para. 8). I agree with the majority of the court below that the trial judge\u2019s finding that Mr. Iten was a credible and reliable witness is entitled to deference. Whether a different trier of fact may have reached a different conclusion does not justify appellate interference (C.A. reasons, at paras. 26 and 34 (CanLII)). In any event, it was the combined effect of the identification evidence and the strong DNA evidence that allowed the judge to infer guilt on the underlying robbery.\n[14] The authorities referred to by the appellant, in which DNA or fingerprint evidence was found insufficient to infer guilt on the underlying theft or robbery, are distinguishable. In R. v. Mars (2006), 206 O.A.C. 387, there was no evidence that assisted in determining when the accused\u2019s fingerprint was placed on a pizza box used in committing a robbery (para. 21). Further, evidence given by a neighbour, who described all three robbers as black, \u201ceffectively excluded the appellant who . . . is white\u201d (per Doherty J.A., at para. 27). Similarly, in R. v. Nicholl (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 549 (Ont. C.A.), where a pop can with the accused\u2019s thumbprint on it was found in a vehicle two weeks after it was stolen, and in R. v. Grayston, 2016 ONCA 784, where a balaclava with DNA from the accused and other individuals was found in a stolen vehicle, this evidence was held to be compatible with explanations other than guilt. In R. v. Ahmed, 2015 ONCA 848, the accused\u2019s DNA was found \u2014 together with three other DNA matches \u2014 on a plastic grocery bag used during a robbery, which bags are \u201ccommonplace, portable, disposable and reusable\u201d (para. 7 (CanLII)). Given the generic nature of the eyewitness descriptions relied on by the Crown, the evidence did not go far enough to support the inference that the accused\u2019s DNA had been deposited on the bag during the robbery.\n[15] By contrast, there was additional evidence in this case that permitted the trial judge to determine when the appellant\u2019s cigarette was left in the stolen truck. I also note that DNA evidence, either alone or in combination with \u201cless than strong\u201d identification evidence, has served to ground verdicts of guilt in similar cases (R. v. Stjepanovic, 2006 BCCA 169, 223 B.C.A.C. 226, at paras. 10\u201111; see also R. v. O\u2019Brien, 2011 SCC 29, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 485, at paras. 2 and 13\u201116).\n[16] This is not a case where the judge\u2019s verdict \u201ccannot be supported by the evidence\u201d (Brunelle, at para. 7). Rather, the verdict is one that a properly instructed trier of fact could reasonably have rendered (Villaroman, at para. 55). The judge was entitled to conclude that the \u201ccircumstantial evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience\u201d, was not reasonably capable of supporting an inference other than that the appellant was guilty (Villaroman, at para. 38). I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellant\u2019s convictions.\nAppeal allowed, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and O\u2019Bonsawin JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ruttan Bates, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\n"

C\u201146, s. 162(1) (a).\nThe accused was convicted of 2 counts of voyeurism for surreptitiously taking 38 photos of 2 boys aged between 12 and 14 years old in their underwear in hockey arena dressing rooms. The accused was the boys\u2019 hockey coach. The trial judge held that the Crown had proved the four elements of the voyeurism offence under s. 162(1) (a) of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt: the accused took the photos of the boys (1) intentionally; (2) surreptitiously; (3) in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and (4) in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Specifically, regarding the fourth element, she effectively interpreted s. 162(1) (a) as having no implicit temporal component, stating that s. 162(1) (a) focuses on the nature of the place in which an observation or recording is made, but does not require that the person who is the subject of the observation or recording was, or ever had been, nude, or that the person could reasonably be expected to be nude. She found that individuals of various ages change their underwear or shower in dressing rooms, and thus can reasonably be expected to be nude in them, and that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of s. 162(1) (a).\nA majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the accused\u2019s appeal, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial. It concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected at the time when the offences allegedly occurred. It stated that s. 162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the appeal. She was of the view that s. 162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the \u201cplace\u201d, which, under s. 162(1)(a), is a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.\nProperly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, s. 162(1) (a) of the Criminal Code has no implicit temporal component. Accordingly, the Crown need not establish that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the place at the specific time when the photos were taken. As a result, the trial judge appropriately convicted the accused of voyeurism under s. 162(1) (a).\nParliament\u2019s purposes in enacting the voyeurism offence in s. 162(1) were to protect individuals\u2019 privacy and sexual integrity. Parliament\u2019s objective of protecting privacy appears in the opening words of s. 162(1), which refer to circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. These are circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred. As for Parliament\u2019s objective of protecting sexual integrity, it is apparent in each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1). Section 162(1)(a) protects the sexual integrity of persons in specific places. It does not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may reasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom. In addition, para. (a) does not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. Section 162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in specific activities: when the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Under para. (b), the nature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Similarly to para. (a), the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose. Section 162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. It applies whether the subject is clothed or unclothed \u2014 no matter what they are doing, and regardless of the location of the targeted subject. The opening words of s. 162(1) also protect sexual integrity, and each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) also protect privacy.\nThe question as to whether the \u201cplace\u201d referred to in s. 162(1)(a) is qualified by an implicit temporal component is one of statutory interpretation. The words in s. 162(1)(a) must be considered in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. Section 162(1)(a) must be interpreted according to a textual, contextual, and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. The text of s. 162(1)(a) refers to a test for the \u201cplace\u201d that is objective in two respects. First, s. 162(1)(a) uses the definite article \u201cthe person\u201d when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article \u201ca person\u201d when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that the person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s. 162(1)(a) asks whether a person can reasonably be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude.\nThe use of an objective test in s. 162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time. The key textual point is the lack of express language in s. 162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the \u201cplace\u201d to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly by referring to the observation or recording being made in a place in which a person can then reasonably be expected to be nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording.\nThe statutory context and purpose of s. 162(1)(a) also suggest that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component. Parliament\u2019s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as a location\u2011based offence without a temporal component. Rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s. 162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way. Section 162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially \u201csafe places\u201d, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non\u2011consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially \u201csafe place\u201d violates trust and can result in the person\u2019s humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self\u2011esteem, and can cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. In this way, s. 162(1)(a) protects privacy, as well as sexual integrity as it is understood today.\nCases Cited\nConsidered: R. v.

Overview\n[1] This appeal concerns the scope of the voyeurism offence in s. 162(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . Section 162(1) (a) provides that it is an offence to surreptitiously observe or make a visual recording of a person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if the person is in \u201ca place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity\u201d. The question in this appeal is whether the \u201cplace\u201d referred to in s. 162(1) (a) is qualified by an implicit temporal component; specifically, must the person be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude at the specific time when the person is surreptitiously observed or recorded?\n[2] On the facts of this case, the issue is whether a hockey coach, the respondent, Randy William Downes, committed the offence of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) by surreptitiously photographing 2 boys aged between 12 and 14 years old in their underwear in hockey arena dressing rooms, even if a person could not reasonably be expected to be nude at the specific time when the photos were taken. There was conflicting evidence at trial on whether boys at this age shower or are nude in dressing rooms.\n[3] The trial judge relied on this Court\u2019s decision in R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, on the scope of the voyeurism offence. She effectively interpreted s. 162(1)(a) as having no implicit temporal component, and convicted Mr. Downes of two counts of voyeurism. A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (per Willcock J.A., Grauer J.A. concurring) disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge had failed to address conflicts in the evidence about whether nudity could reasonably be expected when the photos were taken. In dissent, Dickson J.A. agreed with the trial judge and would have dismissed the appeal.\n[4] The Crown now appeals to this Court as of right on the question of law as to whether s. 162(1)(a) has an implicit temporal component. In addition, Mr. Downes submits that if s. 162(1)(a) is interpreted as lacking a temporal component, then the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial. He raised it for the first time before the Court of Appeal, but the court did not address it.\n[5] In my view, properly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, s. 162(1)(a) has no implicit temporal component. The text of s. 162(1)(a) lacks language suggesting that Parliament intended the \u201cplace\u201d to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Further, as this Court observed in Jarvis, Parliament\u2019s purposes in enacting the voyeurism offence were to protect individuals\u2019 privacy and sexual integrity. Those purposes are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) without an implicit temporal component, and would be detracted from by reading in such a component. In effect, s. 162(1)(a) designates places such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms as \u201csafe places\u201d where people should be free from intrusions onto their privacy and sexual integrity, whether or not a person in the place could reasonably be expected to be nude or engaged in sexual activity at the specific time the person is surreptitiously observed or recorded. Finally, I would decline to address the constitutional issue because this is not an appropriate case for this Court to exceptionally exercise its discretion to decide such an issue for the first time on appeal. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the convictions.\nII. Background\n[6] Mr. Downes was convicted of 2 counts of voyeurism under s. 162(1) (a) of the Criminal Code for surreptitiously taking 38 photos of 2 adolescent male hockey players, T.R. and G.C., in hockey dressing rooms. Mr. Downes was the boys\u2019 hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his home.\n[7] In March 2016, Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) officers searched Mr. Downes\u2019 electronic devices at the border when he returned to Canada from the United States after a brief shopping trip and found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker rooms. Mr. Downes explained to the CBSA that the photos were from his sports photography business. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child pornography on his home computer.\n[8] In April 2016, the RCMP obtained and executed a warrant to search Mr. Downes\u2019 home and electronic devices. They found the photos of T.R. and G.C. that led to the voyeurism charges. The photos of T.R. were taken when he was 13 or 14 years old and show him sitting on a bench wearing only his underwear, revealing his crotch area and bare torso, or putting on street clothes after a hockey practice. The photos of G.C. were taken when he was about 12 years old and show him wearing only his underwear, wearing a shirt and underwear, or fully clothed; in some photos, G.C. is standing clothed at a sink in the washroom area of a dressing room. Mr. Downes told the RCMP that he liked young boys but that it was \u201cnot a sexual thing\u201d (A.R., vol. III, at p. 207).\n[9] Mr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. using his iPhone. He deleted some photos but emailed others to himself, downloaded them onto a computer, and copied them onto a USB stick. He also cropped some photos to focus on G.C.\n[10] None of T.R., G.C., or G.C.\u2019s mother knew that Mr. Downes had taken the photos. The trial judge found that Mr. Downes likely knew that a hockey league rule prohibited the use of cell phones in dressing rooms to prevent photos being taken of children.\n[11] At trial, both parties led evidence about whether a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in a hockey dressing room. The evidence centred on whether boys would remove their underwear or shower in dressing rooms. T.R. and G.C. testified that they did not shower in dressing rooms, but that some of their teammates did. One of Mr. Downes\u2019 former hockey players testified that he would change his underwear in dressing rooms, and although he did not shower, other players occasionally did. Another of Mr. Downes\u2019 former hockey players testified that from ages 11 to 14 or 15 he never got completely naked or showered in dressing rooms and never saw others do so. Three hockey coaches (two of whom had coached with Mr. Downes) testified that boys of T.R. and G.C.\u2019s ages rarely are naked or shower in dressing rooms; a former manager of one of Mr. Downes\u2019 hockey teams testified to the same effect. One hockey coach explained that this was because boys of T.R. and G.C.\u2019s ages are too self-conscious about their bodies. But it was common ground that children a little older than T.R. and G.C. and adults often are naked or shower in dressing rooms.\nIII. Decisions Below\nA. Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2019 BCSC 992 (MacNaughton J.)\n[12] The trial judge convicted Mr. Downes on both voyeurism charges. She held that the Crown had proved the four elements of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) beyond a reasonable doubt: Mr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. (1) intentionally, (2) surreptitiously, (3) in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (4) in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.\n[13] The trial judge applied the contextual factors identified by this Court in Jarvis and found that T.R. and G.C. were in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. She noted that T.R. and G.C. were in a private or semi-private place set aside for dressing and undressing; their parents entrusted them to Mr. Downes, an experienced coach; and they did not expect to be photographed by their coach through the surreptitious use of a cell phone for non-instructional purposes. The trial judge ruled that although T.R. and G.C. would expect to be observed by others in the dressing room, they would not expect to be photographed, nor would they expect Mr. Downes to email photos of them to himself and to keep them long after he stopped having contact with them.\n[14] At trial, Mr. Downes did not expressly argue that s. 162(1)(a) contains an implicit temporal component. Instead, he argued that the Crown had to prove that T.R. and G.C. were in a place in which they could reasonably be expected to be nude. He argued that the evidence showed that neither T.R. nor G.C. had any expectation of being nude in the dressing rooms in which they were photographed. The trial judge rejected that argument. She stated that s. 162(1)(a) focuses on the nature of the place in which an observation or recording is made, but does not require that the person who is the subject of the observation or recording was, or ever had been, nude, or that the person could reasonably be expected to be nude. It is sufficient under s. 162(1)(a) that a person (not \u201cthe person\u201d) could reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. In the trial judge\u2019s view, homes, bathrooms, and changing rooms are traditionally private or quasi-private places in which a person can reasonably expect privacy, and in which they can reasonably be expected to be nude or partially nude. The focus in s. 162(1)(a) on the place in which an observation or recording is made recognizes that there are private or semi\u2011private spaces in which a person should be protected from being observed or recorded.\n[15] The trial judge found that individuals of various ages change their underwear or shower in dressing rooms, and thus can reasonably be expected to be nude in them. She concluded that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of s. 162(1)(a). As a result, the dressing rooms where Mr. Downes photographed T.R. and G.C. were places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.\nB. Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2022 BCCA 8, 409 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Willcock and Grauer JJ.A., Dickson J.A. Dissenting)\n[16] A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed Mr. Downes\u2019 appeal, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected \u201cat the time\u201d when the offences allegedly occurred (paras. 40 and 55). The majority stated that s. 162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. In its view, s. 162(1)(a) does not criminalize an invasion of privacy alone. The majority noted that although Mr. Downes\u2019 conduct involved a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy, that did not necessarily make it conduct that s. 162(1)(a) criminalized as a sexual offence.\n[17] The majority ruled that although it was open to the trial judge to find that nudity was reasonably expected in the dressing rooms in which T.R. and G.C. were photographed, she had failed to address conflicts in the evidence on whether nudity was expected at the time the photos were taken. The majority therefore ordered a new trial.\n[18] Dickson J.A. dissented. In her view, s. 162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the \u201cplace\u201d. The relevant place under s. 162(1)(a) is \u201ca place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, exposing intimate body parts or engaging in sexual activity, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred\u201d (para. 56 (emphasis in original)). She stated that when a person is in \u201ca manifestly private place such as a bathroom or dressing room they are generally entitled to expect that they will not be surreptitiously observed or recorded there\u201d (para. 92). In her view, Parliament intended to criminalize surreptitious observation or recording of persons in such places.\n[19] Dickson J.A. concluded that Mr. Downes criminally invaded the personal privacy and sexual integrity of T.R. and G.C. by surreptitiously photographing them in their underwear in the dressing rooms, irrespective of whether nudity could be expected at that specific time. His conduct was \u201cseriously exploitative and personally invasive\u201d, and was \u201cappropriately criminalized as a form of sexual offence\u201d (para. 97).\nIV. Issues\n[20] This appeal raises two issues:\n(1) Does s. 162(1) (a) of the Criminal Code have an implicit temporal component?\n(2) If s. 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component, is the provision unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Charter ?\nV. Analysis\nA. Does Section 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code Have an Implicit Temporal Component?\n(1) The Voyeurism Offence\n[21] Parliament enacted the voyeurism offence, s. 162(1) of the Criminal Code , in 2005. Section 162(1) provides:\nVoyeurism\n162 (1) Every one commits an offence who, surreptitiously, observes \u2014 including by mechanical or electronic means \u2014 or makes a visual recording of a person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if\n(a) the person is in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity;\n(b) the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity; or\n(c) the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose.\n[22] Mr. Downes was charged with voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a). The offence is committed when a person surreptitiously observes or makes a visual recording of another person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if the observation or recording is done in \u201ca place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity\u201d. A \u201cvisual recording\u201d under s. 162 is defined under subs. (2) as including \u201ca photographic, film or video recording made by any means\u201d.\n[23] It is not disputed that the photos taken by Mr. Downes are \u201cvisual recordings\u201d. It is also no longer disputed that Mr. Downes took the photos surreptitiously and in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The issue before this Court is whether the photos were taken in \u201ca place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude\u201d. Does this element of the offence have a temporal component? Must the Crown establish that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the place at the specific time when the photos were taken?\n[24] This question of statutory interpretation requires this Court to consider the words in s. 162(1)(a) \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Jarvis, at para. 24). Section 162(1)(a) must be interpreted \u201caccording to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole\u201d (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10).\n[25] In what follows, I will first review this Court\u2019s decision in Jarvis and the purposes of the voyeurism offence. I will then interpret s. 162(1)(a) based on its text, context, and purpose.\n(2) This Court\u2019s Decision in Jarvis and the Purposes of Section 162(1)\n[26] This Court considered s. 162(1) for the first time in Jarvis. In that case, this Court ruled that a high school teacher who used a camera concealed inside a pen to surreptitiously record female students at the school by focussing on their faces, upper bodies, and breasts, committed the offence of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(c) (\u201cthe observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose\u201d). The elements of the offence were established because the students were surreptitiously recorded in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy and the recordings were made for a sexual purpose.\n[27] In Jarvis, Wagner C.J. for the majority noted that the voyeurism offence was enacted as part of Bill C-2, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, 1st Sess., 38th Parl., 2004-2005 (assented to July 20, 2005), the overarching purpose of which was to \u201cprotect children and other vulnerable persons from sexual exploitation, violence, abuse and neglect\u201d (para. 51). Most sex crimes, including voyeurism, are committed by men, while the victims are usually women and children (see Department of Justice, Voyeurism as a Criminal Offence: A Consultation Paper (2002), at p. 4; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 65, citing R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 2; J. Bailey, \u201cImplicitly Feminist?: The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s Decision in R v Jarvis\u201d (2020), 32 C.J.W.L. 196, at pp. 200-201).\n[28] Parliament\u2019s object in enacting s. 162(1), Wagner C.J. found in Jarvis, was \u201cto protect individuals\u2019 privacy and sexual integrity, particularly from new threats posed by the abuse of evolving technologies\u201d (para. 48). The new voyeurism offence \u201cwas motivated by concerns about the potential for rapidly evolving technology to be abused for the secret viewing or recording of individuals for sexual purposes and in ways that involve a serious breach of privacy\u201d (para. 49, citing Department of Justice, at p. 1). Voyeurism is thus both a sexual and a privacy-based offence. Section 162(1) is intended to deal with both these related harms: behaviour that violates sexual integrity, and behaviour that breaches privacy (paras. 51-52). Rowe J., concurring in the result in Jarvis, agreed with Wagner C.J. that the purpose and object of s. 162(1) is \u201cto protect well-established interests of privacy, autonomy and sexual integrity of all individuals, in light of threats posed by new technologies to encroach upon them\u201d (para. 113).\n[29] Parliament\u2019s objectives of protecting against the related harms of violations of privacy and sexual integrity are apparent in the wording and structure of s. 162(1). I will consider each objective in turn.\n[30] Parliament\u2019s objective of protecting privacy appears in the opening words of s. 162(1), which state that it is an offence for someone to surreptitiously observe or record a person \u201cin circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d if any of paras. (a), (b), or (c) applies. In Jarvis, Wagner C.J. explained that the circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy under s. 162(1) are \u201ccircumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred\u201d (para. 28). A court should consider the entire context in which the observation or recording occurred, including the following non-exhaustive factors: (1) the location of the person when they were observed or recorded; (2) the nature of the impugned conduct (i.e., whether it consisted of observation or recording); (3) the awareness or consent of the person who was observed or recorded; (4) the manner in which the observation or recording was made; (5) the subject matter or content of the observation or recording; (6) any rules, regulations, or policies that governed the observation or recording; (7) the relationship between the parties; (8) the purpose for which the observation or recording was made; and (9) the personal attributes of the person who was observed or recorded (paras. 5 and 28-29).\n[31] Parliament\u2019s objective of protecting sexual integrity is also apparent in each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1).\n[32] Section 162(1)(a) protects the sexual integrity of persons in specific places: when \u201cthe person is in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity\u201d. I agree with the observations of Juriansz J.A. in R. v. Trinchi, 2019 ONCA 356, 145 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 8, that para. (a) \u201cdoes not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity\u201d; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may \u201creasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom\u201d (see also Jarvis, at para. 46, per Wagner C.J.; M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at \u00b621.245). I also agree that, unlike para. (c), para. (a) \u201cdoes not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. It would apply to an accused who hoped to profit by posting recordings on the Internet\u201d (Trinchi, at para. 8; see also Jarvis, at para. 32, per Wagner C.J., and at paras. 143-44, per Rowe J.).\n[33] Section 162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in specific activities: when \u201cthe person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity\u201d. I again agree with Juriansz J.A. that, under para. (b), the \u201cnature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity\u201d (Trinchi, at para. 9; see also Jarvis, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J.). In addition, the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose: \u201c[p]aragraph (b), like para. (a), would apply to an accused whose purpose was commercial\u201d (Trinchi, at para. 9; see also Jarvis, at para. 32, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 143, per Rowe J.).\n[34] Section 162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. This provision applies \u201cwhether the subject is clothed or unclothed \u2014 no matter what she or he is doing\u201d (Trinchi, at para. 10). In Jarvis, for example, the accused teacher was convicted under s. 162(1)(c), even though the students surreptitiously video recorded were fully clothed and going about common school activities. Paragraph (c) applies regardless of the location of the targeted subject (Jarvis, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 129, per Rowe J.).\n[35] I hasten to add that the opening words of s. 162(1) also protect sexual integrity, and each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) also protect privacy. Parliament\u2019s two objectives of protecting against the related harms of violations of sexual integrity and privacy appear throughout s. 162(1). For example, in considering whether a person \u201cis in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the opening words of s. 162(1), a court must consider whether a person \u201cwould reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred\u201d, based on the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in Jarvis (paras. 5 and 28-29). These considerations include factors relating to sexual integrity, such as whether the subject matter of the observation or recording includes intimate parts of a person\u2019s body (para. 29(5)), and whether the recording is for a sexual purpose (paras. 29(8) and 31-32). Similarly, paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) protect privacy from surreptitious observations or recordings in circumstances where sexual integrity is engaged.\n[36] I now turn to consider whether s. 162(1)(a) has an implicit temporal component; in other words, whether the Crown must prove that nudity was reasonably expected at the specific time when the surreptitious recording was made.\n(3) The Interpretation of Section 162(1)(a)\n(a) Positions of the Parties\n[37] The Crown submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as requiring proof that nudity is reasonably expected in the place at the specific time when a surreptitious recording is made. The Crown says that it is sufficient for it to prove that the \u201cplace\u201d where a surreptitious recording was made is one in which nudity could reasonably be expected to occur at any time. Section 162(1)(a) thus protects the privacy of persons in certain \u201cplaces\u201d, whether or not nudity is expected at the time of the alleged offence. The Crown claims that there is ample evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe hockey dressing rooms, in which Mr. Downes took the photographs of T.R. and G.C., are places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude\u201d (A.F., at para. 95, quoting trial reasons, at para. 228 (CanLII)).\n[38] Mr. Downes argues that s. 162(1)(a) requires the Crown to prove that nudity is reasonably expected at the specific time and place at which a surreptitious recording is made. He claims that a temporal component ensures that the voyeurism offence maintains its purpose of prohibiting breaches of sexual privacy. In his view, s. 162(1)(a) should be interpreted in light of the harms contemplated in the scheme for sexual offences in Part V of the Criminal Code , and is breached only when the person is recorded in a way that infringes their sexual integrity. He claims that an actual infringement of sexual integrity is needed; a risk of infringement is insufficient. Mr. Downes notes that none of the photos at issue depicted nudity or was pornographic. He claims that since none of the boys in his photos was nude and there was no reasonable expectation at the time the photos were taken that anybody would be nude, it cannot be inferred that he intended to take a nude or otherwise prohibited voyeuristic photo.\n[39] In my view, when s. 162(1)(a) is properly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, the provision does not have an implicit temporal component.\n(b) Text\n[40] The text of s. 162(1)(a) refers to an objective test for the \u201cplace\u201d without regard to time. Although not determinative, the text of s. 162(1)(a) thus suggests that the provision lacks a temporal component.\n[41] The test in s. 162(1)(a) for the \u201cplace\u201d is objective in two respects. First, s. 162(1)(a) uses the definite article \u201cthe person\u201d (\u201cla personne\u201d) when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article \u201ca person\u201d (\u201cune personne\u201d) when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that the person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s. 162(1)(a) asks whether a person can \u201creasonably\u201d be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude. The use of an objective test in s. 162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time.\n[42] The key textual point is the lack of express language in s. 162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the \u201cplace\u201d to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly. For example, an adjacent provision, s. 162.1(1) \u2014 the offence of publishing an intimate image without consent \u2014 contains two express temporal components. An \u201cintimate image\u201d is defined under s. 162.1(2) as a visual recording of a person made by any means, \u201c(a) in which the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts or is engaged in explicit sexual activity; (b) in respect of which, at the time of the recording, there were circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and (c) in respect of which the person depicted retains a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time the offence is committed\u201d. Section 162(1)(a) contains no such temporal language. Had Parliament intended s. 162(1)(a) to contain a temporal component, it could easily have referred to the observation or recording being made in \u201ca place in which a person can then reasonably be expected to be\u201d nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude \u201cat the time of the observation or recording\u201d (see C.A. reasons, at para. 77, per Dickson J.A. (emphasis in original)). But Parliament chose not to do so.\n[43] Thus, while not determinative, the lack of express temporal language in s. 162(1)(a)\u2019s objective test for the \u201cplace\u201d suggests that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component.\n(c) Statutory Context and Purpose\n[44] The statutory context and purpose of s. 162(1)(a) also suggest that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component. Interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as prohibiting surreptitious observation or recording of persons in specific places without a temporal component promotes Parliament\u2019s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity, especially for children and other vulnerable persons. Interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from these purposes and leads to arbitrary and absurd results.\n[45] Parliament\u2019s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence without a temporal component. As noted by the intervener, the Attorney General of Ontario, rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s. 162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way: \u201cIf it is reasonable to expect that people in a certain place will be naked, or expose their genitals or anal region or breasts, or be engaged in explicit sexual activity, then that is a place where everyone is entitled to be free from surreptitious observation and visual recording \u2014 whether naked or not, exposed or not, explicit sexual activity or not\u201d (I.F., at para. 18). Thus, when a person is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, s. 162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially \u201csafe places\u201d, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non-consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording. In this way, s. 162(1)(a) protects both privacy and sexual integrity.\n[46] It is worth elaborating on how prohibiting voyeurism in such \u201csafe places\u201d under s. 162(1)(a), whether or not nudity is reasonably expected at the time of the surreptitious observation or recording, protects sexual integrity as it is understood today. As noted in this Court\u2019s decisions in Friesen and Jarvis, society\u2019s conception of sexual offences has evolved from a focus on the wrongful interference with sexual propriety to a concern with protecting sexual integrity (Friesen, at para. 55, and Jarvis, at para. 127, per Rowe J., both citing E. Craig, Troubling Sex: Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity (2012), at p. 68). In the passage cited approvingly in Friesen and the concurring reasons in Jarvis, Professor Elaine Craig explained that \u201c[t]his shift from focusing on sexual propriety to sexual integrity enables greater emphasis on violations of trust, humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem rather than simply, or only, on deprivations of honour, chastity, or bodily integrity (as was more the case when the law\u2019s concern had a greater focus on sexual propriety)\u201d (p. 68). Under a sexual integrity analysis, the focus is \u201cnot simply [on] the sexual motives, arousal, or body parts of the accused, or the community\u2019s standard of sexual propriety, but also [on] the perception, experience, and impact on the complainant\u201d (p. 75). In addition, a sexual integrity analysis focuses not just on physical harm to the complainant, but also on emotional and psychological harm, which is often more lasting than physical harm, especially for children (Friesen, at paras. 56-59).\n[47] Surreptitious observation or recording of a person where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and which occurs in a \u201csafe place\u201d under s. 162(1)(a), violates or poses a risk of violating sexual integrity, even if nudity is not reasonably expected at the specific time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially private and \u201csafe place\u201d violates trust and can result in the person\u2019s humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self\u2011esteem (Craig, at p. 68). It can also cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. As the intervener, the Samuelson\u2011Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, observes: \u201cSuch violations of trust objectify those targeted by reducing them to body parts, creating images that in a digital environment can be easily replicated, cropped and manipulated in ways and for uses that disregard their right to control their own bodies. These violating images hinder subjects from developing their sexuality as they see fit, while also potentially exposing them to the shame and humiliation that often results from instantaneous and widespread dissemination\u201d (I.F., at para. 24).\n[48] The emotional and psychological harms caused by violations of sexual integrity, even from non-nude photographs, are illustrated in this case. The sentencing judge noted the statement of T.R.\u2019s mother that \u201cwhen she told T.R. about the photographs, he was disappointed as he had considered Mr. Downes one of his more positive coaches. She said T.R.\u2019s trust was broken and, as a result, T.R. is more cautious and less trusting of coaches and people in general\u201d (2020 BCSC 177, at para. 18 (CanLII)). As Dickson J.A. noted aptly, \u201c[t]he potentially traumatic impact for adolescent boys of being photographed surreptitiously in such a manifestly private place is obvious\u201d (para. 97).\n[49] To sum up, reading s. 162(1)(a) as prohibiting surreptitious observation or recording of persons in specific places and without a temporal component promotes Parliament\u2019s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity.\n[50] By contrast, interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from Parliament\u2019s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity. On such an interpretation, surreptitious photos of children in their underwear in inherently private places would be permitted without criminal sanction simply because the children in those places were too self-conscious to undress (such as boys around the age of puberty) (see trial reasons, at para. 220). Such an interpretation would fail to protect the privacy and sexual integrity of some of the most vulnerable persons in our society \u2014 persons whom Parliament sought to protect through the voyeurism offence.\n[51] Relatedly, the Crown argues that such an interpretation of s. 162(1)(a) would result in arbitrary and absurd results: groups of children who are too self\u2011conscious about their bodies to shower or be nude in dressing rooms could be photographed surreptitiously, but children who are just a few years older and less self\u2011conscious \u2014 and who thus might shower or be nude \u2014 could not be photographed. I agree with the Crown that Parliament could not have intended such arbitrary and absurd results (see Rizzo, at para. 27). Parliament could not have intended that persons who ordinarily choose to disrobe in a place where nudity can reasonably be expected are protected from voyeurism, while persons who ordinarily choose to keep their clothes on are not.\n[52] The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded otherwise by taking a narrow perspective that views sexual offences as concerned with sexual propriety alone rather than also with sexual integrity. The majority ruled that an implicit temporal component is essential for s. 162(1)(a) to fulfill its purpose as a sexual offence, rather than as an offence protecting privacy alone. In its view, reading s. 162(1)(a) as criminalizing surreptitious observation or recording when nudity is not reasonably expected at the time of the observation or recording would \u201ccapture conduct that does not bear any of the hallmarks of voyeurism as a breach of sexual privacy\u201d (para. 41 (emphasis in original)). The majority declared that the voyeurism offence in s. 162(1) \u201c[is] fundamentally concerned with bodily and sexual privacy\u201d and \u201c[is] not intended to establish [an] offenc[e] founded upon an invasion of privacy alone\u201d (para. 54). It stated that while Mr. Downes\u2019 conduct was \u201cundoubtedly a breach of trust and invasive of privacy, that does not necessarily make it conduct that this section criminalizes as a sexual offence\u201d (para. 54).\n[53] I disagree. The majority\u2019s reasoning assumes that in order to stigmatize conduct as a violation of sexual integrity, and thus as a sexual offence, there must be a risk of capturing nude images at the relevant time. But, as I have explained above, taking surreptitious photographs of children in their underwear in an inherently \u201csafe place\u201d like a hockey dressing room violates not only the children\u2019s privacy but also their sexual integrity, even if nudity was not reasonably expected when the photos were taken. Taking surreptitious photos in such an inherently \u201csafe place\u201d may injure many interests associated with sexual integrity: such conduct violates trust and can result in the humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem of the targeted individuals. Such photos can injure a person\u2019s sexual integrity by reducing them to body parts, by hindering them from developing their sexuality as they see fit, and by creating a risk of widespread dissemination of the photos to strangers. When viewed through the lens of Parliament\u2019s purpose of protecting sexual integrity rather than simply sexual propriety, Mr. Downes\u2019 conduct violated both the children\u2019s privacy and their sexual integrity. He thus engaged in conduct that Parliament has criminalized as a sexual offence.\n(d) Conclusion\n[54] Section 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component requiring the Crown to prove that nudity was reasonably expected at the specific time when the photos were taken. As a result, the trial judge appropriately convicted Mr. Downes of two counts of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a).\nB. If Section 162(1)(a) Does Not Have an Implicit Temporal Component, Is the Provision Unconstitutionally Overbroad Contrary to Section 7 of the Charter ?\n[55] Mr. Downes submits that if this Court accepts that s. 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component, then the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Charter . He states that the objective of s. 162(1) is to target exploitative sexual conduct and says that the lack of a temporal component \u201cextends the offence to cover conduct bearing no connection to its underlying purpose of preventing sexual exploitation\u201d (R.F., at para. 68). Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial, and although he raised it at the Court of Appeal, the court did not address it.\n[56] There is a serious question as to whether Mr. Downes can challenge the constitutionality of s. 162(1)(a) in this Crown appeal as of right under s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . Such an appeal is limited to the question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, which in this case was whether s. 162(1) (a) has an implicit temporal component. Although in a Crown appeal as of right the respondent can raise \u201cany argument which supports the order of the court below\u201d (R. v. Keegstra, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at para. 23), Mr. Downes\u2019 overbreadth argument does not support the Court of Appeal\u2019s order: if accepted, it would likely result not in a new trial but in no trial, since s. 162(1) (a) would be unconstitutional (para. 36). Thus, ordinarily Mr. Downes could not challenge the constitutionality of s. 162(1) (a) without first obtaining leave to cross-appeal on this issue under s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26 .\n[57] I have concluded, however, that it is unnecessary to decide whether the constitutional issue raised by Mr. Downes is properly before this Court because, in any event, this is not a case in which this Court should exceptionally exercise its discretion to decide such a constitutional question for the first time on appeal. As noted in Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 20, \u201c[w]hether to hear and decide a constitutional issue when it has not been properly raised in the courts below is a matter for the Court\u2019s discretion, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved by this Court, its suitability for decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice.\u201d The test is a stringent one: this Court must be satisfied that hearing and deciding the new constitutional issue causes no prejudice to the parties (paras. 22-23).\n[58] In this case, deciding whether s. 162(1)(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad would prejudice the Crown and would require the Court to address an important Charter issue in a factual vacuum. Because the Charter issue was not raised at trial, the Crown has filed no evidence on whether any infringement of s. 7 of the Charter could be justified under s. 1 . As noted in Guindon, \u201c[a] respondent, like any other party, cannot rely upon an entirely new argument that would have required additional evidence to be adduced at trial\u201d (para. 32 (citations omitted in original), quoting Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 58). This is especially so in constitutional cases. This Court has often stressed the importance of a full evidentiary record when deciding constitutional questions and has cautioned that \u201cCharter decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum\u201d (MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361; Guindon, at para. 116, per Abella and Wagner JJ.). As the Court of Appeal for Ontario has stated, \u201c[a]rguing the interpretation of a statute is much different than arguing its constitutional validity\u201d (R. v. Wookey, 2016 ONCA 611, 363 C.R.R. (2d) 177, at para. 61, per Tulloch J.A. (now C.J.O.)). As a result, in all the circumstances, I would decline to decide the constitutional issue.\nVI.

The police followed M when he drove out of the parking lot and onto the highway. The police formed the intention on the highway to conduct a random sobriety stop of M pursuant to s. 48(1) of Ontario\u2019s Highway Traffic Act (\u201cHTA\u201d). By the time the police caught up to M, he had pulled off the highway onto a private driveway that served his parents\u2019 home. After stopping M, the police observed obvious signs of impairment and arrested him. M was charged with impaired driving and with operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to the Criminal Code .\nThe trial judge concluded that s. 48(1) of the HTA provided lawful authority for the random sobriety stop. He found M guilty of both charges and stayed the impaired driving conviction. The summary conviction appeal judge allowed M\u2019s appeal, finding that neither s. 48(1) nor s. 216(1) of the HTA permitted police to conduct random sobriety stops on private property absent reasonable and probable grounds. He found that the police breached M\u2019s s. 9 Charter right, and he excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter and entered an acquittal. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal of the acquittal.\nHeld: The appeal is allowed, the acquittal set aside, and the conviction and the stay entered at trial restored.\nPolice do not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to conduct random sobriety stops on private property. While s. 48(1) of the HTA furnishes police officers with the statutory authority to randomly stop a motor vehicle to ascertain the sobriety of the driver, the HTA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cdriver\u201d places sharp limits on police officers\u2019 authority to conduct random sobriety stops under s. 48(1). The HTA contains two definitions of the word \u201cdriver\u201d. Section 1(1) states that \u201cdriver\u201d means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway, and s. 48(18) provides that within s. 48, \u201cdriver\u201d includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle. The definition in s. 1(1) is exhaustive and specifies the scope of the word \u201cdriver\u201d, whereas the definition in s. 48(18) is non\u2011exhaustive and expands the ordinary meaning of the defined term. The definition of \u201cdriver\u201d in s. 1(1) is two\u2011pronged; it targets both an activity and the locus of such activity. To be a driver, one must be driving a vehicle (activity) and must do so on a highway (locus). The definition in s. 48(18) seeks only to expand the activity prong of the definition and not the locus element. Under a harmonious reading of the two definitions of \u201cdriver\u201d, for the purpose of s. 48(1), \u201cdriver\u201d refers to a person who is driving, or has care or control of, a motor vehicle on a highway. A person who has care or control of a motor vehicle but who is no longer on a highway would not be a \u201cdriver\u201d under the HTA.\nSection 48(1) authority cannot be used by police to carry out a random sobriety stop on private property on the basis that the driver was on the highway at the time the police officer formed the subjective intention to stop them. While s. 48(1) sets out the circumstances under which police can stop drivers without reasonable and probable grounds to ascertain sobriety, s. 216(1) of the HTA sets out the mechanics of the general police power to stop vehicles, including the corresponding duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop. Sections 216(1) and 48(1) fit together to supply a police power to conduct random sobriety stops on highways and a correspondent duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop. Section 216(1) supplies a communication requirement, such that a police officer seeking to invoke s. 48(1) authority must, at a minimum, signal or otherwise request that the driver stop their vehicle on a highway. The police must therefore communicate their intention to a driver to effect a random stop on a highway in order to fall under s. 48(1) of the HTA.\nIn the instant case, M was not a driver for the purposes of s. 48(1) of the HTA when he was stopped by the police. Even if it can be said that he had care or control of the ATV, he was not on a highway when the police effected the stop. Therefore, the police stop was unauthorized by s. 48(1). Since the police waited until M had pulled into the private driveway before they signalled their intention to stop him, they did not properly invoke their authority to conduct a random sobriety stop under s. 48(1) of the HTA. Since the stop was unlawful, the police breached M\u2019s rights under s. 9 of the Charter , as a detention not authorized by law is arbitrary.\nHowever, on the whole and considering all of the circumstances, the evidence obtained from the unlawful police stop should not have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter . The police acted without statutory authority in effecting the stop of M but given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time of the random sobriety stop, the breach was not so serious as to require the Court to disassociate itself from the police actions. The legal uncertainty pulls in favour of exclusion, but only slightly. The unlawful police stop constituted a marked, although not egregious, intrusion on M\u2019s Charter \u2011protected interests and moderately favours exclusion of the evidence. However, the evidence collected by the police was reliable and crucial to the Crown\u2019s case and impaired driving is a serious offence. Admission of the evidence would better serve the truth\u2011seeking function of the criminal trial process and would not damage the long\u2011term repute of the justice system.\nCases Cited\nApplied: R. v.

Johnston and Lex Gill, for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice and O\u2019Bonsawin J. \u2014\nI. Overview\n[1] This case is about whether police can conduct a random sobriety stop on private property under s. 48(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (\u201cHTA\u201d). A constable of the Ontario Provincial Police (\u201cOPP\u201d) formed the intention on a highway to randomly stop the respondent to ascertain his sobriety, and followed him onto a private driveway to do so. Once the constable approached the respondent, he observed obvious signs of intoxication and the respondent indicated that he might have had 10 beers. Two subsequent breathalyzer tests revealed that the respondent\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was above the legal limit.\n[2] In our view, the police officers did not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to follow the respondent onto the private driveway to conduct the random sobriety stop. Accordingly, the police officers breached the respondent\u2019s rights under s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Nonetheless, for the reasons that follow, we would not exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter . Accordingly, we would allow the appeal.\nII. Facts\n[3] At around 12:30 a.m. on March 26, 2016, Constables Jeff Lobsinger and Laura Hicks of the OPP were on general patrol in the vicinity of the Thessalon First Nation. While on patrol, Cst. Lobsinger spotted an all-terrain vehicle (\u201cATV\u201d) parked outside a convenience store. The respondent, Walker McColman, drove the ATV out of the parking lot and onto the highway, at which point Cst. Lobsinger directed Cst. Hicks to follow the ATV in their cruiser.\n[4] The trial judge found as a matter of fact that Cst. Lobsinger formed the intention on the highway to conduct a random sobriety stop of Mr. McColman pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA. At trial, Cst. Lobsinger conceded that Mr. McColman had not manifested signs of impaired driving that would have otherwise warranted a stop. That is, the police officers did not have reasonable and probable grounds to stop him.\n[5] By the time the officers caught up to Mr. McColman, he had pulled off the highway onto a private driveway that served his parents\u2019 home as well as a commercial establishment. There was no suggestion at trial that Mr. McColman pulled onto the driveway to avoid the police officers. Approximately one minute elapsed between when Cst. Lobsinger spotted the ATV and when the police officers stopped him.\n[6] After stopping Mr. McColman, Cst. Lobsinger spoke with him and observed obvious signs of impairment, ranging from a strong odour of alcohol to his inability to stand up straight. According to Cst. Lobsinger\u2019s testimony, Mr. McColman stated that he \u201cmight\u2019ve had 10\u201d beers that evening: A.R., at p. 154. Cst. Lobsinger arrested Mr. McColman for impaired driving at 12:36 a.m. and brought him to the police station.\n[7] At the police station, the breathalyzer test was delayed because Mr. McColman vomited due to his alcohol consumption. A police officer eventually conducted 2 breathalyzer tests, which recorded his blood alcohol concentration level as 120 and 110 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police charged Mr. McColman with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and with operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1) (b) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . Section 253 was repealed and replaced in 2018.\nIII. Relevant Provisions\n[8] Section 1(1) of the HTA defines a \u201cdriver\u201d as \u201ca person who drives a vehicle on a highway\u201d. It further defines a \u201chighway\u201d as including:\n. . . a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof;\n[9] Section 48(1) of the HTA furnishes police officers with the statutory authority to randomly stop a motor vehicle to ascertain the sobriety of the driver. It provides:\nA police officer, readily identifiable as such, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop for the purpose of determining whether or not there is evidence to justify making a demand under section 320.27 or 320.28 of the Criminal Code (Canada) .\n[10] Section 48(18) provides that, within s. 48, a driver \u201cincludes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle\u201d.\n[11] Lastly, s. 216(1) of the HTA sets out the broader police power to stop vehicles and the corresponding duty on drivers. It provides:\nA police officer, in the lawful execution of his or her duties and responsibilities, may require the driver of a vehicle, other than a bicycle, to stop and the driver of a vehicle, when signalled or requested to stop by a police officer who is readily identifiable as such, shall immediately come to a safe stop.\nIV. Judicial History\nA. Ontario Court of Justice\n[12] Mr. McColman brought a Charter application alleging, among other things, that the random sobriety stop was unlawful and breached his rights under s. 9 of the Charter . He maintained that the police did not have the authority to conduct the stop on private property.\n[13] The trial judge dismissed the application, concluding that s. 48(1) of the HTA provided lawful authority for the random sobriety stop. He found that the officers intended to stop Mr. McColman\u2019s vehicle for the purpose of checking the driver\u2019s sobriety, and that they had formed the intention to stop him while he was operating a vehicle on a highway. The trial judge reasoned:\nThe mere fact that [Cst. Lobsinger] did not effect this stop until [Mr. McColman] had turned into a private driveway and was thus on private property did not eliminate or invalidate the officer\u2019s authority under s. 48 of the Highway Traffic Act.\n(voir dire reasons, at para. 54, reproduced in A.R., at p. 8.)\n[14] In light of his conclusion on s. 48(1) of the HTA, the trial judge declined to consider whether the officers had authority under the common law to stop Mr. McColman on his private driveway.\n[15] The trial judge subsequently found Mr. McColman guilty of impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . The trial judge conditionally stayed the impaired driving conviction pursuant to this Court\u2019s guidance in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, and sentenced Mr. McColman to the mandatory minimums of a $1,000 fine (plus a $300 victim surcharge) and a 12-month driving prohibition.\nB. Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2019 ONSC 5359, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 375\n[16] Mr. McColman appealed to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, arguing, among other things, that the trial judge erred in finding that police officers are authorized to conduct random sobriety stops on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA.\n[17] The summary conviction appeal judge allowed the appeal, finding that neither s. 48(1) nor s. 216(1) of the HTA permitted police officers to conduct sobriety or highway safety stops on private property absent reasonable and probable grounds. Once Mr. McColman\u2019s vehicle left the highway and entered the private driveway, he was no longer a \u201cdriver\u201d within the meaning of the HTA. As a result, the police officers did not have the statutory authority to randomly detain Mr. McColman to check his sobriety. The appeal judge also found that the stop was not authorized under the common law.\n[18] Since the random sobriety stop was unlawful, the appeal judge found that the police breached s. 9 of the Charter . In his analysis under s. 24(2) of the Charter , the appeal judge found that the actions of the police were serious, as the officers \u201cpursued [Mr. McColman] onto private property when they had neither the statutory [nor] common law authority to do so\u201d: para. 49. The impact of the breach was also significant, as Mr. McColman had a high expectation of privacy on his own property. While society clearly had an interest in the adjudication of the matter on its merits, the balancing exercise favoured exclusion under s. 24(2) of the Charter .\nC. Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2021 ONCA 382, 156 O.R. (3d) 253\n[19] The Crown appealed the acquittal entered by the appeal judge, arguing that police are authorized to effect random sobriety stops on private property if they form the lawful intention to stop a driver on a highway.\n[20] A majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (per Tulloch J.A., as he then was, Feldman J.A. concurring) dismissed the appeal. The court held that the plain language of s. 48(1) and the related definitions of \u201cdriver\u201d and \u201chighway\u201d did not authorize random sobriety stops off the highway. The majority also held that the police did not have the common law authority to randomly check Mr. McColman\u2019s sobriety on private property. As a result, the stop was unlawful and breached Mr. McColman\u2019s rights under s. 9 of the Charter .\n[21] The majority agreed with the appeal judge that the evidence obtained from the unlawful stop should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter . In assessing the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state misconduct, while the majority was not prepared to find that the police acted in bad faith, it found that their conduct was \u201cbrazen\u201d and that a \u201clack of clarity in the law . . . does not give officers free licence to assume that they have authority\u201d: paras. 84-85. As for the impact of the breach, the majority found that there was a significant impact on Mr. McColman\u2019s liberty and privacy interests because the police questioned him and obtained evidence against him in the course of an unlawful detention in an area in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Finally, while excluding the evidence would undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, the majority concluded that, in the interest of having a justice system that is beyond reproach, the court should not condone conduct that tests the limits of police authority. Accordingly, the majority excluded the evidence and upheld Mr. McColman\u2019s acquittal.\n[22] Justice Hourigan, dissenting, held that both s. 48(1) of the HTA and the common law authorized the random sobriety stop. He maintained that the majority\u2019s interpretation of the HTA runs counter to its public protection purpose because the legislature could not have intended for drivers to evade investigation by pulling over onto private property. Justice Hourigan adopted the Crown\u2019s interpretation of the HTA and found that the officers had the authority to make the stop in the circumstances.\n[23] In the alternative, Hourigan J.A. held that the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter and urged trial courts to conduct a more meaningful analysis of the Grant factors: R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. He held that the first line of inquiry militated against excluding the evidence because the state misconduct was minor or technical in nature, and the law was not well settled, as there was jurisprudence supporting the officers\u2019 interpretation of their authority. The second line of inquiry similarly weighed against excluding the evidence because Mr. McColman\u2019s privacy expectations were minimal. The stop took place on a driveway shared with a commercial business, thereby giving the police an implied licence to enter. Finally, the third line of inquiry militated against excluding the evidence because the evidence was reliable and constituted overwhelming proof of Mr. McColman\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts. Accordingly, Hourigan J.A. would not have excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter .\nV. Issues\n[24] The Crown\u2019s appeal raises two issues.\n[25] First, the Crown argues that the random sobriety stop was authorized under s. 48(1) of the HTA. It submits that police may conduct a random sobriety stop off a highway if the police officer forms the intention on a highway to check the driver\u2019s sobriety. In support of this submission, the Crown notes that unlike s. 216(1) of the HTA, s. 48(1) does not include language pertaining to the communication of the decision to stop the driver. The Crown also suggests that the definition of \u201cdriver\u201d in s. 48(18) may oust the general definition of \u201cdriver\u201d in s. 1(1) for the purpose of s. 48. This would authorize police to conduct a random sobriety stop whenever a person has care or control of a motor vehicle, regardless of whether the intention to stop was formed on a highway.\n[26] Second, if the HTA did not authorize the police stop, resulting in a breach of s. 9 of the Charter , the Crown submits that admission of Mr. McColman\u2019s impairment and blood alcohol concentration evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It maintains that the Charter-infringing state conduct was not serious, since the police acted in good faith in the context of legal uncertainty about the geographic limitations of the power to conduct random sobriety stops. The Crown argues that the impact of the breach was neither intrusive nor significant. The Crown submits that driving is a regulated activity and the sobriety stops are brief and limited to their purpose. Finally, the Crown maintains that there is significant public interest in adjudicating these charges on their merits given the reliability and centrality of the evidence.\n[27] It must be noted that this Court did not grant leave on the issue of whether the police had the common law authority to conduct the stop.\nVI. Analysis\nA. Was the Random Sobriety Stop Authorized by Section 48(1) of the HTA?\n[28] This case presents the first opportunity for this Court to address whether police officers can conduct random sobriety stops on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA.\n[29] On several occasions, this Court has stated that various forms of random vehicular stops violate s. 9 of the Charter but are justified under s. 1. In R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621, this Court held that statutorily authorized spot checks \u2014 random police checks conducted at stationary, predetermined locations \u2014 violate s. 9 but are justified under s. 1. Shortly after, this Court held in R. v. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, that statutorily authorized roving stops \u2014 random police stops to check licences, proof of insurance, the mechanical fitness of vehicles and the sobriety of drivers \u2014 violate s. 9 but are justified under s. 1.\n[30] Police officers conducting random vehicular stops must exercise their powers vigilantly and ensure that they do not overstep the limits of their powers. Since these random stops constitute \u201carbitrary detention\u201d, the \u201cdetention will only be justified under s. 1 of the Charter if the police act within the limited highway-related purposes for which the powers were conferred\u201d: R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 22 (citations omitted).\n[31] The question of whether police officers can effect random sobriety stops on private property has been addressed by various appellate courts across the country under their versions of the HTA: see, e.g., R. v. Lux, 2012 SKCA 129, 405 Sask. R. 214; R. v. Anderson, 2014 SKCA 32, 433 Sask. R. 255; Scott v. R., 2021 QCCS 3866. However, Ontario\u2019s HTA differs in important ways from the other provincial statutes that regulate driving and drivers. In analyzing a provision of the HTA, a court must keep its focus on the text, context, and purpose of the provision at issue.\n[32] Both the appellant Crown and the Court of Appeal for Ontario drew heavily upon jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. In Lux, police officers observed a motor vehicle driving in a private parking area and conducted a random sobriety stop of the vehicle while it was still within the private parking area. The Court of Appeal held that s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act, S.S. 2004, c. T-18.1, did not authorize peace officers to conduct random sobriety stops on private property: para. 31. Two years later, in Anderson, a case factually similar to the case at bar, the Court of Appeal held that a police officer who had formed his intention on a highway to randomly stop the vehicle could lawfully complete the stop on private property pursuant to s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act: paras. 24-25.\n[33] Despite the seeming relevance of Lux and Anderson, Ontario\u2019s HTA differs in relevant respects from The Traffic Safety Act from Saskatchewan. Notably, the latter does not define the term \u201cdriver\u201d; in contrast, as we shall discuss, the HTA\u2019s definition of driver places sharp limits on police officers\u2019 authority to conduct random sobriety stops under s. 48(1) of the HTA. Given that Lux and Anderson focus closely on the specific wording of s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act, neither judgment sheds much light on how this Court should approach s. 48(1) of Ontario\u2019s HTA.\n(1) The Meaning of Section 48(1) of the HTA\n[34] We turn now to s. 48(1) of the HTA, which states:\nA police officer, readily identifiable as such, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop for the purpose of determining whether or not there is evidence to justify making a demand under section 320.27 or 320.28 of the Criminal Code (Canada) .\n[35] Under the modern approach to statutory interpretation, \u201cthe words of a statute must be read \u2018in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u2019\u201d: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 117, citing Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; see also Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 37. In determining the meaning of the text, a court cannot read a statutory provision in isolation, but must read the provision in light of the broader statutory scheme: Rizzo, at para. 21.\n[36] In its written submissions and during oral argument, the Crown placed great weight on the broader purposes underlying the HTA. But a purposive analysis does not grant the interpreter licence to disregard the clear meaning of the statute: see R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 149, at para. 26.\n[37] The key question in this case is whether Mr. McColman was a \u201cdriver\u201d for the purpose of s. 48(1) of the HTA at the time of the random sobriety stop. The HTA contains two definitions of the word \u201cdriver\u201d that may apply to Mr. McColman. Section 1(1) of the HTA states that \u201c\u2018driver\u2019 means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway\u201d. By contrast, s. 48(18) provides that, within s. 48, \u201c\u2018driver\u2019 includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle\u201d. In its factum, the Crown suggests that it is possible to interpret s. 48(1) such that it authorizes police to conduct random sobriety stops whenever they see someone in the care or control of a motor vehicle, irrespective of whether they intended to check the person\u2019s sobriety on a highway. In other words, the Crown submits that s. 48(18) sets out essential elements of what constitutes a \u201cdriver\u201d. This argument must fail for two reasons.\n[38] First, not all statutory definitions are exhaustive: R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022). Exhaustive definitions \u201cdeclare the complete meaning of the defined term and completely displace whatever meanings the defined term might otherwise bear in ordinary or technical usage\u201d, whereas non-exhaustive definitions \u201cdo not purport to displace the meaning that the defined term would have in ordinary usage; they simply add to, subtract from or exemplify that meaning\u201d: pp. 69\u201170. Exhaustive definitions are generally introduced using the verb \u201cmeans\u201d, while non-exhaustive definitions are introduced with the verb \u201cincludes\u201d: pp. 69\u201170.\n[39] Here, the definition in s. 1(1) is exhaustive and specifies the scope of the word \u201cdriver\u201d, whereas the definition in s. 48(18) is non-exhaustive and expands the ordinary meaning of the defined term. Indeed, the definition of \u201cdriver\u201d in s. 1(1) is two-pronged; it targets both an activity and the locus of such activity. To be a driver, one must be driving a vehicle (activity) and must do so on a highway (locus). The definition in s. 48(18) seeks only to expand the activity prong of the definition and not the locus element.\n[40] Second, this Court has stated that, while the relative effects of ordinary meaning, context, and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, courts must seek to read the provisions of an act as a harmonious whole: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10. As stated above, a non\u2011exhaustive definition does not necessarily oust other definitions. Depending on the context, exhaustive and non-exhaustive definitions can be read together. Under a harmonious reading of the two definitions of \u201cdriver\u201d, for the purpose of s. 48(1), \u201cdriver\u201d refers to a person who is driving, or has care or control of, a motor vehicle on a highway. A person who has care or control of a motor vehicle but who is no longer on a highway would not be a \u201cdriver\u201d under the HTA.\n[41] In the present case, Mr. McColman was not a \u201cdriver\u201d for the purpose of s. 48(1) when he was stopped by the police. Even if it can be said that he had care or control of the ATV, he was not on a highway when the police effected the stop. Therefore, the police stop was unauthorized by s. 48(1) of the HTA.\n[42] The Crown suggests that a core question in this appeal is whether police must communicate their intention to effect a random sobriety stop on a highway in order to fall under s. 48(1) of the HTA. The Crown argues that s. 48(1) authority is triggered when police form the intention to effect a random sobriety stop of a driver who is on a highway, and not when police communicate that intention to the driver. The Crown maintains that this interpretation is supported by s. 216(1) of the HTA.\n[43] On the Crown\u2019s view, s. 216(1) exhibits a legislative choice to put communication of intent to stop a driver at issue. Since the legislature chose not to include the language of \u201csignalled or requested to stop\u201d in s. 48(1), that section does not require the police to communicate their decision to stop a driver. So long as the driver was on the highway at the time the police officer formed the subjective intention to stop them, the officer can avail themselves of s. 48(1) authority to carry out a random sobriety stop on private property. In our view, this argument must also fail.\n[44] Sections 48(1) and 216(1) do not speak to differing legislative choices because the two provisions need not be read apart. In fact, the provisions are often cited together to furnish the statutory authority to conduct random sobriety stops: see, e.g., R. v. Sivarasah, 2017 ONSC 3597, 383 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at para. 108; R. v. Holland, 2017 ONCJ 948, at para. 11 (CanLII); R. v. Warha, 2015 ONCJ 214, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Vander Griendt, 2015 ONSC 6644, 331 C.C.C. (3d) 135, at paras. 4 and 21. Section 216(1) sets out the mechanics of the general police power to stop vehicles, including the corresponding duty on drivers to stop \u201cwhen signalled or requested to stop\u201d. By contrast, s. 48(1) sets out the circumstances under which police can stop drivers without reasonable and probable grounds to ascertain sobriety. The two provisions fit together to supply a police power to conduct random sobriety stops on highways and a corresponding duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop.\n[45] On this reading, the absence of the phrase \u201cwhen signalled or requested to stop\u201d in s. 48(1) does not speak to any legislative choice to privilege the point in time when police form the intention to conduct a random sobriety stop. Section 216(1) supplies a \u201ccommunication\u201d requirement, such that a police officer seeking to invoke s. 48(1) authority must, at a minimum, signal or otherwise request that the driver stop their vehicle on a highway.\n[46] Moreover, the inclusion of the word \u201crequire\u201d in s. 48(1) implies the communication of an expectation or order to someone. The Oxford English Dictionary (online) defines \u201crequire\u201d as \u201c[t]o order, instruct, or oblige (a person) to do something\u201d (emphasis in original). One cannot require someone to do something by merely subjectively intending it, as the Crown is arguing.\n[47] Here, the police waited until Mr. McColman had pulled onto his parents\u2019 driveway before they signalled their intention to stop him. Accordingly, they did not properly invoke their authority to conduct a random sobriety stop under s. 48(1).\n[48] Finally, the Crown submits that maintaining the majority of the Court of Appeal\u2019s reading of s. 48(1) of the HTA would create a sanctuary problem. The sanctuary problem refers to the idea that in the future, impaired drivers will simply pull onto private property whenever they spot a police cruiser. The dissenting judge below suggested that \u201c[i]n many cases, this sanctuary will be fleeting, as the impaired driver will stay on the private property only for as long as the police cruiser is in the area. Once it is out of sight, the driver will be free to re-enter the public highway and continue to endanger public safety\u201d: para. 96, per Hourigan J.A. In our view, the sanctuary problem is overstated.\n[49] First, random sobriety stops are not the only tool available to police to combat impaired driving. While police officers may not conduct random sobriety stops of drivers on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA, they may stop drivers if they have reasonable and probable grounds: Ladouceur, at p. 1287. This judgment does not constitute a blanket ban on police stops of drivers on private property. Various factual scenarios might give rise to reasonable and probable grounds. For example, if a driver is driving erratically, a police officer may have reasonable and probable grounds to pursue the driver onto private property. In addition, as the majority at the Court of Appeal noted, a \u201ctrue case of flight might well contribute to reasonable grounds to detain the accused, depending on the circumstances\u201d: para. 42. Thus, police officers are not barred from stopping drivers on private property in all circumstances.\n[50] Second, absent a successful constitutional challenge, this Court must respect the will of the legislature as expressed in valid legislation. It is not this Court\u2019s role to rewrite the law or to ask what law it would have enacted itself. When read contextually, s. 48(1) of the HTA does not authorize police officers to conduct random sobriety stops on private property. This Court is duty-bound to respect the legislature\u2019s will. If the legislature believes that police officers ought to wield wider powers under s. 48(1), it may amend the provision.\n(2) The Random Sobriety Stop Breached Mr. McColman\u2019s Section 9 Charter Rights\n[51] While s. 48(1) of the HTA furnished the police officers with the legal authority to conduct random sobriety stops of drivers of motor vehicles, they did not have the authority to stop Mr. McColman because he was not a \u201cdriver\u201d within the meaning of the HTA at the time of the stop. Since the stop was unlawful, the police officers breached Mr. McColman\u2019s rights under s. 9 of the Charter , which proclaims that \u201c[e]veryone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned\u201d. This Court has affirmed that \u201ca detention not authorized by law is arbitrary and violates s. 9\u201d: Grant, at para. 54. Given the above finding that the police officers did not have the legal authority to randomly stop Mr. McColman, it follows that they arbitrarily detained him.\n[52] The next question is whether the evidence the police officers obtained on the driveway and later at the police station should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter .\nB. Should the Evidence Obtained Have Been Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter ?\n[53] Section 24(2) requires that evidence obtained in a manner that infringes the Charter rights of an accused be excluded from the trial if it is established that \u201chaving regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute\u201d. The s. 24(2) analysis is an objective one, evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person, and the burden to persuade a court that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute rests on the party seeking exclusion: Grant, at para. 68.\n[54] Section 24(2) is focused on maintaining the long-term integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system. Accordingly, the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) is directed not at punishing police misconduct or compensating the accused, but rather at systemic and institutional concerns: Grant, at para. 70. In Grant, this Court explained that the s. 24(2) analysis engages three lines of inquiry: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter \u2011protected interests of the accused; and (3) society\u2019s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. Courts are tasked with balancing the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry, but as recognized in Grant, \u201c[t]he balancing mandated by s. 24(2) is qualitative in nature and therefore not capable of mathematical precision\u201d: para. 140.\n[55] Trial courts must evaluate each of the three lines of inquiry thoroughly. A cursory review of the Grant test prevents appropriate appellate review and transforms s. 24(2) from a contextual inquiry into a bright-line rule.\n[56] In the current case, the trial judge did not conduct a Grant analysis, since he found that s. 48(1) of the HTA authorized the random sobriety stop and there was no s. 9 violation. Accordingly, this Court must conduct the Grant analysis afresh.\n(1) The Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing Conduct\n[57] The first line of inquiry focuses on the extent to which the state conduct at issue deviates from the rule of law. As this Court stated in Grant, at para. 72, this line of inquiry \u201crequires a court to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct\u201d. Or as this Court phrased it in R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 22: \u201cDid [the police conduct] involve misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself?\u201d\n[58] In evaluating the gravity of the state conduct at issue, a court must \u201csituate that conduct on a scale of culpability\u201d: R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 43. As Justice Doherty observed in R. v. Blake, 2010 ONCA 1, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 4, \u201cthe graver the state\u2019s misconduct the stronger the need to preserve the long\u2011term repute of the administration of justice by disassociating the court\u2019s processes from that misconduct\u201d: para. 23. To properly situate state conduct on the \u201cscale of culpability\u201d, courts must also ask whether the presence of surrounding circumstances attenuates or exacerbates the seriousness of the state conduct: Grant, at para. 75. Were the police compelled to act quickly in order to prevent the disappearance of evidence? Did the police act in good faith? Could the police have obtained the evidence without a Charter violation? Only by adopting a holistic analysis can a court properly situate state conduct on the scale of culpability.\n[59] It should be noted at the outset that the first and second lines of inquiry are distinct. The first line of inquiry evaluates the state conduct itself, while the second line of inquiry goes further and assesses the impact of the state conduct on the accused\u2019s Charter-protected interests. This Court has noted that \u201c[w]hile the first two lines of inquiry typically work in tandem in the sense that both pull towards exclusion of the evidence, they need not pull with identical degrees of force in order to compel exclusion\u201d: R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 141. As noted in R. v. Lafrance, 2022 SCC 32, at para. 90, \u201cit is the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry that trial judges must consider and balance against the third line of inquiry when assessing whether evidence should be excluded\u201d (emphasis in original). In certain situations, only one of the first two lines of inquiry will pull towards exclusion of the evidence. State conduct that is not particularly serious may nonetheless heavily impact the accused\u2019s Charter-protected interests. Conversely, state conduct that is egregious may minimally impact the accused\u2019s Charter-protected interests. Courts must be careful not to collapse the first two lines of inquiry into one, unstructured analysis.\n[60] In the case at bar, the first line of inquiry pulls slightly in favour of exclusion. Although there was relevant case law to support the police officers\u2019 sobriety stop, given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time, the police officers should have acted with more prudence. When faced with legal uncertainty, \u201cthe police would do well to err on the side of caution\u201d: R. v. TELUS Communications Co., 2013 SCC 16, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 80.\n[61] At the time of the random sobriety stop, the applicable case law was in a state of uncertainty: see R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 71. The dissenting judge below pointed to several Ontario cases in support of his proposition that \u201cthere was jurisprudence that supported the officers\u2019 authority to make the stop on the shared driveway\u201d: para. 178, per Hourigan J.A. See especially R. v. Alrayyes, 2013 ONSC 7256; R. v. Calder (2002), 29 M.V.R. (4th) 292 (Ont. S.C.), aff\u2019d (2004), 47 M.V.R. (4th) 20 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. McGregor, 2015 ONCJ 692, 92 M.V.R. (6th) 333; and Warha. For example, in Alrayyes, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that under s. 48(1) of the HTA, a police officer\u2019s authority to stop a vehicle driving on a highway did not evaporate merely because the vehicle had entered onto private property: para. 31 (QL, WL).\n[62] However, not all of the applicable case law supported Cst. Lobsinger\u2019s decision to conduct a random sobriety stop. In R. v. George, 2004 ONCJ 316, the trial judge held that the police officer did not have the authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to conduct a random sobriety stop of a person who had pulled off the highway onto his private driveway: paras. 15-16 (CanLII). Similarly, in R. v. Nield, 2015 ONSC 5730, 88 M.V.R. (6th) 274, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that s. 48(1) of the HTA did not apply to a person who was driving a vehicle, but who was not situated on a highway: paras. 26 and 29. See also R. v. Hajivasilis, 2013 ONCA 27, 114 O.R. (3d) 337, at para. 13; R. v. Larocque, 2014 ONCJ 601, at para. 11 (CanLII); and Vander Griendt, at paras. 19-21.\n[63] Ultimately, however, the police officers in this case acted without legal justification. As outlined above, the HTA did not furnish them with authority to conduct a random sobriety stop on private property. Nor did they have reasonable and probable grounds. Given the legal uncertainty at play, the police officers had a duty to act cautiously and to question the limits of their authority. As Dickson C.J. noted in dissent in Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10, \u201c[i]t has always been a fundamental tenet of the rule of law in this country that the police, in carrying out their general duties as law enforcement officers of the state, have limited powers and are only entitled to interfere with the liberty or property of the citizen to the extent authorized by law\u201d. Although Dickson C.J. was speaking in the context of the police common law power, his remarks apply equally to the police exercise of statutory power. Police officers can only exercise the powers granted to them by the law. In situations marked by legal uncertainty, police officers should not rely on that uncertainty but instead should err on the side of caution.\n[64] Under the first line of inquiry, courts must also ask whether there are other extenuating circumstances that affect their view of the gravity of the state conduct. In the current case, the police could have conducted the random sobriety stop on the highway by activating the cruiser\u2019s lights or sirens as soon as Mr. McColman had departed from the convenience store on his ATV. Thus, the \u201cevidence could have been obtained without a Charter violation\u201d: R. v. Jacoy, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 548, at p. 559. In short, the police officers could have conducted the random sobriety stop before Mr. McColman pulled onto private property.\n[65] In our view, on the whole, the first line of inquiry pulls slightly in favour of exclusion. The police acted without statutory authority in effecting the stop, and a body of case law confirmed their lack of authority to stop Mr. McColman. On the other hand, another body of case law supported their conduct. Given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time of the random sobriety stop, the breach was accordingly not so serious as to require this Court to disassociate itself from the police actions. In light of that same legal uncertainty, however, the police officers should have acted with more prudence. In our view, on balance, these two effects of the legal uncertainty pull in favour of exclusion, but only slightly.\n(2) The Impact of the Breach on the Charter-Protected Interests of Mr. McColman\n[66] The second line of inquiry is aimed at the concern that admitting evidence obtained in violation of the Charter may send a message to the public that Charter rights are of little actual avail to the citizen. Courts must evaluate the extent to which the breach \u201cactually undermined the interests protected by the right infringed\u201d: Grant, at para. 76. Like the first line of inquiry, the second line envisions a sliding scale of conduct, with \u201cfleeting and technical\u201d breaches at one end of the scale and \u201cprofoundly intrusive\u201d breaches at the other: para. 76.\n[67] For example, in R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, the impact on the accused\u2019s s. 9 interests was found to fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. The impact of the accused\u2019s arbitrary arrest was mitigated to some degree because although he was arrested on the basis of a mistake of law about the legal status of a drug, he was lawfully detained for a traffic collision investigation: para. 92. By contrast, in Harrison, this Court found that the impact was more significant because the accused was stopped and his vehicle was subjected to a search without lawful justification: para. 31; see also R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 56.\n[68] In the current case, the second line of inquiry moderately favours exclusion of the evidence. The stop impacted Mr. McColman\u2019s liberty interests because the police questioned him in the course of an unlawful detention. Although the police had the power to randomly stop Mr. McColman to check his sobriety, they did not act within the legal limits of that power. In addition, the fact that the arbitrary detention occurred on private property is relevant because \u201c[r]etreat to a private residence (even if not one\u2019s own residence) will sometimes be the only practical way for individuals to exercise their right to be left alone\u201d: Le, at para. 155. As a result of the unlawful stop, Mr. McColman was arrested and brought to the police station, where he was detained for several hours. The police obtained significant evidence against him, including the officer\u2019s observations of signs of impairment, Mr. McColman\u2019s statements about his alcohol consumption, and the results of two breathalyzer tests. Therefore, the unlawful police stop constituted a marked, although not egregious, intrusion on Mr. McColman\u2019s Charter-protected interests.\n(3) Society\u2019s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits\n[69] The third line of inquiry asks whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion. This inquiry requires courts to consider both the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice and the impact of failing to admit the evidence: Grant, at para. 79. In each case, \u201cit is the long-term repute of the administration of justice that must be assessed\u201d: Harrison, at para. 36.\n[70] Under this third line of inquiry, courts should consider factors such as the reliability of the evidence, the importance of the evidence to the Crown\u2019s case, and the seriousness of the alleged offence, although this Court has recognized that the final factor can cut both ways: Grant, at paras. 81 and 83-84. While the public has a heightened interest in a determination on the merits where the offence is serious, it also has a vital interest in maintaining a justice system that is above reproach: para. 84.\n[71] While there is an obvious impact upon the administration of justice in admitting evidence obtained in contravention of s. 9 of the Charter , admitting the evidence in the case at bar would not damage the long-term repute of the administration of justice. First, the evidence collected by the police was reliable and crucial to the Crown\u2019s case. Cst. Lobsinger observed several signs of impairment at the scene, including a strong odour of alcohol and Mr. McColman\u2019s inability to stand up straight. Mr. McColman admitted to the officers that he \u201cmight\u2019ve had 10\u201d beers that evening. Two breathalyzer tests, conducted some time after he vomited due to his alcohol consumption, revealed that Mr. McColman\u2019s blood alcohol concentration level was significantly above the legal limit.\n[72] Second, impaired driving is a serious offence. This Court has recognized that society has a vital interest in combatting drinking and driving. In R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 16, Cory J. noted:\nEvery year, drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any other crime. In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most significant social loss to the country.\n(See also R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 8.)\n[73] In light of the reliability and importance of the evidence as well as the seriousness of the alleged offence, the third line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of inclusion. Admission of the evidence in this case would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system.\n(4) Balancing the Grant Factors\n[74] When balancing the Grant factors, the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry must be balanced against the third line of inquiry: Lafrance, at para. 90; R. v. Beaver, 2022 SCC 54, at para. 134. Here, the first line of inquiry slightly favours exclusion of the evidence and the second line of inquiry does so moderately. However, the third line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of inclusion and, in our view, outweighs the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry because of the crucial and reliable nature of the evidence as well as the important public policy concerns about the scourge of impaired driving. On the whole, considering all of the circumstances, the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2).\nVII. Conclusion\n[75] We would allow the appeal on the basis that the evidence obtained from the unlawful police stop should not have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter . Accordingly, we would set aside the acquittal entered below and restore the conviction and Kienapple stay entered at trial. The Crown is granted leave to appeal the sentence. We would eliminate the victim surcharge (R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599) and otherwise restore the sentence imposed.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ministry of the Attorney General \u2014 Crown Law Office, Criminal, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Orazietti & Orazietti, Sault Ste. Marie.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Trudel, Johnston & Lesp\u00e9rance, Montr\u00e9al.\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n"

C\u201146, ss. 254(2) (b), 254(5) .\nOn April 2, 2017, two police officers were informed by forest trail patrollers that an individual who was intoxicated was driving an all\u2011terrain vehicle (\u201cATV\u201d). At about 1:35 p.m., the police officers arrived at the scene, saw B and stopped him as he was about to leave the scene on foot. One of the officers noticed that B\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol. At 1:41 p.m., that officer radioed for an approved screening device (\u201cASD\u201d) to be brought to him, since the officers did not have one in their possession. Once he had requested an ASD, the officer demanded that B provide forthwith a breath sample pursuant to s. 254(2) (b) of the Criminal Code . Starting at 1:45 p.m., B refused three times to provide the requested sample on the ground that he had not been driving the ATV in question. He was arrested for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) Cr. C.\nThe Municipal Court judge held that the validity of the demand made by the police officer did not depend on the presence of an ASD at the scene. He convicted B of the offence of refusing to comply with a demand made under s. 254(2) Cr. C., contrary to ss. 254(5) and 255(1) Cr. C. B\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court was dismissed, but his subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal found that, in order for a demand to be valid, the peace officer must be in a position to demand that the driver provide a breath sample forthwith, which means that the officer must have immediate access to an ASD. The court was of the view that the demand made to B by the police officer was invalid due to the absence of an ASD. It reversed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and directed that a judgment of acquittal be entered.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Crown has not shown that there was any unusual circumstance that would account for the absence of an ASD at the scene and thereby justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. The demand made by the police officer was therefore invalid. Accordingly, B\u2019s refusal did not attract criminal liability, and the acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be upheld.\nThe word \u201cforthwith\u201d in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning, having regard to the text, context and purpose of this provision. According to the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words \u201cprovide\u201d and \u201cforthwith\u201d found in this provision, the driver must \u201csupply\u201d a breath sample to the peace officer \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithout delay\u201d. The word \u201cforthwith\u201d qualifies the demand under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. that stopped drivers must obey. Such drivers are not free to provide a sample when they see fit. It is true that operational time is implicit in the word \u201cforthwith\u201d, because the police officer has to ready the equipment and instruct the suspect on what to do; however, operational time is different from the time needed for a device to be delivered to the scene.\nThe constitutionality of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. depends on an interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d that is consistent with its ordinary meaning, because this word implicitly limits the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Since a detained driver must provide a breath sample forthwith, the driver may not consult counsel before doing so. This limit is justified under s. 1 of the Charter precisely because the detention is of very brief duration. The purpose of the detection procedure of which s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. forms a part is to combat the menace of impaired driving. In the pursuit of this purpose, Parliament sought to strike a balance between the public interest in eradicating driver impairment and the need to safeguard individual Charter rights. This balance must be kept in mind when interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nThe existence of unusual circumstances may justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. While it is neither necessary nor desirable to identify in the abstract, and in an exhaustive manner, the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual, given that it is preferable for those circumstances to be identified on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis in light of the facts of each matter, it is nonetheless important to provide some guidelines to assist lower courts in this inquiry. First, the burden of establishing the existence of unusual circumstances rests on the Crown. Second, the unusual circumstances must be identified in light of the text of the provision in order to preserve the provision\u2019s constitutional integrity by ensuring that courts do not unduly extend the ordinary meaning strictly given to the word \u201cforthwith\u201d. Section 254(2)(b) Cr. C. specifies that the sample collected must enable a proper analysis to be made, which opens the door to delays caused by unusual circumstances related to the use of the device or the reliability of the result. Circumstances involving urgency in ensuring the safety of the public or of police officers might also be recognized as unusual. Third, unusual circumstances cannot arise from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency, because allocating a limited budget is the daily reality of any government. Fourth, the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself an unusual circumstance.\nA demand made under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. cannot be presumed to be valid in the absence of an ASD at the scene. Nothing in this provision indicates that Parliament intended to create such a presumption of validity. A person cannot be criminally liable for refusing to comply with a demand with which it was not actually possible to comply because of the absence of an ASD at the time the demand was made. Finally, the validity of a demand cannot be conditional on the time needed for an ASD to be delivered to the scene, because such an approach would create intolerable uncertainty for drivers. When a detained driver has to respond to a demand to provide a breath sample, the driver must be able to know whether the demand is valid and whether refusing will result in criminal liability. In a context where the driver is unable to retain and instruct counsel, it cannot be expected that the driver will agree in advance to comply and will then be capable of determining when the delay in the delivery of an ASD justifies a refusal.\nCases Cited\nOverruled: R. v.

Introduction\n[1] This appeal concerns the interpretation of the immediacy requirement in what was, at the relevant time, s. 254(2)(b) (now s. 320.27(1)(b))[1] of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 (\u201cCr. C.\u201d). According to this provision, if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a driver has alcohol in their body, the peace officer may, by demand, require the driver \u201cto provide forthwith a sample of breath that, in the peace officer\u2019s opinion, will enable a proper analysis to be made\u201d through an approved screening device (\u201cASD\u201d).\n[2] The immediacy requirement arising from this provision has both an implicit component and an explicit component. It is \u201cimplicit as regards the police demand for a breath sample, and explicit as to the mandatory response: the driver must provide a breath sample \u2018forthwith\u2019\u201d (R. v. Woods, 2005 SCC 42, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 14). This case deals with the latter component.\n[3] Under s. 254(5) Cr. C., any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with such a demand commits an offence.\n[4] The central issue in this case relates to the time within which a peace officer must enable a driver who is stopped for this purpose to provide the breath sample required for a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. Specifically, this Court must determine whether the validity of a demand made by a peace officer under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. requires that the officer have immediate access to an ASD at the time the demand is made.\n[5] This Court therefore has an opportunity to settle a jurisprudential debate over the interpretation of the immediacy requirement. This debate is illustrated by the approaches adopted, on the one hand, by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Degiorgio, 2011 ONCA 527, 275 C.C.C. (3d) 1, and R. v. Quansah, 2012 ONCA 123, 286 C.C.C. (3d) 307, and, on the other, by the Quebec Court of Appeal in the judgment under appeal. After interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in a manner consistent with the text, context and purpose of this provision, I conclude that the Quebec Court of Appeal\u2019s approach is substantially correct.\n[6] Stops to provide breath samples are meant to be brief. Drivers stopped for this purpose are then being detained. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence allows a limit on the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms during such detention. This limit is justified under s. 1 of the Charter , because s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. reflects the balance struck by Parliament between the safeguarding of drivers\u2019 constitutional rights and the public interest in eradicating impaired driving (Woods, at para. 29). It is essential to this balance that the word \u201cforthwith\u201d be interpreted in a manner generally consistent with its usual or ordinary meaning.\n[7] Exceptionally, unusual circumstances may justify giving the word \u201cforthwith\u201d a more flexible interpretation than its usual or ordinary meaning demands (Woods, at para. 43, citing R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254). However, those circumstances must be just that: unusual. They cannot arise from utilitarian considerations or considerations of administrative convenience. Moreover, the determination of what constitutes unusual circumstances must be grounded primarily in the text of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n[8] The Quebec Court of Appeal was correct in law in stating that the wording of the provision allows for a flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d where there are unusual circumstances related to, among other things, the use of the device or the reliability of the result that will be generated, because the text of the provision indicates that the sample taken must enable a \u201cproper analysis\u201d to be made.\n[9] It is neither necessary nor desirable to set out an exhaustive list of the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual. For the purposes of this case, it will suffice to say that the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself such an unusual circumstance. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nII. Factual Background\n[10] On April 2, 2017, Constables Dale Atkins and Jean\u2011Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux were informed by forest trail patrollers that an individual who was intoxicated was driving an all\u2011terrain vehicle (\u201cATV\u201d) in Val\u2011B\u00e9lair. While en route, they learned that the individual had parked his vehicle and was about to leave the scene on foot.\n[11] The constables arrived at the scene at about 1:35 p.m. They saw the respondent and stopped him. Constable Atkins noticed that the respondent\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol. The respondent identified himself through his driver\u2019s licence as Mr. Pascal Breault. When questioned by Constable Atkins, he admitted drinking one beer but denied driving the ATV. Constable C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux spoke with the patrollers, who confirmed that the respondent had been driving the vehicle; he conveyed that information to his colleague. At that point, the constables believed that they were indeed talking to the individual referred to by the patrollers.\n[12] At 1:41 p.m., Constable Atkins radioed for an ASD to be brought to him, since the constables did not have one in their possession. Constable C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux later testified that he did not know why he and Constable Atkins did not have an ASD: [translation] \u201c. . . I can\u2019t tell you whether we didn\u2019t take one that day or whether there were no more available . . .\u201d (A.R., vol. II, at p. 81). A colleague patrolling the Charlesbourg area responded that he had an ASD and that he was on his way. Constable Atkins estimated that Charlesbourg was about 10 minutes from his location, although a 15\u2011minute delay was not impossible.\n[13] Once he had radioed for an ASD, Constable Atkins demanded that the respondent provide forthwith a breath sample, pursuant to s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. Neither he nor Constable C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux told the respondent that there was no ASD at the scene. Starting at 1:45 p.m., the respondent refused not once but three times to provide the requested sample. Following the respondent\u2019s first refusal, Constable Atkins informed him of the consequences he faced. The respondent then reiterated his refusal twice. During that interaction, he said that he wished to retain and instruct counsel, a request that Constable Atkins denied. The reason given by the respondent for each of the three refusals was that he had not been driving the ATV in question. The respondent was therefore arrested for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) Cr. C.\n[14] At about 2:00 p.m., there was still no ASD at the scene. In view of the respondent\u2019s refusal, the constables cancelled their radioed request that an ASD be brought to them. They seized the respondent\u2019s ATV and released him.\nIII. Decisions Below\nA. Municipal Court of Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, 2019 QCCM 114 (Judge Simard)\n[15] Relying on the Ontario Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Degiorgio, Judge Simard held that the validity of the demand made by Constable Atkins did not depend on the presence of an ASD at the scene. The judge also noted that the respondent had been unaware of the absence of an ASD and had immediately refused to blow three times for an entirely different reason. As well, in Judge Simard\u2019s view, police cars do not all have to be equipped with an ASD. In the end, he held that the prosecution had proved the essential elements of the offence. Indeed, the demand made by Constable Atkins had been clear, and the respondent had been duly informed of the consequences of his refusal and had provided no reasonable excuse to justify it. The respondent was convicted of the offence of refusing to comply with a demand made under s. 254(2) Cr. C., contrary to ss. 254(5) and 255(1) Cr. C.\nB. Quebec Superior Court, 2020 QCCS 1597 (Pronovost J.)\n[16] In the Superior Court, counsel for the respondent acknowledged that Judge Simard\u2019s analysis was legally sound in light of the ratio decidendi of R. v. Piazza, 2018 QCCA 948, and R. v. Petit, 2005 QCCA 687, 200 C.C.C. (3d) 514. Relying on Vauclair J.A.\u2019s obiter dictum in Piazza, he announced his intention of asking the Quebec Court of Appeal to overturn Petit. Pronovost J. dismissed the appeal.\nC. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 505, 75 M.V.R. (7th) 4 (Doyon, Vauclair, Hogue, Ruel and Rancourt JJ.A.)\n[17] In unanimous reasons written by Doyon J.A., the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. In doing so, it relied heavily on Vauclair J.A.\u2019s review of the jurisprudence in Piazza. It concluded from that review that, in order for a demand to be valid, the peace officer must be in a position to demand that the driver [translation] \u201cprovide a breath sample forthwith, before the [driver] even has the time, realistically speaking, to contact counsel\u201d, despite being detained. It also concluded that this means the peace officer must have immediate access to an ASD (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). The word \u201cforthwith\u201d in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must therefore be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning. However, departing from this meaning is justifiable where the delay is due to unusual circumstances related to, among other things, the use of the device or the reliability of the result that will be generated.\n[18] The Court of Appeal considered it illogical for a driver to face criminal liability for refusing to comply forthwith with a demand with which it was, in any event, not actually possible to comply forthwith. The court also found it undesirable for the validity of a demand to be assessed after the fact based on how long it took for an ASD to become available; this creates uncertainty and leads to inconsistent results. A driver who refuses right away to comply with a demand to provide forthwith a breath sample when an ASD is not available at the scene might be convicted of the offence, whereas this would not be the case if the driver agreed but later changed their mind after \u201ctoo\u201d long a delay.\n[19] The court was therefore of the view that the demand made by Constable Atkins in this case was invalid due to the absence of an ASD. As a result, the respondent was not criminally liable for refusing to comply. The court reversed the lower courts\u2019 judgments, directed that a judgment of acquittal be entered and declared that Petit, which allowed a 10\u2011minute delay for the delivery of an ASD, no longer had precedential value.\nIV. Issue\n[20] The resolution of this case lies in the answer to the following question: Does the validity of a demand made by a peace officer under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. require that the officer have immediate access to an ASD at the time the demand is made?\nV. Positions of the Parties\n[21] The Crown, appealing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, submits that this question must be answered in the negative. First, the appellant argues that the word \u201cforthwith\u201d should not be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning because this would lead to results contrary to what Parliament intended when it created the offence set out in s. 254(5) Cr. C., namely to adopt a deterrent measure for the purpose of convincing drivers who are pulled over to provide a breath sample. In the Crown\u2019s opinion, a flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d is needed to combat the problem of drinking and driving and deter impaired individuals from driving. Relying on Quansah, the appellant submits that a short delay that is reasonable and necessary in light of all the circumstances must be permitted, including a delay due to the time required to bring an ASD to an officer who needs one. Adopting a flexible approach would also prevent problems in the performance of the work of police officers, who do not always have such a device with them or who, for a variety of practical reasons, cannot take a breath sample immediately. Second, the Crown argues that possession of an ASD at the time the demand is made is not an essential element of the offence under s. 254(5) Cr. C. The Crown contends that if Parliament had intended to make possession of an ASD a requirement, it would have said so clearly, as it does in the current s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. Nonetheless, the Crown acknowledges that if this Court finds that the demand made by Constable Atkins was invalid because of the absence of an ASD, the respondent\u2019s acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be upheld.\n[22] The respondent argues that, unless there are unusual circumstances, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d must be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning, because a driver who is stopped for a breath sample is being detained without the right to counsel. In the respondent\u2019s view, the Court of Appeal did not exhaustively define the unusual circumstances that may justify a more flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d, but it did correctly find that a shortfall in the number of ASDs for budgetary or administrative reasons is not such a circumstance. Because the Crown has not shown that there were unusual circumstances, the demand made by Constable Atkins was invalid and the acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be affirmed.\nVI. Analysis\n[23] It is important to begin by reproducing s. 254(2)(b) and s. 254(5) as they read at the relevant time:\n254 . . .\nTesting for presence of alcohol or a drug\n(2) If a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol or a drug in their body and that the person has, within the preceding three hours, operated a motor vehicle or vessel, operated or assisted in the operation of an aircraft or railway equipment or had the care or control of a motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, whether it was in motion or not, the peace officer may, by demand, require the person to comply with paragraph (a), in the case of a drug, or with either or both of paragraphs (a) and (b), in the case of alcohol:\n(a) to perform forthwith physical coordination tests prescribed by regulation to enable the peace officer to determine whether a demand may be made under subsection (3) or (3.1) and, if necessary, to accompany the peace officer for that purpose; and\n(b) to provide forthwith a sample of breath that, in the peace officer\u2019s opinion, will enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device and, if necessary, to accompany the peace officer for that purpose.\n. . .\nFailure or refusal to comply with demand\n(5) Everyone commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made under this section.\n[24] At the end of a statutory interpretation exercise, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal was correct in law in holding that, as a general rule, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d must be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning. This interpretation is consistent with the text, context and purpose of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. It is also in keeping with the decisions of this Court, from R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, to Woods, in which the word \u201cforthwith\u201d has been interpreted in a manner consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in unusual circumstances.\nA. Applicable Principles of Statutory Interpretation\n[25] Every statutory interpretation exercise involves reading the words of a provision \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26; see also R. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 15, at para. 21).\n[26] Courts therefore have to interpret the \u201ctext through which the legislature seeks to achieve [its] objective\u201d, because \u201cthe goal of the interpretative exercise is to find harmony between the words of the statute and the intended objective, not to achieve the objective \u2018at all costs\u2019\u201d (MediaQMI inc. v. Kamel, 2021 SCC 23, at para. 39, quoting Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers, 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 271, at para. 174). Consequently, as laudable and important as the fight against impaired driving may be, it is not permissible, in the pursuit of that objective, to distort the meaning to be given to the text of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in the statutory interpretation exercise.\n[27] Finally, in interpreting a criminal law provision like s. 254(2)(b), courts must be careful not to create uncertainty, for \u201c[i]t is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act constitutes a crime at the time he commits the act\u201d (R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 14; see also R. v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 203; R. v. Levkovic, 2013 SCC 25, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 204, at para. 1; Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1155).\n[28] I turn now to the interpretation of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nB. Section 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n(1) Text\n[29] It is important to consider the meaning of two words found in this provision: \u201cprovide\u201d and \u201cforthwith\u201d. \u201cProvide\u201d means to \u201csupply\u201d something to someone (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 1245). \u201cForthwith\u201d means \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithout delay\u201d (Woods, at para. 13, quoting Canadian Oxford Dictionary, at p. 585; see also R. v. Grant, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 139, at p. 150).\n[30] According to the grammatical and ordinary meaning of these words, a driver detained under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must \u201csupply\u201d a breath sample to the peace officer \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithout delay\u201d. In addition, the provision states that the sample \u201cwill enable a proper analysis to be made\u201d by means of an ASD.\n[31] Therefore, and contrary to what the Crown argues, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d qualifies the demand that drivers must obey. Stopped drivers \u201care bound by s. 254(2) to comply immediately\u201d (Woods, at para. 45). They are not free to provide a sample when they see fit.\n[32] It is true that operational time is implicit in the word \u201cforthwith\u201d, because the officer \u201chas to ready the equipment and instruct the suspect on what to do\u201d (Bernshaw, at para. 64). However, what is in issue in this case is not operational time, but rather the time needed for a device to be delivered to the scene.\n(2) Context\n[33] The power conferred by s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. relates to an investigative procedure. It is the first step in a two\u2011step detection and enforcement procedure, the second being the breathalyzer test that is generally administered at the police station and that requires the peace officer to have reasonable grounds to believe that the driver\u2019s blood alcohol level exceeds the legal limit (Woods, at para. 6).\n[34] The constitutionality of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. depends on an interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d that is consistent with its ordinary meaning:\nSection 254(2) authorizes roadside testing for alcohol consumption, under pain of criminal prosecution, in violation of ss. 8 , 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . But for its requirement of immediacy, s. 254(2) would not pass constitutional muster. That requirement cannot be expanded to cover the nature and extent of the delay that occurred here.\n(Woods, at para. 15)\n[35] Although a stopped driver is being detained at the first step of the detection procedure, the driver has no right to counsel; this right exists only at the second step (Woods, at para. 31). This is the case because the word \u201cforthwith\u201d implicitly limits the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter . This is a condition for the application of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.; since the detained driver must provide a breath sample forthwith, the driver may not consult counsel before doing so. The Court has recognized that this limit on s. 10(b) of the Charter is justified under s. 1 (Thomsen, at p. 653; Woods, at para. 30) precisely because the detention is of very brief duration (Bernshaw, at para. 23). The more flexibly the word \u201cforthwith\u201d is interpreted, the less the recognized justification for limiting the right to counsel holds up.\n[36] Furthermore, as I said above, a driver who refuses or fails to comply with a demand is subject to criminal sanctions under s. 254(5) Cr. C. It is therefore not an offence to express an intention to refuse once the ASD arrives at the scene; refusing without reasonable excuse to provide forthwith a sample is what constitutes the offence (Woods, at paras. 14 and 45). This suggests that compliance must actually be physically possible.\n[37] Finally, in both its written and its oral submissions, the Crown invited this Court to interpret s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in light of the new scheme that came into force in 2018. I would decline the invitation, for the following reasons.\n(a) New Impaired Driving Detection Scheme\n[38] On June 21, 2018, the Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2018, c. 21, received royal assent. Through that Act, Parliament repealed ss. 249 to 261 of the Criminal Code and introduced ss. 320.11 to 320.4, which came into force on December 18, 2018.\n[39] The wording of s. 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C. is substantially similar to that of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. Section 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C. provides that if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol in their body and that the person has operated a conveyance within the preceding three hours, the peace officer may, by demand, require the person to immediately provide the samples of breath that, in the peace officer\u2019s opinion, are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. Under s. 320.15(1) Cr. C., everyone who fails or refuses to comply, without reasonable excuse, with such a demand is subject to criminal sanctions.\n[40] One of the distinctions between the new scheme and the former one is s. 320.27(2) Cr. C., which authorizes the random screening of drivers by peace officers who have an ASD in their possession and who are acting in the course of the lawful exercise of their powers, even if there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that a stopped driver has alcohol in their body.\n[41] According to the Crown\u2019s argument, because s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. does not expressly require peace officers to have an ASD in their possession when they make a demand, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d must not be interpreted as creating such an obligation in practice. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant urged the Court to see in the new scheme an \u201cindication\u201d that Parliament took notice of and did not wish to repudiate the jurisprudence of certain appellate courts in this country allowing delays of several minutes. In my view, this argument must be rejected, for two reasons.\n[42] First, subsequent legislative history, that is, the amendments made to the version of a provision in force at the relevant time, \u201ccan cast no light on the intention of the enacting Parliament or Legislature\u201d with respect to that version predating the amendments (United States of America v. Dynar, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at para. 45; see also Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte, 2014 SCC 55, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 725, at para. 78). As stated by s. 45(3) of the Interpretation Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I\u201121 , \u201c[t]he repeal or amendment of an enactment in whole or in part shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law.\u201d In the same vein, s. 45(4) of the Interpretation Act adds that \u201c[a] re\u2011enactment, revision, consolidation or amendment of an enactment shall not be deemed to be or to involve an adoption of the construction that has by judicial decision or otherwise been placed on the language used in the enactment or on similar language.\u201d\n[43] Even if the retention of the word \u201cimm\u00e9diatement\u201d in the French version of s. 320.27(1) Cr. C. (\u201cforthwith\u201d has been replaced by \u201cimmediately\u201d in the English version) could be seen as confirmation of the interpretation given to this word by the courts (which Parliament is presumed to know), that body of jurisprudence consists primarily of this Court\u2019s decisions in Thomsen, Grant, Bernshaw and Woods, in which this word was interpreted in a manner consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in unusual circumstances (C.A. reasons, at para. 67 in fine). As Doyon J.A. properly noted in his reasons, if Parliament had wished to depart from that interpretation, it was free to use other words \u2014 such as [translation] \u201cas soon as reasonably possible\u201d or \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d (para. 68). Yet it did not do so.\n[44] Second, and more importantly, there is a conceptual difference between the possession requirement in s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. and the immediacy requirement, which relates to temporality. Indeed, the word \u201cimmediately\u201d is also used in s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. It follows that the guidance provided by this judgment on the interpretation of the immediacy requirement in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. applies to the interpretation of the word \u201cimmediately\u201d in s. 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C.\n(3) Purpose\n[45] The detection procedure of which s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. forms a part has a purpose with both a preventive aspect and a remedial aspect, namely to combat the menace of impaired driving. First, with regard to the preventive aspect, the procedure increases the risk of detection in the minds of impaired drivers, with a view to deterring them from getting behind the wheel. Then, with regard to the remedial aspect, the procedure is intended to detect dangerous drivers quickly and get them off the road (Woods, at paras. 6 and 30; Thomsen, at p. 655).\n[46] In the pursuit of this purpose, Parliament also sought to strike a balance \u201cbetween the public interest in eradicating driver impairment and the need to safeguard individual Charter rights\u201d (Woods, at para. 29). The Court must keep this balance in mind when interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n(4) Conclusion on the Interpretation of Section 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n[47] The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d is in keeping with the purpose of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. and the context of this provision. Moreover, our Court has consistently interpreted this word by giving it this specific meaning, subject to unusual circumstances. For example, in Grant, this Court refused to interpret the word \u201cforthwith\u201d as allowing for a 30\u2011minute delay for the delivery of an ASD to the scene (see also Thomsen, at pp. 653\u201155; Woods, at paras. 13 and 43\u201144).\n[48] It was in Bernshaw that this Court opened the door to a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. In that case, a driver was pulled over and a police officer smelled alcohol on his breath. In reply to a question by the police officer, the driver admitted that he had been drinking. The officer then demanded that the driver take a screening test using an ASD, which he failed. The reliability of the result was challenged because of the possible presence of alcohol in the driver\u2019s mouth less than 15 minutes before the test, which could have falsely elevated the reading on the ASD. This Court held that the word \u201cforthwith\u201d allowed for a 15\u2011minute waiting period in order to collect a reliable sample. To reach that conclusion, it relied on the wording of the provision in force at the time, which stated that the sample obtained had to be necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. The provision thus included requirements relating to the use of the ASD in order to ensure that a proper analysis could be made, which justified a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. Nevertheless, such a delay is not acceptable in every case, but only where the officer has information suggesting that a sample collected without waiting would not be reliable (Bernshaw, at paras. 71\u201173, citing R. v. Pierman (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 704 (C.A.), aff\u2019d in part [1996] 1 S.C.R. 68).\n[49] This Court drew on Bernshaw in Woods. In that case, a driver was stopped by two police officers. Detecting a strong odour of alcohol in the driver\u2019s car, the officers demanded that he provide a breath sample pursuant to what was then s. 254(2) Cr. C. The driver refused and was arrested under s. 254(5) Cr. C. and taken to the police station, where he arrived about an hour after his arrest. At the station, the police demanded a second time that the driver provide a breath sample. The driver agreed. After several attempts, he provided a valid sample, which was a fail. He was therefore required to provide a breathalyzer sample. Based on the breathalyzer reading, the driver was charged with and later convicted of operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit.\n[50] This Court, per Fish J., held that the breath sample was inadmissible in evidence because it had been provided approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes after the demand and not \u201cforthwith\u201d as required by s. 254(2) Cr. C. Citing Bernshaw, Fish J. stated that the word \u201cforthwith\u201d may in unusual circumstances \u201cbe given a more flexible interpretation than its ordinary meaning strictly suggests\u201d (Woods, at para. 43). However, the Court noted that the immediacy requirement must generally be interpreted in accordance with the usual meaning of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d, referring in particular to R. v. C\u00f4t\u00e9 (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 667 (C.A.), in which Arbour J.A., as she then was, had found that a 14\u2011minute delay due to the absence of an ASD at the scene did not satisfy the immediacy requirement:\nSpeaking for a unanimous court, Arbour J.A. (as she then was) cited the passage I have reproduced from Grant, and explained:\nIf the accused must be taken to a detachment, where contact with counsel could more easily be accommodated than at the side of the road, a large component of the rationale in Thomsen disappears. In other words, if the police officer is not in a position to require that a breath sample be provided by the accused before any realistic opportunity to consult counsel, then the officer\u2019s demand is not a demand made under s. 238(2). The issue is thus not strictly one of computing the number of minutes that fall within or without the scope of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d. Here, the officer was ready to collect the breath sample in less than half the time it took in Grant. However, in view of the circumstances, particularly the wait at the police detachment, I conclude that the demand was not made within s. 238(2). As the demand did not comply with s. 238(2), the appellant was not required to comply with the demand and his refusal to do so did not constitute an offence. [Emphasis added; p. 285.]\nIt is for these reasons that we are prohibited on constitutional grounds from expanding the meaning of \u201cforthwith\u201d in s. 254(2) to cover the delays that occurred in this case.\n(Woods, at paras. 35\u201136)\nTherefore, the relevant time period for the explicit immediacy requirement is the period between the making of the demand and the moment when the breath sample can be provided (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). The above passage from Woods echoes the idea, originally stated in Thomsen, that a limit on the right to counsel results by implication from the language of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C., and specifically from the word \u201cforthwith\u201d. Indeed, but for the immediacy requirement, the provision \u201cwould not pass constitutional muster\u201d (Woods, at para. 15). The immediacy requirement is, of course, usually discussed in relation to the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter . However, this is not the only constitutional right that may be engaged by this requirement; this may also be the case for the rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter , which guarantee protection against, respectively, unreasonable search or seizure and arbitrary detention or imprisonment (Woods, at para. 15).\n[51] It follows that the approach adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Quansah needs to be qualified. It is true that the immediacy requirement is not met where the length of the detention was such that the stopped driver could realistically have consulted counsel. It is also true that, in the reverse case, the analysis is not at an end, because there are situations in which the immediacy requirement is not met even though there was not enough time to consult counsel (Quansah, at paras. 34\u201135). However, with respect, the Ontario Court of Appeal broadened the immediacy requirement unduly by finding that it must allow for the time \u201creasonably necessary to enable the officer to discharge his or her duty as contemplated by s. 254(2)\u201d (Quansah, at para. 47). \u201cForthwith\u201d is not synonymous with \u201ctime reasonably necessary\u201d; this word must be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in the unusual circumstances referred to by Fish J. at para. 43 of Woods.\n[52] That being so, what must be determined is whether the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time a demand is made under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. is an unusual circumstance that justifies a more flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d.\nC. Unusual Circumstances That Allow for a Flexible Interpretation of the Word \u201cForthwith\u201d\n[53] The Quebec Court of Appeal was correct in law in stating that unusual circumstances related to the use of the ASD or the reliability of the result that will be generated may justify a flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d found in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n[54] As I mentioned above, it is neither necessary nor desirable for the purposes of this appeal to identify in the abstract, and in an exhaustive manner, the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual and may justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. It is preferable for those circumstances to be identified on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis in light of the facts of each matter. However, it is important to provide some guidelines to assist lower courts in this inquiry.\n[55] First, the burden of establishing the existence of unusual circumstances rests on the Crown.\n[56] Second, as in Bernshaw, the unusual circumstances must be identified in light of the text of the provision (Piazza, at para. 81 (CanLII)). This preserves the provision\u2019s constitutional integrity by ensuring that courts do not unduly extend the ordinary meaning strictly given to the word \u201cforthwith\u201d.\n[57] Like the provision at issue in Bernshaw, s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. specifies that the sample collected must enable a \u201cproper analysis\u201d to be made, which opens the door to delays caused by unusual circumstances related to the use of the device or the reliability of the result.\n[58] That being said, courts might recognize unusual circumstances other than those directly related to the use of the ASD or the reliability of the result that will be generated. For example, insofar as the primary purpose of the impaired driving detection procedure is to ensure everyone\u2019s safety, circumstances involving urgency in ensuring the safety of the public or of peace officers might be recognized.\n[59] Third, unusual circumstances cannot arise from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency. A flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement cannot be justified by the magnitude of the public funding required to supply police forces with ASDs or by the time needed to train officers to use them. There is nothing unusual about such utilitarian considerations. Allocating a limited budget is the daily reality of any government (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie\u2011Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, at para. 153).\n[60] Fourth, the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself an unusual circumstance.\nD. A Demand Made in the Absence of an ASD Is Not Presumed To Be Valid\n[61] In oral argument, counsel for the Crown contended that a demand made in the absence of an ASD is presumed to be valid. According to counsel, a detained driver must therefore agree to provide the requested sample even though it is impossible for the driver to provide it given the absence of a device. Only if the device arrives too late (an expression that, I might add, is not clearly defined) can the driver then refuse to provide the breath sample and be shielded from any criminal liability; the presumed validity of the demand would, so to speak, lapse. On the other hand, again according to the Crown, if the driver from the outset expresses an intention to refuse to provide a sample, then the driver commits the offence provided for in s. 254(5) Cr. C., despite the physical impossibility of complying with the demand made.\n[62] The Ontario Court of Appeal adopted this reasoning in Degiorgio. The case involved a driver who refused three times to provide a breath sample when the officer had no ASD with him. The Court of Appeal, which upheld the guilty verdict, found that immediacy does not define the substance of the offence. Where a driver immediately refuses to comply, the prosecution is thus not required to show that, had it not been for the refusal, the police could have administered the test in accordance with the immediacy requirement (Degiorgio, at paras. 57\u201158, quoting with approval R. v. Danychuk (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.)).\n[63] With respect, I do not agree. As I have already explained, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d qualifies the demand to provide a breath sample. It is refusing to obey that demand to provide forthwith a sample that constitutes a criminal offence, not stating in advance that one will refuse to comply with the demand once an ASD is available at the scene. Moreover, and as Doyon J.A. properly noted at paras. 49\u201150 and 55 of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, how can a person be criminally liable for refusing to comply with a demand \u2014 that is, a demand to provide a breath sample \u2014 with which it was not actually possible to comply because of the absence of an ASD at the time the demand was made? To ask the question is to answer it.\n[64] More fundamentally, a demand cannot be both valid and invalid. In other words, to reiterate what the Court of Appeal in essence said, the validity of a demand cannot be conditional on the time needed for an ASD to be delivered to the scene (C.A. reasons, at paras. 51\u201161). This would be the situation if the approach of the Crown and the Ontario Court of Appeal were accepted.\n[65] Such an approach creates intolerable uncertainty for drivers. It is a basic legal principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse. It must therefore be possible for people to know in advance, before committing an act, whether the act constitutes a crime (Mabior, at para. 14). When a detained driver has to respond to a demand to provide a breath sample, the driver must be able to know whether the demand is valid and whether refusing will result in criminal liability (C.A. reasons, at para. 51). In a context where the driver is unable to retain and instruct counsel, it cannot legitimately and realistically be expected that the driver will agree in advance to comply and will then be capable of determining when the delay in the delivery of an ASD justifies a refusal. This also shows why a restrained approach must be taken in identifying what may constitute an \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d allowing for a flexible interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d. The more flexibly the word is interpreted, thereby turning immediacy into a variable requirement, the more necessary it becomes for drivers to retain and instruct counsel (R. v. Talbourdet (1984), 9 D.L.R. (4th) 406 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 414\u201115, a contrario). Indeed, this was the wish expressed by the respondent after he first refused to provide a breath sample.\n[66] Nothing in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. indicates that Parliament intended to create the presumption of validity proposed by the Crown. That being said, peace officers who have no ASD with them when they stop a driver who is suspected of having alcohol in their body are not entirely without options. They can require the driver to perform coordination tests, as permitted by the current s. 320.27(1)(a) Cr. C. These officers also have common law powers to check for sobriety. Where doing so is reasonable and necessary, they can, among other things, question a driver who is lawfully stopped about prior alcohol consumption or ask the driver to perform physical tests other than those provided for in the Criminal Code (R. v. Orbanski, 2005 SCC 37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 43\u201149; Leclerc v. R., 2022 QCCA 365, at paras. 45\u201148 (CanLII)).\n[67] Finally, I should address the Crown\u2019s argument that the respondent cannot rely on the absence of an ASD at the scene to justify his refusal because he was unaware of that absence while stopped by the police. With respect, I disagree. Accepting this argument could encourage peace officers not to be transparent, because when they stop a driver, they are normally the only ones to know whether or not they are in possession of an ASD. This would mean that peace officers could, at their sole discretion and in an arbitrary manner, make valid a demand that otherwise would have been invalid if the driver had been informed of the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the driver was stopped.\nE. Application to the Facts of the Case\n[68] The Crown has not shown that there was any unusual circumstance that would account for the absence of an ASD at the scene and thereby justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. In fact, the appellant is unable to explain why Constables Atkins and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux did not have an ASD in their possession. The demand made by Constable Atkins was therefore invalid. Accordingly, the respondent\u2019s refusal did not attract criminal liability, and the acquittal entered by the Quebec Court of Appeal must be upheld.\nVII. Disposition\n[69] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Qu\u00e9bec; Giasson et associ\u00e9s \u2014 Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Labrecque Doyon, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des avocats et avocates de la d\u00e9fense: BMD Avocats inc., Laval.\nSolicitors for the intervener Association des avocats de la d\u00e9fense de Montr\u00e9al\u2011Laval\u2011Longueuil: Marcoux Elayoubi Raymond, Longueuil; Desjardins C\u00f4t\u00e9, Montr\u00e9al.\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n[1] Section 254 was repealed in 2018 by the Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2018, c. 21. It was replaced by s. 320.27, which is nearly identical.\n"

C-5.3, art. 5, 10.\nEn juin 2018, le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral adopte la Loi sur le cannabis (\u00ab Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb) qui d\u00e9criminalise l\u2019usage r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif du cannabis. Cette loi prohibe la possession de plantes de cannabis ainsi que la culture de telles plantes \u00e0 des fins personnelles, mais exempte de ces prohibitions la possession et la culture d\u2019au plus quatre plantes. Au m\u00eame moment, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois met en place son propre r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation du cannabis en adoptant un projet de loi qui, entre autres, cr\u00e9e la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis (\u00ab SQDC \u00bb), laquelle exerce un monopole de vente du cannabis au Qu\u00e9bec. Il \u00e9dicte \u00e9galement la Loi encadrant le cannabis (\u00ab Loi provinciale \u00bb). Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale interdisent totalement la possession de plantes de cannabis ainsi que la culture de telles plantes \u00e0 des fins personnelles dans une maison d\u2019habitation. Ces interdictions sont assorties d\u2019amendes.\nEn octobre 2018, M intente en Cour sup\u00e9rieure une action en son nom et au nom de toutes les personnes qui, au Qu\u00e9bec, sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre poursuivies pour possession, dans leur maison d\u2019habitation, d\u2019une plante de cannabis. Il soutient que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel pr\u00e9vue au par. 91(27) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , et outrepassent les chefs de comp\u00e9tence reconnus aux provinces. Il demande \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de d\u00e9clarer ces dispositions ultra vires ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, inop\u00e9rantes par application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9clare les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constitutionnellement invalides. La Cour d\u2019appel infirme le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et confirme la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des art. 5 et 10, pour le motif que ceux-ci rel\u00e8vent des comp\u00e9tences conf\u00e9r\u00e9es aux provinces par les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Elle conclut de surcro\u00eet que les dispositions contest\u00e9es sont op\u00e9rantes.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est rejet\u00e9.\nLes articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constituent un exercice valide par la l\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec des comp\u00e9tences que lui conf\u00e8rent les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . De plus, les dispositions n\u2019entravent pas la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet du texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et elles sont en cons\u00e9quence op\u00e9rantes.\nPour d\u00e9cider si une loi ou certaines de ses dispositions sont constitutionnellement valides au regard du partage des comp\u00e9tences, il faut d\u2019abord proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la qualification de cette loi ou de ces dispositions, puis, sur cette base, \u00e0 leur classification parmi les chefs de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 .\n\u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la loi en examinant son objet et ses effets. Aux fins d\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet, les tribunaux font appel \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve intrins\u00e8que, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au texte m\u00eame de la loi, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que tels que les d\u00e9bats parlementaires. Dans leur examen des effets de la loi, les tribunaux tiennent compte tant de ses effets juridiques (ceux \u00e9tant directement li\u00e9s aux dispositions de la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame), que de ses effets pratiques (les effets secondaires d\u00e9coulant de son application). Lorsque des dispositions bien pr\u00e9cises d\u2019une loi qui, pr\u00e9tend-on, font partie int\u00e9grante d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation, sont attaqu\u00e9es, les tribunaux qualifient d\u2019abord les dispositions plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la loi dans son ensemble. Mais cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il faille interpr\u00e9ter isol\u00e9ment les dispositions. Une lecture et analyse contextuelle des dispositions contest\u00e9es qui prend en compte le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation au sein duquel elles sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9es s\u2019av\u00e8re cruciale pour distinguer l\u2019objet de la loi des moyens retenus pour le r\u00e9aliser.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est indispensable d\u2019analyser les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale au regard de leur contexte et non pas de leur simple libell\u00e9. En ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve intrins\u00e8que aux fins d\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet, un survol de la Loi provinciale r\u00e9v\u00e8le un vaste syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9glementation incluant la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un monopole d\u2019\u00c9tat, confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la SQDC, qui supervise chacune des \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019achat par les citoyens de cannabis dans le but d\u2019assurer la protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population. Les articles 5 et 10 ne poursuivent pas l\u2019objectif autonome et ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019interdire la possession et la culture de plantes de cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles. Les interdictions elles-m\u00eames sont un moyen, parmi un large \u00e9ventail de mesures, pour r\u00e9aliser les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques de la Loi provinciale puisqu\u2019elles agissent comme de s\u00e9rieux incitatifs \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration des consommateurs au march\u00e9 licite du cannabis. En ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que, les interventions des parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois confirment que les interdictions facilitent l\u2019approvisionnement des consommateurs aupr\u00e8s de la SQDC. Les dispositions contest\u00e9es ne repr\u00e9sentent pas une tentative d\u00e9guis\u00e9e de r\u00e9\u00e9dicter les interdictions de possession et culture de cannabis abrog\u00e9es par le Parlement, vu l\u2019absence totale de preuve d\u2019un dessein l\u00e9gislatif dit inappropri\u00e9. Quant aux effets des dispositions contest\u00e9es, celles-ci ont pour cons\u00e9quence pratique d\u2019emp\u00eacher les citoyens de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver des plantes de cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles et d\u2019obliger les consommateurs \u00e0 s\u2019approvisionner aupr\u00e8s de la SQDC. En ce qui concerne les cons\u00e9quences juridiques, les dispositions prohibent la possession et la culture de plantes de cannabis et imposent des sanctions p\u00e9nales en cas de contravention. Ensemble, les effets juridiques et pratiques confirment la conclusion d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019analyse de la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que : les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale ont pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable d\u2019assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique de vente du cannabis afin de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public, particuli\u00e8rement celles des jeunes, contre les m\u00e9faits de cette substance.\n\u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si les dispositions contest\u00e9es rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le droit criminel pr\u00e9vue au par. 91(27) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , ou des comp\u00e9tences attribu\u00e9es aux provinces sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils ainsi que sur les mati\u00e8res de nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e par les par. 92(13) et (16) respectivement. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, m\u00eame si les art. 5 et 10 pr\u00e9sentent en apparence les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de droit criminel, en ce qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9voient des interdictions assorties de sanctions et reposent sur un objet valide de droit criminel, ils ne doivent pas pour autant \u00eatre class\u00e9s sous le par. 91(27). La d\u00e9criminalisation partielle du cannabis par le Parlement a ouvert la voie \u00e0 l\u2019intervention l\u00e9gislative des provinces. En interdisant la possession et la culture \u00e0 domicile de plantes de cannabis, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le par. 92(15) d\u2019\u00e9dicter des mesures p\u00e9nales destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une loi par ailleurs valide. Les articles 5 et 10, qui contribuent \u00e0 assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique et ainsi \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public, se rattachent clairement aux chefs de comp\u00e9tence provinciaux puisque les interventions l\u00e9gislatives des provinces en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 publique ont pour assises principales la comp\u00e9tence large et pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils (par. 92(13)), ainsi que la comp\u00e9tence r\u00e9siduelle sur les mati\u00e8res de nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province (par. 92(16)). L\u2019intervention du l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 t\u00e9moigne ici d\u2019un esprit de r\u00e9glementation, et non pas de r\u00e9pression d\u2019une menace ou d\u2019un mal. Cela est d\u2019importance puisque la sant\u00e9, en tant que mati\u00e8re non attribu\u00e9e dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un chevauchement de comp\u00e9tences. En vertu de la doctrine du double aspect, le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales peuvent adopter des lois sur des mati\u00e8res qui, par leur nature m\u00eame, comportent \u00e0 la fois une facette provinciale et une facette f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019encadrement de l\u2019usage du cannabis pr\u00e9sente un double aspect en ce qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre abord\u00e9 suivant la perspective du droit criminel (en vertu du par. 91(27)), en r\u00e9primant un mal, ou un effet nuisible ou ind\u00e9sirable pour le public; et celle de la sant\u00e9 ou du commerce (en vertu des par. 92(13) et (16)), en r\u00e9glementant notamment les conditions de production, de distribution et de vente de la substance. Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, qui encadrent l\u2019usage du cannabis suivant cette deuxi\u00e8me perspective normative, sont en cons\u00e9quence intra vires de la l\u00e9gislature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\nDes dispositions d\u2019une loi provinciale qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es constitutionnellement valides peuvent n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es inop\u00e9rantes, suivant la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans les cas o\u00f9 il existe (1) un conflit d\u2019application; ou (2) une entrave \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la seule question qui se pose consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe un conflit d\u2019objets, ce qui suppose d\u2019\u00e9tablir d\u2019abord quel est l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de d\u00e9terminer ensuite si les dispositions de la Loi provinciale sont incompatibles avec cet objet.\nLa Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas pour objet de cr\u00e9er, et ce, dans le but de limiter les activit\u00e9s illicites li\u00e9es au cannabis, des droits positifs permettant de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver \u00e0 des fins personnelles au plus quatre plantes de cannabis. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation ne correspond pas \u00e0 la nature essentiellement prohibitive du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel, et n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e par le texte de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Les interdictions aux art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale r\u00e9pondent directement \u00e0 plusieurs des objectifs de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de cette loi. De plus, m\u00eame si les approches retenues respectivement par le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le l\u00e9gislateur provincial \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019auto-culture du cannabis sont diff\u00e9rentes, la Loi provinciale t\u00e9moigne au m\u00eame titre que la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019un souci de lutter contre le crime organis\u00e9. Les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques poursuivis par la Loi provinciale et ses interdictions aux art. 5 et 10 sont donc en harmonie avec les objectifs vis\u00e9s par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit d\u2019objets.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. c.

Suivant cette loi, il est interdit \u00e0 tout individu d\u2019avoir en sa possession ou de cultiver plus de quatre plantes de cannabis \u00e0 son domicile. Les provinces et les territoires ont par la suite adopt\u00e9 leurs propres lois afin de r\u00e9glementer des questions d\u2019ordre pratique telles les modalit\u00e9s de vente et d\u2019entreposage du cannabis. Dans le cadre d\u2019un vaste projet l\u00e9gislatif incluant l\u2019instauration d\u2019un monopole de vente du cannabis, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a pour sa part adopt\u00e9 des dispositions prohibant compl\u00e8tement la possession et la culture de plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile, quel que soit le nombre de plantes. Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si les dispositions qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises sont constitutionnellement valides au vu du partage des comp\u00e9tences et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si elles sont op\u00e9rantes au regard de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que les dispositions contest\u00e9es constituent un exercice valide par la l\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec des comp\u00e9tences que lui conf\u00e8rent les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Je conclus \u00e9galement que les dispositions contest\u00e9es n\u2019entravent pas la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet du texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et qu\u2019elles sont en cons\u00e9quence op\u00e9rantes.\n[2] Dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je n\u2019\u00e9mets aucune opinion sur l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 ou le bien-fond\u00e9 des approches retenues respectivement par le Parlement et le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Je m\u2019attache \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi deux approches \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019auto\u2011culture de cannabis \u2014 l\u2019approche f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dite plus \u00ab permissive \u00bb, et l\u2019approche qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise dite plus \u00ab restrictive \u00bb \u2014 peuvent coexister sur le plan juridique au sein de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne.\nI. Contexte\n[3] En 2018, le Canada est devenu le deuxi\u00e8me pays du monde apr\u00e8s l\u2019Uruguay, et le tout premier pays du G7, \u00e0 d\u00e9criminaliser l\u2019usage r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif du cannabis. La d\u00e9criminalisation de cette substance psychoactive, aussi appel\u00e9e marijuana, marque un v\u00e9ritable changement d\u2019approche par rapport \u00e0 celle qui \u00e9tait suivie au pays depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un si\u00e8cle. En effet, la consommation, la possession et la vente du cannabis avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 criminalis\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1923, lorsque cette substance fut ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la liste des stup\u00e9fiants bannis par la Loi de l\u2019opium et des drogues narcotiques, 1923, S.C. 1923, c. 22. Le cannabis a, de nombreuses d\u00e9cennies plus tard, \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit \u00e0 la liste des substances contr\u00f4l\u00e9es figurant \u00e0 l\u2019ann. II de la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances , L.C. 1996, c. 19 (\u00ab LRDS \u00bb).\n[4] Le 19 juin 2018, le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a adopt\u00e9 le projet de loi C-45, Loi concernant le cannabis et modifiant la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances, le Code criminel et d\u2019autres lois, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g. Cette loi est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 17 octobre 2018 sous le nom de Loi sur le cannabis , L.C. 2018, c. 16 (\u00ab Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb). La d\u00e9criminalisation de l\u2019usage r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif du cannabis est au c\u0153ur de cette mesure l\u00e9gislative qui soustrait cette substance \u00e0 l\u2019application des interdictions criminelles pr\u00e9vues aux art. 4 \u00e0 7.1 de la LRDS . La Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale prohibe la possession de plantes de cannabis ainsi que la culture de telles plantes \u00e0 des fins personnelles, mais exempte de ces prohibitions la possession et la culture d\u2019au plus quatre plantes. Les dispositions cr\u00e9ant ces prohibitions sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ainsi :\nPossession\n8 (1) Sauf autorisation pr\u00e9vue sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi :\n. . .\ne) il est interdit \u00e0 tout individu d\u2019avoir en sa possession plus de quatre plantes de cannabis qui sont ni en train de bourgeonner ni en train de fleurir;\n. . .\nProduction\n12 . . .\n. . .\nCulture, multiplication ou r\u00e9colte \u2014 individu \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix-huit ans ou plus\n(4) Sauf autorisation pr\u00e9vue sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi, il est interdit \u00e0 tout individu \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix-huit ans ou plus de se livrer aux activit\u00e9s suivantes :\n. . .\nb) cultiver, multiplier ou r\u00e9colter plus de quatre plantes de cannabis au m\u00eame moment dans sa maison d\u2019habitation, ou offrir de le faire.\n[5] L\u2019adoption de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale repr\u00e9sente un changement de paradigme dans le paysage juridique canadien. D\u2019une approche ax\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9pression, le Canada a migr\u00e9 \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime confiant aux provinces la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer le cadre r\u00e9gissant la vente et la distribution du cannabis sur leur territoire respectif. En d\u2019autres mots, les provinces sont appel\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer, dans leurs champs de comp\u00e9tence, sur une substance qui faisait jusqu\u2019alors, et ce, depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un si\u00e8cle, l\u2019objet de prohibitions de nature criminelle. Les lois et r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis par les provinces parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale instaurent principalement des r\u00e8gles encadrant la vente de la substance, par exemple en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019emplacement, au fonctionnement et au personnel des magasins o\u00f9 sont vendus les diff\u00e9rents produits du cannabis. Bon nombre des mesures l\u00e9gislatives provinciales pr\u00e9voient \u00e9galement des restrictions suppl\u00e9mentaires, qui s\u2019ajoutent au cadre l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, notamment pour ce qui est de l\u2019\u00e2ge minimal requis pour acheter du cannabis, de la limite applicable en mati\u00e8re de possession de cette substance et des lieux o\u00f9 celle-ci peut \u00eatre consomm\u00e9e en public.\n[6] Le 12 juin 2018, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a mis en place son propre r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation du cannabis en adoptant le projet de loi no 157, Loi constituant la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis, \u00e9dictant la Loi encadrant le cannabis et modifiant diverses dispositions en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re, 1re sess., 41e l\u00e9g. La cr\u00e9ation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis (\u00ab SQDC \u00bb), une filiale de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec exer\u00e7ant un monopole de vente de la substance au Qu\u00e9bec, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019une des mesures les plus importantes. L\u2019\u00e9diction de la Loi encadrant le cannabis, RLRQ, c. C\u20115.3 (\u00ab Loi provinciale \u00bb) en a \u00e9t\u00e9 une autre. La Loi provinciale comprend une vaste gamme de dispositions concernant la possession, la culture, l\u2019usage, le transport, l\u2019entreposage, la vente et la promotion du cannabis sur le territoire du Qu\u00e9bec. Les dispositions particuli\u00e8res de la Loi provinciale qui sont contest\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les art. 5 et 10, qui interdisent totalement la possession de plantes de cannabis ainsi que la culture de telles plantes \u00e0 des fins personnelles dans une maison d\u2019habitation. Ces interdictions sont assorties d\u2019amendes allant de 250 $ \u00e0 750 $, lesquelles sont port\u00e9es au double en cas de r\u00e9cidive:\n5. Il est interdit d\u2019avoir en sa possession une plante de cannabis.\nQuiconque contrevient aux dispositions du premier alin\u00e9a commet une infraction et est passible d\u2019une amende de 250 $ \u00e0 750 $. En cas de r\u00e9cidive, ces montants sont port\u00e9s au double.\n10. Il est interdit de faire la culture de cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles.\nCette interdiction de culture s\u2019applique notamment \u00e0 la plantation des graines et des plantes, la reproduction des plantes par boutures, la culture des plantes et la r\u00e9colte de leur production.\nQuiconque contrevient aux dispositions du premier alin\u00e9a en faisant la culture de quatre plantes de cannabis ou moins dans sa maison d\u2019habitation commet une infraction et est passible d\u2019une amende de 250 $ \u00e0 750 $. En cas de r\u00e9cidive, ces montants sont port\u00e9s au double.\nAux fins du troisi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a, une \u00ab maison d\u2019habitation \u00bb a le sens que lui donne le paragraphe 8 de l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur le cannabis (L.C. 2018, c. 16 ).\n[7] En cons\u00e9quence, aux termes des art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, la possession et la culture \u00e0 domicile de plantes de cannabis sont sanctionn\u00e9es p\u00e9nalement au Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 tout comme au Manitoba d\u2019ailleurs, cette province ayant adopt\u00e9 une approche similaire \u00e0 celle du Qu\u00e9bec dans sa Loi sur la r\u00e9glementation des alcools, des jeux et du cannabis, C.P.L.M., c. L153, par. 101.13(1) et art. 101.15.\n[8] Le 25 octobre 2018, l\u2019appelant devant notre Cour, Janick Murray-Hall, a intent\u00e9 en Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec une action en son nom et au nom de toutes les personnes qui, au Qu\u00e9bec, sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre poursuivies pour possession, dans leur maison d\u2019habitation, d\u2019une plante de cannabis et de subir ainsi les cons\u00e9quences p\u00e9nales d\u00e9coulant de la Loi provinciale. Il soutient alors que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel pr\u00e9vue au par. 91(27) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 et outrepassent les chefs de comp\u00e9tence reconnus aux provinces. Il demande \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de d\u00e9clarer ces dispositions ultra vires ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, de les d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rantes par application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2019 QCCS 3664\n[9] Le 3 septembre 2019, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 M. Murray-Hall, et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constitutionnellement invalides.\n[10] La cour est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 cette conclusion d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en qualifiant, dans un premier temps, le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable des dispositions contest\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant le fait d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tablir une interdiction compl\u00e8te de la culture personnelle de cannabis, car elle est de nature \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique \u00bb (par. 51 (CanLII)). Le caract\u00e8re absolu des interdictions ainsi que le sentiment de \u00ab d\u00e9sapprobation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb (par. 46) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la consommation de cannabis se d\u00e9gageant des d\u00e9bats parlementaires permettent, selon la cour, de conclure que les dispositions contest\u00e9es ne visent pas simplement \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population. Elles auraient plut\u00f4t pour objet de \u00ab r\u00e9primer la production personnelle de cannabis \u00bb (ibid.) comme le faisaient les anciennes dispositions de la LRDS , ce qui am\u00e8ne la cour \u00e0 conclure au caract\u00e8re \u00ab d\u00e9guis\u00e9 \u00bb des dispositions contest\u00e9es. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019argument portant que les interdictions \u00e9tablies aux art. 5 et 10 constituent des moyens pour r\u00e9aliser les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Loi provinciale, la cour juge qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 par la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que ni par l\u2019examen des effets. De l\u2019avis de la cour, \u00ab les interdictions pos\u00e9es par les articles 5 et 10 ne sont pas des moyens, mais bien l\u2019objet m\u00eame de ces dispositions \u00bb (par. 76).\n[11] La Cour sup\u00e9rieure poursuit son examen de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle et statue que les dispositions contest\u00e9es rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification, la cour conclut \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence des trois caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de droit criminel valide, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la similitude des dispositions contest\u00e9es et des dispositions de la LRDS qui interdisaient autrefois la possession et la culture de cannabis. La cour ajoute que la th\u00e9orie du double aspect ne trouve pas application dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, puisque, de par le caract\u00e8re absolu des interdictions qu\u2019ils contiennent, les art. 5 et 10 se rattachent uniquement au pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en droit criminel. \u00c9voquant la possibilit\u00e9 de restreindre la possession et culture personnelle de cannabis \u00e0 une, deux ou trois plantes, la cour souligne qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l est \u00e9vident qu\u2019au-del\u00e0 de z\u00e9ro plant, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 envisageable que la province puisse l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer, soit au niveau de la sant\u00e9 ou de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 87).\n[12] Enfin, la cour conclut que les dispositions jug\u00e9es invalides ne peuvent \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9es en vertu de la doctrine des pouvoirs accessoires. En effet, elles ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es suffisamment int\u00e9gr\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi provinciale, par ailleurs jug\u00e9e valide dans son ensemble, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les interdictions totales qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9voient n\u2019\u00e9taient \u00ab pas absolument n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb (par. 99). Selon la cour, l\u2019imposition d\u2019une restriction plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re que celle impos\u00e9e par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant le nombre de plantes, au lieu des interdictions absolues, aurait permis de r\u00e9aliser les objectifs poursuivis par la l\u00e9gislature provinciale.\n[13] Ayant conclu \u00e0 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, la cour a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re op\u00e9rant des dispositions. Elle rejette en outre la demande de suspension de la d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, au motif qu\u2019aucun vide juridique ni chaos ne sont susceptibles de d\u00e9couler de sa d\u00e9cision.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021 QCCA 1325\n[14] Dans un arr\u00eat unanime, la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a infirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et en cons\u00e9quence confirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, pour le motif que ceux-ci rel\u00e8vent des comp\u00e9tences conf\u00e9r\u00e9es aux provinces par les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 .\n[15] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification, la cour estime que le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable des dispositions contest\u00e9es consiste \u00e0 \u00ab mettre en place l\u2019un des moyens choisis pour assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole d\u2019\u00c9tat confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la SQDC \u00bb (par. 82 (CanLII)), monopole dont la cr\u00e9ation vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir et \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les m\u00e9faits du cannabis, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population. Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, qui interdisent la possession et la culture \u00e0 domicile, ont donc pour objet de diriger les consommateurs vers la seule source d\u2019approvisionnement ayant re\u00e7u la confiance du l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a conclu la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, les dispositions contest\u00e9es ne poursuivent pas un \u00ab objectif autonome et ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019interdire la culture personnelle de cannabis \u00bb (par. 81). Dans son raisonnement, la Cour d\u2019appel insiste sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de tenir compte de la Loi provinciale dans sa globalit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que de faire une lecture isol\u00e9e des art. 5 et 10. Elle invite \u00e9galement \u00e0 la prudence dans l\u2019analyse des d\u00e9bats parlementaires, lesquels ne d\u00e9montrent pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019existence d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e visant \u00e0 r\u00e9primer moralement la possession et la culture personnelle de cannabis en tant que telles.\n[16] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification, la Cour d\u2019appel conclut que les dispositions contest\u00e9es se rattachent aux comp\u00e9tences provinciales pr\u00e9vues aux par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Elle juge que la pr\u00e9sente affaire se pr\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019application de la doctrine du double aspect, les deux ordres de gouvernement poursuivant des objectifs parall\u00e8les qui s\u2019inscrivent dans leurs champs de comp\u00e9tence respectifs. Le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, note-t-elle, \u00ab cherche \u00e0 mieux contr\u00f4ler l\u2019immixtion des organisations criminelles \u00bb dans le march\u00e9 du cannabis en rempla\u00e7ant une mesure qu\u2019il juge inefficace (la prohibition totale de la possession) par une mesure qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de r\u00e9duire l\u2019importance du r\u00f4le du crime organis\u00e9 (la d\u00e9criminalisation de la possession d\u2019une quantit\u00e9 restreinte) (par. 93). Le l\u00e9gislateur provincial cherche pour sa part \u00e0 assurer un contr\u00f4le efficace de l\u2019acc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9 au cannabis en cr\u00e9ant un monopole \u00e9tatique de distribution.\n[17] Ayant confirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des dispositions contest\u00e9es, la Cour d\u2019appel conclut de surcro\u00eet qu\u2019elles sont op\u00e9rantes au regard de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Se penchant sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une entrave \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la cour rejette l\u2019argument de M. Murray-Hall selon lequel le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ait non pas seulement d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9 la culture \u00e0 domicile, mais l\u2019ait v\u00e9ritablement autoris\u00e9e dans le but de limiter l\u2019exercice des activit\u00e9s illicites li\u00e9es au cannabis. La cour note que le texte de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment aucun droit positif de poss\u00e9der ou de cultiver des plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile \u00e0 des fins personnelles. Elle ajoute que l\u2019argument de M. Murray-Hall est d\u2019autant plus troublant qu\u2019il repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle le Parlement poss\u00e9derait le pouvoir en vertu de sa comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel non seulement d\u2019interdire des comportements, mais celui d\u2019en d\u2019autoriser formellement. Enfin, la Cour d\u2019appel souligne \u00e0 nouveau la compl\u00e9mentarit\u00e9 des deux lois en cause, lesquelles refl\u00e8tent le m\u00eame souci de combattre les m\u00e9faits associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la consommation de cannabis. En cons\u00e9quence, il est possible selon elle de donner \u00e0 la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une interpr\u00e9tation qui soit conforme au principe du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif, et de conclure que celle-ci \u00ab n\u2019a pas limit\u00e9 le pouvoir de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e nationale d\u2019interdire la culture priv\u00e9e du cannabis dans le cadre de la mise en \u0153uvre de moyens propres \u00e0 atteindre ses objectifs \u00bb (par. 139).\nIII. Questions en litige\n[18] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve les deux questions suivantes :\nA. La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle fait erreur en droit en concluant que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont constitutionnellement valides?\nB. La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle fait erreur en droit en concluant que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont constitutionnellement op\u00e9rants?\n[19] Bien que M. Murray-Hall ne mentionne express\u00e9ment que la premi\u00e8re question dans ses observations \u00e9crites, je suis d\u2019avis que notre Cour doit \u00e9galement se pencher sur la deuxi\u00e8me. Plusieurs des arguments de M. Murray-Hall se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue incompatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019objets entre la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale. La Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9galement consacr\u00e9 une bonne partie de ses motifs \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019application des dispositions contest\u00e9es entrave ou nuit \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans de telles circonstances, il m\u2019appara\u00eet avis\u00e9 de trancher cette question, en apportant toutes les nuances n\u00e9cessaires.\nIV. Analyse\nA. La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle fait erreur en droit en concluant que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont constitutionnellement valides?\n[20] Comme je l\u2019explique ci-apr\u00e8s, je suis d\u2019avis que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constituent un exercice valide par la l\u00e9gislature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des comp\u00e9tences que lui conf\u00e8rent les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , et que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a donc pas commis d\u2019erreur dans son examen de la validit\u00e9 des dispositions contest\u00e9es. Je vais d\u2019abord pr\u00e9senter le cadre d\u2019analyse que j\u2019applique pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion.\n(1) Cadre d\u2019analyse\n[21] Le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des lois est bien \u00e9tabli et ne fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune controverse particuli\u00e8re dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de sorte qu\u2019un bref rappel suffira.\n[22] Pour d\u00e9cider si une loi ou certaines de ses dispositions sont constitutionnellement valides au regard du partage des comp\u00e9tences, les tribunaux doivent d\u2019abord proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la qualification de cette loi ou de ces dispositions, puis, sur cette base, \u00e0 leur classification parmi les chefs de comp\u00e9tence \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, 2020 CSC 17, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 283, par. 26, citant Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu (Can.), 2000 CSC 31, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 783, par. 15).\n[23] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la loi (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, par. 28, citant Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest c. Alberta, 2007 CSC 22, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 26). Dans la jurisprudence de la Cour, cette op\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme visant \u00e0 d\u00e9gager l\u2019\u00ab objet principal \u00bb de la loi (RJR-MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1995] 3 R.C.S. 199, par. 29), sa \u00ab caract\u00e9ristique principale ou la plus importante \u00bb (Friends of the Oldman River Society c. Canada (Ministre des Transports), [1992] 1 R.C.S. 3, p. 62\u201163), ou encore son \u00ab id\u00e9e ma\u00eetresse \u00bb (R. c. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 463, p. 481\u2011482). L\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification consiste quant \u00e0 elle \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable ainsi circonscrit rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019un des chefs de comp\u00e9tence du l\u00e9gislateur qui a adopt\u00e9 le texte de loi (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, par. 25).\n[24] Pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable d\u2019une loi, les tribunaux examinent son objet et ses effets (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, par. 16). Cette op\u00e9ration essentiellement interpr\u00e9tative ne se veut ni technique, ni formaliste, pour reprendre les mots du regrett\u00e9 professeur Peter W. Hogg (Constitutional Law of Canada (\u00e9d. feuilles mobiles), vol. 1, p. 15\u201112, cit\u00e9 dans Ward c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 17, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 569, par. 18). En effet, il est loisible aux tribunaux de prendre en compte, outre les termes employ\u00e9s dans la loi elle-m\u00eame, les circonstances dans lesquelles celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e (Ward, par. 17, citant Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, par. 17\u201118, et Morgentaler, p. 483).\n[25] Aux fins d\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet, les tribunaux font appel \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve intrins\u00e8que, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au texte m\u00eame de la loi, y compris son pr\u00e9ambule et les dispositions \u00e9non\u00e7ant ses objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que tels que les d\u00e9bats parlementaires et les proc\u00e8s-verbaux de comit\u00e9s parlementaires (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 27; Bande Kitkatla c. Colombie-Britannique (Ministre des Petites et moyennes entreprises, du Tourisme et de la Culture), 2002 CSC 31, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 146, par. 53\u201154; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la procr\u00e9ation assist\u00e9e, 2010 CSC 61, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 457 (\u00ab Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la LPA \u00bb), par. 22 et 184). Dans leur examen des effets de la loi, les tribunaux tiennent compte tant de ses effets juridiques, soit ceux \u00e9tant directement li\u00e9s aux dispositions de la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame, que de ses effets pratiques, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les effets \u00ab secondaires \u00bb d\u00e9coulant de son application (Bande Kitkatla, par. 54, citant Morgentaler, p. 482-483).\n[26] Cela dit, j\u2019insiste tout de m\u00eame sur le fait que c\u2019est l\u2019analyse du texte qui est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019op\u00e9ration de qualification. Comme le rappelait le juge Kasirer dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, \u00ab [e]n fin de compte, c\u2019est la substance m\u00eame de la loi qu\u2019il faut qualifier, et non les discours prononc\u00e9s devant le Parlement ou les propos publi\u00e9s dans la presse \u00bb (par. 165).\n[27] Les prochaines sections sont consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 ces deux \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse \u2014 la qualification et la classification \u2014, l\u2019op\u00e9ration ayant pour objectif de d\u00e9terminer si les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit jug\u00e9s constitutionnellement valides par la Cour d\u2019appel.\n(2) La qualification des dispositions contest\u00e9es\n[28] \u00c0 mon avis, les dispositions contest\u00e9es ont pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable d\u2019assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique, dans un but de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population, particuli\u00e8rement celles des jeunes, contre les m\u00e9faits du cannabis. Il s\u2019ensuit que les interdictions visant la possession de plantes de cannabis et leur culture \u00e0 domicile pr\u00e9vues aux art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constituent un moyen au service des objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques poursuivis par cette m\u00eame loi. \u00c0 quelques nuances pr\u00e8s, ma conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de de la qualification rejoint celle de la Cour d\u2019appel.\n[29] Avant d\u2019entreprendre l\u2019analyse, je vais faire un bref survol des principes applicables \u00e0 la qualification de dispositions qui, pr\u00e9tend-on, font partie int\u00e9grante d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation. Il est utile de pr\u00e9ciser dans quelle mesure les tribunaux devraient proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019analyse d\u2019une loi dans son ensemble afin de qualifier certaines de ses dispositions. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question est pertinente \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le d\u00e9saccord entre les parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification repose essentiellement sur l\u2019importance que celles-ci accordent respectivement aux dispositions contest\u00e9es et \u00e0 la Loi provinciale consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans sa globalit\u00e9. Monsieur Murray-Hall insiste sur les dispositions elles-m\u00eames, et reproche \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel de ne pas avoir v\u00e9ritablement envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que celles-ci poursuivent un objectif distinct de celui vis\u00e9 globalement par la loi. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec met plut\u00f4t l\u2019accent sur le r\u00f4le que jouent les dispositions au sein du r\u00e9gime, faisant siens les propos de la Cour d\u2019appel selon lesquels \u00ab leur v\u00e9ritable objectif ne se d\u00e9gage que lorsqu\u2019on les analyse dans le contexte global de la [Loi provinciale] \u00bb (par. 43).\n[30] Lorsque, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, seules des dispositions bien pr\u00e9cises sont attaqu\u00e9es et non pas toute la loi, certains principes s\u2019appliquent. Il convient de qualifier d\u2019abord les dispositions plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la loi dans son ensemble, un principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 par le juge Dickson (plus tard juge en chef) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Transports Nationaux du Canada, Lt\u00e9e, [1983] 2 R.C.S. 206. Mais, d\u2019ajouter le juge Dickson, cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il faille interpr\u00e9ter isol\u00e9ment les dispositions. Une analyse contextuelle des dispositions s\u2019impose lorsqu\u2019elles font partie d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9glementation. Voici les propos du juge Dickson \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard :\nIl est \u00e9vident au d\u00e9part qu\u2019une disposition inconstitutionnelle ne sera pas sauv\u00e9e par son insertion dans une loi par ailleurs valide, m\u00eame si cette loi comporte un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9glementation \u00e9tabli en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9changes et de commerce que conf\u00e8re le par. 91(2). La bonne m\u00e9thode, lorsque l\u2019on doute que la disposition contest\u00e9e ait la m\u00eame caract\u00e9risation constitutionnelle que la loi dont elle fait partie, est de prendre pour point de d\u00e9part ladite disposition plut\u00f4t que de commencer par d\u00e9montrer la validit\u00e9 de la loi dans son ensemble. Je ne crois pas toutefois que cela signifie qu\u2019il faille interpr\u00e9ter isol\u00e9ment la disposition en cause. Si l\u2019argument de validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle se fonde sur la pr\u00e9tention que la disposition contest\u00e9e fait partie d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9glementation, il semblerait alors n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter dans son contexte. Si, en fait, elle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme faisant partie d\u2019un tel syst\u00e8me, il faudra alors examiner la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de ce syst\u00e8me dans son ensemble. [Je souligne; p. 270-271.]\n[31] La Cour a maintes fois insist\u00e9 sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer les dispositions contest\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de leur interaction avec le r\u00e9gime dont elles font partie. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 14, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 693 (\u00ab Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) 2015 \u00bb), l\u2019une des questions consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la disposition exigeant la destruction des donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement des armes d\u2019\u00e9paule portait sur la m\u00eame mati\u00e8re \u2014 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique \u2014 que la loi abrogeant le r\u00e9gime d\u2019enregistrement. S\u2019exprimant au nom de la majorit\u00e9, les juges Cromwell et Karakatsanis ont dit ceci : \u00ab La \u201cmati\u00e8re\u201d de la disposition doit [. . .] \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, vu que son lien avec ce r\u00e9gime peut \u00eatre une consid\u00e9ration importante lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir son caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable . . . \u00bb (par. 30).\n[32] Le principe qu\u2019a formul\u00e9 la juge en chef McLachlin dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ward, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait question de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle d\u2019un article d\u2019un r\u00e8glement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur les p\u00eacheries qui interdisait la vente de jeunes phoques, est \u00e9galement pertinent : \u00ab La question n\u2019est pas tant de savoir si le R\u00e8glement interdit la vente que de savoir pourquoi celle\u2011ci est interdite \u00bb (par. 19 (soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)). Dans cette affaire, on ne pouvait donc pas simplement s\u2019arr\u00eater au fait que la disposition contest\u00e9e interdisait la vente, l\u2019\u00e9change ou le troc, ce qui aurait pu laisser croire qu\u2019elle relevait de la comp\u00e9tence des provinces sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou le commerce. En examinant le pourquoi de l\u2019interdiction et son interaction avec le reste du r\u00e9gime, il est devenu apparent que le Parlement visait par cette interdiction \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la chasse commerciale et qu\u2019il exer\u00e7ait validement sa comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de p\u00eacheries.\n[33] Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019une lecture des dispositions contest\u00e9es qui prend en compte le r\u00e9gime au sein duquel elles sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9es s\u2019av\u00e8re cruciale pour distinguer l\u2019objet de la loi des moyens retenus pour le r\u00e9aliser. Dans Ward, la juge en chef McLachlin mettait d\u2019ailleurs en garde contre le fait de \u00ab confondre l\u2019objet de la mesure l\u00e9gislative avec les moyens choisis pour r\u00e9aliser cet objet \u00bb (par. 25).\n[34] Gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les enseignements \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Transports Nationaux et la mise en garde formul\u00e9e dans Ward, je vais maintenant proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la qualification des art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale. Je m\u2019attacherai d\u2019abord \u00e0 l\u2019objet de ces dispositions, puis \u00e0 leurs effets.\na) L\u2019objet des dispositions contest\u00e9es\n(i) La preuve intrins\u00e8que\n[35] Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale \u00e9tablissent respectivement des interdictions absolues de possession et de culture de plantes de cannabis dans une maison d\u2019habitation, auxquelles sont assorties des amendes de 250 $ \u00e0 750 $. Si on s\u2019arr\u00eatait simplement au libell\u00e9 de ces dispositions, comme nous y invite l\u2019appelant, c\u2019est la notion d\u2019interdiction qui en ressortirait.\n[36] Or, il est indispensable d\u2019analyser les art. 5 et 10 au regard de leur contexte et non pas de leur simple libell\u00e9, puisque c\u2019est la pr\u00e9tention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec qu\u2019elles font partie int\u00e9grante du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation mis en place par la Loi provinciale. Pour reprendre la formule utilis\u00e9e par la juge en chef McLachlin dans Ward, il ne faut pas se limiter \u00e0 constater l\u2019existence des interdictions de possession et de culture, mais il importe d\u2019examiner le pourquoi de leur int\u00e9gration dans le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation bien pr\u00e9cis de la Loi provinciale.\n[37] J\u2019estime \u00e9galement qu\u2019il faut \u00e9viter de faire une lecture \u00ab ind\u00e9pendante \u00bb ou \u00ab individuelle \u00bb des dispositions contest\u00e9es sous pr\u00e9texte que celles-ci repr\u00e9senteraient potentiellement une mati\u00e8re fort \u00e9loign\u00e9e du reste des dispositions. Pour citer la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00ab [l]a constitutionnalit\u00e9 des articles 5 et 10 de la [Loi provinciale] ne se pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 une analyse en vase clos, ind\u00e9pendante de la [Loi] dans sa globalit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 41). Bien \u00e9videmment, il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que certaines dispositions d\u2019une loi puissent rev\u00eatir \u00ab un caract\u00e8re absolument diff\u00e9rent \u00bb des autres dispositions du m\u00eame texte l\u00e9gislatif (Westendorp c. La Reine, [1983] 1 R.C.S. 43, p. 51). Mais avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une telle conclusion, on ne peut faire l\u2019\u00e9conomie d\u2019une analyse contextuelle des dispositions contest\u00e9es. En toute logique, on ne saurait statuer sur l\u2019existence de la diff\u00e9rence marqu\u00e9e qu\u2019invoque M. Murray-Hall entre l\u2019objet des art. 5 et 10 et celui du reste des dispositions de la Loi provinciale sans avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la loi dans son ensemble.\n[38] Un survol de la Loi provinciale r\u00e9v\u00e8le l\u2019\u00e9tendue du syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9glementation implant\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, je con\u00e7ois cette entreprise comme \u00e9tant la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un monopole d\u2019\u00c9tat supervisant chacune des \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019achat par les citoyens de cannabis dans le but d\u2019assurer la protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population. Les interdictions pr\u00e9vues aux art. 5 et 10 constituent, avec les autres mesures d\u2019encadrement \u00e9tablies par la loi, les rouages de cette entreprise. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les interdictions de possession et de culture de plantes de cannabis participent de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique en dirigeant les consommateurs vers la seule source d\u2019approvisionnement l\u00e9galement autoris\u00e9e, soit celle de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat.\n[39] Il convient de rappeler que, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la Loi provinciale, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a modifi\u00e9 la Loi sur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec, RLRQ, c. S-13, afin de cr\u00e9er la SQDC, une filiale de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec, qui assurerait la vente \u00ab dans une perspective de protection de la sant\u00e9, afin d\u2019int\u00e9grer les consommateurs au march\u00e9 licite du cannabis et de les y maintenir, sans favoriser la consommation de cannabis \u00bb (art. 16.1 al. 1; voir aussi l\u2019art. 3 du projet de loi no 157).\n[40] La Loi provinciale pr\u00e9voit les diff\u00e9rents aspects encadrant l\u2019exercice du monopole de vente de la SQDC (art. 25), dont le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019emplacement des points de vente (art. 27 et 33), le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des produits offerts (art. 29, 44 et 45), l\u2019interdiction de vente aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es de moins de 21 ans (art. 34 \u00e0 39), la sensibilisation des consommateurs aux risques que pr\u00e9sente le cannabis pour la sant\u00e9 (art. 30, 31 al. 2, 41 et 57 al. 2), ainsi que le respect de normes d\u2019\u00e9talage, d\u2019affichage et d\u2019emballage (art. 40 \u00e0 42, 56 et 57). \u00c0 mon avis, il faut consid\u00e9rer les interdictions et modalit\u00e9s de contr\u00f4le pr\u00e9vues par la Loi provinciale comme des moyens choisis pour r\u00e9aliser les objets \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au premier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019art. 1, soit \u00ab pr\u00e9venir et [. . .] r\u00e9duire les m\u00e9faits du cannabis afin de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population, particuli\u00e8rement celles des jeunes \u00bb, et \u00ab assurer la pr\u00e9servation de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du march\u00e9 du cannabis \u00bb. Ces interdictions et modalit\u00e9s de contr\u00f4le sont la suite logique des fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es en ce qu\u2019elles permettent, pour reprendre les termes du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de ce m\u00eame article, d\u2019encadrer \u00ab la possession, la culture, l\u2019usage, la vente et la promotion du cannabis \u00bb.\n[41] Tout comme les dispositions tout juste \u00e9voqu\u00e9es, les art. 5 et 10 s\u2019inscrivent dans la logique monopolistique voulue par le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, et les interdictions que pr\u00e9voient ces articles constituent un moyen de r\u00e9aliser les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques.\n[42] En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver des plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile sous peine de sanctions p\u00e9nales a pour effet de diriger les consommateurs qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois vers la source d\u2019approvisionnement s\u00fbre que constitue la SQDC. Ces derniers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient ainsi de produits dont la qualit\u00e9 est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, ainsi que des conseils de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente form\u00e9s aux risques associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la consommation de cannabis (sur le premier point, voir les art. 29, 44 et 45 de la Loi provinciale et le R\u00e8glement d\u00e9terminant d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories de cannabis qui peuvent \u00eatre vendues par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis et certaines normes relatives \u00e0 la composition et aux caract\u00e9ristiques du cannabis, RLRQ, c. C-5.3, r. 0.1; sur le deuxi\u00e8me point, voir l\u2019art. 1 et l\u2019ann. I du R\u00e8glement sur la formation relative \u00e0 la vente au d\u00e9tail de cannabis et sur les renseignements \u00e0 communiquer \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur lors de toute vente de cannabis, RLRQ, c. C-5.3, r. 1). Le fait que les consommateurs s\u2019approvisionnent aupr\u00e8s de la SQDC fait \u00e9galement en sorte que ceux-ci sont assujettis \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019exigences, dont la plus importante m\u2019appara\u00eet \u00eatre celle fixant \u00e0 21 ans l\u2019\u00e2ge minimal requis pour y acheter du cannabis.\n[43] L\u2019essentiel de la th\u00e8se d\u00e9fendue par l\u2019appelant devant notre Cour est que l\u2019objet poursuivi par la Loi provinciale aurait pu \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en encadrant \u2014 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en prohibant compl\u00e8tement \u2014 la culture de cannabis \u00e0 domicile, par exemple en permettant la possession et la culture \u00e0 des fins personnelles d\u2019une, de deux ou de trois plantes de cannabis. En choisissant plut\u00f4t des interdictions de nature absolue, le l\u00e9gislateur provincial se serait ind\u00fbment ing\u00e9r\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel. Je note que le caract\u00e8re absolu des interdictions a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par la juge de premi\u00e8re instance, qui y voyait le signe que le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00ab cherchait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 pallier l\u2019abrogation des anciennes dispositions rendant la culture personnelle et la possession de plante de cannabis criminelles \u00bb (par. 45).\n[44] J\u2019estime cependant que cette distinction entre les interdictions absolues contest\u00e9es et les interdictions plus souples mentionn\u00e9es en ce qui concerne le nombre de plantes permis n\u2019est d\u2019aucun secours \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. M\u00eame en admettant que les objectifs de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public auraient pu \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par un encadrement moins strict de la culture de cannabis \u00e0 domicile et non pas seulement par sa prohibition totale, cet argument est loin d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019identification du caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable des dispositions contest\u00e9es. Devant deux approches jug\u00e9es potentiellement efficaces, il appartient aux organes l\u00e9gislatifs de choisir celle qui sera la plus susceptible de favoriser la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs poursuivis. Notre Cour a d\u2019ailleurs soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que les consid\u00e9rations li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la sagesse des moyens choisis ne sont pas utiles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification (Ward, par. 18 et 22; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, par. 18, citant Morgentaler, p. 487\u2011488; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les valeurs mobili\u00e8res, 2011 CSC 66, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 837, par. 90; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi anti\u2011inflation, [1976] 2 R.C.S. 373, p. 425).\n[45] Bref, envisag\u00e9s conjointement avec les autres dispositions de la Loi provinciale, les art. 5 et 10 ne poursuivent pas l\u2019objectif autonome et ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019interdire la possession et la culture de plantes de cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles. Les interdictions elles-m\u00eames doivent \u00eatre envisag\u00e9es comme un moyen, parmi un large \u00e9ventail de mesures, que le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9aliser les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques de la Loi provinciale. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les interdictions agissent comme de s\u00e9rieux incitatifs \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration des \u00ab consommateurs au march\u00e9 licite du cannabis \u00bb qui assure, entre autres, le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des produits offerts, la sensibilisation aux risques pos\u00e9s par la consommation de cannabis et le respect de normes relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge minimal d\u2019achat (voir l\u2019art. 16.1 al. 1 de la Loi sur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec; voir aussi m.i., par. 12).\n(ii) La preuve extrins\u00e8que\n[46] J\u2019estime que les d\u00e9bats parlementaires sont d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 relative dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Je fais miens les propos de la Cour d\u2019appel soulignant que \u00ab [l]eur lecture tend [. . .] \u00e0 mettre en \u00e9vidence la concordance des interventions portant sur les dispositions contest\u00e9es avec le but pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9gag\u00e9 lors de l\u2019analyse de la preuve intrins\u00e8que \u00bb (par. 72). Les interventions des parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois permettent donc de confirmer ce qui ressortait d\u00e9j\u00e0 de l\u2019interaction entre les dispositions contest\u00e9es et le reste des interdictions et modalit\u00e9s de contr\u00f4le pr\u00e9vues par la Loi provinciale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les interdictions relatives \u00e0 la possession et \u00e0 la culture \u00e0 domicile facilitent l\u2019approvisionnement des consommateurs aupr\u00e8s de la SQDC.\n[47] Il ressort des travaux de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux que deux approches concernant la culture \u00e0 domicile ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par les parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois : l\u2019une misant sur l\u2019interdiction absolue de la possession et de la culture de plantes de cannabis pour faire en sorte que les consommateurs s\u2019approvisionnent aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et l\u2019autre sur la tol\u00e9rance de ces pratiques comme levier dans la lutte contre le crime organis\u00e9 et dans l\u2019\u00ab autonomisation \u00bb des consommateurs \u00e0 faible revenu (voir Assembl\u00e9e nationale, Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, vol. 44, no 189, 1re sess., 41e l\u00e9g., 21 mars 2018, p. 22 (S. Jolin-Barrette), et 35 (M. Mass\u00e9); Assembl\u00e9e nationale, Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, vol. 44, no 191, 1re sess., 41e l\u00e9g., 27 mars 2018, p. 3 (S. Pag\u00e9)). Entre ces deux approches, le choix du l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois s\u2019est clairement arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur la premi\u00e8re.\n[48] Les propos d\u2019un d\u00e9put\u00e9 de l\u2019opposition, qui ont plus tard re\u00e7u l\u2019assentiment de la ministre responsable de la Sant\u00e9 publique, sont r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs : \u00ab Nous, dans un souci de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, dans un souci de sant\u00e9 publique, dans un souci d\u2019aller progressivement, nous faisons le choix, comme \u00c9tat, de ne pas permettre la culture \u00e0 domicile, et on veut, \u00e0 des fins de sant\u00e9 publique et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, orienter les consommateurs vers les magasins d\u2019une filiale de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat pour faire en sorte que la consommation se fasse d\u2019une fa\u00e7on responsable \u00bb (Journal des d\u00e9bats de la Commission permanente de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux, 21 mars 2018, p. 22 (S. Jolin-Barrette)). L\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de favoriser la consommation responsable de la substance par la mise en place d\u2019un syst\u00e8me o\u00f9 les particuliers, priv\u00e9s de l\u2019option de cultiver leur propre cannabis, seraient dirig\u00e9s vers les succursales de la SQDC.\n[49] Cela dit, je reconnais que le d\u00e9bat sur la preuve extrins\u00e8que en Cour sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour d\u2019appel a principalement port\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si les dispositions contest\u00e9es constituaient une forme de \u00ab l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e \u00bb. Pour cette raison, les remarques suivantes s\u2019imposent.\n[50] Aussi d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le terme de \u00ab d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir \u00bb, la notion de \u00ab l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019une loi portant en apparence sur un sujet relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019ordre de gouvernement qui l\u2019a \u00e9dict\u00e9e, mais qui dans les faits porte sur un sujet ne relevant pas de cette comp\u00e9tence (Morgentaler, p. 496). Le recours \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8que, pour autant que ceux-ci refl\u00e8tent l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, est depuis longtemps admis pour trancher le caract\u00e8re pr\u00e9tendument \u00ab d\u00e9guis\u00e9 \u00bb d\u2019un texte de loi (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 R.C.S. 297, p. 318\u2011319).\n[51] L\u2019appelant soutient que les parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ont, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, d\u00e9montr\u00e9 leur volont\u00e9 de contrecarrer l\u2019application de l\u2019approche retenue par le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral concernant la culture \u00e0 domicile et ainsi d\u2019adopter, sous une forme \u00ab d\u00e9guis\u00e9e \u00bb, les dispositions de la LRDS qui interdisaient autrefois la possession et la culture de cannabis. Cette pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre retenue.\n[52] Il est vrai qu\u2019un certain inconfort a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 dans l\u2019enceinte de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e nationale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du projet de d\u00e9criminalisation, lanc\u00e9 sur la seule initiative du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. De m\u00eame, les parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ont jug\u00e9 opportun de r\u00e9it\u00e9rer la dangerosit\u00e9 du cannabis en raison des risques de banalisation \u2014 per\u00e7us ou av\u00e9r\u00e9s \u2014 de cette substance qu\u2019entra\u00eenait l\u2019adoption de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019appelant nous renvoie au discours prononc\u00e9 par la ministre responsable de la Sant\u00e9 publique, au cours des derni\u00e8res \u00e9tapes ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la version finale du projet de loi no 157 :\nCe projet de loi positionne et pr\u00e9pare le Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur prochaine de la l\u00e9galisation du cannabis, impos\u00e9e, il faut se le dire, l\u00e0, Mme la Pr\u00e9sidente, unilat\u00e9ralement par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Je veux que les citoyens comprennent bien, l\u00e0, que ce n\u2019est pas le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec puis ce n\u2019est pas les d\u00e9put\u00e9s de l\u2019opposition puis ce n\u2019est pas personne ici, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, qui ont demand\u00e9 \u00e7a. \u00c7a s\u2019est ramass\u00e9 dans notre agenda suite \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Alors, on s\u2019est activ\u00e9s avec des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers extr\u00eamement courts et un degr\u00e9 d\u2019incertitude \u00e9lev\u00e9 quant aux intentions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Dire que c\u2019\u00e9tait un r\u00e9el d\u00e9fi, c\u2019est peu dire, Mme la Pr\u00e9sidente. Le but ultime, le m\u00eame pour nous depuis le d\u00e9part, \u00e9tait d\u2019offrir le meilleur encadrement possible \u00e0 cette substance sur notre territoire, compte tenu des enjeux qu\u2019elle comporte. Et, je tiens \u00e0 le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, Mme la Pr\u00e9sidente, le cannabis n\u2019est pas une substance banale et inoffensive. Je dis aux jeunes : Ce n\u2019est pas g\u00e9nial de fumer du cannabis. [Je souligne.]\n(Assembl\u00e9e nationale, Journal des d\u00e9bats, vol. 44, no 346, 1re sess., 41e l\u00e9g., 6 juin 2018, p. 21972-21973 (L. Charlebois))\n[53] De tels propos sont toutefois loin d\u2019\u00eatre suffisants pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e. Comme le soulignaient les juges Cromwell et Karakatsanis dans Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) 2015, \u00ab [l]es tribunaux sont, \u00e0 juste titre, r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019une loi est d\u00e9guis\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 31). Une application moins restrictive de la th\u00e9orie du d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir entra\u00eenerait un risque que les tribunaux outrepassent leur fonction judiciaire et statuent sur la base de consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre politique, manifestant ainsi \u00ab leur d\u00e9sapprobation soit du principe directeur du texte l\u00e9gislatif, soit du moyen par lequel la loi cherche \u00e0 l\u2019appliquer \u00bb (ibid.).\n[54] \u00c0 mon avis, les propos de la ministre ne d\u00e9montrent pas une volont\u00e9 de recriminaliser ce que le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait pour but de d\u00e9criminaliser. Ils refl\u00e8tent plut\u00f4t une inqui\u00e9tude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des risques que cr\u00e9e la consommation de cannabis, particuli\u00e8rement chez les plus jeunes. Comme le souligne la Cour d\u2019appel, cette inqui\u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 la Chambre des communes lors de l\u2019examen du projet de loi C-45 (par. 102). En effet, bon nombre de parlementaires ont mentionn\u00e9 que c\u2019est chez \u00ab [l]es Canadiens et les Canadiennes, y compris les enfants et les jeunes \u00bb qu\u2019on observe certains des plus hauts taux de consommation de cannabis dans le monde, et que ses effets pouvaient s\u2019av\u00e9rer particuli\u00e8rement dangereux pour les jeunes consommateurs (ibid., citant D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 148, no 183, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 30 mai 2017, p. 11706 (M. Mendicino)). Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans un tel contexte, les propos de la ministre montrent simplement que les pr\u00e9occupations relatives aux effets nocifs du cannabis pour la sant\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas disparu du seul fait de la d\u00e9criminalisation de cette substance. En d\u2019autres mots, les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par les parlementaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux lors des d\u00e9bats sur le projet de loi C-45 ont trouv\u00e9 \u00e9cho \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des murs de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e nationale du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[55] Un parall\u00e8le a \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9 par la juge de premi\u00e8re instance entre les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et celles de l\u2019affaire Morgentaler, o\u00f9 une loi de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse interdisant les avortements, sauf en milieu hospitalier, avait pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable non pas le contr\u00f4le des \u00e9tablissements de sant\u00e9 priv\u00e9s, mais bien la limitation de l\u2019avortement en tant qu\u2019acte socialement ind\u00e9sirable qu\u2019il convenait de supprimer ou de punir. L\u2019arr\u00eat Morgentaler rappelait notamment \u00ab [l]e principe directeur [voulant] que les provinces ne puissent s\u2019ing\u00e9rer dans les sph\u00e8res criminelles en essayant de renforcer, de compl\u00e9ter ou de remplacer le droit criminel [. . .] ou de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles consid\u00e8rent comme des d\u00e9fauts ou des failles \u00bb (p. 498). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelant plaide que ce m\u00eame principe est battu en br\u00e8che par les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale, lesquels viseraient \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019abrogation des dispositions qui criminalisaient autrefois la production personnelle de cannabis.\n[56] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, je suis d\u2019avis que les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce diff\u00e8rent de celles de l\u2019arr\u00eat Morgentaler. Les interventions des parlementaires provinciaux dans Morgentaler t\u00e9moignaient d\u2019une opposition frontale aux cliniques d\u2019avortement autonome comme \u00ab fl\u00e9au public \u00bb \u00e0 \u00e9liminer, et ne laissaient aucune ambig\u00fcit\u00e9 sur le dessein poursuivi par la mesure l\u00e9gislative contest\u00e9e (p. 503). En outre, bon nombre de pr\u00e9occupations importantes se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019objet d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de la loi \u2014 \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemples, les co\u00fbts des soins de sant\u00e9 ou l\u2019opposition \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 deux niveaux \u2014 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es sous silence lors des d\u00e9bats parlementaires. On ne peut en dire autant de la fa\u00e7on dont se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les d\u00e9bats ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la Loi provinciale et des dispositions contest\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Lorsque d\u00e9battues par les parlementaires qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, les interdictions de possession et de culture de plantes de cannabis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement envisag\u00e9es sous l\u2019angle des objets d\u00e9clar\u00e9s de la loi, soit la pr\u00e9servation de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du march\u00e9 du cannabis et la protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population.\n[57] Vu l\u2019absence totale de preuve d\u2019un dessein l\u00e9gislatif dit \u00ab inappropri\u00e9 \u00bb, et faisant montre de la prudence avec laquelle la Cour a toujours trait\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de l\u00e9gislation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e, je ne peux accepter l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant. Les dispositions contest\u00e9es ne repr\u00e9sentent pas une tentative d\u00e9guis\u00e9e de r\u00e9\u00e9dicter les interdictions de droit criminel abrog\u00e9es par le Parlement.\nb) Les effets des dispositions contest\u00e9es\n[58] Les effets des dispositions contest\u00e9es sont limpides, et je souscris au portrait qu\u2019en dresse la Cour sup\u00e9rieure dans ses motifs :\n. . . l\u2019application des articles 5 et 10 a pour cons\u00e9quence pratique d\u2019une part, d\u2019emp\u00eacher les citoyens de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver des plantes de cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles et d\u2019autre part, d\u2019obliger les consommateurs \u00e0 s\u2019approvisionner en cannabis aupr\u00e8s de la SQDC.\nQuant aux cons\u00e9quences juridiques, les dispositions provinciales ont pour effet, tout d\u2019abord, de prohiber la possession d\u2019une plante de cannabis et la culture personnelle de cannabis ainsi que d\u2019imposer des sanctions p\u00e9nales en cas de contravention. Elles entra\u00eenent aussi des cons\u00e9quences de nature p\u00e9nale \u00e0 des actes qui \u00e9taient autrefois criminalis\u00e9s par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, soit la LRDS . [par. 49\u201150]\n[59] Je me permets cependant d\u2019ajouter que, si les dispositions contest\u00e9es introduisent effectivement dans le champ du droit p\u00e9nal des comportements par ailleurs d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9s, les cons\u00e9quences en cas de contravention sont d\u2019un tout autre ordre que celles d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application des dispositions de la LRDS . Les personnes contrevenant aux art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre condamn\u00e9es \u00e0 des amendes qu\u2019on pourrait qualifier de relativement modestes, en ce qu\u2019elles vont de 250 $ \u00e0 750 $.\n[60] Ensemble, les effets juridiques et pratiques d\u00e9crits pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment confirment la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis parvenu plus t\u00f4t apr\u00e8s analyse de la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que. Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale n\u2019ont pas pour objet de r\u00e9primer la possession et la culture \u00e0 domicile en tant que telles, mais bien d\u2019assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique dans un but de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public contre les m\u00e9faits du cannabis.\n[61] Un dernier point sur les effets des dispositions contest\u00e9es m\u00e9rite qu\u2019on s\u2019y attarde. L\u2019intervenante Canadian Association for Progress in Justice soutient que le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9guis\u00e9 des dispositions contest\u00e9es pourrait ressortir, outre de l\u2019examen des d\u00e9bats parlementaires, de la prise en compte de leurs effets. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale et une s\u00e9rie d\u2019infractions criminelles pr\u00e9vues par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale auraient pour effet combin\u00e9 de recriminaliser des comportements qui avaient pourtant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9s. Les interdictions provinciales transformeraient les plantes de cannabis que poss\u00e8dent ou cultivent des particuliers qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois en une forme de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 2 de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, o\u00f9 ce terme est d\u00e9fini ainsi : \u00ab Cannabis qui est ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu, produit ou distribu\u00e9 par une personne vis\u00e9e par une interdiction pr\u00e9vue sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou d\u2019une loi provinciale . . . \u00bb La possession, la distribution, la culture et la production de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb sont l\u2019objet d\u2019infractions criminelles pr\u00e9vues respectivement aux art. 8(1)b), 9(1)a)(iv), 12(4)a) et 13(1) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Partant, les dispositions contest\u00e9es de la Loi provinciale cr\u00e9eraient, en raison du caract\u00e8re \u00ab illicite \u00bb des plantes cultiv\u00e9es dans les maisons d\u2019habitation qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises, non pas seulement des infractions r\u00e9glementaires, mais \u00e9galement des infractions criminelles.\n[62] J\u2019accepte la pr\u00e9misse selon laquelle l\u2019examen des d\u00e9bats parlementaires ainsi que l\u2019analyse des effets peuvent \u00eatre utiles aux fins de d\u00e9monstration du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9guis\u00e9 d\u2019une loi. Notre Cour l\u2019a elle-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, lorsqu\u2019elle a soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab les effets de la loi peuvent indiquer un objet autre que celui qu\u2019elle \u00e9nonce \u00bb et qu\u2019\u00ab on parle parfois de \u201cmotif d\u00e9guis\u00e9\u201d \u00bb en cas de diff\u00e9rence marqu\u00e9e entre les effets de la loi et son objet d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (par. 18). Cela dit, je ne peux toutefois retenir l\u2019argument selon lequel la recriminalisation de comportements ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce soit un effet des dispositions provinciales, lorsque l\u2019on consid\u00e8re leur interaction avec la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le Parlement a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb par r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale, et de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que des comportements sanctionn\u00e9s p\u00e9nalement par les provinces fassent l\u2019objet des interdictions criminelles pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8(1)b), 9(1)a)(iv), 12(4)a) et 13(1) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La possibilit\u00e9 que soient recriminalis\u00e9es la possession ou la culture d\u2019une \u00e0 quatre plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile r\u00e9sulte donc du seul fait de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise le Parlement d\u2019envisager, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 de sa loi, l\u2019intervention des provinces sur le plan de la r\u00e9glementation. Pour dire les choses simplement, toute possible recriminalisation ne d\u00e9coule pas des dispositions provinciales, mais bien uniquement des dispositions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\n[63] Faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intervenante signifierait que l\u2019adoption par une province de toute interdiction du cannabis \u00e0 des fins de r\u00e9glementation serait ultra vires parce que d\u00e9j\u00e0 vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb, et par la possible application des prohibitions criminelles pr\u00e9vues aux art. 8(1)b), 9(1)a)(iv), 12(4)a) et 13(1) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Concr\u00e8tement, cela aurait pour effet d\u2019annihiler le pouvoir des provinces d\u2019encadrer l\u2019usage de cette substance. Un tel r\u00e9sultat irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la vision du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par la Cour et de l\u2019intention manifeste du l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Sur ce dernier point, le Parlement a visiblement tenu pour acquis que les provinces seraient en mesure de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer relativement au cannabis \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de leurs champs de comp\u00e9tence, d\u2019o\u00f9 la mention des lois provinciales dans le texte de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb.\nc) Conclusion sur le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable\n[64] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que les art. 5 et 10 ont pour caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable d\u2019assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique de vente du cannabis afin de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public, particuli\u00e8rement celles des jeunes, contre les m\u00e9faits de cette substance. Les interdictions de possession et de culture de plantes de cannabis ne constituent pas en soi l\u2019objet des dispositions contest\u00e9es, mais bien un moyen permettant de diriger les consommateurs vers la seule source d\u2019approvisionnement jug\u00e9e fiable et s\u00e9curitaire.\n(3) La classification des dispositions contest\u00e9es\n[65] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question qui nous occupe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les dispositions contest\u00e9es rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le droit criminel pr\u00e9vue au par. 91(27) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , ou des comp\u00e9tences attribu\u00e9es aux provinces sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils ainsi que sur les mati\u00e8res de nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e par les par. 92(13) et (16) respectivement. Pour les raisons qui suivent, je conclus que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale se rattachent aux pouvoirs des provinces et qu\u2019ils sont en cons\u00e9quence intra vires de la l\u00e9gislature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\n[66] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, je ne peux accepter le raisonnement qu\u2019a suivi la juge de premi\u00e8re instance et que l\u2019appelant nous invite \u00e0 faire n\u00f4tre, \u00e0 savoir que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale r\u00e9unissent les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de droit criminel et, partant, que ces dispositions rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. En ce qui concerne les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments, il m\u2019appara\u00eet indubitable que les dispositions contest\u00e9es pr\u00e9voient des interdictions assorties de sanctions (Reference as to the Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] R.C.S. 1 (\u00ab Renvoi sur la margarine \u00bb), p. 49\u201150). Quant au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, la Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que la protection des groupes vuln\u00e9rables contre les risques pos\u00e9s par le cannabis pour leur sant\u00e9 constitue un objet valide de droit criminel (R. c. Malmo\u2011Levine, 2003 CSC 74, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 571, par. 76\u201178). Cela dit, il convient de noter que dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois visait \u00e0 assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique, dans une vis\u00e9e de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population.\n[67] Je suis d\u2019avis que m\u00eame si les art. 5 et 10 pr\u00e9sentent en apparence toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques des r\u00e8gles de droit criminel, ils ne doivent pas pour autant \u00eatre class\u00e9s sous le par. 91(27) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Pour les raisons qui suivent, j\u2019estime qu\u2019on ne peut se limiter \u00e0 la simple correspondance entre les trois exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le Renvoi sur la margarine, d\u2019une part, et les dispositions contest\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019autre part, pour d\u00e9cider de la classification de ces derni\u00e8res.\n[68] Premi\u00e8rement, la d\u00e9cision du Parlement de d\u00e9criminaliser une conduite donn\u00e9e laisse le champ libre aux provinces d\u2019adopter leurs propres interdictions assorties de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 cette m\u00eame conduite, pour autant que les interdictions servent \u00e0 faire appliquer des lois portant sur des mati\u00e8res de comp\u00e9tence provinciale (par. 92(15) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 ). En cons\u00e9quence, les mesures r\u00e9glementaires \u00e0 caract\u00e8re p\u00e9nal qu\u2019adoptent les provinces \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019activit\u00e9s d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9es ne constituent pas n\u00e9cessairement des tentatives de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re criminelle. C\u2019est en ce sens que le juge Major, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Siemens c. Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 CSC 3, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 6, \u00e9crivait que \u00ab [l]a seule existence d\u2019une interdiction et d\u2019une sanction n\u2019invalide pas l\u2019exercice par ailleurs acceptable d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative provinciale \u00bb (par. 25).\n[69] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il est reconnu que les provinces ont comp\u00e9tence pour l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de plusieurs mati\u00e8res touchant \u00e0 des objets qui constituent par ailleurs des objets valides de droit criminel. Dans le Renvoi sur la margarine, le juge Rand a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab [l]a paix, l\u2019ordre, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la sant\u00e9 et la moralit\u00e9 publics \u00bb comme les \u00ab fins \u00bb poursuivies ordinairement, mais non exclusivement par le droit criminel (p. 50). Si la paix, l\u2019ordre, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la sant\u00e9 et la moralit\u00e9 publics sont des objets classiques de droit criminel, les provinces peuvent prendre en compte de tels imp\u00e9ratifs dans la conception de leurs propres syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9glementation. Comme nous l\u2019enseigne l\u2019arr\u00eat Siemens, \u00ab [l]e fait que certaines [des] consid\u00e9rations [prises en compte par la l\u00e9gislature provinciale] aient un aspect moral n\u2019invalide pas pour autant une loi provinciale par ailleurs l\u00e9gitime \u00bb (par. 30). Ici, le seul fait que le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ait l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 en consid\u00e9rant le risque r\u00e9el que repr\u00e9sente la consommation de cannabis pour certaines populations vuln\u00e9rables n\u2019est pas en soi le signe d\u2019un empi\u00e8tement sur le domaine du droit criminel.\n[70] Plut\u00f4t que de prendre pour point de d\u00e9part le cadre analytique \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans le Renvoi sur la margarine, comme l\u2019a fait la juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je proc\u00e9derai \u00e0 la qualification des dispositions contest\u00e9es en consid\u00e9rant les fondements constitutionnels de l\u2019action l\u00e9gislative des provinces en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 publique.\n[71] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9criminalisation partielle par le Parlement de la possession, de la vente et de la distribution de cannabis, ainsi que de la possession et de la culture de plantes de cannabis, a ouvert la voie \u00e0 l\u2019intervention l\u00e9gislative des provinces. En interdisant la possession et la culture \u00e0 domicile de plantes de cannabis, le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le par. 92(15) d\u2019\u00e9dicter des mesures p\u00e9nales destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une loi par ailleurs valide. J\u2019ai conclu, plus t\u00f4t, que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale instaurent un r\u00e9gime assurant l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique et qu\u2019ils contribuent, de fait, \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques. Ainsi qualifi\u00e9es, les dispositions contest\u00e9es se rattachent clairement aux chefs de comp\u00e9tence provinciaux pr\u00e9vus aux par. 92(13) et (16). Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que les interventions l\u00e9gislatives des provinces en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 publique ont pour assises principales la comp\u00e9tence large et pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils (par. 92(13)), ainsi que la comp\u00e9tence r\u00e9siduelle sur les mati\u00e8res de nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province (par. 92(16)) (Chaoulli c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CSC 35, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 791, par. 18).\n[72] Un mot sur ces deux chefs de comp\u00e9tence comme fondements distincts de la validit\u00e9 des art. 5 et 10. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dupond c. Ville de Montr\u00e9al, [1978] 2 R.C.S. 770, le juge Beetz \u00e9crivait que la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 reconna\u00eet aux l\u00e9gislatures provinciales un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de \u00ab faire des lois relatives \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res de nature purement locale ou priv\u00e9e dans la province \u00bb, les diff\u00e9rents domaines de pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 92 n\u2019en \u00e9tant \u00ab que des exemples \u00bb et le par. 92(16) \u00e9tablissant un pouvoir r\u00e9siduel (p. 792). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et de fa\u00e7on similaire aux conclusions dans l\u2019affaire Dupond, les dispositions contest\u00e9es tirent leur validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle non seulement du par. 92(16), mais \u00e9galement du par. 92(13). La comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9vue au par. 92(13) vise le droit priv\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le droit relatif aux rapports interpersonnels (H. Brun, G. Tremblay et E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6e \u00e9d. 2014), p. 495, par. VI-2.109).\n[73] Cette pr\u00e9cision faite, il incombe maintenant d\u2019expliquer en quoi l\u2019intervention du l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 t\u00e9moigne ici d\u2019un esprit de r\u00e9glementation, et non pas de r\u00e9pression d\u2019une menace ou d\u2019un mal. Cela est d\u2019importance puisque la sant\u00e9, en tant que mati\u00e8re non attribu\u00e9e dans la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un chevauchement de comp\u00e9tences (RJR-MacDonald, par. 32; Schneider c. La Reine, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 112, p. 142; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 CSC 44, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 134, par. 68). Dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la non\u2011discrimination g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, la juge Karakatsanis a d\u00e9crit en ces termes l\u2019existence d\u2019un chevauchement de comp\u00e9tences dans ce m\u00eame domaine : \u00ab La sant\u00e9 constitue un champ de comp\u00e9tence qui pr\u00e9sente un caract\u00e8re \u201cinforme\u201d, et o\u00f9 il y a chevauchement entre des exercices valides de la comp\u00e9tence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des provinces pour r\u00e9glementer le domaine de la sant\u00e9 et la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel pour r\u00e9pondre aux menaces \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 . . . \u00bb (par. 93). Il est par ailleurs bien \u00e9tabli que les deux ordres de gouvernements sont habilit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer relativement \u00e0 la production, \u00e0 la distribution et \u00e0 la vente de produits pr\u00e9sentant un danger pour la sant\u00e9 publique, dont le tabac et l\u2019alcool (RJR-MacDonald, par. 36-38; R. c. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 213, par. 131; Rio Hotel Ltd. c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Commission des licences et permis d\u2019alcool), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 59, p. 63 et 67\u201168).\n[74] Ici, la possession et culture personnelle de cannabis n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois comme un fl\u00e9au social \u00e0 r\u00e9primer, mais plut\u00f4t comme une pratique qu\u2019il convient d\u2019interdire pour diriger les consommateurs vers une source d\u2019approvisionnement contr\u00f4l\u00e9e. Il est utile de faire une analogie avec les conclusions de notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schneider, o\u00f9 l\u2019Heroin Treatment Act, S.B.C. 1978, c. 24, de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e intra vires de la l\u00e9gislature provinciale en vertu du par. 92(16). De l\u2019avis de la Cour, la loi visait non pas \u00e0 punir les toxicomanes, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 encadrer leur traitement m\u00e9dical et \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (Schneider, p. 132\u2011133). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et de fa\u00e7on similaire \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi contest\u00e9e dans Schneider, les interdictions pr\u00e9vues aux art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale ne visent pas d\u2019objectifs punitifs en tant que tels, mais refl\u00e8tent plut\u00f4t une logique d\u2019encadrement et de supervision de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la substance.\n[75] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les art. 5 et 10 rel\u00e8vent donc non pas de la sph\u00e8re du droit criminel, mais bien de la comp\u00e9tence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des provinces en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9glementation de la sant\u00e9.\n[76] S\u2019il est vrai que des interdictions semblables \u00e0 celles pr\u00e9vues aux art. 5 et 10 ont autrefois \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par le Parlement en vertu du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en droit criminel, cela s\u2019explique par la doctrine du double aspect. Celle-ci participe du courant moderne en mati\u00e8re de f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme et d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constitutionnelle, lequel reconna\u00eet les in\u00e9vitables chevauchements de comp\u00e9tence (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 42). En vertu de la doctrine du double aspect, le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales peuvent adopter des lois sur des mati\u00e8res qui, par leur nature m\u00eame, comportent \u00e0 la fois une facette provinciale et une facette f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Transport Desgagn\u00e9s inc. c. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Canada Inc., 2019 CSC 58, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 228, par. 84). La doctrine du double aspect sera donc susceptible d\u2019application lorsque chaque ordre de gouvernement a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00ab imp\u00e9rieux \u00bb \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer relativement \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents aspects de la m\u00eame activit\u00e9 ou mati\u00e8re (par. 85). En pratique, sans pour autant cr\u00e9er une comp\u00e9tence concurrente sur une m\u00eame mati\u00e8re, la doctrine du double aspect \u00ab ouvre la voie \u00e0 l\u2019application concurrente de l\u00e9gislations f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et provinciales \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les valeurs mobili\u00e8res, par. 66 (italique omis)).\n[77] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est un cas classique d\u2019application de la doctrine du double aspect. L\u2019encadrement de l\u2019usage des drogues, notamment du cannabis, comporte des aspects \u00e0 la fois f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux, ce qui permet d\u2019envisager l\u2019application concurrente de lois des deux ordres de gouvernement. Cette mati\u00e8re pr\u00e9sente un double aspect en ce qu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre abord\u00e9e suivant deux perspectives diff\u00e9rentes : (1) celle du droit criminel (en vertu du par. 91(27)), en r\u00e9primant un \u00ab mal \u00bb ou un effet nuisible ou ind\u00e9sirable pour le public; et (2) celle de la sant\u00e9 ou du commerce (en vertu des par. 92(13) et (16)), en r\u00e9glementant notamment les conditions de production, de distribution et de vente de la substance. Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale encadrent l\u2019usage du cannabis suivant cette deuxi\u00e8me perspective normative, et ainsi rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence provinciale.\n[78] Je conclus cette portion de l\u2019analyse en insistant sur le fait que les dispositions contest\u00e9es n\u2019empi\u00e8tent pas sur la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel du seul fait qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9voient des interdictions de nature absolue. La juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion contraire, expliquant qu\u2019\u00ab en choisissant d\u2019interdire de fa\u00e7on absolue la possession de plantes de cannabis et sa culture \u00e0 des fins personnelles, la province a perdu sa comp\u00e9tence \u00bb (par. 86). Cette inf\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e en droit, et fait abstraction du fait que bon nombre d\u2019interdictions r\u00e9glementaires rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re absolu sans pour autant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des interdictions de droit criminel. Il suffit de citer \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple l\u2019interdiction de la vente de tabac aux mineurs consacr\u00e9e, en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, aux art. 13 et 14.4 de la Loi concernant la lutte contre le tabagisme, RLRQ, c. L-6.2.\n(4) Conclusion sur la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des dispositions contest\u00e9es\n[79] La pr\u00e9somption de constitutionnalit\u00e9 des lois demeure un principe cardinal de notre jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de partage des comp\u00e9tences (Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] R.C.S. 198, p. 255; Nova Scotia Board of Censors c. McNeil, [1978] 2 R.C.S. 662, p. 687-688; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. c. Ministre du Revenu national, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 453, par. 162; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu, par. 25). En vertu de cette pr\u00e9somption, toute disposition l\u00e9gislative est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e intra vires de l\u2019ordre de gouvernement qui l\u2019a adopt\u00e9e.\n[80] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9montrer que, de par leur caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable, les art. 5 et 10 ne se rattachent pas \u00e0 l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de sujets relevant de la comp\u00e9tence des provinces. Il n\u2019y est pas parvenu. Les dispositions contest\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas pour mati\u00e8re la r\u00e9pression morale de la production personnelle de cannabis. Leur caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable est plut\u00f4t d\u2019assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du monopole \u00e9tatique de vente du cannabis, dans un but de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population contre les m\u00e9faits de cette substance.\n[81] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale constituent un exercice valide par le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois des comp\u00e9tences que lui conf\u00e8rent les par. 92(13) et (16) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , et que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a donc pas commis d\u2019erreur dans son examen de la validit\u00e9 des dispositions contest\u00e9es.\n[82] M\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur d\u00e9terminant, je souligne que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada n\u2019est pas intervenu dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire pour contester la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale. Ma conclusion sur la validit\u00e9 de ces dispositions s\u2019inscrit bien dans l\u2019esprit de prudence qui guide les tribunaux lorsque le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral renonce \u00e0 toute participation au d\u00e9bat : \u00ab . . . la Cour devrait se montrer particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 invalider une loi provinciale lorsque le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n\u2019en conteste pas la validit\u00e9 . . . \u00bb (SEFPO c. Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 2, p. 19\u201120).\nB. La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle fait erreur en droit en concluant que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont constitutionnellement op\u00e9rants?\n[83] Dans cette deuxi\u00e8me partie, je vais traiter de la question de savoir si la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019applique dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de telle sorte que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale seraient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s inop\u00e9rants dans la seule mesure de leur incompatibilit\u00e9 avec la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, je suis d\u2019avis que les dispositions contest\u00e9es sont op\u00e9rantes. L\u2019application des interdictions absolues pr\u00e9vues par la Loi provinciale n\u2019entrave pas la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet f\u00e9d\u00e9ral identifi\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend ce dernier, la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas pour objet de cr\u00e9er, et ce, dans le but de limiter les activit\u00e9s illicites li\u00e9es au cannabis, des droits positifs permettant de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver \u00e0 des fins personnelles au plus quatre plantes de cannabis. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne correspond pas \u00e0 la nature essentiellement prohibitive du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel, et n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e par le texte de cette loi.\n[84] En guise d\u2019introduction, je rappelle les circonstances qui commandent l\u2019application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il y a incompatibilit\u00e9 justifiant de faire primer une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur une loi provinciale valide dans les cas o\u00f9 il existe un conflit d\u2019application ou une entrave \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans le premier cas, le conflit d\u2019application suppose une impossibilit\u00e9 de respecter les deux lois simultan\u00e9ment, notamment \u00ab lorsqu\u2019une loi dit \u201coui\u201d et que l\u2019autre dit \u201cnon\u201d \u00bb selon l\u2019expression consacr\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Multiple Access Ltd. c. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 161, p. 191. Dans le second cas, \u00ab l\u2019imposition de l\u2019obligation de se conformer \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation provinciale \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb (Banque canadienne de l\u2019Ouest, par. 73). Comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le juge Major dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. c. Saskatchewan, 2005 CSC 13, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 188, par. 14-15, l\u2019existence de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces situations suffit \u00e0 d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ce qui ne signifie pas pour autant qu\u2019il soit ais\u00e9 d\u2019en faire la d\u00e9monstration.\n[85] En effet, le fardeau de preuve qui incombe \u00e0 la partie all\u00e9guant l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit d\u2019application ou d\u2019un conflit d\u2019objets est \u00e9lev\u00e9 (Alberta (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Moloney, 2015 CSC 51, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 327, par. 27; Saskatchewan (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lemare Lake Logging Ltd., 2015 CSC 53, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 419, par. 21-23). Une telle exigence d\u00e9coule de la r\u00e8gle cardinale d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constitutionnelle portant que \u00ab [c]haque fois qu\u2019on peut l\u00e9gitimement interpr\u00e9ter une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de mani\u00e8re qu\u2019elle n\u2019entre pas en conflit avec une loi provinciale, il faut appliquer cette interpr\u00e9tation de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 toute autre qui entra\u00eenerait un conflit \u00bb (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 307, p. 356). En outre, j\u2019estime que l\u2019imp\u00e9ratif de mener le volet de l\u2019op\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 avec autant de pr\u00e9cision possible prend une importance toute particuli\u00e8re dans des circonstances comme celles en cause, o\u00f9 la mati\u00e8re l\u00e9gislative pr\u00e9sente un double aspect. Il s\u2019agit \u00ab de ne pas \u00e9roder l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie provinciale \u00bb, un souci que j\u2019exprimais notamment dans les Renvois relatifs \u00e0 la Loi sur la tarification de la pollution caus\u00e9e par les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, 2021 CSC 11, par. 128.\n[86] Pour les raisons qui suivent, et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019approche dite \u00ab restrictive \u00bb qui guide la Cour en la mati\u00e8re, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de preuve qui lui incombait.\n[87] Je tiens \u00e0 dissiper d\u2019embl\u00e9e toute id\u00e9e selon laquelle il existerait un conflit d\u2019application entre les dispositions contest\u00e9es et la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Lorsque questionn\u00e9 par la Cour \u00e0 ce sujet, l\u2019appelant a d\u2019ailleurs conc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019ob\u00e9ir aux deux lois, ce qui sugg\u00e8re une absence de conflit d\u2019application. En s\u2019abstenant de poss\u00e9der et de cultiver des plantes de cannabis \u00e0 son domicile, un particulier qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois peut ainsi se conformer ais\u00e9ment \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui soustrait au champ d\u2019application de son r\u00e9gime d\u2019infractions criminelles la possession et la culture d\u2019au plus quatre plantes de cannabis, et \u00e0 la Loi provinciale qui interdit la possession et la culture de toute plante de cannabis dans une maison d\u2019habitation.\n[88] La seule question qui se pose consiste donc plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe une entrave \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objet f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, ce qui suppose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019\u00e9tablir d\u2019abord quel est l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de d\u00e9terminer ensuite si les dispositions de la Loi provinciale sont incompatibles avec cet objet (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 CSC 39, [2010] 2 R.C.S. 536, par. 66).\n[89] La th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelant concernant l\u2019existence d\u2019une entrave \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut se r\u00e9sumer en quelques lignes. L\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulerait du fait que la Loi provinciale ne se contente pas de restreindre ce que permet la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, soit la culture et la possession d\u2019au plus quatre plantes de cannabis dans une maison d\u2019habitation, mais a plut\u00f4t pour effet de l\u2019interdire compl\u00e8tement. En avan\u00e7ant un tel argument, l\u2019appelant tient pour acquis que les al. 8(1)e) et 12(4)b) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont dans les faits cr\u00e9\u00e9 un droit positif d\u2019auto-culture de cannabis. Le fait de permettre positivement et express\u00e9ment de cultiver un nombre maximal de quatre plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile constitue, selon l\u2019appelant, l\u2019objet des dispositions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Dans sa forme plus raffin\u00e9e, l\u2019argument revient \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer que le fait de conf\u00e9rer aux Canadiens et aux Canadiennes un droit positif de poss\u00e9der ou de cultiver au plus quatre plantes de cannabis constitue l\u2019objet pr\u00e9cis des al. 8(1)e) et 12(4)b). Un tel objet serait poursuivi pour r\u00e9aliser d\u2019autres objets plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de cette loi, notamment le fait d\u2019\u00e9liminer ou de limiter le march\u00e9 illicite du cannabis (al. 7c)) (voir la distinction qui est faite entre un objet pr\u00e9cis et un objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans Rothmans, par. 25).\n[90] \u00c0 mon avis, la th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelant ne peut \u00eatre retenue. L\u2019objet des dispositions de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019est pas de cr\u00e9er un droit positif d\u2019auto-culture de cannabis, et ce, dans un objectif plus large consistant \u00e0 limiter l\u2019influence du crime organis\u00e9. Un tel objet n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 \u00ab la nature essentiellement prohibitive du pouvoir en droit criminel \u00bb (Rothmans, par. 19), dont la reconnaissance en droit canadien remonte \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat phare Proprietary Articles Trade Association c. Attorney General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310 (C.P.). Comme le rappelait la juge en chef McLachlin dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la LPA, \u00ab [l]e pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en droit criminel ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que pour interdire des actes \u00bb (par. 38). Ainsi, lorsque sont pr\u00e9vues des exceptions visant des pratiques que le Parlement n\u2019entend pas interdire, \u00ab [la loi] n\u2019autorise pas vraiment ces pratiques, elle s\u2019abstient seulement de les interdire \u00bb (ibid. (italique omis)).\n[91] Il est vrai que, dans le langage courant et m\u00eame dans le discours de certains parlementaires, le fait de pr\u00e9voir des exceptions ou des exemptions dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime d\u2019infractions criminelles est souvent pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un effort de \u00ab l\u00e9galisation \u00bb. Une telle fa\u00e7on de s\u2019exprimer est toutefois erron\u00e9e et laisse faussement entendre qu\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la population des droits positifs l\u2019autorisant \u00e0 se conduire de telle ou telle mani\u00e8re. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on ne saurait donc voir dans les propos de la ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9, qui parlait d\u2019une \u00ab autorisation de la culture limit\u00e9e \u00e0 domicile \u00bb, la manifestation claire de la volont\u00e9 du Parlement de conf\u00e9rer un droit positif d\u2019auto-culture (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 148, no 314, 1re sess., 42e l\u00e9g., 13 juin 2018, p. 20875). Je rappelle par ailleurs que les tribunaux doivent faire preuve de circonspection lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019appuient sur les d\u00e9bats parlementaires comme expression de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Le recours \u00e0 ce type de preuve extrins\u00e8que doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 \u00ab avec prudence \u00bb, compte tenu du fait que \u00ab les d\u00e9clarations faites par les d\u00e9put\u00e9s peuvent s\u2019av\u00e9rer de mauvais indicateurs de l\u2019intention du Parlement \u00bb (R. c. Sharma, 2022 CSC 39, par. 89).\n[92] En outre, je note que rien dans le libell\u00e9 des al. 8(1)e) et 12(4)b) n\u2019indique que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e9tait d\u2019autoriser l\u2019auto-culture de cannabis. Au contraire, ces dispositions se pr\u00e9sentent comme des r\u00e8gles classiques de droit criminel : elles renferment une interdiction, une sanction et elles s\u2019attaquent \u00e0 un mal en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques. Elles sont greff\u00e9es d\u2019exemptions visant la culture et la possession d\u2019une \u00e0 quatre plantes de cannabis. Leur texte ne laisse planer aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur le fait que la possession et la culture d\u2019une \u00e0 quatre plantes de cannabis ont simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 exclues du champ d\u2019application des infractions criminelles pr\u00e9vues par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Soulignant l\u2019absence de dispositions conf\u00e9rant un droit expr\u00e8s de cultiver du cannabis \u00e0 des fins personnelles, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu \u00e0 bon droit qu\u2019\u00ab il semble plus exact de dire non pas que la [Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale] a l\u00e9galis\u00e9 certains volets li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019usage de cette substance, mais, plut\u00f4t, qu\u2019elle les a d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 117).\n[93] L\u2019appelant fait grand cas du fait que l\u2019al. 7c) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est formul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on nettement plus positive ou permissive, \u00e9non\u00e7ant un des objets de la loi comme \u00e9tant le fait de \u00ab permettre la production licite de cannabis afin de limiter l\u2019exercice d\u2019activit\u00e9s illicites qui sont li\u00e9es au cannabis \u00bb. Il y voit le signe que le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait v\u00e9ritablement pour intention de conf\u00e9rer un droit positif d\u2019auto-culture. Encore une fois, je ne peux accepter les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelant.\n[94] Premi\u00e8rement, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident que par \u00ab production licite \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019al. 7c), le l\u00e9gislateur visait explicitement la production de cannabis \u00e0 domicile. Je consid\u00e8re plut\u00f4t que le terme \u00ab production licite \u00bb exprime une intention g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de permettre la production \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du cadre l\u00e9gal mis en place par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La notion de \u00ab production licite \u00bb pourrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, a contrario, comme l\u2019inverse de la notion de \u00ab cannabis illicite \u00bb qui, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, est d\u00e9finie comme tout \u00ab [c]annabis qui est ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu, produit ou distribu\u00e9 par une personne vis\u00e9e par une interdiction pr\u00e9vue sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou d\u2019une loi provinciale ou qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 import\u00e9 par une personne vis\u00e9e par une interdiction pr\u00e9vue sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi. \u00bb\n[95] Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame en admettant que la notion de \u00ab production licite \u00bb puisse s\u2019entendre de la production \u00e0 domicile, le mot \u00ab permettre \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019al. 7c) ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme le signe d\u2019une autorisation ou permission cr\u00e9atrice de droits positifs. Il ne peut l\u2019\u00eatre puisque, comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la cr\u00e9ation de droits positifs ne constitue pas un exercice valide de la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel et que la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans notre examen de l\u2019op\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des dispositions provinciales.\n[96] Les enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Rothmans sont pertinents pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. J\u2019estime que les principes qui s\u2019en d\u00e9gagent permettent de trancher la question de l\u2019op\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des dispositions contest\u00e9es. Dans cette affaire, il fallait d\u00e9cider si une loi provinciale interdisant la promotion des produits du tabac dans tout endroit accessible \u00e0 des jeunes entravait la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui interdisait la promotion des produits du tabac, sauf dans les commerces de d\u00e9tail. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan avait conclu que la loi provinciale interdisait ce qui \u00e9tait par ailleurs autoris\u00e9 par la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la promotion du tabac dans les commerces de d\u00e9tail. Notre Cour a conclu diff\u00e9remment, pr\u00e9cisant que \u00ab le Parlement n\u2019accordait pas et ne pouvait pas accorder aux d\u00e9taillants un droit positif d\u2019exposer des produits du tabac \u00bb (par. 18 (je souligne)). En outre, les lois adopt\u00e9es en vertu du pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en droit criminel \u00ab ne permettent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas de cr\u00e9er des droits autonomes qui limitent la capacit\u00e9 des provinces de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer plus rigoureusement dans le domaine que le Parlement \u00bb (par. 19 (je souligne)).\n[97] Le principe qu\u2019il faut retenir de ces passages est que l\u2019adoption d\u2019exceptions ou d\u2019exemptions dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de droit criminel ne peut servir \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer des droits positifs de pratiquer les activit\u00e9s faisant l\u2019objet de ces m\u00eames exceptions ou exemptions. Cette pr\u00e9cision est importante dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe. Les provinces peuvent l\u00e9gitimement prendre des initiatives r\u00e9glementaires pour encadrer des activit\u00e9s d\u00e9criminalis\u00e9es sans ce faisant entraver la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objet \u2014 la cr\u00e9ation de droits positifs \u2014 qui est par d\u00e9finition \u00e9tranger au pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en mati\u00e8re de droit criminel.\n[98] Je reconnais que les circonstances de l\u2019arr\u00eat Rothmans diff\u00e8rent de celles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sur un point important. Dans Rothmans, l\u2019exemption relative \u00e0 l\u2019exposition de produits du tabac dans les commerces de d\u00e9tail ne semblait pas intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de droit criminel vis\u00e9 par la loi dans son ensemble, soit le fait de s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 publique d\u2019envergure nationale. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour dans cette affaire, m\u00eame si on acceptait que la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale octroie aux d\u00e9taillants un droit positif d\u2019exposer des produits du tabac, il serait difficile d\u2019imaginer qu\u2019un tel droit puisse v\u00e9ritablement contribuer \u00e0 la lutte contre un mal dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 publique (par. 20). Dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe, il serait au contraire possible de soutenir que les exemptions visant la possession et la culture de plantes de cannabis \u00e0 domicile participent directement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objet de droit criminel, soit celui de d\u00e9courager le commerce illicite du cannabis. Suivant cette logique, la reconnaissance d\u2019un droit positif d\u2019auto-culture pourrait ainsi contribuer \u00e0 limiter la demande pour du cannabis provenant de sources illicites ou d\u2019organisations criminelles, un objet auquel nuirait l\u2019application des interdictions absolues adopt\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n[99] Je ne peux toutefois accepter que des exceptions ou des exemptions adopt\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9gime d\u2019infractions criminelles puissent g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des droits positifs, m\u00eame lorsque ces exceptions ou exemptions sont intimement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019objets de droit criminel. La Cour a circonscrit au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le droit criminel. Dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la LPA, la juge en chef McLachlin a notamment formul\u00e9 une mise en garde pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019\u00ab une d\u00e9finition sans balises [de ce que constitue un v\u00e9ritable objet de droit criminel], jumel\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance, est susceptible de rompre l\u2019\u00e9quilibre constitutionnel entre pouvoirs f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux \u00bb (par. 43). \u00c0 mon sens, la modification des principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Rothmans pr\u00e9senterait un risque similaire pour l\u2019\u00e9quilibre constitutionnel du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La reconnaissance de droits positifs cr\u00e9\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d\u2019exceptions ou d\u2019exemptions intimement li\u00e9es \u00e0 un objet valide de droit criminel \u00e9largirait ind\u00fbment l\u2019\u00e9tendue du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en droit criminel.\n[100] Les principes qui se d\u00e9gagent de l\u2019arr\u00eat Rothmans sont pertinents, sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019y apporter quelque modification, et ils s\u2019appliquent au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Cela signifie que les exemptions pr\u00e9vues aux al. 8(1)e) et 12(4)b) de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne sont pas des sources de droits positifs, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019apparence d\u2019un lien \u00e9troit entre celles-ci et l\u2019objet de droit criminel que constitue la lutte contre les activit\u00e9s illicites.\n[101] Bien que cela ne soit pas en soi d\u00e9terminant pour trancher la question de l\u2019op\u00e9rabilit\u00e9, je souligne que les objectifs poursuivis par le Parlement et la l\u00e9gislature provinciale sont concordants. En effet, la protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population \u2014 particuli\u00e8rement celles des jeunes \u2014, la lutte contre le crime organis\u00e9 et le fait de garantir l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des produits dont la qualit\u00e9 est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e sont autant de consid\u00e9rations ayant manifestement anim\u00e9 l\u2019adoption de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de la Loi provinciale.\n[102] Je note \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que les interdictions provinciales r\u00e9pondent directement \u00e0 plusieurs des objectifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En effet, les interdictions absolues de possession et de culture de la Loi provinciale permettent vraisemblablement de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 des jeunes en restreignant l\u2019acc\u00e8s au cannabis (al. 7a)), la culture \u00e0 domicile par des personnes majeures \u00e9tant susceptible d\u2019accro\u00eetre l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de cette substance par les mineurs r\u00e9sidant sous le m\u00eame toit. Elles pr\u00e9viennent \u00e9galement les incitations \u00e0 l\u2019usage du cannabis (al. 7b)), la pr\u00e9sence de plantes de cannabis au domicile pouvant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de facto comme une incitation. Elles contribuent au contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des produits offerts (al. 7f)), le cannabis cultiv\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison n\u2019\u00e9tant pas soumis \u00e0 des normes de qualit\u00e9 telle la concentration maximale du principal compos\u00e9 actif du cannabis, le t\u00e9trahydrocannabinol (\u00ab THC \u00bb). Elles contribuent clairement \u00e0 la sensibilisation du public aux risques que pose la consommation du cannabis pour la sant\u00e9 (al. 7g)), l\u2019offre d\u2019information aux consommateurs \u00e9tant facilit\u00e9e par leur int\u00e9gration \u00e0 un cadre de vente r\u00e9glement\u00e9.\n[103] Enfin, j\u2019ajouterais que m\u00eame si les approches retenues respectivement par le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le l\u00e9gislateur provincial \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019auto-culture sont diff\u00e9rentes, la Loi provinciale t\u00e9moigne au m\u00eame titre que la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019un souci de lutter contre le crime organis\u00e9 (al. 7c) et d)). Le l\u00e9gislateur provincial \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019en raison de leur contribution \u00e0 l\u2019instauration d\u2019un march\u00e9 unique, les interdictions absolues de possession et de culture \u00e0 domicile permettraient de limiter le trafic de cannabis provenant de sources non autoris\u00e9es. En outre, il n\u2019est pas du ressort de la Cour de trancher la question de savoir laquelle des deux approches \u2014 la prohibition de la production personnelle, ou la tol\u00e9rance d\u2019une telle pratique \u2014 est la plus susceptible de limiter l\u2019exercice d\u2019activit\u00e9s illicites li\u00e9es au cannabis. Il suffit de constater que c\u2019est ce m\u00eame objectif qui a guid\u00e9 l\u2019intervention l\u00e9gislative des deux ordres de gouvernement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[104] En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que les art. 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale n\u2019entravent pas la r\u00e9alisation des objets \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, notamment celui de limiter la pr\u00e9sence des organisations criminelles dans le march\u00e9 du cannabis, et qu\u2019elles sont op\u00e9rantes au regard de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Les objectifs de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques poursuivis par la Loi provinciale et ses interdictions sont, dans une large mesure, en harmonie avec les objectifs vis\u00e9s par la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit d\u2019objets.\nV. Conclusion\n[105] Les articles 5 et 10 de la Loi provinciale sont valides et op\u00e9rants. Je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\n[106] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec a demand\u00e9 que lui soient accord\u00e9s les d\u00e9pens. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il ne serait pas justifi\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 cette demande. La Cour poss\u00e8de le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle usuelle selon laquelle la partie ayant obtenu gain de cause a droit aux d\u00e9pens. La pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un enjeu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public constitue un facteur dans l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir, si bien que \u00ab la partie d\u00e9bout\u00e9e qui soul\u00e8ve une question de droit s\u00e9rieuse et importante pour le public ne doit pas toujours supporter les d\u00e9pens de l\u2019autre partie \u00bb (Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium c. Canada (Commissaire des Douanes et du Revenu), 2007 CSC 2, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 38, par. 35, citant \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CSC 4, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 76, par. 69). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelant est un citoyen qui a soulev\u00e9 d\u2019importantes questions de droit constitutionnel relativement \u00e0 un enjeu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, soit la d\u00e9criminalisation de l\u2019usage r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif du cannabis et ses cons\u00e9quences. Je suis d\u2019avis que de telles circonstances militent en faveur de l\u2019exercice de notre pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et, en cons\u00e9quence, chaque partie assumera ses propres d\u00e9pens devant la Cour et devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures.\nPourvoi rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant : Sara\u00eflis Avocats, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 : Lavoie, Rousseau (Justice\u2011Qu\u00e9bec), Qu\u00e9bec; Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario : Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario \u2014 Direction du droit constitutionnel, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Manitoba : Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Manitoba, Winnipeg.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Colombie\u2011Britannique : Legal Services Branch \u2014 Ministry of Attorney General, Victoria.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Saskatchewan : Constitutional Law Branch \u2014 Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Regina.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta : Attorney General of Alberta \u2014 Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Canadian Association for Progress in Justice : IMK, Montr\u00e9al; Dalziel Law Corporation, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne du cancer : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne du cancer, Ottawa; Langlois Lawyers, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Cannabis Amnesty : Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto; Ruby Shiller Enenajor DiGiuseppe, Toronto.\nProcureurs des intervenants Cannabis Council of Canada et l\u2019Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de l\u2019industrie du cannabis : McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\n* Le juge Brown n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au dispositif final du jugement."

Bien que le dossier \u00e9crit relatif \u00e0 la motion en rejet sommaire f\u00fbt volumineux, il n\u2019y avait aucune possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix ou de contre\u2011interroger des t\u00e9moins\u2011cl\u00e9s ni au cours de la portion publique ni au cours de la portion \u00e0 huis clos.\nLa juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que m\u00eame si les requ\u00eates \u00e9taient envisag\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable, les motifs expos\u00e9s ne pourraient pas justifier un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et, par cons\u00e9quent, une audition de la preuve (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., un voir\u2011dire) sur le fond ne serait d\u2019aucune aide pour le tribunal. Elle a rejet\u00e9 sommairement les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et inscrit les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9. Lors de l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par H et J, la Cour d\u2019appel a annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et renvoy\u00e9 les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures au tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance en vue de la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire. Elle a conclu que la juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait impos\u00e9 une norme trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour permettre que les requ\u00eates fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019une audition de la preuve, et que les requ\u00eates auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail et tranch\u00e9es lors d\u2019un voir\u2011dire sur le fond.\nArr\u00eat : L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nUne requ\u00eate lors d\u2019une instance criminelle, notamment pour un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure, ne devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement que si elle est manifestement frivole. Ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire est celui qui r\u00e9ussit le mieux \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re et \u00e0 assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des instances judiciaires. C\u2019est une norme rigoureuse qui permet aux juges du proc\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9carter le genre de requ\u00eates que vise \u00e0 exclure le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner le rejet sommaire, mais qui permet l\u2019instruction au fond de la plupart des requ\u00eates lors de proc\u00e9dures proportionn\u00e9es. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles et n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es sommairement.\nLes juges du proc\u00e8s ont le pouvoir de rejeter sommairement des requ\u00eates faites dans le contexte du droit criminel dans certaines circonstances. La norme s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e concernant le rejet sommaire doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur les deux ensembles de valeurs sous\u2011jacentes en jeu dans de telles proc\u00e9dures : l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci. Ces valeurs coexistent et il faut tendre vers les deux pour que l\u2019une et l\u2019autre se r\u00e9alisent. Dans le contexte criminel, il est \u00e9vident que les d\u00e9lais excessifs doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9duits pour que les proc\u00e8s soient efficaces. Le rejet des requ\u00eates non fond\u00e9es contribue \u00e0 faire en sorte que les proc\u00e8s aient lieu dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, ce qui repr\u00e9sente une part essentielle de l\u2019engagement du syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle de traiter les inculp\u00e9s pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s innocents de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger leurs droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de leur personne et \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s, c\u2019est plus qu\u2019un objectif de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale : c\u2019est un imp\u00e9ratif constitutionnel. Un proc\u00e8s criminel porte sur des all\u00e9gations faites par l\u2019\u00c9tat contre un accus\u00e9 dont la libert\u00e9 est souvent en jeu. Le rejet sommaire de requ\u00eates en droit criminel peut restreindre le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re et son droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, garantis par l\u2019art. 7 et l\u2019al. 11d) de la Charte, en emp\u00eachant celui\u2011ci de pr\u00e9senter en d\u00e9tail ses arguments et d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate.\nLes valeurs sous\u2011jacentes de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci commandent la conclusion qu\u2019un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire rigoureux devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 aux motions en rejet sommaire lors de proc\u00e8s criminels. Comme son nom l\u2019indique, une proc\u00e9dure sommaire est cens\u00e9e \u00eatre sommaire : pr\u00e9liminaire, br\u00e8ve et s\u2019apparentant plus \u00e0 un survol qu\u2019\u00e0 un examen en profondeur. Le rejet sommaire repose sur des all\u00e9gations et est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par l\u2019artifice consistant \u00e0 tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. En revanche, une instruction sur le fond suppose une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur les faits et sur la question de savoir si, apr\u00e8s un examen complet, les faits \u00e9tablis \u00e9tayent les all\u00e9gations et justifient la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e. Une norme rigoureuse est aussi \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res des proc\u00e8s criminels, notamment la fa\u00e7on dont les vastes pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance du juge du proc\u00e8s peuvent contribuer \u00e0 assurer l\u2019utilisation efficace, efficiente et proportionn\u00e9e des ressources judiciaires, ainsi que le respect des droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Les juges ont une fonction de gardien, et l\u2019objectif est que seules les requ\u00eates qui devraient \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par le pouvoir de rejet sommaire soient dans les faits rejet\u00e9es sommairement. Les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient p\u00e9cher par exc\u00e8s de prudence lorsqu\u2019ils se voient demander de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate.\nLe crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer relativement au rejet sommaire des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel est celui qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole. Ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire favorise \u00e0 la fois l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci. La partie \u00ab frivole \u00bb de la norme permet d\u2019\u00e9carter les requ\u00eates qui seront forc\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9es, et le mot \u00ab manifestement \u00bb exprime l\u2019id\u00e9e que le caract\u00e8re frivole de la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre \u00e9vident. Si le caract\u00e8re frivole de la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas manifeste ou \u00e9vident au vu du dossier, la requ\u00eate ne devrait pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement et devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre jug\u00e9e au fond. Cette norme rigoureuse permettra aux juges d\u2019\u00e9carter les requ\u00eates qui ne seraient jamais accueillies et qui, par d\u00e9finition, feraient perdre du temps \u00e0 la cour. Elle prot\u00e8ge aussi les droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable en veillant \u00e0 ce que les requ\u00eates qui pourraient \u00eatre accueillies, notamment les demandes in\u00e9dites, soient jug\u00e9es au fond. Cette norme ne s\u2019applique pas aux motions en rejet sommaire qui sont autrement assujetties \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9vu par voie l\u00e9gislative ou judiciaire.\nLa partie qui demande le rejet sommaire a le fardeau de convaincre le juge que la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole. Lorsqu\u2019il applique la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb, le juge ne devrait m\u00eame pas se livrer \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation limit\u00e9e de la preuve pour v\u00e9rifier si celle\u2011ci est raisonnablement susceptible d\u2019\u00e9tayer une inf\u00e9rence, et il ne devrait pas non plus d\u00e9cider quelle inf\u00e9rence il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re parmi des inf\u00e9rences oppos\u00e9es. Une telle \u00e9valuation devrait avoir lieu lors du voir\u2011dire. Le juge doit tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le requ\u00e9rant et doit prendre les arguments de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 leur sens le plus fort. La requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente du requ\u00e9rant devrait expliquer son fondement factuel et indiquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve anticip\u00e9s qui pourraient \u00e9tablir les faits qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue. Lorsque le requ\u00e9rant ne peut pas indiquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve anticip\u00e9s qui pourraient \u00e9tablir un fait n\u00e9cessaire, le juge peut rejeter l\u2019all\u00e9gation factuelle pour le motif qu\u2019elle est manifestement frivole. Le juge devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenir pour acquis que les inf\u00e9rences formul\u00e9es par le requ\u00e9rant sont vraies, m\u00eame si des inf\u00e9rences contradictoires sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Le juge ne devrait rejeter une inf\u00e9rence que si elle est manifestement frivole, ce qui veut dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de raisonnement menant \u00e0 l\u2019inf\u00e9rence propos\u00e9e. Une approche semblable est adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate dans son ensemble. Puisque les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s sont tenus pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s, une requ\u00eate ne sera manifestement frivole que lorsque les vices fondamentaux sont apparents au vu du dossier. Enfin, le pouvoir du juge du proc\u00e8s de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 tout au long de l\u2019instance. M\u00eame si le juge permet que la requ\u00eate fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire, il conserve le pouvoir de la rejeter sommairement pendant celui-ci s\u2019il appara\u00eet \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle est manifestement frivole.\nLe dossier relatif \u00e0 une motion en rejet sommaire devrait normalement \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel et \u00eatre de nature sommaire car la production d\u2019une preuve tr\u00e8s \u00e9toff\u00e9e exige souvent du temps, des efforts et des d\u00e9lais d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objectif m\u00eame de la motion. Bien que l\u2019on s\u2019attende \u00e0 ce que les deux parties pr\u00e9sentent leurs meilleurs arguments, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de fixer des r\u00e8gles fermes concernant le type de dossier qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9. La partie qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente a le fardeau minimal de fournir au juge les pr\u00e9cisions suivantes, au moyen de plaidoiries ou d\u2019observations \u00e9crites : (1) les principes juridiques, les dispositions de la Charte ou de lois qui sont invoqu\u00e9s, et la fa\u00e7on dont ces principes ou dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s; (2) les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve anticip\u00e9s qui seront invoqu\u00e9s et la fa\u00e7on dont ils peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s; (3) les arguments propos\u00e9s; et (4) la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e. D\u00e9terminer s\u2019il faut quelque chose de plus et de quelle fa\u00e7on la motion en rejet sommaire doit proc\u00e9der rel\u00e8ve donc des pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance du juge.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la juge a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les inf\u00e9rences et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, en appliquant un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire plus ax\u00e9 sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 relativement au rejet sommaire qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment rigoureux et en mettant l\u2019accent sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 et sur l\u2019issue finale plut\u00f4t que sur la question de savoir si les requ\u00eates \u00e9taient manifestement frivoles.\nJurisprudence\nDistinction d\u2019avec les arr\u00eats : R. c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, la Cour se penche sur la norme qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer dans les affaires criminelles lorsque les juges sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate sans l\u2019instruire sur le fond. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, dans quelles circonstances est\u2011il opportun de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure?\n[2] Un consensus clair pr\u00e9vaut au sein des tribunaux canadiens sur le fait que les juges du proc\u00e8s ont le pouvoir de rejeter sommairement des requ\u00eates faites dans le contexte du droit criminel dans certaines circonstances. Toutefois, la jurisprudence canadienne est divis\u00e9e au sujet du crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019appliquer. Il est temps pour notre Cour de fournir des indications quant \u00e0 cet enjeu important, qui se rapporte \u00e0 des concepts aussi fondamentaux dans notre syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s. La norme choisie doit prot\u00e9ger les droits constitutionnels de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable et \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re tout en \u00e9vitant les d\u00e9lais indus et l\u2019utilisation disproportionn\u00e9e des ressources judiciaires ou leur gaspillage. Elle devrait aussi dissuader les d\u00e9cideurs de trancher la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente sur le fond sans disposer de toute la preuve, car cela risque de causer une iniquit\u00e9 pour une efficacit\u00e9 qui pourrait \u00eatre plus apparente que r\u00e9elle.\n[3] Par cons\u00e9quent, une requ\u00eate lors d\u2019une instance criminelle, notamment pour un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures en raison d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure, ne devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement que si elle est \u00ab manifestement frivole \u00bb. Ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire est celui qui r\u00e9ussit le mieux \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re et \u00e0 assurer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des instances judiciaires. C\u2019est une norme rigoureuse qui permet aux juges du proc\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9carter le genre de requ\u00eates que vise \u00e0 exclure le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner le rejet sommaire, mais qui permet l\u2019instruction au fond de la plupart des requ\u00eates lors de proc\u00e9dures proportionn\u00e9es.\n[4] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, MM. Johnston et Haevischer ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure; la Couronne, quant \u00e0 elle, a demand\u00e9 et obtenu le rejet sommaire des requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des conclusions de la juge du proc\u00e8s, les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures de MM. Johnston et Haevischer n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, je suis d\u2019avis que c\u2019est \u00e0 tort qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es sommairement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette le pourvoi. La requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures de M. Haevischer sera renvoy\u00e9e au tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance en vue de la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire. Comme l\u2019ont demand\u00e9 les avocats de M. Johnston, je ne rendrai aucune ordonnance concernant ce dernier, qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en prison apr\u00e8s l\u2019instruction du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi devant notre Cour.\nII. Contexte\nA. Les six meurtres de Surrey\n[5] Messieurs Johnston et Haevischer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables de six chefs de meurtre au premier degr\u00e9 et d\u2019un chef de complot en vue de commettre un meurtre. Commis le 19 octobre 2007, les meurtres, qui ont plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s les \u00ab six meurtres de Surrey \u00bb, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9s par un diff\u00e9rend portant sur le trafic de drogue \u00e0 Surrey, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, entre Corey Lal, la personne vis\u00e9e, et James (Jamie) Bacon, un des chefs d\u2019une organisation criminelle appel\u00e9e les \u00ab Red Scorpions \u00bb. Dans le cadre d\u2019un complot en vue d\u2019assassiner M. Lal, trois membres des Red Scorpions \u2014 M. Johnston, M. Haevischer et \u00ab Personne X \u00bb \u2014 se sont rendus \u00e0 la \u00ab planque \u00bb de drogue de M. Lal, une suite dans un immeuble d\u2019habitation situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Surrey, afin de l\u2019assassiner.\n[6] Lorsque M. Johnston, M. Haevischer et Personne X sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appartement, ils sont entr\u00e9s en contact avec M. Lal, trois de ses associ\u00e9s, un monteur d\u2019installations au gaz qui faisait l\u2019entretien des foyers dans l\u2019immeuble et un jeune homme qui habitait en face. Les deux derni\u00e8res victimes n\u2019avaient aucun lien avec M. Lal. Bien que ce dernier fut la cible, les meurtriers ont aussi assassin\u00e9 les cinq autres victimes afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019\u00eatre rep\u00e9r\u00e9s. Les meurtres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019une ex\u00e9cution. La preuve m\u00e9dico\u2011l\u00e9gale r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les six hommes ont tous re\u00e7u de multiples coups de feu \u00e0 bout portant alors qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient \u00e9tendus sur le plancher de l\u2019appartement et que deux armes \u00e0 feu ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es pour les assassiner.\nB. L\u2019enqu\u00eate E\u2011Peseta et les accusations\n[7] Ces horribles meurtres tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9s ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pluriannuelle de grande envergure de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (\u00ab GRC \u00bb), appel\u00e9e \u00ab Projet E\u2011Peseta \u00bb, laquelle a abouti au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de multiples accusations contre de nombreux individus.\n[8] Environ cinq ans plus tard, MM. Johnston et Haevischer ont tous deux \u00e9t\u00e9 inculp\u00e9s de six chefs de meurtre au premier degr\u00e9 et d\u2019un chef de complot en vue d\u2019assassiner M. Lal. Ils ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s ensemble.\n[9] Personne X, le troisi\u00e8me participant aux meurtres, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9, mais a plaid\u00e9 coupable au meurtre au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 de trois des victimes et au complot en vue d\u2019assassiner M. Lal. La Couronne voulait convoquer Personne X comme t\u00e9moin au proc\u00e8s de MM. Johnston et Haevischer, mais cette personne a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9e de t\u00e9moigner au terme d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 huis clos tenue en l\u2019absence de MM. Johnston et Haevischer.\n[10] Quang Vinh Thang (Michael) Le et M. Bacon, chefs des Red Scorpions, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9s du meurtre de M. Lal et de complot en vue de l\u2019assassiner. Monsieur Le a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l\u2019accusation de complot en d\u00e9cembre 2013 et a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s contre MM. Johnston et Haevischer. Monsieur Bacon a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l\u2019accusation de complot apr\u00e8s l\u2019annulation par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 dans son cas (R. c. Bacon, 2020 BCCA 140, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 256).\n[11] Personne Y, membre des Red Scorpions, \u00e9tait un autre coconspirateur. Il agissait \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de la police pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate en \u00e9change de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 contre des poursuites pour les six meurtres de Surrey. Toutefois, il a par la suite plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 deux meurtres au premier degr\u00e9 non li\u00e9s.\n[12] L\u2019enqu\u00eate E\u2011Peseta fut complexe et sem\u00e9e d\u2019emb\u00fbches. M\u00eame si la GRC croyait que les Red Scorpions \u00e9taient responsables des six meurtres de Surrey, elle estimait que les seules personnes pouvant fournir une preuve fiable au sujet de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e9taient les auteurs de l\u2019infraction eux\u2011m\u00eames ou leurs proches associ\u00e9s, qui \u00e9taient tous [traduction] \u00ab hostiles \u00bb \u00e0 la police. Les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019ils devaient entretenir des rapports avec les indicateurs qui seraient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner contre ceux qui ont commis ce meurtre.\n[13] Selon les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au dossier, les enqu\u00eateurs ont mis au point la strat\u00e9gie de [traduction] \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb afin de faire en sorte que \u00ab les criminels et leurs associ\u00e9s deviennent loyaux envers la GRC plut\u00f4t qu\u2019envers leur groupe \u00bb (d.a., vol. XIV, p. 36). Se concentrant sur les membres vuln\u00e9rables des Red Scorpions et sur les petites amies des membres, les agents de la GRC ont tent\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9manteler les relations internes au sein des Red Scorpions \u00bb et de \u00ab remplacer ces relations en tissant des liens entre les t\u00e9moins potentiels et eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (p. 37). La strat\u00e9gie pr\u00e9conisait la [traduction] \u00ab maximisation \u00bb ou la \u00ab cr\u00e9ation \u00bb d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements dans l\u2019entourage des personnes vis\u00e9es \u00ab [a]fin de les placer dans une situation o\u00f9 ils doivent ou veulent demander l\u2019aide du \u201cbon policier\u201d \u00bb (p. 32). En obtenant la loyaut\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, la GRC esp\u00e9rait obtenir leur collaboration en vue de r\u00e9soudre les meurtres.\nC. Le proc\u00e8s\n[14] Le proc\u00e8s de MM. Johnston et Haevischer, tenu devant la juge Wedge, fut complexe et long, notamment \u00e0 cause des dizaines de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es avant et pendant le proc\u00e8s et du grand nombre de t\u00e9moins. Ils ont tous les deux \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables de tous les chefs d\u2019accusation.\n[15] Une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant le proc\u00e8s \u2014 la requ\u00eate no 65 (2013 BCSC 1526) \u2014 m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e express\u00e9ment. La requ\u00eate no 65 contestait le privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019indicateur revendiqu\u00e9 par la Couronne sur certains renseignements. Pour respecter le caract\u00e8re sensible des questions li\u00e9es au privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019indicateur, l\u2019audience portant sur la requ\u00eate no 65 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue en l\u2019absence des accus\u00e9s et du public, et des amici curiae ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats des accus\u00e9s et pour situer le tribunal dans un contexte contradictoire. Les m\u00eames amici ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Les renseignements qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s sur la requ\u00eate no 65 constituaient le fondement des arguments sous scell\u00e9s des amici concernant les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\nD. Requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[16] Avant l\u2019inscription des d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9, les deux avocats de la d\u00e9fense ont demand\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure sur la base du test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Babos, 2014 CSC 16, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 309, par. 32.\n[17] L\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures est une r\u00e9paration extraordinaire r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux \u00ab cas les plus manifestes \u00bb (Babos, par. 31). La d\u00e9fense a plaid\u00e9 que le comportement inacceptable des policiers avait port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable de MM. Johnston et Haevischer et min\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice. Les all\u00e9gations entrent dans trois cat\u00e9gories fondamentales. Les deux premi\u00e8res, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es par les avocats de la d\u00e9fense, sont (1) l\u2019inconduite polici\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e; et (2) les conditions inhumaines de d\u00e9tention provisoire de MM. Johnston et Haevischer. La troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie comprend les arguments sous scell\u00e9s des amici.\n[18] La premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie contenait des all\u00e9gations multidimensionnelles d\u2019inconduite polici\u00e8re. Messieurs Johnston et Haevischer ont contest\u00e9 le recours, dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate, \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de [traduction] \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb, qu\u2019ils ont qualifi\u00e9 \u00ab [d\u2019]extr\u00eamement muscl\u00e9e \u00bb (2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192, par. 29). De plus, ils ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu inconduite criminelle et inconduite d\u2019une autre nature de la part des agents qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate E\u2011Peseta. En particulier, le serg. Brassington, le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Attew et deux autres agents ont entretenu des relations d\u2019exploitation sexuelle avec deux t\u00e9moins f\u00e9minins prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Il convient de souligner que le serg. Brassington et le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Attew \u00e9taient des enqu\u00eateurs principaux dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate E\u2011Peseta, et constituaient des [traduction] \u00ab piliers \u00bb dans les efforts visant \u00e0 nouer des liens et \u00e0 traiter avec les t\u00e9moins dans le cadre de la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb. Enfin, ils ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les policiers avaient mal g\u00e9r\u00e9 les fonds, la preuve, les t\u00e9moins, les agents et les indicateurs. Parmi les all\u00e9gations les plus graves, on reprochait aux quatre agents ayant commis une inconduite d\u2019avoir perdu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et au s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Attew et au serg. Brassington d\u2019avoir compromis la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de deux t\u00e9moins f\u00e9minins en r\u00e9v\u00e9lant \u00e0 tort o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient.\n[19] La seconde cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019all\u00e9gations concernait les conditions dans lesquelles MM. Johnston et Haevischer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus apr\u00e8s leur arrestation. Les avocats de la d\u00e9fense ont affirm\u00e9 que MM. Johnston et Haevischer avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment d\u00e9tenus de fa\u00e7on punitive en isolement cellulaire pendant 14 mois, dans des conditions dures et inhumaines, contrairement aux art. 7 et 12 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et aux obligations internationales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. La cellule de M. Haevischer \u00e9tait froide et immonde, macul\u00e9e de mucus, d\u2019excr\u00e9ments et de sang. La cellule de M. Johnston n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune lumi\u00e8re naturelle pendant des mois. Les deux \u00e9taient confin\u00e9s dans leur cellule, seuls, 22 ou 23 heures par jour, et ne disposaient que d\u2019occasions extr\u00eamement limit\u00e9es d\u2019avoir des visites ou des contacts. En pratique, ils \u00e9taient coup\u00e9s de tout contact. Ces conditions ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration physique et des effets pr\u00e9judiciables importants sur leur sant\u00e9 mentale \u2014 les deux ont craint de perdre la raison. Les avocats de la d\u00e9fense ont soutenu que ce traitement ill\u00e9gal faisait partie de la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb et visait \u00e0 susciter le besoin chez les d\u00e9tenus de r\u00e9clamer l\u2019aide de la police afin que leur situation d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e change.\n[20] L\u2019isolement cellulaire de MM. Johnston et Haevischer a pris fin seulement apr\u00e8s que M. Bacon, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenu dans des conditions tout aussi \u00e9pouvantables en attendant son proc\u00e8s pour les six meurtres de Surrey, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019habeas corpus sollicitant son int\u00e9gration \u00e0 la population carc\u00e9rale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie (voir Bacon c. Surrey Pretrial Services Centre, 2010 BCSC 805, 11 Admin. L.R. (5th) 1, par. 292). Le juge McEwan, qui a accueilli la demande de M. Bacon, a vivement condamn\u00e9 ces conditions et jug\u00e9 le traitement de M. Bacon contraire aux art. 7 et 12 de la Charte .\n[21] La troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019all\u00e9gations a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les amici, qui ont invoqu\u00e9 un motif suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019inconduite polici\u00e8re reposant sur des renseignements confidentiels communiqu\u00e9s pendant l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate no 65. Leurs observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 huis clos et ex parte.\nE. La demande de la Couronne relative \u00e0 une audience de type Vukelich\n[22] En temps normal, ces requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures seraient instruites lors d\u2019une audience distincte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du proc\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00ab voir\u2011dire \u00bb (R. c. Sadikov, 2014 ONCA 72, 305 C.C.C. (3d) 421, par. 30\u201131; Erven c. La Reine, [1979] 1 R.C.S. 926, p. 931\u2011932)[1]. \u00c0 la fin du voir\u2011dire, le juge d\u00e9ciderait si les requ\u00eates sont accueillies ou rejet\u00e9es sur le fond, r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la question ultime, soit la suivante : \u00ab les requ\u00e9rants se sont-ils acquitt\u00e9s du fardeau de preuve applicable en \u00e9tablissant les faits qui satisfont \u00e0 chacune des exigences juridiques de la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e? \u00bb En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge devrait d\u00e9cider si les requ\u00e9rants ont respect\u00e9 les trois parties du test de l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos de sorte que les arr\u00eats des proc\u00e9dures sont justifi\u00e9s dans les circonstances.\n[23] Cette question ultime est rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse parce que la Couronne a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 que la juge tienne d\u2019abord le type d\u2019audience d\u00e9crit dans la jurisprudence de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Vukelich (1996), 78 B.C.A.C. 113. D\u2019autres provinces ont des proc\u00e9dures semblables qui portent des noms diff\u00e9rents. Une audience de type Vukelich se tient avant que le tribunal statue sur le fond de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, et pose une question tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente : la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente devrait\u2011elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement ou devrait\u2011elle \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire? La norme qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question pr\u00e9liminaire concernant le rejet sommaire est au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[24] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la raison pour laquelle la Couronne a demand\u00e9 le rejet sommaire lors d\u2019une audience de type Vukelich \u00e9tait qu\u2019aucune des requ\u00eates de la d\u00e9fense ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lait [traduction] \u00ab un fondement suffisant pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019une audition de la preuve est n\u00e9cessaire ou aidera la Cour \u00e0 juger du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate \u00bb (d.a., vol. XIV, p. 22). M\u00eame si les all\u00e9gations s\u2019av\u00e9raient, la Couronne a fait valoir que celles\u2011ci ne satisferaient pas \u00e0 la norme en mati\u00e8re d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure ou qu\u2019elles ne repr\u00e9senteraient pas un cas des plus manifestes justifiant le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\nF. L\u2019audience de type Vukelich\n[25] La juge Wedge a accept\u00e9 de tenir l\u2019audience de type Vukelich r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la Couronne. L\u2019instruction de la motion en rejet sommaire a dur\u00e9 six jours et \u00e9tait divis\u00e9e en une portion publique et une portion \u00e0 huis clos. Les avocats de la d\u00e9fense ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des pi\u00e8ces lors de la portion publique. Seuls les amici ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations mises sous scell\u00e9s et produit des pi\u00e8ces mises sous scell\u00e9s lors de la portion \u00e0 huis clos. (Monsieur Johnston, M. Haevischer et les avocats de la d\u00e9fense n\u2019ont pas eu et n\u2019ont toujours pas acc\u00e8s aux documents sous scell\u00e9s.) Il n\u2019y a eu aucune possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix ou de contre\u2011interroger des t\u00e9moins\u2011cl\u00e9s ni au cours de la portion publique ni au cours de la portion \u00e0 huis clos.\n[26] Le dossier \u00e9crit relatif \u00e0 la motion en rejet sommaire \u00e9tait volumineux. De nombreuses pi\u00e8ces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites lors de la portion publique de l\u2019audience, dont divers documents policiers exposant la strat\u00e9gie adopt\u00e9e par la GRC pour mener l\u2019enqu\u00eate E\u2011Peseta et de nombreux documents portant sur la d\u00e9tention de MM. Johnston et Haevischer. Les pi\u00e8ces mises sous scell\u00e9s produites lors de la portion \u00e0 huis clos de l\u2019audience \u00e9taient importantes et ont \u00e9toff\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble du dossier.\n[27] M\u00eame si le dossier public \u00e9tait volumineux, il ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que la d\u00e9fense souhaitait soumettre \u00e0 la juge Wedge. Les avocats de la d\u00e9fense ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils souhaitaient obtenir d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, dans le cas o\u00f9 la juge d\u00e9cidait de tenir un voir\u2011dire. Ils entendaient appeler \u00e0 la barre certains agents de la GRC pour les contre\u2011interroger, notamment ceux impliqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019inconduite polici\u00e8re, ceux ayant aid\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9laborer la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb et ceux ayant pris part aux d\u00e9cisions de placer MM. Johnston et Haevischer en isolement cellulaire. Ils entendaient aussi appeler \u00e0 la barre des agents correctionnels pour les contre\u2011interroger concernant le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement cellulaire, ainsi que des experts pour qu\u2019ils t\u00e9moignent au sujet des r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019isolement cellulaire sur la sant\u00e9 mentale et le bien\u2011\u00eatre physique de MM. Johnston et Haevischer. Enfin, ils entendaient produire d\u2019autres documents qui, croyaient\u2011ils, prendraient forme une fois qu\u2019ils auraient re\u00e7u toute la preuve.\nG. La d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich : Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192 (motifs publics); 2014 BCSC 2194 (motifs sous scell\u00e9s)\n[28] Sur la base de ce dossier \u00e9crit volumineux mais limit\u00e9, la juge Wedge a rejet\u00e9 sommairement les requ\u00eates sous\u2011jacentes en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\n[29] La juge Wedge a affirm\u00e9 que le test relatif au rejet sommaire consistait \u00e0 savoir si une audition de la preuve (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., un voir\u2011dire) aiderait le tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si les abus all\u00e9gu\u00e9s pourraient permettre \u00e0 MM. Johnston et Haevischer d\u2019obtenir un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions R. c. Wilder, 2004 BCSC 304, et R. c. Hamill (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 338 (C.A. C.\u2011B.), et a conclu que les requ\u00eates pouvaient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es sommairement [traduction] \u00ab si [. . .] les motifs expos\u00e9s par les requ\u00e9rants ne peuvent pas justifier un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00bb (par. 9).\n[30] La juge Wedge s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si la d\u00e9fense pouvait satisfaire au test de l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos pour un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures fond\u00e9 sur un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Ce test exige que le requ\u00e9rant d\u00e9montre (1) qu\u2019il y a une \u00ab atteinte au droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice qui \u201csera r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9[e], perp\u00e9tu\u00e9[e] ou aggrav\u00e9[e] par le d\u00e9roulement du proc\u00e8s ou par son issue\u201d \u00bb; (2) qu\u2019il n\u2019y a \u00ab aucune autre r\u00e9paration susceptible de corriger l\u2019atteinte \u00bb; et (3) que, \u00ab [s]\u2019il subsiste une incertitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 l\u2019issue des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes, [. . .] les int\u00e9r\u00eats militant en faveur de cet arr\u00eat [l\u2019emportent] sur \u201cl\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que repr\u00e9sente pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 un jugement d\u00e9finitif statuant sur le fond\u201d \u00bb (Babos, par. 32, citant R. c. Regan, 2002 CSC 12, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 297, par. 54 et 57).\n[31] \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos, la juge Wedge a reconnu, pour les besoins de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich, que certains actes pouvaient repr\u00e9senter un abus de proc\u00e9dure et que l\u2019inscription de d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces actes porterait atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice. Certains actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles commis par les quatre agents \u2014 entretenir des relations d\u2019exploitation sexuelle, compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moins prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, mentir \u00e0 des sup\u00e9rieurs et trafiquer des demandes de paiement d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et de remboursement de d\u00e9penses \u2014 pourraient constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Toutefois, elle a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb et les autres pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate contest\u00e9es repr\u00e9sentaient un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La juge Wedge a \u00e9galement reconnu que les conditions dans lesquelles MM. Johnston et Haevischer avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus violaient leurs droits garantis par les art. 7 et 12 de la Charte et constituaient un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Enfin, la juge Wedge a accept\u00e9 certaines all\u00e9gations d\u2019abus soulev\u00e9es par les amici, mais a rejet\u00e9 certaines inf\u00e9rences avanc\u00e9es par ceux\u2011ci qui \u00e9taient favorables \u00e0 MM. Johnston et Haevischer. Elle a plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 des inf\u00e9rences favorables \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de la Couronne. Elle a statu\u00e9 que les documents \u00e0 sa disposition lors de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich n\u2019appuyaient pas la th\u00e9orie des amici.\n[32] \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos, la juge Wedge a reconnu, pour les besoins de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune autre r\u00e9paration pour les violations qu\u2019elle avait cern\u00e9es.\n[33] \u00c0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos, la juge Wedge a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab cas des plus manifestes \u00bb o\u00f9 un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 (par. 153). D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la balance, l\u2019inconduite des quatre agents \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement grave. Toutefois, l\u2019inconduite s\u2019\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9e : les agents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendus et retir\u00e9s de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. De plus, les t\u00e9moins f\u00e9minins touch\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s, ce qui temp\u00e8re la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019inconduite. M\u00eame si les conditions de d\u00e9tention \u00e9quivalaient \u00e0 une inconduite grave, prolong\u00e9e et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e ayant eu des cons\u00e9quences imm\u00e9diates et importantes sur la sant\u00e9 mentale et physique de MM. Johnston et Haevischer, la juge Wedge a not\u00e9 que les conditions ne se perp\u00e9tuaient pas et que la conduite de l\u2019\u00c9tat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9e par le juge McEwan. Elle a \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 du poids \u00e0 l\u2019inconduite qu\u2019all\u00e9guaient les amici (mais non aux inf\u00e9rences qu\u2019elle avait rejet\u00e9es). De l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la balance, les crimes \u00e9taient extr\u00eamement graves : les circonstances des infractions \u00e9taient choquantes, il y avait six victimes et le mobile des auteurs des meurtres \u00e9tait le d\u00e9sir de d\u00e9montrer la puissance des Red Scorpions, de semer la peur chez les gangs rivaux et de faire cro\u00eetre le trafic de drogue des Red Scorpions. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les membres des familles des d\u00e9funts avaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que des d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 soient inscrites. Pour la juge Wedge, ces consid\u00e9rations pesaient plus lourd dans la balance.\n[34] La juge Wedge a conclu que m\u00eame si les requ\u00eates \u00e9taient envisag\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable, les motifs expos\u00e9s ne pourraient pas justifier un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Une audition de la preuve (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., un voir\u2011dire) sur le fond ne serait donc d\u2019aucune aide pour le tribunal. Pour ces motifs, elle a rejet\u00e9 sommairement les requ\u00eates et inscrit les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9.\nH. Appel de la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich : Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2021 BCCA 34, 487 C.R.R. (2d) 48 (les juges Tysoe, MacKenzie et Willcock)\n[35] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a conclu que la juge Wedge n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb rejeter sommairement les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures lors de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich. Celles\u2011ci auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail et tranch\u00e9es lors d\u2019un voir\u2011dire sur le fond. La cour a accueilli les appels, annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9, confirm\u00e9 les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9 et renvoy\u00e9 les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures au tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance en vue de la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire.\n[36] La cour a reconnu que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un juge de tenir un voir\u2011dire ou une audition de la preuve est discr\u00e9tionnaire et commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. N\u00e9anmoins, la juge Wedge a commis une erreur concernant les observations sous scell\u00e9s des amici en soupesant la preuve, en tirant des inf\u00e9rences et en \u00e9tablissant des faits sur la foi d\u2019un dossier incomplet. Elle n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les observations des amici de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable et n\u2019a pas tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les amici avaient indiqu\u00e9 des interpr\u00e9tations suffisamment raisonnables et des inf\u00e9rences suffisamment plausibles de sorte qu\u2019une audition compl\u00e8te de la preuve \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\n[37] En outre, la juge Wedge a impos\u00e9 une norme trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour permettre l\u2019audition de la preuve. Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et il \u00e9tait respect\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Lorsque la juge a conclu que les premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 franchies, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que les requ\u00eates n\u2019\u00e9taient pas frivoles. Toutefois, la mise en balance effectu\u00e9e par la juge \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape visait \u00e0 trancher la question ultime, sans qu\u2019elle dispose de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve.\n[38] En outre, la cour a admis certains des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits par les amici. La cour a conclu que cela d\u00e9montrait qu\u2019il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires quant aux faits pertinents pour l\u2019argument des amici et qu\u2019un juge pouvait tirer diff\u00e9rentes conclusions sur l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019inconduite.\n[39] De plus, la cour a fait remarquer qu\u2019en droit, aucune cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019infraction \u2014 peu importe sa gravit\u00e9 \u2014 ne peut \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Le tribunal conserve toujours la facult\u00e9 de se dissocier d\u2019une inconduite en ordonnant un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\nIII. Analyse\n[40] La principale question en appel est de savoir si la juge du proc\u00e8s a fait erreur en rejetant sommairement les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, notre Cour doit \u00e9tablir le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer concernant le rejet sommaire d\u2019une requ\u00eate dans le contexte du droit criminel.\n[41] J\u2019examinerai d\u2019abord l\u2019origine de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich et les valeurs de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s. Ensuite, je d\u00e9terminerai et j\u2019expliquerai le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer : une requ\u00eate ne peut \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement sans audience que si elle est manifestement frivole. Je me prononcerai \u00e9galement sur le cadre d\u2019analyse relatif aux motions en rejet sommaire, notamment les questions de savoir \u00e0 qui incombe le fardeau de la preuve et ce qui doit faire partie du dossier.\n[42] Dans la derni\u00e8re partie, j\u2019appliquerai la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, j\u2019estime que les requ\u00eates n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles et auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre instruites et tranch\u00e9es sur le fond.\nA. Rejet sommaire dans le contexte du droit criminel\n(1) Origine de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich\n[43] L\u2019audience de type Vukelich tire son origine d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue en 1996 qui confirmait le refus du juge du proc\u00e8s de tenir un voir\u2011dire sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019un mandat de perquisition (Vukelich, par. 8). Le juge en chef McEachern, au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, s\u2019est fortement appuy\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision ontarienne R. c. Kutynec (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), qui reconnaissait qu\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab juge du proc\u00e8s peut \u00e9carter les requ\u00eates d\u00e9pourvues de fondement factuel ou juridique, et peut d\u00e9cider comment et quand il convient de r\u00e9gler celles qui sont peut\u2011\u00eatre fond\u00e9es \u00bb (p. 302). Le juge en chef McEachern a ajout\u00e9 que les juges du proc\u00e8s doivent [traduction] \u00ab ma\u00eetriser le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance \u00bb (par. 26). Sur le plan de la proc\u00e9dure, il a approuv\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab une approche souple [. . .] plut\u00f4t qu\u2019[une] proc\u00e9dure formelle \u00bb servant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il devrait ou non proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un voir\u2011dire et comment celui\u2011ci devrait se d\u00e9rouler (par. 23). La m\u00eame approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kutynec. Le juge en chef McEachern estimait que l\u2019on pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux deux questions \u00e0 partir des d\u00e9clarations des avocats, peut\u2011\u00eatre avec un affidavit \u00e0 l\u2019appui.\n[44] En raison de la nature de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, le juge en chef McEachern n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 formuler une norme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les situations o\u00f9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors d\u2019un proc\u00e8s criminel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement. La requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense dans l\u2019affaire Vukelich contestait un mandat de perquisition et se fondait sur l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Garofoli, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1421. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour a conclu que les portions contest\u00e9es avec succ\u00e8s d\u2019une d\u00e9nonciation doivent \u00eatre retranch\u00e9es, apr\u00e8s quoi le juge du proc\u00e8s doit d\u00e9terminer si le reste de la d\u00e9nonciation appuie la d\u00e9livrance du mandat. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vukelich, le juge du proc\u00e8s a appliqu\u00e9 le cadre \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Garofoli pour conclure au vu du dossier, tenant pour av\u00e9r\u00e9es toutes les all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9fense et retranchant les renseignements contest\u00e9s, qu\u2019il y avait toujours suffisamment de renseignements pour d\u00e9livrer le mandat. Vu la nature de la requ\u00eate de la d\u00e9fense et les principes d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tablis par l\u2019arr\u00eat Garofoli, le juge en chef McEachern a conclu que la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire [traduction] \u00ab ne faciliterait pas l\u2019instruction r\u00e9guli\u00e8re des vraies questions \u00bb (par. 26).\n[45] Depuis 1996, des audiences de type Vukelich ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues dans bien des cas autres que portant sur des mandats de perquisition, et on y a fr\u00e9quemment recours dans les proc\u00e8s criminels en Colombie\u2011Britannique. M\u00eame s\u2019il est plus fr\u00e9quent que la Couronne demande une audience de type Vukelich pour rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate de la d\u00e9fense, la fonction de filtrage du juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux requ\u00eates de la Couronne, et les avocats de la d\u00e9fense demandent parfois des audiences de type Vukelich (voir R. c. Cody, 2017 CSC 31, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 659, par. 38; R. c. Biring, 2021 BCSC 2678, par. 5 (CanLII); R. c. Kuntz\u2011Angel, 2020 BCSC 1777, par. 71 (CanLII)).\n(2) Valeurs sous\u2011jacentes : efficacit\u00e9 et \u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s\n[46] La norme s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e concernant le rejet sommaire lors d\u2019une audience de type Vukelich sera fond\u00e9e sur les deux ensembles de valeurs sous\u2011jacentes en jeu dans de telles proc\u00e9dures : l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci. Ces valeurs coexistent et [traduction] \u00ab il faut tendre vers les deux pour que l\u2019un[e] et l\u2019autre se r\u00e9alisent : [elles] sont, en pratique, interd\u00e9pendant[es] \u00bb (R. c. Jordan, 2016 CSC 27, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 631, par. 27, citant B.C. Justice Reform Initiative, A Criminal Justice System for the 21st Century (2012), p. 75).\na) Efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s\n[47] Dans les contextes civil et criminel, les juges du proc\u00e8s jouent un r\u00f4le de gardien et peuvent rejeter sommairement certaines requ\u00eates sans qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019audience sur le fond.\n[48] Une demande dans une affaire civile sera radi\u00e9e \u00ab s\u2019il est \u00e9vident et manifeste, dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s seraient av\u00e9r\u00e9s, que la d\u00e9claration ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune cause d\u2019action raisonnable \u00bb ou, autrement dit, si la demande n\u2019a aucune possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie (R. c. Imperial Tobacco Canada Lt\u00e9e, 2011 CSC 42, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 45, par. 17). La radiation de ce type de demandes \u00ab \u00e9lagu[e] les litiges \u00bb, \u00ab favorise l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et fait \u00e9pargner temps et argent \u00bb et permet aux plaideurs de se concentrer sur les demandes importantes (par. 19\u201120). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, les r\u00e8gles civiles r\u00e9gissant le jugement sommaire, lequel peut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre rendu lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune question v\u00e9ritable requ\u00e9rant la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s, doivent recevoir \u00ab une interpr\u00e9tation large et propice \u00e0 la proportionnalit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement abordable, exp\u00e9ditif et juste des demandes \u00bb (Hryniak c. Mauldin, 2014 CSC 7, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 87, par. 5; voir aussi par. 34).\n[49] Les m\u00eames objectifs sont importants dans le contexte criminel, o\u00f9 il est \u00e9vident que les d\u00e9lais excessifs doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9duits pour que les proc\u00e8s soient efficaces (voir R. c. Glegg, 2021 ONCA 100, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 276, par. 36; Jordan, par. 114 et 139; Cody, par. 36\u201139). Le rejet des requ\u00eates non fond\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel contribue \u00e0 faire en sorte que les proc\u00e8s aient lieu dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, ce qui repr\u00e9sente une \u00ab part essentielle de l\u2019engagement de notre syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle de traiter les inculp\u00e9s pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s innocents de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger leurs droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de leur personne et \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable \u00bb (Jordan, par. 20). \u00ab [L]es proc\u00e8s instruits en temps utile ont des r\u00e9percussions sur les autres personnes qui interviennent dans les proc\u00e8s criminels et qui sont touch\u00e9es par eux, de m\u00eame que sur la confiance du public envers l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb (par. 22).\n[50] De fait, les limites de temps \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la plupart des proc\u00e8s criminels devraient inciter ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent des requ\u00eates sous\u2011jacentes, ou qui r\u00e9clament le rejet sommaire de telles requ\u00eates, \u00e0 se demander s\u00e9rieusement si ces \u00e9tapes sont n\u00e9cessaires et \u00e0 \u00e9valuer leur incidence sur la dur\u00e9e du proc\u00e8s. Tous les participants dans le syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle ont la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019adopter une \u00ab approche proactive qui permet de pr\u00e9venir les d\u00e9lais inutiles en s\u2019attaquant \u00e0 leurs causes profondes \u00bb (Cody, par. 36, citant Jordan, par. 137). Le fait que les d\u00e9cisions concernant le rejet sommaire jouissent d\u2019un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence encourage les juges du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 assumer cette responsabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire au besoin (voir R. c. Samaniego, 2022 CSC 9, par. 25; R. c. Edwardsen, 2019 BCCA 259, par. 75 (CanLII); R. c. Orr, 2021 BCCA 42, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 441, par. 53\u201154).\n[51] L\u2019efficacit\u00e9 ne vise pas, toutefois, la simplicit\u00e9 ou la rapidit\u00e9 comme fins en soi. La complexit\u00e9 dans les proc\u00e8s criminels constitue parfois un passage oblig\u00e9 et l\u2019objectif est d\u2019\u00e9viter les d\u00e9lais disproportionn\u00e9s ou indus, qui portent atteinte aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice (voir Jordan, par. 43). Les proc\u00e8s, et les requ\u00eates soumises \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, devraient avoir une dur\u00e9e proportionn\u00e9e. Ce qui est requis pour l\u2019examen juste et \u00e9quitable d\u2019une requ\u00eate donn\u00e9e d\u00e9pendra de la nature de celle\u2011ci et du contexte du proc\u00e8s dans son ensemble. Les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient chercher \u00e0 \u00e9viter toute \u00ab \u00e9tape proc\u00e9durale ou requ\u00eate qui est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 tort ou qui dure plus longtemps que n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb car elle \u00ab emp\u00eache[rait] d\u2019autres plaideurs m\u00e9ritants de se pourvoir en temps utile devant les tribunaux \u00bb (par. 43). Ces \u00e9tapes n\u2019augmentent pas la qualit\u00e9 de la justice dans ce proc\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis. De m\u00eame, les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient examiner attentivement les d\u00e9cisions prises au nom de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles font r\u00e9ellement sauver du temps et des ressources judiciaires au tribunal. Les \u00e9conomies escompt\u00e9es devraient \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois r\u00e9elles et requises. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur important lors de l\u2019examen de motions en rejet sommaire qui se prolongent et qui sont ax\u00e9es sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9, lesquelles occasionnent souvent d\u2019autres formes de co\u00fbts et de d\u00e9lais (dans le contexte civil, voir Hryniak, par. 6).\n[52] Malheureusement, un examen de la jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019\u00e0 mesure que les audiences de type Vukelich prolif\u00e9raient, devenant presque monnaie courante, leur objectif d\u2019accro\u00eetre l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en pratique. Dans bien des cas, elles sont inutilement longues et ax\u00e9es sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente. Une audience de type Vukelich [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9clam\u00e9e avec insistance par la Couronne \u00bb peut se transformer en un \u00ab long examen pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience du menu d\u00e9tail de la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00bb et donner lieu \u00e0 une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des arguments lors du voir\u2011dire final (R. c. Tse, 2008 BCSC 867, par. 21 (CanLII); voir aussi par. 23). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019audience [traduction] \u00ab consomme, inutilement, les ressources tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es dont l\u2019audience visait elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e0 \u00e9viter le gaspillage \u00bb (R. c. Ali\u2011Kashani, 2017 BCPC 358, par. 52 (CanLII)).\n[53] Le fait que l\u2019objectif initial de l\u2019audience de type Vukelich ne se soit pas toujours concr\u00e9tis\u00e9 est illustr\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sente affaire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019audience de type Vukelich qui a dur\u00e9 six jours comprenait des observations d\u00e9taill\u00e9es des avocats, une preuve substantielle et un examen en profondeur du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Elle a engendr\u00e9 une longue proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel qui entra\u00eenera une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des m\u00eames arguments lorsque les requ\u00eates seront finalement instruites sur le fond.\n[54] De toute \u00e9vidence, on ne peut pas simplement tenir pour acquis que le rejet sommaire est une fa\u00e7on s\u00fbre d\u2019accro\u00eetre l\u2019efficacit\u00e9. Pour faire preuve de pragmatisme et tenir compte de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les juges devraient recenser et soupeser toutes les r\u00e9percussions des divers choix de proc\u00e9dure. Les ressources qui seraient th\u00e9oriquement \u00e9conomis\u00e9es s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas instruction de la principale requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente ne constituent qu\u2019une partie du tableau. Les juges doivent aussi prendre en compte leurs vastes pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance, qui leur permettent de ma\u00eetriser le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance et les processus et proc\u00e9dures de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente. Ces pouvoirs contribuent \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer les pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes concernant les proc\u00e8s prolixes, les recherches \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette, les processus disproportionn\u00e9s et les d\u00e9lais indus. Ils ne constituent pas une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te, mais ils jouent un r\u00f4le important parce qu\u2019ils favorisent les proc\u00e9dures proportionn\u00e9es.\nb) \u00c9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s\n[55] M\u00eame si l\u2019objectif de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s est pressant, le rejet sommaire soul\u00e8ve aussi des pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il est contraire au principe voulant que les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur position et de voir leur preuve, leurs demandes et leurs all\u00e9gations jug\u00e9es au fond. Dans les affaires civiles, les tribunaux ont une certaine r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 priver le demandeur d\u2019un jugement t\u00f4t dans le processus en raison du pr\u00e9judice potentiel qui peut d\u00e9couler du rejet pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de la demande \u2014 particuli\u00e8rement lorsque la demande est in\u00e9dite ou est un cas limite.\n[56] Dans les affaires criminelles, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s est plus qu\u2019un objectif de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale : c\u2019est un imp\u00e9ratif constitutionnel. Un proc\u00e8s criminel porte sur des all\u00e9gations faites par l\u2019\u00c9tat contre un accus\u00e9 dont la libert\u00e9 est souvent en jeu. Le rejet sommaire de requ\u00eates en droit criminel peut restreindre le droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re et son droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, garantis par l\u2019art. 7 et l\u2019al. 11d) de la Charte , en emp\u00eachant celui\u2011ci de pr\u00e9senter en d\u00e9tail ses arguments et d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate (voir Dersch c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1505; R. c. Rose, [1998] 3 R.C.S. 262). Il y a, \u00e9videmment, des limites \u00e0 ces droits. Par exemple, les personnes accus\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas droit \u00e0 un voir\u2011dire et, si un voir\u2011dire est ordonn\u00e9, elles n\u2019ont pas droit au style de voir\u2011dire qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent (Vukelich, par. 26). Le juge du proc\u00e8s d\u00e9cide s\u2019il y a un voir\u2011dire et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de la fa\u00e7on dont celui\u2011ci se d\u00e9roule et s\u2019il devrait comprendre une audition de la preuve. N\u00e9anmoins, le rejet sommaire de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel met en cause les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et, dans certaines circonstances, peut les restreindre.\n[57] En raison de cette dimension constitutionnelle, les r\u00e8gles et les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9liminaires dans le domaine civil peuvent donner des indications limit\u00e9es, mais ne peuvent pas simplement \u00eatre adopt\u00e9s ou transpos\u00e9s dans le domaine criminel. Dans ce domaine de droit public, les droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 garantis par la Charte doivent \u00eatre pris en compte, particuli\u00e8rement lorsque la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense en vue du respect de ses droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. De plus, les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s qui sont propres aux proc\u00e8s criminels doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es. Cela comprend une appr\u00e9ciation des vastes nature, \u00e9tendue, port\u00e9e et vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des requ\u00eates possibles dans un contexte de droit criminel \u2014 des questions qui vont bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de celles soulev\u00e9es par les d\u00e9clarations dans les affaires civiles. Dans le contexte criminel, certaines requ\u00eates sont r\u00e9gies par un ensemble distinct de r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure criminelle, de processus et de normes d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative, et d\u2019autres sont r\u00e9gies par des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de longue date. Les caract\u00e9ristiques distinctes du contexte criminel ont des incidences \u00e0 la fois sur la norme qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer concernant le rejet sommaire et sur la fa\u00e7on dont elle doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans des cas individuels.\n[58] Les pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s peuvent na\u00eetre de nombreuses fa\u00e7ons. \u00c9tablir une norme trop souple pour le rejet sommaire risque de faire en sorte que des requ\u00eates qui auraient pu \u00eatre accueillies apr\u00e8s une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond soient rejet\u00e9es sur la base d\u2019un dossier limit\u00e9 ou incomplet. Ce risque devient particuli\u00e8rement pertinent lorsqu\u2019une partie pr\u00e9sente des arguments in\u00e9dits, qui peuvent avoir une grande valeur de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et permettre au droit d\u2019\u00e9voluer. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans le contexte civil, \u00ab [l]\u2019approche doit \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et permettre, dans la mesure du possible, l\u2019instruction de toute demande in\u00e9dite, mais soutenable \u00bb (Imperial Tobacco, par. 21). Cette pr\u00e9occupation s\u2019applique tout autant dans les affaires criminelles : les tribunaux ont reconnu le risque que des demandes in\u00e9dites soient r\u00e9prim\u00e9es, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab les contours des droits constitutionnels sont \u00e9tablis gr\u00e2ce aux litiges relatifs \u00e0 des questions nouvelles, non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et litigieuses \u00bb (R. c. McDonald, 2013 BCSC 314, par. 44 (CanLII); Teal Cedar Products Ltd. c. Rainforest Flying Squad, 2022 BCSC 429, par. 14\u201115 (CanLII)). Certains intervenants ont soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019une requ\u00eate in\u00e9dite pourrait exiger un examen approfondi de la preuve pour que les questions puissent \u00eatre cern\u00e9es ad\u00e9quatement. Je suis aussi de cet avis.\n[59] Ces pr\u00e9occupations sont \u00e0 la base de la jurisprudence actuelle et concordent avec celle\u2011ci, laquelle reconna\u00eet que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s exige un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire, de sorte que la plupart des requ\u00eates sont instruites au fond (voir R. c. Frederickson, 2018 BCCA 2, par. 33 (CanLII)). De fait, les parties devant notre Cour s\u2019entendent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toutes pour dire qu\u2019il ne devrait pas y avoir de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un accus\u00e9 fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire, bien qu\u2019elles ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la norme exacte devant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e.\nc) Les valeurs de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s appuient un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire rigoureux pour le rejet sommaire dans le contexte criminel\n[60] Les valeurs sous\u2011jacentes de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci commandent la conclusion qu\u2019un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire rigoureux devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 aux motions en rejet sommaire lors de proc\u00e8s criminels. Comme son nom l\u2019indique, une proc\u00e9dure sommaire est cens\u00e9e \u00eatre sommaire : pr\u00e9liminaire, br\u00e8ve et s\u2019apparentant plus \u00e0 un survol qu\u2019\u00e0 un examen en profondeur. Le rejet sommaire repose sur des all\u00e9gations et est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par l\u2019artifice consistant \u00e0 tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. En revanche, une instruction sur le fond suppose une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur les faits et sur la question de savoir si, apr\u00e8s un examen complet, les faits \u00e9tablis \u00e9tayent les all\u00e9gations et justifient la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e.\n[61] Une norme rigoureuse est aussi \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res des proc\u00e8s criminels, notamment la fa\u00e7on dont les vastes pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance du juge du proc\u00e8s peuvent contribuer \u00e0 assurer l\u2019utilisation efficace, efficiente et proportionn\u00e9e des ressources judiciaires, ainsi que le respect des droits de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. Les juges ont une fonction de gardien et l\u2019objectif est que seules les requ\u00eates qui devraient \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par le pouvoir de rejet sommaire soient dans les faits rejet\u00e9es sommairement. Les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient donc p\u00e9cher par exc\u00e8s de prudence lorsqu\u2019ils se voient demander de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le contexte du droit criminel. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la norme de contr\u00f4le empreinte de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence appliqu\u00e9e en appel aux d\u00e9cisions d\u2019un juge en mati\u00e8re de gestion de l\u2019instance (Samaniego, par. 25; Edwardsen, par. 75). Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire et la norme choisis concernant le rejet sommaire doivent respecter l\u2019observation de notre Cour (dans le contexte de la s\u00e9lection des jur\u00e9s) selon laquelle \u00ab une injustice occasionnelle ne saurait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le prix \u00e0 payer pour l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. Find, 2001 CSC 32, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 863, par. 28).\nB. Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb pour le rejet sommaire\n[62] J\u2019aborde maintenant la question au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi : quel est le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer relativement au rejet sommaire des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel? J\u2019examine bri\u00e8vement l\u2019incertitude dans la jurisprudence. J\u2019indique ensuite le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire appropri\u00e9, qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole, et j\u2019explique pourquoi ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire favorise \u00e0 la fois l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci. J\u2019expose aussi pourquoi les autres crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9liminaires propos\u00e9s conviennent moins aux motions en rejet sommaire et je donne des indications concernant la fa\u00e7on dont la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e, la partie \u00e0 qui incombe le fardeau concernant la motion en rejet sommaire et quel type de dossier devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Je conclus par un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du cadre d\u2019analyse applicable aux motions en rejet sommaire.\n(1) Examen de la jurisprudence\n[63] Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments \u00bb (McDonald, par. 18). Il a notamment \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme n\u2019ayant aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s (Cody, par. 38); \u00e9tant frivole ou manifestement frivole (Jordan, par. 63; Cody, par. 38; Accurso c. R., 2022 QCCA 752, par. 323 et 329 (CanLII); Br\u00fbl\u00e9 c. R., 2021 QCCA 1334, par. 31 (CanLII)); ne comportant aucun motif pour lequel la requ\u00eate pourrait \u00eatre accueillie (Cody, par. 38); n\u2019indiquant aucune probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable que le voir\u2011dire sera utile (R. c. Pires, 2005 CSC 66, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 343, par. 35); \u00e9tant vou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec (R. c. Armstrong, 2012 BCCA 242, 350 D.L.R. (4th) 457, par. 38; R. c. Omar, 2007 ONCA 117, 84 O.R.

C.\u2011B.) \u00bb), par. 36 (CanLII)); \u00e9tant non fond\u00e9 \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue (Cobb, par. 7); ne reposant sur aucun fait raisonnablement susceptible de justifier en derni\u00e8re analyse une r\u00e9paration (Gill (C.S. C.\u2011B.), par. 36); \u00e9tant d\u00e9pourvu de fondement factuel ou juridique (Kutynec, p. 302); n\u2019ayant aucun fondement dans la preuve (Omar, par. 31); \u00e9tant compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de fondement (R. c. Sandhu, 2021 MBQB 22, par. 23 (CanLII)); ou \u00e9tant \u00ab manifestement mal fond[\u00e9] et frivole \u00bb (Valcourt c. R., 2019 QCCA 903, par. 6 (CanLII)). En fait, certaines d\u00e9cisions comprennent de multiples combinaisons de ces mots ou expressions (voir, p. ex., Cobb, par. 7; Gill (C.S. C.\u2011B.), par. 36; Omar, par. 31).\n[64] Comme il ressort des citations susmentionn\u00e9es, cette incertitude ne se limite pas \u00e0 la Colombie\u2011Britannique. Les provinces et territoires de l\u2019ensemble du pays ont invoqu\u00e9 une combinaison de d\u00e9cisions, y compris Vukelich, Kutynec et Cody, \u00e0 l\u2019appui du pouvoir du juge du proc\u00e8s de rejeter sommairement des requ\u00eates (voir, p. ex., R. c. RV, 2022 ABCA 218, par. 63\u201164 (CanLII); R. c. Wesaquate, 2022 SKCA 101, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 225, par. 93; R. c. Giesbrecht, 2019 MBCA 35, [2019] 7 W.W.R. 280, par. 134\u2011136; R. c.

Smith, 2021 YKTC 60, par. 5 et 13 (CanLII); R. c. Denechezhe, 2021 YKTC 18, par. 82 (CanLII)).\n[65] Bien que les diverses formulations visent toutes \u00e0 \u00e9viter les voir\u2011dire inutiles et entra\u00eenant le gaspillage de ressources, M. Johnston avait raison lorsqu\u2019il a fait valoir que la reformulation d\u2019une norme \u00e0 l\u2019aide de diff\u00e9rents mots et expressions cr\u00e9e de la confusion et engendre de l\u2019incertitude. La jurisprudence actuelle est donc incertaine et d\u00e9montre que la Cour doit clarifier le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer concernant le rejet sommaire de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel. Il s\u2019agit de la premi\u00e8re fois que cette question est soulev\u00e9e et la Cour est maintenant appel\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bon crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire fond\u00e9 sur les principes fondamentaux.\n(2) Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb\n[66] Je conclus que la norme qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer concernant le rejet sommaire est celle consistant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole. Cette norme est tir\u00e9e de la jurisprudence portant sur les requ\u00eates frivoles, comme le font valoir certains intervenants et parties, notamment M. Johnston, M. Haevischer, l\u2019Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society, l\u2019Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles et la Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia. Toutefois, elle exige aussi que les d\u00e9fauts dans la requ\u00eate soient \u00e9vidents.\n[67] La partie \u00ab frivole \u00bb de la norme permet d\u2019\u00e9carter les requ\u00eates qui seront forc\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9es. La Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab il est largement reconnu que le crit\u00e8re exigeant que l\u2019appel ne soit \u201cpas futile\u201d ([. . .] le crit\u00e8re de \u201cnon\u2011futilit\u00e9\u201d) est tr\u00e8s peu exigeant \u00bb (R. c. Oland, 2017 CSC 17, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 250, par. 20). Apr\u00e8s examen de la jurisprudence sur le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de \u00ab non\u2011futilit\u00e9 \u00bb, le caract\u00e8re in\u00e9vitable ou n\u00e9cessaire du rejet est la principale caract\u00e9ristique d\u2019une requ\u00eate \u00ab futile \u00bb ou \u00ab frivole \u00bb. En ce qui concerne la jurisprudence sur les requ\u00eates pour la mise en libert\u00e9 sous caution en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au par. 679(3) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , voir R. c. Passey (1997), 56 Alta. L.R. (3d) 317 (C.A.), par. 6\u20118; R. c. Effert, 2006 ABCA 352, par. 5\u20116 (CanLII); R. c. Greer, 2021 BCCA 148, par. 36 (CanLII); R. c.

En ce qui concerne les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9vues au par. 685(1) visant le rejet sommaire d\u2019appels lorsque la cour d\u2019appel \u00e9tablit que les moyens juridiques d\u2019appel sont frivoles ou vexatoires, voir R. c. Beseiso, 2020 ONCA 686, par. 7 (CanLII); R. c. Mehedi, 2019 ONCA 387, par. 6 (CanLII). Enfin, en ce qui concerne les requ\u00eates fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 320.25 visant une suspension d\u2019une interdiction de conduite en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel, voir R. c. McPherson, 1999 BCCA 638, 140 C.C.C. (3d) 316, par. 5.\n[68] Outre le caract\u00e8re in\u00e9vitable ou n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019\u00e9chec, la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 \u00bb englobe un ensemble d\u2019autres expressions. C\u2019est parce qu\u2019elle sera forc\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9e que la requ\u00eate frivole a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant \u00ab non d\u00e9fendable \u00bb et comme \u00ab n\u2019ayant aucun fondement justifiant qu\u2019elle soit accueillie \u00bb. De m\u00eame, dire qu\u2019une requ\u00eate est \u00ab vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec \u00bb \u00e9voque l\u2019in\u00e9vitabilit\u00e9 et constitue simplement une autre fa\u00e7on de dire que la requ\u00eate est \u00ab frivole \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Armstrong, par. 38; Omar, par. 31; Cobb, par. 7).\n[69] Cependant, j\u2019ajoute le mot \u00ab manifestement \u00bb afin d\u2019exprimer l\u2019id\u00e9e que le caract\u00e8re frivole de la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre \u00e9vident. Le mot \u00ab manifestement \u00bb signifie [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019une fa\u00e7on manifeste, \u00e9vidente, ind\u00e9niable, patente \u00bb, et \u00ab manifeste \u00bb signifie \u00ab [c]lairement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il, \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ou au jugement; susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre vu ou compris; \u00e9vident \u00bb (Oxford English Dictionary (en ligne)). De m\u00eame que la norme civile relative \u00e0 la radiation d\u2019une demande exige qu\u2019il soit \u00ab \u00e9vident et manifeste \u00bb que celle\u2011ci ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune cause d\u2019action raisonnable (ou, en anglais, \u00ab plain and obvious \u00bb), le mot \u00ab manifestement \u00bb ajoute une autre couche \u00e0 la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 \u00bb et indique de mani\u00e8re utile qu\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire devrait \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur ce qui est clairement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9.\n[70] La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a r\u00e9cemment eu recours \u00e0 la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb, notamment dans le contexte du rejet sommaire propos\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures (Accurso, par. 323 et 329; Br\u00fbl\u00e9, par. 31; voir aussi Ouellet c. R., 2021 QCCA 386, 70 C.R. (7th) 279, par. 12, note 3, renvoyant \u00e0 une requ\u00eate \u00ab \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame frivole \u00bb). La Cour d\u2019appel a appel\u00e9 les juges \u00e0 faire preuve de prudence lors de l\u2019application de cette norme avant de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate, car un tel rejet prive le requ\u00e9rant (souvent l\u2019accus\u00e9) d\u2019une audience sur le fond (Accurso, par. 314\u2011315, citant Br\u00fbl\u00e9, par. 31). Dans le cadre de motions en rejet sommaire, la Cour d\u2019appel, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019exiger que l\u2019accus\u00e9 prouve l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation de la Charte au moyen d\u2019une requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente fond\u00e9e sur celle\u2011ci, a seulement exig\u00e9 que l\u2019accus\u00e9 d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il est possible que la demande soit accueillie (Accurso, par. 323).\n[71] Ainsi, la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb, qui \u00e9voque la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente de l\u2019\u00e9chec, est le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer pour le rejet sommaire des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel. Si le caract\u00e8re frivole de la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas manifeste ou \u00e9vident au vu du dossier, la requ\u00eate ne devrait pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement et devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre jug\u00e9e au fond.\n[72] Cette norme est celle qui sert le mieux les valeurs de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une norme rigoureuse qui permettra aux juges d\u2019\u00e9carter les requ\u00eates qui ne seraient jamais accueillies et qui, par d\u00e9finition, feraient perdre du temps \u00e0 la cour. Le rejet sommaire, outil brutal qui emp\u00eache le requ\u00e9rant d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant, n\u2019est pas la seule fa\u00e7on par laquelle les juges peuvent prot\u00e9ger l\u2019efficacit\u00e9. La panoplie des pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance du juge lui permet d\u2019adapter les proc\u00e9dures et contribue \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer les pr\u00e9occupations selon lesquelles les \u00ab recherches \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette \u00bb peuvent faire avorter le progr\u00e8s d\u2019un proc\u00e8s, engendrer des d\u00e9lais indus ou causer une utilisation disproportionn\u00e9e du temps du tribunal.\n[73] Le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb prot\u00e8ge aussi les droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable en veillant \u00e0 ce que les requ\u00eates qui pourraient \u00eatre accueillies, notamment les demandes in\u00e9dites, soient jug\u00e9es au fond. La protection des droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable est toujours importante, mais rev\u00eat une importance accrue lorsque la requ\u00eate en cause comporte de graves cons\u00e9quences. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, plus les cons\u00e9quences associ\u00e9es \u00e0 une requ\u00eate donn\u00e9e sont graves, plus l\u2019incidence possible sur les droits d\u2019un accus\u00e9 est grande en cas de rejet sommaire de celle\u2011ci. Certaines requ\u00eates entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences plus importantes simplement en raison de leur nature et des questions qu\u2019elles soul\u00e8vent. Par exemple, les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures fond\u00e9es sur un abus de proc\u00e9dure ont une \u00e9norme importance pour l\u2019accus\u00e9 et le public. Elles comportent souvent de graves all\u00e9gations de conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de la part de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et exigent toujours des cons\u00e9quences s\u00e9rieuses, \u00e0 savoir un arr\u00eat permanent de la poursuite (Babos, par. 30, 35 et 37; Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Tobiass, [1997] 3 R.C.S. 391, par. 91). De m\u00eame, il peut \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans une requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente que les droits que la Charte garantit \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s, de sorte que le rejet sommaire de celle\u2011ci emp\u00eache l\u2019accus\u00e9 de plaider ces droits au cours du proc\u00e8s.\n(3) Autres normes propos\u00e9es par les parties\n[74] Les autres normes propos\u00e9es par certains des intervenants et des parties ne conviennent pas aussi bien \u00e0 la t\u00e2che que le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb.\n[75] La Couronne et d\u2019autres ont propos\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de \u00ab l\u2019absence de probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable de succ\u00e8s \u00bb sur la base de leur interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cody. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour a utilis\u00e9 les expressions \u00ab chances raisonnables de succ\u00e8s \u00bb, \u00ab aucun motif qui indiquerait que la demande a des chances d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie \u00bb et \u00ab frivoles \u00bb en lien avec les motions en rejet sommaire (par. 38). Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a affirm\u00e9 que notre Cour [traduction] \u00ab a formul\u00e9 cette norme de sorte qu\u2019elle exige qu\u2019une requ\u00eate ait une \u201cperspective raisonnable\u201d de succ\u00e8s ou soit susceptible d\u2019aider \u00e0 trancher les questions dont le tribunal est saisi \u00bb (par. 373). D\u2019autres tribunaux se sont aussi appuy\u00e9s sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Cody pour fonder le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire concernant le rejet sommaire, citant une ou plusieurs des trois expressions utilis\u00e9es (voir, p. ex., Lehr, par. 17; Hu c. R., 2022 QCCS 2871, par. 13 (CanLII); Greer (C.A. Ont.), par. 108; R. c. Morin, 2022 SKCA 46, [2022] 7 W.W.R. 443, par. 23; R. c. Walton, 2019 ONSC 928, par. 47 (CanLII)).\n[76] Toutefois, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cody, la Cour n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 du crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire devant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au rejet sommaire de requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel. L\u2019arr\u00eat Cody ne portait pas sur le rejet sommaire, mais plut\u00f4t sur les d\u00e9lais d\u00e9raisonnables violant l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte . L\u2019arr\u00eat Cody a confirm\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan et a repris l\u2019appel qui y est lanc\u00e9 aux juges du proc\u00e8s d\u2019utiliser leurs pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance pour r\u00e9duire les d\u00e9lais. En ce qui concerne ce dernier point, la Cour a fait remarquer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cody, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, que les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient exercer ces pouvoirs pour rejeter sommairement des requ\u00eates. L\u2019arr\u00eat Cody n\u2019examinait pas attentivement et n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas la norme au regard de laquelle il convient d\u2019exercer ce pouvoir et ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s faisant autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[77] De plus, la norme de \u00ab l\u2019absence de perspective raisonnable de succ\u00e8s \u00bb ne convient pas au rejet sommaire dans le contexte criminel car elle peut commander un examen au fond de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente. Un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e d\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire et favorise le type de proc\u00e9dures prolong\u00e9es qui accablent actuellement les audiences de type Vukelich. Il risque de faire en sorte que le juge saisi de la motion en rejet sommaire examine trop en profondeur un dossier limit\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il constitue une norme utile dans d\u2019autres domaines du droit, il a tendance \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il est utilis\u00e9 pour le rejet sommaire dans le contexte criminel. L\u2019examen au fond de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re partie du processus d\u00e9cisionnel, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire lorsque le juge r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la question ultime du voir\u2011dire lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[78] Subsidiairement, d\u2019autres devant notre Cour ont invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Pires afin de soutenir que les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient refuser de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audition de la preuve si la partie requ\u00e9rante \u00ab est incapable de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est raisonnablement probable que cette audience aidera \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les questions soumises au tribunal \u00bb (par. 35); cela est parfois appel\u00e9 la norme de \u00ab l\u2019absence de probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable d\u2019utilit\u00e9 \u00bb. Toutefois, en commentant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que les juges du proc\u00e8s limitent les proc\u00e9dures prolixes, la Cour dans cette affaire ne pr\u00e9tendait pas non plus d\u00e9cider du crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire pour les motions en rejet sommaire. L\u2019arr\u00eat Pires portait plut\u00f4t sur la contestation d\u2019un mandat de perquisition et confirmait l\u2019exigence \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Garofoli selon laquelle la d\u00e9fense doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a une probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable que le contre\u2011interrogatoire du d\u00e9posant soit utile pour trancher les questions pertinentes (par. 3 et 40).\n[79] La norme de \u00ab l\u2019absence de probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable d\u2019utilit\u00e9 \u00bb souffre du m\u00eame d\u00e9faut d\u2019\u00eatre ax\u00e9e sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9. De plus, elle est centr\u00e9e sur la proc\u00e9dure (comment la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e) plut\u00f4t que sur la substance (\u00e0 savoir si la requ\u00eate est en quelque sorte vici\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement). Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que cela puisse \u00eatre une consid\u00e9ration utile pour d\u00e9cider de quelle fa\u00e7on un voir\u2011dire devrait se d\u00e9rouler, cette norme ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre de motions en rejet sommaire afin de d\u00e9terminer si une requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente devrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire.\n[80] La norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb se veut une norme claire applicable aux motions en rejet sommaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte du droit criminel qui ne sont pas autrement assujetties \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9vu par voie l\u00e9gislative ou judiciaire. Elle n\u2019a pas, par exemple, d\u2019incidence sur les requ\u00eates fond\u00e9es sur les dispositions du Code criminel comme les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9vues au par. 685(1) concernant les appels futiles ou les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 679 concernant la mise en libert\u00e9 sous caution en attendant l\u2019issue d\u2019un appel (y compris Oland). Cette norme n\u2019\u00e9clipse pas non plus les ensembles de r\u00e8gles de droit qui se sont constitu\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de certains types de requ\u00eates, comme celles de type Garofoli et Pires visant \u00e0 contester la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 d\u2019un mandat de perquisition.\n(4) Application de la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb\n[81] Ayant \u00e9tabli quel devrait \u00eatre le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire, je donne maintenant des indications quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9. J\u2019explique comment les juges devraient traiter les faits et les inf\u00e9rences all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente et comment reconna\u00eetre lorsque la requ\u00eate est manifestement frivole.\n[82] La Couronne a fait valoir que les juges du proc\u00e8s devraient pouvoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une appr\u00e9ciation ou un examen limit\u00e9 de la preuve propos\u00e9e et rejeter les faits ou les inf\u00e9rences qui n\u2019ont pas de fondement raisonnable dans les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le requ\u00e9rant. L\u2019approche de la Couronne exige un examen au fond et est donc incompatible avec le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb. Elle est contraire \u00e0 la proposition \u00e9tablie selon laquelle les faits doivent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre tenus pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s, et non accept\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant vrais apr\u00e8s une \u00e9valuation limit\u00e9e. Le juge ne devrait pas se livrer \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation limit\u00e9e de la preuve pour v\u00e9rifier si celle\u2011ci est raisonnablement susceptible d\u2019\u00e9tayer une inf\u00e9rence, et il ne devrait pas non plus d\u00e9cider quelle inf\u00e9rence il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re parmi des inf\u00e9rences oppos\u00e9es. Une telle \u00e9valuation devrait avoir lieu lors du voir\u2011dire, proprement dit.\n[83] Lorsqu\u2019il est saisi d\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire, le juge doit tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le requ\u00e9rant et doit prendre les arguments de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 leur sens le plus fort (Vukelich, par. 26; Armstrong, par. 8; Gill (C.S. C.\u2011B.), par. 24). Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer la preuve ou d\u2019\u00e9tablir des faits dans le cadre de la motion en rejet sommaire, la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente du requ\u00e9rant devrait expliquer son fondement factuel et indiquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve anticip\u00e9s qui pourraient \u00e9tablir les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Lorsque le requ\u00e9rant ne peut pas indiquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve anticip\u00e9s qui pourraient \u00e9tablir un fait n\u00e9cessaire, le juge peut rejeter l\u2019all\u00e9gation factuelle pour le motif qu\u2019elle est manifestement frivole.\n[84] De m\u00eame, le juge devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenir pour acquis que les inf\u00e9rences formul\u00e9es par le requ\u00e9rant sont vraies, m\u00eame si des inf\u00e9rences contradictoires sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Le juge ne devrait rejeter une inf\u00e9rence que si elle est manifestement frivole, ce qui veut dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de raisonnement menant \u00e0 l\u2019inf\u00e9rence propos\u00e9e. Tel pourrait \u00eatre le cas lorsqu\u2019un fait n\u00e9cessaire qui sous\u2011tend l\u2019inf\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou si l\u2019inf\u00e9rence ne peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e en droit (p. ex., si l\u2019inf\u00e9rence propos\u00e9e repose sur un raisonnement inacceptable).\n[85] Une approche semblable est adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate dans son ensemble. Puisque les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s sont tenus pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s, une requ\u00eate ne sera manifestement frivole que lorsqu\u2019il y a un d\u00e9faut fondamental dans la voie juridique de celle\u2011ci : la r\u00e9paration ne peut \u00eatre obtenue. Par exemple, une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre manifestement frivole parce que le juge n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e (voir, p. ex., Lehr, par. 27\u201132). Il pourrait \u00e9galement s\u2019agir d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sentant un argument juridique qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9: les requ\u00eates fond\u00e9es sur des propositions juridiques qui sont nettement contraires au droit \u00e9tabli et non contest\u00e9 sont manifestement frivoles (voir, p. ex., Lehr, par. 22\u201123) .\n[86] Une requ\u00eate peut aussi \u00eatre manifestement frivole lorsque la r\u00e9paration sollicit\u00e9e ne pourrait jamais \u00eatre accord\u00e9e selon les faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate en question. La nature de la requ\u00eate sera pertinente pour cette analyse. Dans le cas de certaines requ\u00eates, le juge du proc\u00e8s pourrait \u00eatre en mesure de tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits avanc\u00e9s par le requ\u00e9rant et, ce faisant, d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la r\u00e9paration sollicit\u00e9e pourrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Les requ\u00eates de type Garofoli, o\u00f9 le juge du proc\u00e8s se demande si la d\u00e9nonciation pourrait justifier la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un mandat de perquisition m\u00eame si les portions contest\u00e9es de la d\u00e9nonciation sont supprim\u00e9es, illustrent ce point. Lorsque la d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9taye tout de m\u00eame la d\u00e9livrance du mandat, la requ\u00eate peut alors \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement parce que m\u00eame si la d\u00e9fense peut prouver que les portions contest\u00e9es de la d\u00e9nonciation doivent \u00eatre radi\u00e9es, la r\u00e9paration sollicit\u00e9e (l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus gr\u00e2ce au mandat) ne pourrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\n[87] Par ailleurs, des portions cl\u00e9s de la requ\u00eate pourraient \u00eatre manquantes. Par exemple, la requ\u00eate pourrait omettre d\u2019\u00e9noncer une conclusion qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour le respect du test juridique pertinent. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e si le requ\u00e9rant accepte qu\u2019une autre r\u00e9paration est susceptible de corriger l\u2019atteinte. Les all\u00e9gations factuelles cl\u00e9s peuvent aussi \u00eatre manquantes. Par exemple, une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour abus de proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e si le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu une conduite abusive.\n[88] Ces vices fondamentaux doivent \u00eatre manifestes. Si l\u2019erreur n\u2019est pas apparente au vu du dossier, la requ\u00eate doit suivre son cours.\n[89] Enfin, le pouvoir du juge du proc\u00e8s de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 tout au long de l\u2019instance. M\u00eame si le juge permet que la requ\u00eate fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire, il conserve le pouvoir de la rejeter sommairement pendant celui\u2011ci s\u2019il appara\u00eet \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle est manifestement frivole (Cody, par. 38, citant Jordan, par. 63). Cela peut se produire si le requ\u00e9rant est incapable d\u2019obtenir toute preuve, contest\u00e9e ou non, pour prouver un fait n\u00e9cessaire.\n(5) Le fardeau incombe \u00e0 la partie qui r\u00e9clame le rejet sommaire\n[90] Dans le cadre d\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire, la partie qui demande le rejet sommaire a le fardeau de convaincre le juge que la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole.\n[91] Certains soutiennent que le fardeau devrait incomber \u00e0 la partie qui pr\u00e9sente la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de droit automatique \u00e0 un voir\u2011dire (Vukelich, par. 26). Toutefois, imposer le fardeau \u00e0 la partie qui demande le rejet sommaire est logique, pratique et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable. Logiquement, la partie qui cherche \u00e0 obtenir le rejet sommaire devrait avoir le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que cette r\u00e9paration doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Sur le plan pratique, le fardeau peut dissuader le demandeur de solliciter le rejet sommaire de chacune des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans un dossier, qu\u2019elles soient manifestement frivoles ou non. Un tel comportement strat\u00e9gique est tout \u00e0 fait inefficace et fait perdre du temps au tribunal.\n[92] Si, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une motion d\u2019une partie, le juge du proc\u00e8s exerce son pouvoir de gestion de l\u2019instance pour tenir une audience sur le rejet sommaire, le fardeau incombera tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 la partie s\u2019opposant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., la partie qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait du rejet sommaire de la requ\u00eate). Si la partie prouve que la requ\u00eate est manifestement frivole, le juge peut la rejeter sommairement.\n(6) Dossier r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel pour les motions en rejet sommaire\n[93] Le dossier relatif \u00e0 une motion en rejet sommaire devrait normalement \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel et \u00eatre de nature sommaire car la production d\u2019une preuve tr\u00e8s \u00e9toff\u00e9e exige souvent du temps, des efforts et des d\u00e9lais d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objectif m\u00eame de la motion. Bien que l\u2019on s\u2019attende \u00e0 ce que les deux parties pr\u00e9sentent leurs meilleurs arguments, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de fixer des r\u00e8gles fermes concernant le type de dossier qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 (voir Glegg, par. 37; Giesbrecht, par. 158). Compte tenu des diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure qui s\u2019appliquent dans l\u2019ensemble des provinces et territoires, et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019un juge du proc\u00e8s peut, en vertu de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, d\u00e9cider de la fa\u00e7on dont une requ\u00eate devrait suivre son cours, l\u2019approche relative \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur le rejet sommaire devrait comporter [traduction] \u00ab un processus souple plut\u00f4t que fixe \u00bb (Vukelich, par. 19; voir aussi Kutynec, p. 293\u2011294 et 299).\n[94] \u00c0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, la partie qui d\u00e9pose la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente doit s\u2019assurer que celle\u2011ci est conforme aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure locales et aux pratiques, directives et proc\u00e9dures applicables. Certains ressorts ont mis au point des r\u00e8gles et des approches pr\u00e9cises pour circonscrire les requ\u00eates qui devraient \u00eatre instruites lors d\u2019un voir\u2011dire. L\u2019Ontario a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le pouvoir de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate dans ses r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure criminelle (voir Glegg, par. 34; R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re criminelle de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice (Ontario), TR\/2012\u20117, r\u00e8gle 34.02). L\u2019Alberta exige que toutes les requ\u00eates fond\u00e9es sur la Charte soient accompagn\u00e9es de renseignements suffisants (voir R. c. Dwernychuk (1992), 135 A.R. 31 (C.A.), par. 12 et 21; R. c. Baker, 2004 ABPC 218, 47 Alta. L.R. (4th) 152, par. 11; R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re criminelle de la Cour du Banc du Roi de l\u2019Alberta, TR\/2017\u201176, r\u00e8gle 14). La Couronne en Alberta demande souvent des pr\u00e9cisions pour mieux comprendre la requ\u00eate de la d\u00e9fense avant d\u2019en r\u00e9clamer le rejet sommaire.\n[95] Les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s concernant la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, ainsi que la motion en rejet sommaire, feront \u00e9videmment partie du dossier. Le demandeur doit expliquer clairement de quelle fa\u00e7on la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole. Il ne suffit pas de faire simplement des d\u00e9clarations cat\u00e9goriques portant que la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente ne donnera pas lieu, en derni\u00e8re analyse, \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u2014 ce raisonnement met ind\u00fbment l\u2019accent sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 ultime de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente et non sur la question de savoir si elle est manifestement frivole.\n[96] Conform\u00e9ment au principe voulant qu\u2019une requ\u00eate ne doive \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e que si elle est manifestement frivole, tout document additionnel qui est vers\u00e9 au dossier concernant une motion en rejet sommaire devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel et n\u00e9cessaire. Cela aidera \u00e0 \u00e9viter la question des d\u00e9lais et de l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 qui ont, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, accabl\u00e9 les audiences de type Vukelich. Il ne devrait pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9senter une preuve contest\u00e9e d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et abondante pour d\u00e9terminer si la requ\u00eate sera forc\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9e. Les avocats devraient, au minimum, donner des d\u00e9tails concernant (1) les principes juridiques, les dispositions de la Charte ou de lois qui sont invoqu\u00e9s, et la fa\u00e7on dont ces principes ou dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s; (2) les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (anticip\u00e9s) qui seront invoqu\u00e9s et la fa\u00e7on dont ils peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s; (3) les arguments propos\u00e9s; et (4) la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e (Baker, par. 11; Dwernychuk, par. 21\u201122).\n[97] Dans le cadre d\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire, la partie qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente a le fardeau minimal de fournir au juge les pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t au moyen de plaidoiries ou d\u2019observations \u00e9crites. Bien que le fardeau g\u00e9n\u00e9ral incombe \u00e0 la partie qui r\u00e9clame le rejet sommaire, le requ\u00e9rant est celui qui sait quelle r\u00e9paration est sollicit\u00e9e de sorte qu\u2019il devrait \u00e9noncer, de fa\u00e7on suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, ce qu\u2019il esp\u00e8re prouver au moyen de la requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir cette r\u00e9paration. Selon les exigences locales relatives au d\u00e9p\u00f4t, il est possible qu\u2019une grande partie de ces renseignements soient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans un avis de requ\u00eate et les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Les observations des avocats seront une [traduction] \u00ab premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape utile \u00bb pour compl\u00e9ter ces renseignements (Vukelich, par. 23). De plus, il convient de rappeler que le juge du proc\u00e8s peut, en vertu de ses pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance, demander au requ\u00e9rant de lui indiquer ces d\u00e9tails avant de tenir un voir\u2011dire (R. c. Felderhof (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), par. 57).\n[98] M\u00eame si les d\u00e9clarations des avocats suffiront souvent, quelque chose de plus pourrait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire. Je m\u2019en remets \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge tranchant la motion en rejet sommaire pour ce qui est de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il faut quelque chose de plus et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ce que ce devrait \u00eatre. D\u00e9cider de quelle fa\u00e7on la motion en rejet sommaire proc\u00e9dera rel\u00e8ve des pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance du juge. Toutefois, le juge doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que plus il y a de documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, plus le risque est grand qu\u2019il y ait des d\u00e9lais, que l\u2019audience sur le rejet sommaire se transforme en un d\u00e9bat sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente et que le juge statue par inadvertance sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate elle\u2011m\u00eame (Gill (C.S. C.\u2011B.), par. 24).\nC. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 et cadre d\u2019analyse pour le rejet sommaire\n[99] Bien que la norme de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb en soit au c\u0153ur, le cadre d\u2019analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour le rejet sommaire exige une approche souple afin de permettre les diff\u00e9rences entre les ressorts quant aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure criminelle et de favoriser une approche pratique et ax\u00e9e sur les principes.\n[100] Dans le cours normal d\u2019un proc\u00e8s criminel, une partie d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente \u2014 qui peut prendre de nombreuses formes et couvrir une myriade de sujets \u2014 et la partie adverse peut r\u00e9pliquer en pr\u00e9sentant une motion visant le rejet de cette requ\u00eate. Cela cr\u00e9e un cadre d\u2019analyse en deux volets, selon lequel les juges doivent (1) se prononcer sur la motion en rejet sommaire; et si elle est rejet\u00e9e, (2) statuer sur le fond de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente.\n[101] Les deux volets posent des questions diff\u00e9rentes, et font intervenir des consid\u00e9rations distinctes de m\u00eame que leurs propres normes juridiques. Au cours du premier volet, lorsque le juge statue sur la motion en rejet sommaire, la question est de savoir si, tenant pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits et les inf\u00e9rences all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, la partie r\u00e9clamant le rejet sommaire a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est manifestement frivole. Si l\u2019affaire fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire, les juges doivent alors, pendant le deuxi\u00e8me volet, au terme du voir\u2011dire, trancher la question ultime de savoir si la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente est accueillie ou rejet\u00e9e sur le fond : le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019est\u2011il acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de preuve applicable et a\u2011t\u2011il \u00e9tabli les faits n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 chacune des exigences l\u00e9gales qui sous\u2011tendent la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e pour la requ\u00eate en question?\n[102] Toutefois, le lien entre ces volets va au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019ordre dans lequel ils doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s car tout au long de l\u2019analyse, les juges devront se demander comment exercer leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et leurs pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance de sorte que justice soit rendue dans les circonstances. Les juges sont ma\u00eetres de la salle d\u2019audience et ne sont pas tenus d\u2019instruire toutes les motions ou de tenir des types pr\u00e9cis d\u2019audience. Ils peuvent, par exemple, prescrire la fa\u00e7on dont les motions ou le voir\u2011dire seront instruits, particuli\u00e8rement s\u2019il convient de le faire sur la base d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage ou sous une autre forme; d\u00e9cider de l\u2019ordre dans lequel les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s; restreindre un contre\u2011interrogatoire qui est ind\u00fbment r\u00e9p\u00e9titif, sans queue ni t\u00eate, pointilleux, trompeur ou d\u00e9pourvu de pertinence; imposer des limites raisonnables aux observations orales; ordonner des observations \u00e9crites; et diff\u00e9rer des d\u00e9cisions (Samaniego, par. 22; Felderhof, par. 57). Les pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance comprennent aussi la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures en mati\u00e8re de preuve ou de permettre la pr\u00e9sentation de nouvelles requ\u00eates en cours d\u2019instance lorsque cela est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice (R. c. J.J., 2022 CSC 28, par. 86). Une motion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat visant l\u2019obtention de directives commande aussi un exercice des pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance (J.J., par. 103\u2011105).\n[103] Ind\u00e9pendamment des normes juridiques distinctes appliqu\u00e9es lors des deux volets de ce processus, les juges devront se demander s\u2019ils proc\u00e9deront m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019instruction d\u2019une motion en rejet sommaire; de quelle fa\u00e7on la motion en rejet sommaire devrait \u00eatre instruite; et de quelle fa\u00e7on un \u00e9ventuel voir\u2011dire se d\u00e9roulera. Il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cisions discr\u00e9tionnaires prises en vertu de leurs pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[104] Lorsqu\u2019ils exercent leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019ils instruiront la motion en rejet sommaire, les juges doivent tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences et du contexte associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, ce qui comprend la question de savoir si elle peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement sommaire et la fa\u00e7on dont les droits \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable du requ\u00e9rant seront touch\u00e9s par une audience sur le rejet sommaire. De plus, les juges doivent se demander si la tenue d\u2019une audience sur le rejet sommaire repr\u00e9senterait une utilisation efficace du temps du tribunal ou si cette audience retarderait dans les faits le proc\u00e8s. Lorsque, par exemple, l\u2019audience sur le rejet sommaire prendrait presque autant de temps qu\u2019un voir\u2011dire sur la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente, il faut se demander si l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et le respect de l\u2019administration de la justice militent plus en faveur de l\u2019utilisation du temps du tribunal pour examiner le fond de la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente plut\u00f4t que de l\u2019affectation de ressources \u00e0 des questions qui lui sont pr\u00e9liminaires. Sur le plan uniquement de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, les juges ne peuvent se voir reprocher d\u2019avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 directement \u00e0 un voir\u2011dire lorsque l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate sur le fond prendrait le m\u00eame temps que la tenue d\u2019une audience sur le rejet sommaire. Les juges ne devraient tenir une audience de type Vukelich que lorsque cela est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de faire en sorte que le proc\u00e8s soit d\u2019une dur\u00e9e proportionn\u00e9e : un proc\u00e8s qui respecte le droit du requ\u00e9rant d\u2019\u00eatre entendu, qui sert l\u2019objectif de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s, qui \u00e9conomise en fait des ressources et qui \u00e9vite les d\u00e9lais indus.\n[105] Si les juges d\u00e9cident d\u2019instruire la motion en rejet sommaire, ils doivent aussi d\u00e9cider de quelle fa\u00e7on ils le feront. Les juges doivent s\u2019assurer que la motion est instruite d\u2019une mani\u00e8re juste et proportionn\u00e9e.\n[106] Si le rejet sommaire est refus\u00e9, les juges du proc\u00e8s seront aussi appel\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00e9tablir de quelle fa\u00e7on le voir\u2011dire sur la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente devrait se d\u00e9rouler, notamment s\u2019il devrait y avoir une audition de la preuve ou si l\u2019affaire peut \u00eatre instruite uniquement sur le fondement des arguments, d\u2019un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits ou d\u2019une combinaison de m\u00e9thodes. Permettre qu\u2019une requ\u00eate fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un voir\u2011dire n\u2019autorise pas les avocats \u00e0 plaider la requ\u00eate comme ils l\u2019entendent. Le temps et la latitude donn\u00e9s aux avocats pour faire valoir la requ\u00eate devraient \u00eatre proportionn\u00e9s : tout juste suffisants pour que la requ\u00eate soit trait\u00e9e \u00e9quitablement. Au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce point, il peut y avoir des d\u00e9lais indus.\n[107] L\u2019exercice de ces pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance commande non seulement des proc\u00e9dures proportionn\u00e9es qui mettent en \u00e9quilibre l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci, mais peut aussi exiger une analyse comparative servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019approche qui r\u00e9pond le mieux aux exigences et au caract\u00e8re \u00e9quitable d\u2019une situation donn\u00e9e. Les juges devraient garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner le rejet sommaire n\u2019est pas le seul outil dont ils disposent pour g\u00e9rer la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente et se demander si leurs autres pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance conviennent mieux pour g\u00e9rer la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente (Samaniego; Cody, par. 38). Les valeurs de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s pourraient \u00eatre mieux servies par la tenue d\u2019un voir\u2011dire sur la requ\u00eate sous\u2011jacente qui ne vise, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire judiciaire, que ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019examen \u00e9quitable de la teneur des all\u00e9gations. Lorsque les juges exercent leurs pouvoirs de gestion de l\u2019instance de cette fa\u00e7on, ils r\u00e9alisent les objectifs qui sous\u2011tendent ceux\u2011ci : faire en sorte que les proc\u00e8s se d\u00e9roulent de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable, efficace et efficiente (Samaniego, par. 21).\nIV. Application \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[108] Gardant ce cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, la juge a commis une erreur en rejetant sommairement les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures fond\u00e9es sur un abus de proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par MM. Johnston et Haevischer. Premi\u00e8rement, la juge n\u2019a pas tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits et inf\u00e9rences all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les avocats de la d\u00e9fense et les amici. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle a appliqu\u00e9 un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire trop peu rigoureux relativement au rejet sommaire, ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en balance \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de toute la preuve sur la port\u00e9e de la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et \u00e0 statuer sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures sur la base d\u2019un dossier partiel.\nA. D\u00e9faut de tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s\n[109] La juge a indiqu\u00e9 avec justesse qu\u2019elle devait reconna\u00eetre les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les requ\u00e9rants comme \u00e9tant av\u00e9r\u00e9s. Toutefois, en pratique, elle n\u2019a pas tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits et les inf\u00e9rences all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et, ce faisant, elle n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable.\n[110] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, et comme l\u2019a conclu la Cour d\u2019appel, la juge a commis une erreur dans ses motifs sous scell\u00e9s en appr\u00e9ciant la preuve, en tirant des inf\u00e9rences et en constatant des faits. La juge a eu tort d\u2019accepter l\u2019argument de la Couronne selon lequel les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9tayaient pas la th\u00e9orie des amici, et elle n\u2019a donc pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019argument de ceux\u2011ci de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable. La juge aurait d\u00fb tenir pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par les amici et n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb rejeter leurs inf\u00e9rences \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celles\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles.\n[111] J\u2019estime aussi que la juge a commis une erreur dans la d\u00e9cision publique en ne tenant pas pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s les inf\u00e9rences et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans trois cas.\n[112] Premi\u00e8rement, la juge n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb englobait les conditions abusives de d\u00e9tention. Elle a pris bonne note de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la d\u00e9fense portant que la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb [traduction] \u00ab comprenait l\u2019isolement des accus\u00e9s dans des conditions de d\u00e9tention visant \u00e0 les rendre particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00bb (jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 35; voir aussi par. 58 et 113). M\u00eame si la juge a accept\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations factuelles concernant les conditions de d\u00e9tention et l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les conditions \u00e9taient ordonn\u00e9es par la GRC, elle ne semble pas avoir accept\u00e9 le lien all\u00e9gu\u00e9 entre la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb et les conditions de d\u00e9tention. Cela est \u00e9vident dans la mesure o\u00f9 la juge a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb \u00e9tait elle\u2011m\u00eame abusive. Si la juge avait accept\u00e9 le lien all\u00e9gu\u00e9 entre les conditions de d\u00e9tention abusives et la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb, alors elle aurait accept\u00e9 l\u2019inf\u00e9rence portant que cette strat\u00e9gie \u00e9tait elle\u2011m\u00eame abusive. Au vu du dossier, cette inf\u00e9rence n\u2019\u00e9tait pas manifestement frivole. La juge a commis une erreur en n\u2019acceptant pas ces all\u00e9gations et inf\u00e9rences et elle n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les th\u00e8ses de MM. Johnston et Haevischer de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable.\n[113] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la juge n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il y avait un lien intentionnel entre la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb et la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible des quatre agents. Elle a reconnu que l\u2019effet de la strat\u00e9gie [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tait d\u2019encourager l\u2019attitude \u201ctout est permis\u201d [chez les quatre agents] \u00bb (par. 124). Les arguments des avocats de la d\u00e9fense allaient plus loin. Au cours des plaidoiries, les avocats de M. Johnston ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019ils voulaient contre\u2011interroger le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Attew et le surintendant superviseur afin d\u2019aider la cour \u00e0 comprendre [traduction] \u00ab comment cette strat\u00e9gie a pris naissance, de quelle fa\u00e7on elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e et par qui, et dans quelle mesure elle a influenc\u00e9 la conduite de ces agents \u00bb (d.a., vol. XV, p. 263). L\u2019all\u00e9gation portait que la strat\u00e9gie permettait explicitement ou implicitement la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible; l\u2019inf\u00e9rence correspondante est que la strat\u00e9gie \u00e9tait en soi abusive. Par exemple, les requ\u00eates soulevaient la possibilit\u00e9 que la strat\u00e9gie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans le but que les agents fassent changer de camp les t\u00e9moins prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en se livrant \u00e0 des rapports sexuels avec ceux\u2011ci. Comme l\u2019ont indiqu\u00e9 les avocats de M. Johnston dans son avis de requ\u00eate, un document r\u00e9sumant la strat\u00e9gie fait \u00e9tat du fait que les [traduction] \u00ab petites amies \u00bb peuvent \u00eatre vuln\u00e9rables et aborde la \u00ab cr\u00e9ation d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00bb dans l\u2019entourage des t\u00e9moins vis\u00e9s, notamment \u00ab l\u2019infid\u00e9lit\u00e9 \u00bb (d.a., vol. XIV, p. 14 et 31\u201132). La juge n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les requ\u00eates de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable en concluant que la strat\u00e9gie de \u00ab changement de camp des t\u00e9moins \u00bb ne faisait qu\u2019encourager les agents \u00e0 avoir une conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible.\n[114] Troisi\u00e8mement, et enfin, la juge a conclu que les autres cas d\u2019inconduite polici\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par MM. Johnston et Haevischer ne repr\u00e9sentaient pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure selon la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du test \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos. Bien que la juge puisse avoir tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait que ces pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate ont eu lieu, elle a ensuite conclu que le traitement par les policiers de certains fonds, t\u00e9moins, mandataires, indicateurs et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne pouvaient pas \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du test \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos. En consid\u00e9rant les arguments \u00e0 leur sens le plus fort, je conclus que l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ces pratiques repr\u00e9sentaient un abus de proc\u00e9dure n\u2019\u00e9tait pas manifestement frivole : aucun vice fondamental n\u2019entachait l\u2019all\u00e9gation.\nB. Application d\u2019un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire trop peu rigoureux\n[115] La juge a commis une erreur de droit en appliquant le mauvais crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire relativement au rejet sommaire. Bien qu\u2019elle ne disposait pas des pr\u00e9sents motifs \u00e9tablissant le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la \u00ab frivolit\u00e9 manifeste \u00bb, elle a not\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que la question primordiale \u00e9tait de savoir si les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction sur le fond. Toutefois, dans son analyse, elle a appliqu\u00e9 un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire plus ax\u00e9 sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 relativement au rejet sommaire, lequel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment rigoureux.\n[116] Une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre manifestement frivole \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re ou la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du test \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos. Toutefois, tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des graves all\u00e9gations d\u2019abus avanc\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants. Par cons\u00e9quent, une fois que la juge a conclu (1) que les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sentaient des all\u00e9gations concernant la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible des agents qui choquerait la conscience de la collectivit\u00e9 ou le sens du franc\u2011jeu et de la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; (2) que l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice subirait un pr\u00e9judice si les proc\u00e9dures se poursuivaient; et (3) qu\u2019aucune r\u00e9paration, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, ne pourrait corriger l\u2019atteinte, il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre clair que les requ\u00eates n\u2019\u00e9taient pas frivoles, encore moins manifestement frivoles. Les conclusions portant qu\u2019il y avait des abus graves en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et qu\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tait la seule r\u00e9paration possible suffisaient pour \u00e9tablir que les requ\u00eates n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles.\n[117] En cons\u00e9quence, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que la juge proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la mise en balance pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du test \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos. En proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 cette mise en balance, la juge a commis une autre erreur en ce qu\u2019elle se trouvait \u00e0 trancher la question ultime sur la base d\u2019un dossier incomplet. Elle a effectu\u00e9 la mise en balance apr\u00e8s avoir rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 tort l\u2019argument selon lequel certaines des all\u00e9gations correspondaient \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du test \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos, faisant ainsi d\u00e9vier le processus de mise en balance. De plus, j\u2019aimerais signaler qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en balance, il faut faire preuve de prudence lorsque l\u2019on se demande dans quelle mesure une r\u00e9primande judiciaire faite dans le cas d\u2019une autre personne (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans le cadre de la demande en habeas corpus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Bacon au juge McEwan) peut aider \u00e0 corriger les abus personnels all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par d\u2019autres personnes devant un autre tribunal.\n[118] De plus, la juge a effectu\u00e9 la mise en balance lorsqu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas \u00eatre certaine qu\u2019elle avait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 toute la preuve n\u00e9cessaire. Dans les affaires comme la pr\u00e9sente, qui porte sur la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de l\u2019\u00c9tat, il existe une possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle que la port\u00e9e de la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible soit inconnue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du rejet sommaire et qu\u2019elle soit bien plus grave que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Lorsque la communication de la preuve au proc\u00e8s n\u2019est pas pertinente quant aux questions que soul\u00e8ve la requ\u00eate, une communication distincte sera vraisemblablement n\u00e9cessaire pour faire en sorte que tous les documents pertinents pour la requ\u00eate soient produits. De plus, il se peut que la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible ne soit r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e qu\u2019au moyen du contre\u2011interrogatoire. Comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour d\u2019appel, certaines all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9fense \u2014 comme celles formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u2014 [traduction] \u00ab sont telles qu\u2019elles ne peuvent vraisemblablement \u00eatre \u00e9tablies qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire \u00bb (par. 404; voir aussi R. c. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, 44 C.R. (7th) 83, par. 64). La Cour a en outre reconnu que le contre\u2011interrogatoire est un outil d\u2019une importance cruciale et qu\u2019il est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re (voir, p. ex., R. c. Lyttle, 2004 CSC 5, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 193, par. 41; R. c. Osolin, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 595, p. 663; R. c. Shearing, 2002 CSC 58, [2002] 3 R.C.S. 33, par. 76; R. c. N.S., 2012 CSC 72, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 726, par. 64).\n[119] La Couronne d\u00e9crit cette issue comme \u00e9tant pr\u00e9occupante et affirme que le fait d\u2019exiger un voir\u2011dire une fois que les deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes du test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos d\u00e9montrent que la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas manifestement frivole restreint ind\u00fbment le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du juge de rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate, de sorte que des ressources judiciaires seront gaspill\u00e9es. La pr\u00e9occupation concernant le gaspillage des ressources judiciaires est injustifi\u00e9e, compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences possibles. Rejeter sommairement une requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures sans disposer de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve porte atteinte au droit de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable et mine la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice. Dans les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, des abus de la plus haute importance peuvent \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9s : le fait de rejeter sommairement celles\u2011ci, sans que le requ\u00e9rant ait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve visant \u00e0 \u00e9tayer ses pr\u00e9tentions, risque d\u2019aggraver les torts caus\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00c9tat au requ\u00e9rant. En outre, ce r\u00e9sultat ne restreint pas ind\u00fbment le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du juge dans le rare cas o\u00f9 la mise en balance de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos pourrait convenir \u00e0 la motion en rejet sommaire; il ne fait que reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait manifestement frivole aux premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tapes du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Babos et, dans les circonstances, n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e sommairement.\n[120] Enfin, je conviens avec la Cour d\u2019appel que la juge a d\u00e9riv\u00e9 vers une d\u00e9cision sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 ultime des requ\u00eates. En concluant qu\u2019elle n\u2019ordonnerait pas un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, la juge a mis l\u2019accent sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 et sur l\u2019issue finale plut\u00f4t que sur la question de savoir si les requ\u00eates \u00e9taient manifestement frivoles. Ce faisant, elle a appliqu\u00e9 un crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire trop souple pour le rejet sommaire et a confondu l\u2019analyse requise pour l\u2019audience sur le rejet sommaire avec celle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tenue de faire lors du voir\u2011dire lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[121] En terminant, la Couronne souligne que son observation est non pas qu\u2019un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures ne pourrait jamais \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 pour de telles infractions graves, mais plut\u00f4t que dans ces circonstances pr\u00e9cises, au terme d\u2019une mise en balance, un arr\u00eat ne devrait pas \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures devrait ou non \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la gravit\u00e9 des infractions et de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019abus, je souscris \u00e0 la proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel selon laquelle aucune cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019infractions n\u2019\u00e9chappe \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nV. Conclusion\n[122] Lorsque le cadre d\u2019analyse d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment est appliqu\u00e9, il est \u00e9vident que les requ\u00eates en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures n\u2019\u00e9taient pas manifestement frivoles et n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es sommairement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette le pourvoi. Compte tenu du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Johnston, seule la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Haevischer sera renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique en vue d\u2019une instruction lors d\u2019un voir\u2011dire. Monsieur Haevischer aura l\u2019occasion de plaider toutes les all\u00e9gations. La Couronne, dans ses observations, a reconnu que M. Haevischer devrait avoir [traduction] \u00ab la chance de plaider \u00e0 nouveau toutes les questions \u00bb si l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait renvoy\u00e9e (transcription, p. 20). Cela dit, je laisse au juge de l\u2019audience le soin de d\u00e9cider, en vertu de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, comment le voir\u2011dire doit se d\u00e9rouler.\n[123] Dans mes motifs, je ne me suis pas appuy\u00e9e sur les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admis par la Cour d\u2019appel et, pour cette raison, je ne tranche pas la question de savoir si la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en admettant ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et, s\u2019ils sont admis, l\u2019importance qui devrait leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, sont des questions sur lesquelles se prononcera le juge instruisant la requ\u00eate en arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures de M. Haevischer.\nPourvoi rejet\u00e9.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant : Ministry of Attorney General \u2014 Criminal Appeals & Special Prosecutions, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Cody Rae Haevischer : Buck & Dlab Law, Vancouver; Thirkell & Company, Abbotsford (C.-B.).\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Matthew James Johnston : Martland & Saulnier, Vancouver; Pringle Chivers Sparks Teskey, Vancouver; Desbarats Law Corporation, Vancouver.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenante la directrice des poursuites p\u00e9nales : Service des poursuites p\u00e9nales du Canada, Halifax.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario : Minist\u00e8re du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, Bureau des avocats de la Couronne \u2014 Droit criminel, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association of Ontario : Henein Hutchison, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society : MN Law, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Criminal Trial Lawyers\u2019 Association : Dawson Duckett Garcia & Johnson, Edmonton; Purser Law, Edmonton.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia : Peck and Company, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intervenante l\u2019Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles : McCarthy T\u00e9trault, Toronto.\n* Le juge Brown n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au dispositif final du jugement.\n[1] Pour \u00e9viter la confusion dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, j\u2019utiliserai le terme \u00ab requ\u00eate \u00bb ou \u00ab requ\u00eate sous-jacente \u00bb pour d\u00e9signer une requ\u00eate sous-jacente et \u00ab motion \u00bb pour d\u00e9signer la demande de rejet sommaire. De plus, bien que les termes \u00ab voir-dire \u00bb et \u00ab audition de la preuve \u00bb soient souvent utilis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on interchangeable dans la jurisprudence, j\u2019utilise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00ab voir-dire \u00bb pour parler de l\u2019audience distincte qui a lieu \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019un proc\u00e8s afin qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en particulier soit tranch\u00e9e. J\u2019utilise \u00ab audition de la preuve \u00bb pour parler de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage de vive voix au cours d\u2019un voir-dire. Ce dernier peut comprendre une audition de la preuve, mais on peut aussi y proc\u00e9der sur la base d\u2019un dossier \u00e9crit seulement, ou uniquement sur le fondement des observations des avocats (R. c. Kematch, 2010 MBCA 18, 251 Man. R. (2d) 191, par. 43; voir aussi R. c. Garnier, 2017 NSSC 239, par. 13 (CanLII)).

Un proc\u00e8s avec jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 pour novembre 2018, d\u00e9lai qui respectait le plafond \u00e9tabli dans Jordan. Toutefois, des changements touchant la preuve du minist\u00e8re public risquaient d\u2019entra\u00eener un ajournement de l\u2019instance. La d\u00e9fense a offert de consentir \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s devant juge seul afin que l\u2019instance puisse se terminer en de\u00e7\u00e0 du plafond fix\u00e9 dans Jordan, mais le minist\u00e8re public a refus\u00e9. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a alors propos\u00e9 une date de proc\u00e8s en juin 2019, mais l\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible. Le proc\u00e8s a en cons\u00e9quence d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 28 octobre et s\u2019est ultimement termin\u00e9 le 28 novembre 2019. L\u2019accus\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures pour cause de violation du droit d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable que lui garantit l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte . Le juge du proc\u00e8s a refus\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures, m\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai net d\u2019environ 35 mois d\u00e9passait le plafond prescrit dans Jordan. Appliquant une mesure transitoire exceptionnelle, il a conclu que les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient raisonnablement fond\u00e9es sur le droit tel qu\u2019il existait avant que Jordan ne soit rendu. L\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de plusieurs infractions et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont confirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9, concluant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu violation de l\u2019al. 11b).\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli, les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 sont \u00e9cart\u00e9es et l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures est ordonn\u00e9.\nAucune mesure transitoire exceptionnelle ne s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le d\u00e9lai net d\u2019environ 35 mois est un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable, contraire \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte . Premi\u00e8rement, le juge du proc\u00e8s a fait erreur en concluant que le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 par le fait que les parties se sont fond\u00e9es raisonnablement sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit ant\u00e9rieur. Les parties ne pouvaient s\u2019\u00eatre raisonnablement fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision en juillet 2016, et elles ne l\u2019ont pas fait, puisqu\u2019elles ont consciemment pr\u00e9vu la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s respectant le plafond fix\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat. Dans le cas de la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement au prononc\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan, il aurait fallu plut\u00f4t s\u2019attacher \u00e0 la question de savoir si les parties et les tribunaux avaient dispos\u00e9 de suffisamment de temps pour s\u2019adapter. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le d\u00e9lai exc\u00e9dant le plafond \u00e9tait d\u00fb non pas \u00e0 un manque de temps emp\u00eachant les parties et le syst\u00e8me de s\u2019adapter, mais au refus du minist\u00e8re public de consentir \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s devant juge seul, et ce, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 averti des cons\u00e9quences possibles du d\u00e9lai, et le fait que l\u2019affaire Jordan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de deux ans et demi auparavant. Enfin, il est injuste et d\u00e9raisonnable de qualifier la totalit\u00e9 de la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juin et octobre 2019 de d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. Il n\u2019existe pas de r\u00e8gle absolue suivant laquelle tout d\u00e9lai qui s\u2019\u00e9coule, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re date disponible, post\u00e9rieurement au rejet par un avocat de la d\u00e9fense d\u2019une date de proc\u00e8s propos\u00e9e par le tribunal, doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. Toutes les circonstances pertinentes devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9terminer comment la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partie entre les diff\u00e9rents acteurs.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s : R. c.

Pourvoi accueilli.\nSaman Wickramasinghe et Parmbir Gill, pour l\u2019appelant.\nTracy Kozlowski et Andrew Hotke, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs de jugement de la Cour rendus par\nLes juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Rowe \u2014\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel de plein droit interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario qui a confirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es par un jury contre l\u2019appelant pour homicide involontaire coupable, d\u00e9charge d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu dans l\u2019intention de blesser et possession sans permis d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte charg\u00e9e. Deux moyens d\u2019appel sont invoqu\u00e9s : premi\u00e8rement, une violation du droit garanti \u00e0 l\u2019appelant par l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable qui justifierait un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et, deuxi\u00e8mement, une erreur dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 au jury qui exigerait la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Comme nous sommes d\u2019avis que le premier moyen est d\u00e9terminant, nous nous abstenons d\u2019examiner le second.\n[2] Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 l\u2019origine des accusations ont eu lieu le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2015. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 de diverses infractions le lendemain. L\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire dans le cadre d\u2019un proc\u00e8s avec jury a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e \u00e0 novembre 2018, date qui, comme en convenaient les deux parties, respecterait le plafond \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Jordan, 2016 CSC 27, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 631. Toutefois, la veille du proc\u00e8s, des changements touchant la preuve du minist\u00e8re public risquaient d\u2019entra\u00eener un ajournement de l\u2019instance. La d\u00e9fense a offert de consentir \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s devant juge seul, mais le minist\u00e8re public a refus\u00e9. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que si ce dernier avait accept\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire soit instruite par un juge seul, comme cela \u00e9tait propos\u00e9, le proc\u00e8s se serait termin\u00e9 en de\u00e7\u00e0 du plafond fix\u00e9 dans Jordan. En raison du refus du minist\u00e8re public, le juge du proc\u00e8s a propos\u00e9 une date de proc\u00e8s en juin 2019, mais l\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible. La tenue du proc\u00e8s a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2019; il a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 28 octobre et s\u2019est ultimement termin\u00e9 le 28 novembre.\n[3] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a calcul\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai total \u00e9tait d\u2019environ 47 mois et demi. Il a d\u00e9duit un peu plus de 10 mois pour le d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense avant le renvoi \u00e0 proc\u00e8s, et un autre mois et demi en tant que circonstance exceptionnelle distincte li\u00e9e aux difficult\u00e9s relatives \u00e0 la preuve du minist\u00e8re public. Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la complexit\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire ne justifiait pas un d\u00e9lai additionnel, le juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai net \u00e9tait d\u2019environ 35 mois.\n[4] M\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai net d\u00e9passait le plafond prescrit dans Jordan, le juge du proc\u00e8s a refus\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures. Appliquant une mesure transitoire exceptionnelle, il a conclu que les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient raisonnablement fond\u00e9es sur le droit tel qu\u2019il existait avant que Jordan ne soit rendu. Il a \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que, bien que les parties aient \u00e9t\u00e9 au fait de cet arr\u00eat, elles n\u2019avaient pas encore une [traduction] \u00ab compr\u00e9hension approfondie des enseignements de l\u2019affaire Jordan \u00bb (2019 ONSC 320, par. 277 (CanLII)).\n[5] Avec \u00e9gards, le juge du proc\u00e8s a fait erreur en statuant qu\u2019une mesure transitoire exceptionnelle s\u2019appliquait, et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont commis une erreur en confirmant sa d\u00e9cision.\n[6] Premi\u00e8rement, les parties ne pouvaient s\u2019\u00eatre raisonnablement fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision en juillet 2016. De fait, les parties ne se sont pas fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 Jordan, puisqu\u2019elles ont consciemment pr\u00e9vu la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s respectant le plafond fix\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat. Au contraire, comme a conclu notre Cour dans R. c. Cody, 2017 CSC 31, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 659, dans le cas des p\u00e9riodes \u00e9coul\u00e9es post\u00e9rieurement au prononc\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan, il \u00ab faut plut\u00f4t s\u2019attacher \u00e0 la question de savoir si les parties et les tribunaux ont dispos\u00e9 de suffisamment de temps pour s\u2019adapter \u00bb (par. 71). Comme l\u2019a fait observer le juge d\u2019appel Nordheimer, en dissidence, [traduction] \u00ab seule une tr\u00e8s petite portion du d\u00e9lai en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9e avant la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Jordan, et la majeure partie, voire la totalit\u00e9, de ce d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense \u00bb (2022 ONCA 229, 161 O.R. (3d) 161, par. 143). En cons\u00e9quence, le juge du proc\u00e8s a fait erreur en concluant que, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab justifi\u00e9 par le fait que les parties se sont fond\u00e9es raisonnablement sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit ant\u00e9rieur \u00bb (par. 278).\n[7] Deuxi\u00e8mement, comme l\u2019a \u00e0 juste titre soulign\u00e9 le juge d\u2019appel Nordheimer, le minist\u00e8re public a eu [traduction] \u00ab amplement le temps \u00bb de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Jordan (par. 148). Le d\u00e9lai exc\u00e9dant le plafond \u00e9tait d\u00fb non pas \u00e0 un manque de temps emp\u00eachant le syst\u00e8me d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les d\u00e9lais institutionnels enracin\u00e9s, mais au refus du minist\u00e8re public de consentir \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s devant juge seul, et ce, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 averti des cons\u00e9quences possibles du d\u00e9lai, et le fait que l\u2019affaire Jordan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de deux ans et demi auparavant. N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du minist\u00e8re public, le proc\u00e8s se serait tenu en de\u00e7\u00e0 du plafond. Cela d\u00e9montre clairement que les parties et le syst\u00e8me avaient dispos\u00e9 de suffisamment de temps pour s\u2019adapter.\n[8] Nous concluons qu\u2019aucune mesure transitoire exceptionnelle ne s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il en r\u00e9sulte que le d\u00e9lai net d\u2019environ 35 mois est un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable, contraire \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11b) de la Charte .\n[9] \u00c0 l\u2019instar des juges majoritaires et du juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel, nous rejetons la r\u00e8gle [traduction] \u00ab absolue \u00bb que sugg\u00e8re le minist\u00e8re public et suivant laquelle tout d\u00e9lai qui s\u2019\u00e9coule, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re date disponible, post\u00e9rieurement au rejet par un avocat de la d\u00e9fense d\u2019une date de proc\u00e8s propos\u00e9e par le tribunal, doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la juge d\u2019appel van Rensburg et du juge d\u2019appel Tulloch, maintenant juge en chef de l\u2019Ontario, au par. 56, voulant que cette approche soit incompatible avec ce que notre Cour consid\u00e8re comme un d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense. Les d\u00e9lais imputables \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense comprennent \u00ab les retards caus\u00e9s uniquement ou directement par sa conduite \u00bb ou \u00ab les p\u00e9riodes que la d\u00e9fense renonce \u00e0 invoquer \u00bb (Jordan, par. 66). De plus, \u00ab les p\u00e9riodes durant lesquelles le tribunal et le minist\u00e8re public ne sont pas disponibles ne constituent pas un d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense m\u00eame si l\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense n\u2019est pas disponible lui non plus \u00bb (par. 64). Toutes les circonstances pertinentes devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9terminer comment la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partie entre les diff\u00e9rents acteurs (R. c. Boulanger, 2022 CSC 2, par. 8). Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec les juges majoritaires et le juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il est injuste et d\u00e9raisonnable de qualifier la totalit\u00e9 de la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juin et octobre 2019 de d\u00e9lai imputable \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense (par. 59 et 136).\n[10] En cons\u00e9quence, nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel, d\u2019\u00e9carter les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et d\u2019ordonner l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures.\nPourvoi accueilli.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant : Ursel Phillips Fellows Hopkinson, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 : Minist\u00e8re du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, Bureau des avocats de la Couronne \u2014 Droit criminel, Toronto."

F\u20116.3, art. 38, 40.\n\u00c0 l\u2019issue d\u2019un mariage de trois ans, l\u2019\u00e9pouse et l\u2019\u00e9poux ont sign\u00e9 un accord de s\u00e9paration qui pr\u00e9voyait essentiellement que chaque partie conserverait les biens qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient en son nom et renoncerait \u00e0 tout droit sur les biens de l\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du foyer familial et des objets m\u00e9nagers. L\u2019accord, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9pouse, a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une rencontre avec deux amis des parties qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins de sa signature. Aucune information financi\u00e8re n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e entre les parties, et ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a obtenu de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants avant de signer l\u2019accord. Pr\u00e8s de 17 mois apr\u00e8s que l\u2019\u00e9pouse eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divorce, l\u2019\u00e9poux a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate reconventionnelle et r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le partage des biens familiaux, soutenant qu\u2019il avait sign\u00e9 l\u2019accord sans avoir consult\u00e9 d\u2019avocat et sous la contrainte. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019accord n\u2019\u00e9tait pas obligatoire et a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder quelque importance que ce soit. Il a plut\u00f4t proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9galisation des biens familiaux en vertu de la loi de la Saskatchewan relative aux biens familiaux, la Loi sur les biens familiaux (\u00ab LBF \u00bb), et a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de verser \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux un paiement d\u2019\u00e9galisation net d\u2019environ 90 000 $. La Cour d\u2019appel a annul\u00e9 la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux effectu\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et conclu que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait obligatoire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 le cadre \u00e9labor\u00e9 par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin c. Miglin, 2003 CSC 24, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 303, et conclu qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019accorder beaucoup d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019accord. Compte tenu de la valeur des biens familiaux \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e de l\u2019accord, la Cour d\u2019appel a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux de verser environ 5 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli.\nLes tribunaux devraient de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale encourager et favoriser les contrats conjugaux, dans les limites permises par le l\u00e9gislateur, en l\u2019absence de raison imp\u00e9rieuse de rejeter l\u2019accord. Cette d\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u00e9coule de la reconnaissance du fait que l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance \u00e9conomique, l\u2019autonomie et la recherche d\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif sont des objectifs importants dans le contexte du droit de la famille. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019accord intervenu entre l\u2019\u00e9pouse et l\u2019\u00e9poux \u00e9tait obligatoire. Il \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quitable, compte tenu des crit\u00e8res et des objectifs de la LBF. Il y a lieu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition du foyer familial et des objets m\u00e9nagers en fonction de leur valeur \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s, op\u00e9ration qui se solde pour l\u2019\u00e9pouse par une dette de 43 382,63 $ envers l\u2019\u00e9poux.\nLes contrats conjugaux pr\u00e9sentent des avantages et pr\u00e9occupations uniques. D\u2019une part, les parties sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement mieux plac\u00e9es que les tribunaux pour comprendre les besoins et circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques de leur rapports priv\u00e9s. D\u2019autre part, les parties \u00e0 des contrats conjugaux sont particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 l\u2019injustice et \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation, en raison de l\u2019environnement unique dans lequel ces contrats sont n\u00e9goci\u00e9s et conclus. La jurisprudence de la Cour sur les contrats conjugaux, y compris l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, rappelle aux tribunaux qu\u2019ils doivent aborder les contrats conjugaux avec prudence et tenir compte des importantes protections proc\u00e9durales qui contribuent \u00e0 garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord conclu. En outre, bien que la Cour soutienne depuis longtemps la libert\u00e9 des parties de r\u00e9gler leurs affaires familiales en priv\u00e9, on ne saurait permettre que le respect de cette libert\u00e9 fasse \u00e9chec \u00e0 des objectifs d\u2019ordre public consacr\u00e9s dans la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droit de la famille. Les tribunaux doivent aborder les r\u00e8glements en droit de la famille en vue de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre, d\u2019une part, les valeurs que repr\u00e9sentent l\u2019autonomie des parties contractantes et la certitude et, d\u2019autre part, le souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Essentiellement, les tribunaux doivent examiner les contrats conjugaux en faisant montre d\u2019une sensibilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s qui peuvent exister dans le contexte du droit de la famille, sans pr\u00e9sumer que les conjoints n\u2019avaient pas la capacit\u00e9 de contracter simplement parce que l\u2019accord a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9 dans des conditions stressantes sur le plan \u00e9motionnel.\nBien que les tribunaux puissent d\u00e9gager de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux utiles pour les guider dans l\u2019examen des contrats conjugaux, cet arr\u00eat n\u2019est pas, et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre, un cadre d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale permettant aux tribunaux de traiter tous les types de contrats conjugaux. Le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, qui s\u2019inscrivait dans un contexte l\u00e9gislatif diff\u00e9rent, ne devrait pas \u00eatre transpos\u00e9 dans une loi provinciale sur les biens familiaux. Au contraire, l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du tribunal est tributaire de la loi applicable, et les diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre le partage des biens et les aliments entre \u00e9poux, les pr\u00e9occupations relatives au partage des pouvoirs et les caract\u00e9ristiques distinctives de lois particuli\u00e8res commandent une m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse adapt\u00e9e.\n\u00c0 l\u2019instar d\u2019autres lois provinciales sur les biens familiaux, la LBF pr\u00e9voit, au d\u00e9part, une pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition \u00e9gale, mais permet aux conjoints de se soustraire au r\u00e9gime dans certaines circonstances. En particulier, la LBF reconna\u00eet deux types de contrats conjugaux en mati\u00e8re de biens familiaux. Les \u00ab contrats familiaux \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 38 de la LBF sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutoires s\u2019ils respectent les formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 cet article, notamment l\u2019obligation pour chaque conjoint de reconna\u00eetre formellement, devant un avocat ind\u00e9pendant, qu\u2019il est conscient de la nature et de l\u2019effet des modalit\u00e9s du contrat. Le tribunal peut quand m\u00eame tenir compte d\u2019un contrat conjugal qui ne respecte pas les exigences l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 38 et, en vertu de l\u2019art. 40, lui donner l\u2019importance qu\u2019il estime raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que la LBF pr\u00e9voie au d\u00e9part une pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales, l\u2019existence d\u2019un accord \u00e9crit intervenu entre les conjoints est un facteur important pour d\u00e9terminer si, dans les circonstances, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales.\nPour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il doit tenir compte d\u2019un accord qui ne constitue pas un contrat familial vis\u00e9 par la LBF, le tribunal devrait \u00eatre sensible \u00e0 toute pr\u00e9occupation concernant la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord au regard des principes ordinaires du droit des contrats. En supposant que l\u2019accord soit valide, l\u2019attention du tribunal se porte ensuite sur la question de savoir si cet accord m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019\u00e9galisation. Le tribunal doit appr\u00e9cier l\u2019accord du point de vue de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, lorsque des pr\u00e9occupations de ce genre sont soulev\u00e9es. En examinant l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation pour y d\u00e9celer des pressions indues ou l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un rapport de force in\u00e9gal ou d\u2019une autre vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9, le juge peut d\u00e9terminer si les parties ont conclu l\u2019accord librement et en \u00e9tant conscientes de son sens et de ses effets. Bien que des mesures de protection telle la communication de la situation financi\u00e8re et l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants offrent une protection essentielle dans le contexte du droit de la famille, elles ne sont pas exig\u00e9es par la loi et leur absence, sans plus, ne permet pas de remettre n\u00e9cessairement en question l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le respect de l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des conjoints consacr\u00e9 tant dans la l\u00e9gislation que dans la jurisprudence, il y a lieu de tenir s\u00e9rieusement compte d\u2019un accord, \u00e0 moins que le tribunal ne soit convaincu que l\u2019accord d\u00e9coule d\u2019un processus de n\u00e9gociation injuste.\nUne fois convaincu qu\u2019il y a lieu de tenir compte de l\u2019accord, le tribunal peut en \u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 substantielle afin de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019importance qu\u2019il y a lieu de lui accorder pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens. En fin de compte, l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un accord lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de rendre une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens d\u00e9pend de la mesure dans laquelle le contenu concorde avec ce qui est juste et \u00e9quitable dans les circonstances, eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux facteurs du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. Les objectifs et les crit\u00e8res de la loi applicable fournissent un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence objectif permettant d\u2019\u00e9valuer la compr\u00e9hension subjective qu\u2019ont les parties de ce qui est \u00e9quitable et de limiter le risque qu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9cartent de fa\u00e7on marqu\u00e9e des objectifs d\u2019ordre public exprim\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019accord \u00e9tait obligatoire et il n\u2019existait aucune pr\u00e9occupation fond\u00e9e quant \u00e0 son \u00e9quit\u00e9. L\u2019accord est court et peu compliqu\u00e9, et il refl\u00e8te l\u2019intention des parties d\u2019effectuer une rupture nette de leur partenariat. Une absence de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants et de communication formelle peut nuire \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un choix \u00e9clair\u00e9, mais elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas troublante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, parce que l\u2019\u00e9poux ne pouvait faire \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice en r\u00e9sultant : personne n\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de ces garanties avait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord. Il y avait donc lieu de tenir s\u00e9rieusement compte de l\u2019accord, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il refl\u00e8te la conception qu\u2019avaient les parties d\u2019un partage \u00e9quitable des biens dans le contexte de leur relation au moment de la s\u00e9paration. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait erreur en concluant que l\u2019accord ne liait pas les parties et en ne tenant pas compte de son contenu pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des biens, et bien que la Cour d\u2019appel ait conclu qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019accorder une grande importance \u00e0 l\u2019accord, les biens familiaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galis\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 des parties, entra\u00eenant ainsi une injustice. Outre le foyer familial et les objets m\u00e9nagers, la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales des biens familiaux selon la LBF entra\u00eene une injustice. Les parties \u00e9taient les mieux plac\u00e9es pour organiser les biens familiaux limit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant de leur bref mariage et, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, la solution la plus juste et la plus \u00e9quitable consiste \u00e0 donner effet \u00e0 leur accord peu compliqu\u00e9.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eats examin\u00e9s : Miglin c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Dans le contexte du droit de la famille, les accords priv\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentent des avantages et pr\u00e9occupations uniques. D\u2019une part, il convient d\u2019encourager les parties \u00e0 faire montre d\u2019autonomie en r\u00e9glant entre elles leurs affaires familiales, car elles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement mieux plac\u00e9es que les tribunaux pour comprendre les besoins et circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques de leur rapports priv\u00e9s. D\u2019autre part, les parties \u00e0 des contrats conjugaux sont particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 l\u2019injustice et \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation, en raison de l\u2019environnement unique dans lequel ces contrats sont n\u00e9goci\u00e9s et conclus. Par cons\u00e9quent, la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droit de la famille autorise normalement les juges \u00e0 examiner les contrats conjugaux. Le degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un tel contrat aux termes de la loi applicable d\u00e9pend souvent de la question de savoir s\u2019il respecte certaines formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales, comme l\u2019obtention par chacune des parties de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants.\n[2] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir comment les tribunaux devraient aborder et appr\u00e9cier un contrat conjugal qui vise cens\u00e9ment \u00e0 soustraire les parties \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime provincial de partage des biens familiaux, mais ne satisfait pas aux exigences l\u00e9gales qui permettraient \u00e0 ce contrat de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. En particulier, le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi pose la question de savoir si le cadre d\u2019analyse que notre Cour a \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin c. Miglin, 2003 CSC 24, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 303 \u2014 qui portait sur les aliments entre \u00e9poux sous le r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la Loi sur le divorce , L.R.C. 1985, c. 3 (2 e suppl .) \u2014 s\u2019applique \u00e0 juste titre \u00e0 un tel contrat.\n[3] La jurisprudence de notre Cour sur les contrats conjugaux, y compris l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, reconna\u00eet que la rupture d\u2019une relation conjugale est souvent marqu\u00e9e par des bouleversements \u00e9motionnels et qu\u2019elle peut donner lieu \u00e0 des vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s qui nuisent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de ces contrats. L\u2019impact d\u00e9vastateur d\u2019une s\u00e9paration signifie que les parties \u00e0 un accord de s\u00e9paration peuvent n\u2019\u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab pas en mesure de prendre des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 caract\u00e8re permanent et ex\u00e9cutoire \u00bb (J. D. Payne et M. A. Payne, Dealing with Family Law : A Canadian Guide (1993), p. 78, cit\u00e9 dans Miglin, par. 74). L\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin et les arr\u00eats qui l\u2019ont suivi rappellent donc aux tribunaux qu\u2019ils doivent aborder les contrats conjugaux avec prudence et tenir compte des importantes protections proc\u00e9durales qui contribuent \u00e0 garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord conclu. En outre, bien que notre Cour soutienne depuis longtemps la libert\u00e9 des parties de r\u00e9gler leurs affaires familiales en priv\u00e9, on ne saurait permettre que le respect de cette libert\u00e9 fasse \u00e9chec \u00e0 des objectifs d\u2019ordre public consacr\u00e9s dans la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droit de la famille. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour d\u00e9cider de l\u2019importance \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 un accord, le juge charg\u00e9 de la r\u00e9vision examine g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation et le contenu de l\u2019accord, conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif.\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019instar d\u2019autres lois provinciales sur les biens familiaux, la Loi sur les biens familiaux, L.S. 1997, c. F\u20116.3 (LBF ou Loi), de la Saskatchewan pr\u00e9voit, au d\u00e9part, une pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition \u00e9gale, mais permet aux conjoints de se soustraire au r\u00e9gime dans certaines circonstances (les dispositions pertinentes de la LBF sont reproduites en annexe des pr\u00e9sents motifs). En particulier, la LBF reconna\u00eet deux types de contrats conjugaux en mati\u00e8re de biens familiaux. Les \u00ab contrats familiaux \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 38 de la Loi sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutoires s\u2019ils respectent les formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 cet article, notamment l\u2019obligation pour chaque conjoint de reconna\u00eetre formellement, devant un avocat ind\u00e9pendant, qu\u2019il est conscient de la nature et de l\u2019effet des modalit\u00e9s du contrat. Le tribunal peut quand m\u00eame tenir compte d\u2019un contrat conjugal qui ne respecte pas les exigences l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 38 et, en vertu de l\u2019art. 40, lui donner \u00ab l\u2019importance qu\u2019il estime raisonnable \u00bb. Bien que la Loi pr\u00e9voie au d\u00e9part une pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales, l\u2019existence d\u2019un accord \u00e9crit intervenu entre les conjoints est un facteur important pour d\u00e9terminer si, dans les circonstances, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales (voir le par. 21(1) et l\u2019al. 21(3)a)).\n[5] L\u2019accord en cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par des conjoints en instance de s\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019un mariage de trois ans. L\u2019accord est simple : il pr\u00e9voit essentiellement que chaque partie conservera les biens qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient en son nom et renoncera \u00e0 tout droit sur les biens de l\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du foyer familial et des objets m\u00e9nagers. Comme il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019avocats, l\u2019accord n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoire, mais le tribunal peut en tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a lieu de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 21.\n[6] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019accord entre les conjoints ne liait pas les parties et a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder quelque importance que ce soit. Il a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux plus de 90 000 $ (2019 SKQB 35). La Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan a conclu que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait commis une erreur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et, appliquant le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, a conclu qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019accorder beaucoup d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019accord (2021 SKCA 117, 463 D.L.R. (4th) 217). La Cour d\u2019appel a r\u00e9parti les biens familiaux en se servant de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des biens effectu\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e de la signature de l\u2019accord, et elle a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux de payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse environ 5 000 $.\n[7] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur. Mais je ne transposerais pas dans une loi provinciale sur les biens familiaux le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, qui s\u2019inscrivait dans un contexte l\u00e9gislatif diff\u00e9rent. Bien que les tribunaux puissent d\u00e9gager de cet arr\u00eat des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux utiles pour les guider dans l\u2019examen des contrats conjugaux, l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin n\u2019est pas, et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre, un cadre d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale permettant aux tribunaux de traiter tous les types de contrats conjugaux. Au contraire, l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du juge est tributaire de la loi applicable, et les diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre le partage des biens et les aliments entre \u00e9poux, les pr\u00e9occupations relatives au partage des pouvoirs et les caract\u00e9ristiques distinctives de la loi de la Saskatchewan commandent une m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse adapt\u00e9e.\n[8] Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il doit tenir compte d\u2019un accord qui ne constitue pas un contrat familial vis\u00e9 par la LBF, le tribunal doit d\u2019abord appr\u00e9cier l\u2019accord du point de vue de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, lorsque des pr\u00e9occupations de ce genre sont soulev\u00e9es. En examinant l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation pour y d\u00e9celer des pressions indues ou l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un rapport de force in\u00e9gal ou d\u2019une autre vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9, le juge peut d\u00e9terminer si les parties ont conclu l\u2019accord librement et en \u00e9tant conscientes de son sens et de ses effets. Bien que des mesures de protection telle la communication de la situation financi\u00e8re et l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants offrent une protection essentielle dans le contexte du droit de la famille, elles ne sont pas exig\u00e9es par la loi et leur absence, sans plus, ne permet pas de remettre n\u00e9cessairement en question l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le respect de l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des conjoints consacr\u00e9 tant dans la l\u00e9gislation que dans la jurisprudence, il y a lieu de tenir s\u00e9rieusement compte d\u2019un accord en application de l\u2019art. 21 de la LBF, \u00e0 moins que le tribunal ne soit convaincu que l\u2019accord d\u00e9coule d\u2019un processus de n\u00e9gociation injuste.\n[9] Une fois convaincu qu\u2019il y a lieu de tenir compte de l\u2019accord, le tribunal peut en \u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 substantielle afin de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019importance qu\u2019il y a lieu de lui accorder pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens. L\u2019importance \u00e0 accorder au contenu de l\u2019accord d\u00e9pend en fin de compte de ce qui est juste et \u00e9quitable selon l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la LBF.\n[10] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel portant que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait obligatoire et qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune pr\u00e9occupation fond\u00e9e quant \u00e0 son \u00e9quit\u00e9. Une absence de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants et de communication formelle peut souvent nuire \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un choix \u00e9clair\u00e9, mais elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas troublante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, parce que l\u2019\u00e9poux ne pouvait faire \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice en r\u00e9sultant : personne n\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de ces garanties avait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord. Par cons\u00e9quent, il y avait lieu de tenir s\u00e9rieusement compte de l\u2019accord. Mais le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait erreur en concluant que l\u2019accord ne liait pas les parties et en ne tenant pas compte de son contenu pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des biens. Et bien que la Cour d\u2019appel ait conclu qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019accorder une grande importance \u00e0 l\u2019accord, les biens familiaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galis\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 des parties, entra\u00eenant ainsi une injustice.\n[11] Dans les circonstances, notamment la bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 du mariage et les biens que chacune des parties poss\u00e9daient avant le mariage, la simple entente concernant la conservation des biens personnels et la division en parts \u00e9gales du foyer familial \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quitable, compte tenu des crit\u00e8res et des objectifs de la LBF. Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel concernant la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition du foyer familial et des objets m\u00e9nagers en fonction de leur valeur \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s. Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux la somme de 43 382,63 $.\nII. Contexte\n[12] Diana Anderson et James Allan Anderson se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s le 11 mai 2015 apr\u00e8s trois ans de mariage. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un premier mariage pour l\u2019un ou pour l\u2019autre, et lorsqu\u2019ils se sont mari\u00e9s les deux \u00e9poux poss\u00e9daient d\u00e9j\u00e0 des biens consid\u00e9rables, y compris des maisons, des v\u00e9hicules, des biens personnels, des R\u00c9ER et des pensions. Ils n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019enfant. Le 19 juillet 2015, les parties ont rencontr\u00e9 deux de leurs amis, qui ont r\u00e9uni le couple pour discuter de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9conciliation. Il est vite devenu \u00e9vident que la r\u00e9conciliation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas envisageable. \u00c0 la fin de la rencontre, les parties ont sign\u00e9 un accord de partage des biens familiaux, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9pouse. Leurs deux amis en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins. Aucune information financi\u00e8re n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e entre les parties, et ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a obtenu de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants avant de signer l\u2019accord. M\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9pouse lui a recommand\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et de consulter un avocat \u00bb, l\u2019\u00e9poux a refus\u00e9 et a sign\u00e9 l\u2019accord sur\u2011le\u2011champ (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 79 (CanLII)).\n[13] L\u2019accord pr\u00e9voit le partage de tous les biens familiaux \u00e0 l\u2019exception du foyer familial. Il pr\u00e9voit en grande partie que les actifs et passifs respectifs des parties doivent rester s\u00e9par\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du foyer familial et d\u2019une camionnette que l\u2019\u00e9pouse a accept\u00e9 de r\u00e9troc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux.\n[14] Les deux parties avaient contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales \u00e0 la mise de fonds pour l\u2019achat du foyer familial et elles avaient partag\u00e9 en parts \u00e9gales les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison, y compris l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, les taxes et les services publics. Au moment de la s\u00e9paration, la maison n\u2019avait aucune valeur nette et les parties auraient subi une perte si elles l\u2019avaient vendue. L\u2019accord pr\u00e9voit donc que le sort de la maison serait tranch\u00e9 plus tard. Les parties ont convenu de faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation de la maison et, si elles ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur sa r\u00e9partition, de recourir \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation. Apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration, l\u2019\u00e9pouse a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre dans la maison et l\u2019\u00e9poux a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019imp\u00f4t foncier jusqu\u2019en juin 2017, et la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que jusqu\u2019au proc\u00e8s, en juin 2018.\n[15] L\u2019accord stipule \u00e9galement que l\u2019\u00e9pouse renoncerait \u00e0 tout droit sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux. Au cours du mariage, l\u2019\u00e9poux avait investi dans Globe\u2011Elite Electrical Contractors Ltd., l\u2019entreprise pour laquelle il travaillait. Consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un investissement irr\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, l\u2019\u00e9pouse a refus\u00e9 de contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019achat des actions. Pour pouvoir investir, l\u2019\u00e9poux a emprunt\u00e9 une somme importante \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur et a refinanc\u00e9 la maison qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait au moment du mariage. L\u2019entreprise avait connu de pi\u00e8tres r\u00e9sultats au cours des ann\u00e9es qui avaient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la s\u00e9paration, mais avait affich\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s bons \u00bb r\u00e9sultats en 2015, au moment de la s\u00e9paration, d\u00e9gageant un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice net pour l\u2019entreprise (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 27). Apr\u00e8s 2015, [traduction] \u00ab il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019autres bonnes ann\u00e9es et l\u2019entreprise a essuy\u00e9 des pertes chaque ann\u00e9e subs\u00e9quente \u00bb (par. 72).\n[16] \u00c0 la suite de la rencontre de r\u00e9conciliation, les parties ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019accord. L\u2019\u00e9poux a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 ses meubles du foyer familial et a encaiss\u00e9 une partie de ses R\u00c9ER, et l\u2019\u00e9pouse a r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9 la camionnette \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux. Ce dernier n\u2019a toutefois pas r\u00e9pondu aux tentatives de l\u2019\u00e9pouse de r\u00e9gler la question du foyer familial. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019\u00e9pouse a communiqu\u00e9 par la suite avec l\u2019\u00e9poux pour lui demander d\u2019officialiser l\u2019accord conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de l\u2019art. 38 de la LBF, ce qui aurait fait en sorte que l\u2019accord aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoire. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019\u00e9pouse a adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux une autre lettre en vue d\u2019obtenir l\u2019\u00e9valuation des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de ce dernier. L\u2019\u00e9poux n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 ces d\u00e9marches. Il n\u2019a pas non plus contest\u00e9 ou r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 l\u2019accord.\n[17] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019\u00e9pouse a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divorce dans laquelle elle r\u00e9clamait les d\u00e9pens, mais pas de pension alimentaire pour conjoint ni la r\u00e9partition des biens. Le 5 mai 2017, pr\u00e8s de 17 mois apr\u00e8s que l\u2019\u00e9pouse eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate et pr\u00e8s de 2 ans apr\u00e8s la signature de l\u2019accord, l\u2019\u00e9poux a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse et une requ\u00eate reconventionnelle dans laquelle il r\u00e9clamait formellement la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux et soutenait qu\u2019il avait sign\u00e9 l\u2019accord sans avoir consult\u00e9 d\u2019avocat et sous la contrainte.\n[18] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait inex\u00e9cutoire, estimant [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s troublante \u00bb l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants (par. 108). Il a conclu que l\u2019accord s\u2019apparentait [traduction] \u00ab davantage \u00e0 un avant\u2011contrat qu\u2019\u00e0 un contrat \u00bb, car il reportait \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure le sort du foyer familial (par. 114; voir aussi le par. 109). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas tenu compte du contenu de l\u2019accord au moment de r\u00e9partir les biens familiaux et il a plut\u00f4t proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9galisation des biens familiaux en vertu de la LBF. Aux fins d\u2019\u00e9galisation, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9tabli la valeur de bon nombre des actifs et des dettes des parties en date de mai 2017, date de la requ\u00eate reconventionnelle de l\u2019\u00e9poux, mais a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les pensions et les placements des parties, ainsi que le foyer familial \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s en juin 2018. Au lieu de donner quelque importance que ce soit au contenu de l\u2019accord, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en equity que lui conf\u00e8re la LBF pour r\u00e9duire de 8 000 $ le paiement d\u2019\u00e9galisation d\u00fb par l\u2019\u00e9pouse, vu le refus de l\u2019\u00e9poux de discuter du foyer familial et de son retard \u00e0 demander la r\u00e9partition des biens, ce qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab des d\u00e9penses et des soucis suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb pour l\u2019\u00e9pouse (par. 278). L\u2019\u00e9pouse s\u2019est vu ordonner de verser \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux un paiement d\u2019\u00e9galisation net de 62 646,98 $ et de lui transf\u00e9rer un R\u00c9ER d\u2019une valeur de 37 089,69 $ ou de lui verser un autre paiement en esp\u00e8ces de 27 817,27 $, pour un total d\u2019environ 90 000 $ (par. 280).\n[19] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan a annul\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance du juge de premi\u00e8re instance concernant la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux et les d\u00e9pens, estimant qu\u2019il avait commis plusieurs erreurs dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019accord. Parmi les erreurs relev\u00e9es, la Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait accord\u00e9 trop d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants, l\u2019obtention de tels conseils n\u2019\u00e9tant pas requise par l\u2019art. 40 de la LBF. Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, l\u2019accord \u00e9tait un contrat obligatoire, et non un avant-contrat et, compte tenu du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, elle a conclu qu\u2019il y avait lieu de lui accorder une grande importance. La Cour d\u2019appel a estim\u00e9 que les biens familiaux devaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e de l\u2019accord. Elle a r\u00e9parti les biens familiaux en reprenant les valeurs que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait \u00e9tablies en d\u00e9cembre 2015, date de la requ\u00eate en divorce de l\u2019\u00e9pouse, et elle a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux de verser 4 914,95 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse.\nIII. Analyse\n[20] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi pose la question de savoir comment un juge devrait \u00e9valuer un accord qui ne respecte pas les exigences formelles d\u2019un accord pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoire selon une loi provinciale sur les biens familiaux. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin devrait s\u2019appliquer aux accords qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s obligatoires selon la LBF.\n[21] Constatant le manque d\u2019uniformit\u00e9 dans le traitement, par les juges de premi\u00e8re instance, des accords qui ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab contrat familial \u00bb, la Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9tabli le cadre applicable par les tribunaux pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019importance \u00e0 donner \u00e0 un accord en vertu de l\u2019art. 40 de la LBF. Le cadre propos\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel vise dans un premier temps \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019accord est valide selon les principes du droit des contrats. Si tel est le cas, il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui cherche \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter l\u2019accord de d\u00e9montrer : (1) soit que le processus de n\u00e9gociation \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 d\u2019iniquit\u00e9s; (2) soit que le contenu de l\u2019accord est in\u00e9quitable en ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9roge substantiellement aux objectifs de la LBF; (3) soit que des changements survenus depuis la conclusion de l\u2019accord font en sorte que ce dernier ne refl\u00e8te plus la volont\u00e9 des parties au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu ou qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus conforme aux objectifs de la loi. Si la partie qui conteste l\u2019accord n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter du fardeau qui lui incombe en ce qui concerne ces \u00e9tapes, le tribunal doit accorder une grande importance \u00e0 l\u2019accord. Cette analyse refl\u00e8te le cadre \u00e9tabli par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin.\n[22] L\u2019\u00e9poux soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas opportun d\u2019appliquer le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, compte tenu du pouvoir que l\u2019art. 40 conf\u00e8re au tribunal de donner \u00e0 un accord entre conjoints \u00ab l\u2019importance \u00bb qu\u2019il estime raisonnable. L\u2019\u00e9poux affirme que ce cadre d\u2019analyse cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle l\u2019accord doit se voir accorder une grande importance \u00e0 moins que la partie qui le conteste ne r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 le discr\u00e9diter, et mine le vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 40.\n[23] Je reconnais qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas opportun d\u2019importer sans modification en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la LBF et \u00e0 la nature de la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux. N\u00e9anmoins, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin et dans d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions portant sur des contrats conjugaux contribuent \u00e0 encadrer la fa\u00e7on dont les juges exercent le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que leur conf\u00e8re l\u2019art. 40 de la LBF. Je vais d\u2019abord examiner ces d\u00e9cisions avant d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la loi saskatchewanaise.\n[24] Enfin, je vais me pencher sur l\u2019application de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019accord en cause. Je vais d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer si le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en concluant que l\u2019accord n\u2019\u00e9tait pas contraignant et en ne lui accordant aucune importance. J\u2019estime que le juge a effectivement commis une erreur, et je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le contenu de l\u2019accord devrait \u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement pris en compte lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de rendre une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens en vertu de la Loi. Je vais ensuite examiner la r\u00e9partition des biens effectu\u00e9e par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et me pencher sur la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e.\nA. Les contrats conjugaux : l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin et les d\u00e9cisions ult\u00e9rieures\n[25] Un contrat conjugal est un accord conclu par des conjoints en vue d\u2019organiser certains aspects de leurs affaires, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de la pension alimentaire pour enfants, de la garde des enfants, de la pension alimentaire pour conjoint ou du partage des biens familiaux. Un tel accord peut \u00eatre conclu au d\u00e9but de la relation conjugale, au cours de celle\u2011ci ou au moment de la s\u00e9paration. Au cours des deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies, notre Cour a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 des dispositions relatives \u00e0 des contrats conjugaux dans diverses lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales, \u00e0 commencer par l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, qui est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019analyse de la Cour d\u2019appel en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que certains principes d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale se d\u00e9gagent de cette jurisprudence, celle\u2011ci r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que le juge doit axer sa d\u00e9marche sur la loi dont il est saisi lorsqu\u2019il examine un tel accord.\n[26] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, les juges Bastarache et Arbour, s\u2019exprimant au nom d\u2019une majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, ont adopt\u00e9 un cadre contextuel pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019importance \u00e0 accorder aux accords de s\u00e9paration portant sur les aliments entre \u00e9poux en vertu de l\u2019art. 15.2 de la Loi sur le divorce . Le paragraphe 15.2(4) oblige les juges \u00e0 tenir compte de plusieurs facteurs pour rendre une ordonnance alimentaire au profit d\u2019un \u00e9poux, y compris l\u2019existence d\u2019une entente entre les \u00e9poux, et le par. 15.2(6) pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019ordonnance alimentaire doit favoriser la r\u00e9alisation de certains objectifs. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin porte sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 au moment de la conclusion de l\u2019accord. Elle comporte deux volets. Tout d\u2019abord, le tribunal doit \u00e9valuer les \u00ab circonstances entourant la n\u00e9gociation et la conclusion de l\u2019accord \u00bb pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 ou des conditions d\u2019oppression qui ont eu une incidence sur le processus de n\u00e9gociation (par. 92; voir aussi le par. 81). Il s\u2019agit notamment de v\u00e9rifier si les parties ont retenu les services de professionnels, notamment de conseillers juridiques. Ensuite, le tribunal doit \u00e9valuer le contenu de l\u2019accord pour d\u00e9terminer si \u00ab \u00e0 sa conclusion, l\u2019accord \u00e9tait conforme pour l\u2019essentiel aux objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la [l]oi \u00bb (par. 87).\n[27] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin porte encore une fois sur le contenu de l\u2019accord au moment de son ex\u00e9cution pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il refl\u00e8te toujours la volont\u00e9 initiale des parties et s\u2019il demeure conforme aux objectifs de la loi. Le tribunal se demande essentiellement si des changements survenus dans la situation des parties rendent aujourd\u2019hui inique l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019accord.\n[28] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, l\u2019analyse d\u00e9coulait du contexte des aliments entre \u00e9poux et des dispositions applicables, des objectifs et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi sur le divorce . Comme notre jurisprudence l\u2019a depuis reconnu, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels limitent l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin dans d\u2019autres contextes l\u00e9gislatifs.\n[29] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hartshorne c. Hartshorne, 2004 CSC 22, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 550, le juge Bastarache, qui \u00e9crivait au nom des juges majoritaires de la Cour, a refus\u00e9 de transposer le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin pour interpr\u00e9ter le par. 65(1) de la Family Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, de la Colombie\u2011Britannique qui autorisait les tribunaux \u00e0 annuler un accord pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoire entre conjoints conclu au moment du mariage lorsque le partage des biens serait in\u00e9quitable au moment de la r\u00e9partition (par. 13 et 42). Le juge Bastarache a conclu \u00ab qu\u2019on d\u00e9formerait la structure analytique \u00bb de la loi de la Colombie\u2011Britannique si l\u2019on suivait \u00ab sans r\u00e9serve l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin \u00bb (par. 42). Dans l\u2019affaire D.B.S. c. S.R.G., 2006 CSC 37, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 231, la Cour a examin\u00e9 quatre affaires portant sur l\u2019adjudication r\u00e9troactive d\u2019une pension alimentaire pour enfants et, l\u00e0 encore, elle n\u2019a pas transpos\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait lieu de modifier un accord ant\u00e9rieur sur la pension alimentaire pour enfants conclu entre les parties, notant que deux des pourvois relevaient de la Loi sur le divorce , tandis que les deux autres relevaient du r\u00e9gime provincial de l\u2019Alberta (par. 50\u201153). La Cour a plut\u00f4t tenu compte du r\u00e9gime sp\u00e9cifique pr\u00e9vu par la loi (voir les par. 54 et 75\u201179). Enfin, dans l\u2019affaire L.M.P. c. L.S., 2011 CSC 64, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 775, notre Cour a refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin pour interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 17 de la Loi sur le divorce , jugeant que la formulation diff\u00e9rente employ\u00e9e par le Parlement au par. 15(2) et \u00e0 l\u2019art. 17 justifiait une approche diff\u00e9rente (par. 25 et 28).\n[30] Rench\u00e9rissant sur des commentaires de notre Cour, des auteurs de doctrine ont remis eux aussi en question l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la seconde \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin dans le contexte du partage des biens familiaux. Le versement d\u2019aliments en faveur d\u2019un conjoint est avant tout une obligation prospective et continue qui s\u2019attache \u00e0 la valeur future et repose en partie sur les moyens et les besoins : [traduction] \u00ab . . . \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019autres indications, on suppose que la pension alimentaire pour conjoint est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre modifi\u00e9e pour tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9volution de la situation \u00bb (C. Rogerson, \u00ab Spousal Support Agreements and the Legacy of Miglin \u00bb (2012), 31 C.F.L.Q. 13, p. 34; voir aussi Miglin, par. 209, le juge LeBel, dissident, mais non sur ce point; Droit de la famille \u2014 152477, 2015 QCCA 1618, par. 16 (CanLII); R. Leckey, \u00ab A Common Law of the Family? Reflections on Rick v. Brandsema \u00bb (2009), 25 Rev. can. d. fam. 257, p. 280). La r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux, en revanche, est un exercice principalement r\u00e9trospectif : il consiste \u00e0 dresser le bilan des biens poss\u00e9d\u00e9s avant le d\u00e9but de la relation conjugale et acquis au cours de celle\u2011ci en tant que contributions ant\u00e9rieures donnant ouverture \u00e0 un droit sur les biens (Leckey (2009), p. 280). La pertinence des changements survenus dans la situation apr\u00e8s la conclusion de l\u2019accord est beaucoup moins \u00e9vidente dans le cas des accords de s\u00e9paration portant sur la r\u00e9partition des biens que dans celui de la pension alimentaire au profit d\u2019un conjoint. Notre Cour a \u00e9galement reconnu cette distinction (voir Miglin, par. 76), ce qui explique en partie pourquoi nous n\u2019avons jamais \u00e9tendu totalement le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux (voir Rick c. Brandsema, 2009 CSC 10, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 295, par. 39; Hartshorne, par. 42).\n[31] Il ressort de cet examen que le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin n\u2019est pas une panac\u00e9e pour tous les contrats conjugaux. Au contraire, l\u2019analyse \u00e0 entreprendre pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il faut accorder de l\u2019importance \u00e0 un contrat conjugal doit \u00eatre d\u00e9finie en fonction du caract\u00e8re distinct du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif sous\u2011jacent. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai compte tenu de la structure constitutionnelle de notre pays : la pension alimentaire pour conjoint dans le contexte d\u2019un divorce est r\u00e9gie par la Loi sur le divorce f\u00e9d\u00e9rale , alors que la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux, par exemple, rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence des provinces en mati\u00e8re de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de droits civils. Importer d\u2019embl\u00e9e une analyse structur\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour interpr\u00e9ter une disposition discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019une loi provinciale risque de miner l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative de la province (D.B.S., par. 55; voir aussi M. Bailey, \u00ab Limits on Autonomy \u00bb, dans B. Atkin, dir., The International Survey of Family Law (2010), 95, p. 97; Leckey (2009), p. 287).\n[32] N\u00e9anmoins, notre Cour s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on plus large sur les principes tir\u00e9s de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin qui traitent de pr\u00e9occupations communes aux contrats conjugaux. Bien que le juge Bastarache ait refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer directement le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin dans les affaires Hartshorne et D.B.S., il s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 dans ces deux affaires sur les principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, comme celui de la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence devant \u00eatre manifest\u00e9e par les tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des contrats conjugaux, pour guider l\u2019analyse \u00e0 effectuer en vertu du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif pertinent (voir D.B.S., par. 76; Hartshorne, par. 40 et 43\u201145). Et, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Rick, notre Cour s\u2019est inspir\u00e9e de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin lorsqu\u2019elle a reformul\u00e9 le concept d\u2019entente abusive en common law \u00ab pour tenir compte du caract\u00e8re particulier des ententes matrimoniales \u00bb (par. 43), reconnaissant qu\u2019il existe une \u00ab obligation de communication franche et compl\u00e8te de tous les renseignements financiers pertinents \u00bb dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation (par. 47).\n[33] Ainsi, bien que le cadre d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer pour examiner un contrat conjugal soit tributaire de la loi soumise \u00e0 l\u2019examen du tribunal, on peut tirer de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin et de la jurisprudence subs\u00e9quente de notre Cour des principes utiles pour faciliter cet examen judiciaire. Comme point de d\u00e9part, les tribunaux devraient de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale encourager et favoriser les contrats conjugaux, dans les limites permises par le l\u00e9gislateur, en l\u2019absence de raison imp\u00e9rieuse de rejeter l\u2019accord (Miglin, par. 46; D.B.S., par. 76; Rick, par. 45). Cette d\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u00e9coule de la reconnaissance du fait que l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance \u00e9conomique, l\u2019autonomie et la recherche d\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif sont des objectifs importants dans le contexte du droit de la famille (Miglin, par. 28). Non seulement les parties sont-elles mieux plac\u00e9es que les tribunaux pour comprendre ce qui est juste dans le contexte de leur relation, mais le r\u00e8glement priv\u00e9 des affaires familiales \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du processus contradictoire permet d\u2019\u00e9viter les frais et le tumulte des litiges prolong\u00e9s (par. 45\u201146; voir aussi Association de m\u00e9diation familiale du Qu\u00e9bec c. Bouvier, 2021 CSC 54, par. 44 et 134).\n[34] Par contre, les n\u00e9gociations concernant les contrats conjugaux se d\u00e9roulent dans un climat particuli\u00e8rement difficile, souvent lors d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de stress \u00e9motionnel aigu \u00ab au cours de laquelle les parties, ou l\u2019une d\u2019elles, peuvent se sentir particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00bb (Miglin, par. 74; voir aussi Rick, par. 47; C. Rogerson, \u00ab Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24 : \u201cThey are Agreements Nonetheless\u201d \u00bb (2003), 20 Rev. can. d. fam. 197, p. 225). Dans ce contexte, la simple application des principes ordinaires de la validit\u00e9 des contrats peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer insuffisante pour apaiser les craintes de d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre et d\u2019exploitation (Miglin, par. 77; M. Shaffer, \u00ab Domestic Contracts, Part II : The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in Hartshorne v. Hartshorne \u00bb (2004), 20 Rev. can. d. fam. 261, p. 286). Les juges doivent plut\u00f4t aborder les r\u00e8glements en droit de la famille en vue de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre, d\u2019une part, les valeurs que repr\u00e9sentent l\u2019autonomie des parties contractantes et la certitude et, d\u2019autre part, le souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Essentiellement, les juges doivent examiner les contrats conjugaux en faisant montre d\u2019une sensibilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s qui peuvent exister dans le contexte du droit de la famille, sans pr\u00e9sumer que les conjoints n\u2019avaient pas la capacit\u00e9 de contracter simplement parce que l\u2019accord a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9 dans des conditions stressantes sur le plan \u00e9motionnel (Miglin, par. 82; voir aussi R. Leckey, \u00ab Contracting Claims and Family Law Feuds \u00bb (2007), 57 U.T.L.J. 1, p. 14; Bailey, p. 102 (citant l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 sexosp\u00e9cifique qui peut d\u00e9couler de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de conclure un contrat dans un contexte \u00e9motionnel)).\n[35] La pr\u00e9occupation au sujet des vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s peut \u00eatre contr\u00e9e au moyen de garanties proc\u00e9durales. Par exemple, la communication compl\u00e8te et franche de tous les renseignements financiers pertinents entre les parties peut contribuer grandement \u00e0 apaiser les craintes d\u2019asym\u00e9trie informationnelle (Rick, par. 47; Colucci c. Colucci, 2021 CSC 24, par. 51). De m\u00eame, l\u2019aide professionnelle, tels les conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants, peut \u00eatre la marque d\u2019un processus de n\u00e9gociation \u00e9quitable (Miglin, par. 82; Rick, par. 60\u201161), bien que l\u2019effet r\u00e9parateur de conseils juridiques lors de la n\u00e9gociation des contrats conjugaux ne doive pas \u00eatre tenu pour acquis. Ainsi que l\u2019a reconnu le juge La Forest, dissident dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Richardson c. Richardson, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 857, le divorce est l\u2019un des moments les plus stressants de la vie et il porte bien des gens \u00e0 faire \u00ab des choses contraires au bon sens et qui sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre le fait d\u2019adultes raisonnables, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019ils ont recours \u00e0 un conseiller juridique \u00bb (p. 883). Les tribunaux doivent tenir soigneusement compte des pressions financi\u00e8res et psychologiques qui caract\u00e9risent la relation, et \u00e9viter de simplement pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques met un contrat \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019iniquit\u00e9.\n[36] La rigueur de l\u2019examen auquel le tribunal soumet le contrat conjugal d\u00e9pend de la loi habilitante. Certaines lois pr\u00e9voient, par exemple, qu\u2019un contrat conjugal ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 que s\u2019il est abusif (voir Loi sur le droit de la famille, L.R.O. 1990, c. F.3, par. 33(4)), alors que d\u2019autres utilisent les termes \u00ab in\u00e9quitable \u00bb ou \u00ab influence indue \u00bb (voir Loi sur les biens matrimoniaux, L.R.N.\u2011B. 2012, c. 107, art. 43; Loi sur le patrimoine familial et l\u2019obligation alimentaire, L.R.Y. 2002, c. 83, par. 2(4)). Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, pour se prononcer sur le caract\u00e8re \u00e9quitable d\u2019un contrat conjugal, on tient habituellement compte \u00e0 la fois des circonstances entourant la conclusion du contrat et du contenu du contrat, lorsque la loi applicable permet un tel examen. Comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 la juge Abella dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Rick, par. 50 : \u00ab . . . en droit de la famille, la meilleure fa\u00e7on de prot\u00e9ger le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une entente n\u00e9goci\u00e9e est de veiller \u00e0 son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois sur les plans proc\u00e9dural et substantiel, conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif applicable \u00bb.\n[37] L\u2019\u00e9valuation du contenu du contrat est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fonction du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif applicable. Les objectifs et les crit\u00e8res de la loi fournissent un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence objectif permettant d\u2019\u00e9valuer la compr\u00e9hension subjective qu\u2019ont les parties de ce qui est \u00e9quitable et de limiter le risque qu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9cartent de fa\u00e7on marqu\u00e9e des objectifs d\u2019ordre public exprim\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur. Le fait d\u2019\u00e9valuer le contenu du contrat en fonction de la loi contribue \u00e0 promouvoir une plus grande certitude pour les parties, qui peuvent s\u2019appuyer sur les droits qui leur sont reconnus par la loi comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour organiser leurs affaires personnelles (M. Shaffer et C. Rogerson, \u00ab Contracting Spousal Support : Thinking Through Miglin \u00bb (2003), 21 C.F.L.Q. 49, p. 61).\n[38] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, notre jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de contrats conjugaux, \u00e0 commencer par l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin, valorise les principes de l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des parties et de la certitude en encourageant les parties \u00e0 organiser leurs affaires intimes sans avoir recours aux tribunaux. Mais les complexit\u00e9s \u00e9motionnelles de la dynamique familiale font qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re familiale, les contrats ne sont pas des op\u00e9rations ordinaires effectu\u00e9es sans lien de d\u00e9pendance. Le contexte unique dans lequel ces accords sont conclus oblige les tribunaux, pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, \u00e0 les aborder avec une conscience aigu\u00eb de leurs faiblesses potentielles, tout en tenant compte de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation et du contenu du contrat.\nB. La Loi sur les biens familiaux de la Saskatchewan\n[39] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas eu tort de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin pour encadrer l\u2019exercice, par les juges, du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que leur conf\u00e8re l\u2019art. 40 de la LBF. Toutefois, elle n\u2019a pas adapt\u00e9 comme il se doit l\u2019analyse au r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif applicable.\n[40] Le droit relatif aux biens familiaux a \u00e9volu\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la conception moderne du mariage en tant que projet \u00e9conomique commun. En 1973, le juge Laskin (plus tard juge en chef) a reconnu dans une opinion dissidente que la contribution qu\u2019une \u00e9pouse avait apport\u00e9e sous forme de travaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un bien\u2011fonds enregistr\u00e9 au nom de son mari devrait lui donner droit en equity \u00e0 une part de ce bien\u2011fonds (Murdoch c. Murdoch, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 423, p. 450\u2011457). Cette opinion a jet\u00e9 les bases de futurs arr\u00eats comme Pettkus c. Becker, [1980] 2 R.C.S. 834, et Peter c. Beblow, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 980, dans lesquels notre Cour a \u00e9largi la doctrine de la fiducie par interpr\u00e9tation en common law dans le contexte du droit de la famille pour reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019un apport non \u00e9conomique peut conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 un conjoint le droit de revendiquer une part des biens accumul\u00e9s au cours du mariage.\n[41] De m\u00eame, apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es de revendications de la part de groupes f\u00e9ministes, la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de biens familiaux a fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9formes dans les ann\u00e9es 1970 et 1980 pour reconna\u00eetre que [traduction] \u00ab le travail non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 accompli par les femmes pour tenir la maison et s\u2019occuper des enfants leur [donne] droit au partage des biens accumul\u00e9s pendant le mariage \u00bb (M. Shaffer, \u00ab Developments in Family Law : The 2003\u20112004 Term \u00bb (2004), 26 S.C.L.R. (2d) 407, p. 435). Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces [traduction] \u00ab gains obtenus de haute lutte \u00bb, tous les r\u00e9gimes provinciaux canadiens en mati\u00e8re de partage des biens pr\u00e9sument maintenant uniform\u00e9ment que les biens familiaux doivent \u00eatre partag\u00e9s en parts \u00e9gales en cas d\u2019\u00e9chec du mariage, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions et de l\u2019exercice, par les tribunaux, de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (Shaffer, p. 435; voir LBF, par. 21(1); Family Property Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F\u20114.7, par. 7(4); Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, art. 81; Loi sur les biens familiaux, C.P.L.M., c. F25, art. 13; Loi sur les biens matrimoniaux (N.\u2011B.), art. 2; Family Law Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. F\u20112, art. 19; Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275, par. 12(1); Loi sur le droit de la famille, L.T.N.\u2011O. 1997, c. 18, par. 36(1); Loi sur le droit de la famille (Ont.), par. 5(1); Family Law Act, S.P.E.I. 1995, c. 12, par. 6(1); Loi sur le patrimoine familial et l\u2019obligation alimentaire (Yukon), par. 6(1)). Bien que la structure des lois varie d\u2019une province \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u2014 par exemple en ce qui concerne le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9vu par la loi lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galisation (voir, p. ex., Loi sur le droit de la famille (Ont.), par. 5(6) (qui recourt \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re fond\u00e9 sur le caract\u00e8re \u00ab inadmissible \u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9galisation); Family Property Act (Alb.), par. 7(4) (qui recourt \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re fond\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019une \u00e9galisation ne serait [traduction] \u00ab pas juste et \u00e9quitable \u00bb)) \u2014, toutes les lois reposent sur une pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales.\n[42] Toutefois, presque tous les r\u00e9gimes provinciaux en mati\u00e8re de biens familiaux permettent aux conjoints de se soustraire par contrat \u00e0 l\u2019application du r\u00e9gime par la conclusion d\u2019un accord priv\u00e9, \u00e0 condition que leur accord respecte certaines exigences formelles, sauf le Qu\u00e9bec (voir Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, art. 391; Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. A, 2013 CSC 5, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 61, par. 83\u201184). Au minimum, la plupart des r\u00e9gimes exigent que l\u2019accord soit conclu par \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9 par les deux parties en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un t\u00e9moin pour que les biens familiaux puissent \u00eatre exclus de la r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Certains pr\u00e9voient \u00e9galement des exigences suppl\u00e9mentaires, telles que la communication de renseignements financiers entre les parties (voir Family Law Act (C.\u2011B.), al. 93(3)(a); Loi sur le droit de la famille (T.N.\u2011O.), al. 8(4)a); Loi sur le droit de la famille (Ont.), al. 56(4)a); Family Law Act (\u00ce.\u2011P.\u2011\u00c9.), al. 55(4)(a)) ou l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants (voir Family Property Act (Alb.), par. 38(2)). Ces formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales servent \u00e0 faire comprendre aux conjoints l\u2019importance de leur accord et \u00e0 favoriser et \u00e0 pr\u00e9server la validit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements contraignants conclus en mati\u00e8re de biens familiaux (D. A. R. Thompson, \u00ab When is a Family Law Contract Not Invalid, Unenforceable, Overridden or Varied? \u00bb (2001), 19 C.F.L.Q. 399). L\u2019accord qui satisfait aux exigences l\u00e9gales ne peut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre annul\u00e9 que s\u2019il est jug\u00e9 fonci\u00e8rement in\u00e9quitable ou abusif (voir, p. ex., Matrimonial Property Act (N.\u2011\u00c9.), art. 29; Family Law Act (C.\u2011B.), par. 93(5)).\n[43] L\u2019objet de la LBF de la Saskatchewan est de reconna\u00eetre que les soins \u00e0 donner aux enfants, la gestion du m\u00e9nage et l\u2019apport financier constituent des responsabilit\u00e9s communes mutuelles aux conjoints et que la contribution de chacun des conjoints en vue d\u2019assumer ces responsabilit\u00e9s est implicite dans une relation conjugale (voir l\u2019art. 20). La Loi s\u2019applique tant aux conjoints mari\u00e9s qu\u2019aux conjoints non mari\u00e9s qui ont cohabit\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on continue pendant au moins deux ans (voir l\u2019al. 2(1) \u00ab conjoint \u00bb c)). \u00c0 l\u2019instar d\u2019autres lois provinciales, la LBF repose sur une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les biens familiaux sont r\u00e9partis en parts \u00e9gales une fois qu\u2019un conjoint en fait la demande en vertu de la Loi (voir le par. 21(1)).\n[44] M\u00eame alors, la LBF habilite le tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9roger au partage \u00e9gal lorsque la r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue par la Loi serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable (voir les art. 21 et 22). Le paragraphe 21(3) \u00e9num\u00e8re plusieurs facteurs dont le tribunal peut tenir compte pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation, notamment tout accord \u00e9crit intervenu entre les conjoints (al. 21(3)a)), la dur\u00e9e de la cohabitation (al. 21(3)b)), la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de s\u00e9paration des conjoints (al. 21(3)c)), la date d\u2019acquisition des biens familiaux (al. 21(3)d)), la contribution d\u2019un tiers pour le compte d\u2019un conjoint \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des biens familiaux (al. 21(3)e)), la contribution faite par un conjoint \u00e0 la carri\u00e8re ou \u00e0 la perspective de carri\u00e8re de l\u2019autre conjoint (al. 21(3)f)), la mesure dans laquelle la situation financi\u00e8re et la capacit\u00e9 de gains de chacun des conjoints ont \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9es par la relation conjugale (al. 21(3)g)), les dettes ou obligations d\u2019un conjoint (al. 21(3)o)) et tous autres faits ou circonstances pertinents (al. 21(3)q)). D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019il y a lieu en vertu de la loi de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales, le tribunal peut ordonner la r\u00e9partition qu\u2019il estime juste et \u00e9quitable (al. 21(2)c) et 22(2)c)). L\u2019objectif primordial de l\u2019analyse pr\u00e9vue par la loi est donc de d\u00e9terminer un partage des biens juste et \u00e9quitable compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la relation.\n[45] Comme d\u2019autres lois provinciales sur les biens familiaux, la LBF permet aux conjoints de se soustraire par contrat au r\u00e9gime et de r\u00e9gler les questions relatives aux biens au moyen d\u2019un accord. La Loi fait une distinction entre un accord formel, appel\u00e9 \u00ab contrat familial \u00bb dans celle\u2011ci, qui est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutoire entre les conjoints (art. 38), et les autres accords qui ne respectent pas les formalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par la loi, mais qui peut quand m\u00eame \u00eatre pris en compte et se voir donner de l\u2019importance par le tribunal en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir une r\u00e9partition juste et \u00e9quitable des biens (art. 40).\n[46] Pour constituer un contrat familial au sens de l\u2019art. 38, l\u2019accord doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9 par chacun des conjoints en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, et chaque conjoint doit reconna\u00eetre par \u00e9crit devant un avocat qu\u2019il comprend la nature et l\u2019effet du contrat, qu\u2019il est conscient des droits que lui accorde la LBF et qu\u2019il entend y renoncer. Une fois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 officialis\u00e9, le contrat familial est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 soustraire les biens envisag\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition \u00e9tablie selon le r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu par la loi (par. 24(1)). La l\u00e9gislature a estim\u00e9 que ces formalit\u00e9s constituaient des indicateurs suffisants d\u2019un accord valide et d\u2019un processus de n\u00e9gociation \u00e9quitable, de sorte que le tribunal fera ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019accord, \u00e0 moins que la partie qui conteste l\u2019accord ne puisse d\u00e9montrer que celui\u2011ci est exorbitant ou cr\u00e9erait une injustice flagrante (par. 24(2)).\n[47] L\u2019article 40 indique clairement que le tribunal peut quand m\u00eame tenir compte de tout accord qui ne respecte pas en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie les formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par l\u2019art. 38 et \u00ab lui donner l\u2019importance qu\u2019il estime raisonnable \u00bb. Et m\u00eame si les biens faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un accord vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 40 ne sont pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s de la r\u00e9partition, l\u2019al. 21(3)a) de la Loi oblige le tribunal \u00e0 tenir compte de tout accord \u00e9crit pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable d\u2019ordonner la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales. La Loi accorde donc une grande valeur \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des conjoints de conclure un accord en mati\u00e8re de partage des biens.\n[48] Comment, alors, le tribunal devrait\u2011il aborder, en application de l\u2019art. 40, l\u2019accord qui n\u2019est pas un \u00ab contrat familial \u00bb? D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, le tribunal devrait \u00eatre sensible \u00e0 toute pr\u00e9occupation concernant la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord au regard des principes ordinaires du droit des contrats, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui manque une ou plusieurs des garanties formelles pour pouvoir \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un contrat familial. Si de telles questions se posent, le tribunal devra s\u2019assurer de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord.\n[49] En supposant que l\u2019accord soit valide, l\u2019attention du tribunal se porte ensuite sur la question de savoir si cet accord m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019\u00e9galisation. S\u2019appuyant sur les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019arr\u00eat Miglin et de la jurisprudence subs\u00e9quente que j\u2019ai \u00e9voqu\u00e9s, la question pertinente dans le cadre de la LBF est celle de savoir si des craintes justifi\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au sujet de la formation de l\u2019accord, de telle sorte qu\u2019il serait injuste d\u2019en tenir compte. Pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019en tenir compte, une partie n\u2019a pas besoin de r\u00e9pondre au crit\u00e8re strict pour s\u2019opposer en common law au caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire d\u2019un contrat. N\u00e9anmoins, la partie qui conteste l\u2019accord doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve tendant \u00e0 indiquer que la formation de l\u2019accord a \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9e de pressions indues, d\u2019oppression ou d\u2019exploitation d\u2019un rapport de force in\u00e9gal ou d\u2019une autre vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9, ou encore qu\u2019une lacune dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation a emp\u00each\u00e9 les parties de comprendre un aspect essentiel du march\u00e9. Si le juge est convaincu qu\u2019aucune pr\u00e9occupation de ce genre n\u2019est \u00e9tablie, l\u2019accord peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019expression de la volont\u00e9 des parties contractantes. Bien que des mesures comme l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants et la communication de renseignements financiers contribuent \u00e0 assurer un processus de n\u00e9gociation \u00e9quitable, elles ne font pas partie des exigences l\u00e9gales pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 40 de la LBF, et leur absence \u00e0 elle seule n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante en ce qui concerne l\u2019analyse.\n[50] S\u2019il est convaincu que l\u2019accord est valide et que l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e, le tribunal peut alors tenir compte de l\u2019accord pour d\u00e9terminer les modalit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es de la r\u00e9partition des biens. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019importance primordiale que la loi et la jurisprudence accordent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des conjoints en mati\u00e8re contractuelle, le contenu de l\u2019accord qui repr\u00e9sente la compr\u00e9hension subjective qu\u2019avaient les parties de la r\u00e9partition des biens qu\u2019elles jugeaient appropri\u00e9 dans le contexte de leur relation au moment de la s\u00e9paration m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement pris en consid\u00e9ration.\n[51] En fin de compte, toutefois, l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un accord lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de rendre une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens d\u00e9pend de la mesure dans laquelle le contenu concorde avec ce qui est juste et \u00e9quitable dans les circonstances, eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux facteurs du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. Le tribunal doit \u00e9valuer le contenu de l\u2019accord dans le contexte de la LBF, en tenant notamment compte de la pr\u00e9somption initiale de r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la Loi et des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019equity \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au par. 21(3) dont les juges doivent tenir compte afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 dans les circonstances de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales. D\u2019autres dispositions peuvent \u00e9galement se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utiles. L\u2019article 22, par exemple, pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales du foyer familial n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e que dans des circonstances extraordinaires ou que dans le cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales serait in\u00e9quitable pour le conjoint qui a la garde des enfants. L\u2019article 23 exclut d\u2019embl\u00e9e certains biens de la r\u00e9partition. Le crit\u00e8re applicable n\u2019est cependant pas celui de la stricte conformit\u00e9 aux droits que la loi reconna\u00eet aux conjoints, car cet examen risque d\u2019entraver l\u2019exercice par les parties du droit que la LBF leur reconna\u00eet de conclure des accords priv\u00e9s concernant le partage de leurs biens (Leckey (2007), p. 13). La question est de savoir si la volont\u00e9 autonome exprim\u00e9e par les parties au moment de la s\u00e9paration s\u2019inscrit dans une gamme de possibilit\u00e9s justes et \u00e9quitables envisag\u00e9es par la LBF, en tenant compte des facteurs contextuels g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au par. 21(3) et, si la chose est utile, d\u2019autres dispositions.\n[52] La fa\u00e7on dont le tribunal tient compte de l\u2019accord est en fin de compte laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion lorsqu\u2019il rend une ordonnance en vertu du par. 21(2). Le fait que l\u2019accord n\u2019est pas un contrat familial au sens de l\u2019art. 38 n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le tribunal de l\u2019accepter sans r\u00e9serve lorsqu\u2019il rend une ordonnance de r\u00e9partition des biens, s\u2019il est convaincu que cela est juste et \u00e9quitable dans les circonstances. Mais m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019un accord d\u00e9roge \u00e0 la LBF d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, le tribunal peut tout de m\u00eame respecter les parties de l\u2019accord qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re justes et \u00e9quitables, tout en ignorant le reste.\n[53] Maintenant que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9 ces principes, je vais appliquer ce cadre aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIV. Application\n[54] L\u2019accord est court et peu compliqu\u00e9. Il refl\u00e8te l\u2019intention des parties d\u2019effectuer une rupture nette de leur partenariat, et pr\u00e9voit seulement la r\u00e9partition entre eux du foyer familial et des objets m\u00e9nagers, ainsi que la r\u00e9trocession d\u2019une camionnette \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux par l\u2019\u00e9pouse. Cette r\u00e9trocession a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu.\n[55] L\u2019\u00e9poux affirme qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 l\u2019accord rapidement sans avoir obtenu de conseils juridiques ou avoir re\u00e7u communication de renseignements financiers. Il soutient que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas fait preuve de suffisamment de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions discr\u00e9tionnaires et des conclusions factuelles tir\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance au sujet de la communication et des conseils juridiques, de m\u00eame que sur la question de savoir si les parties avaient conclu un accord valide.\n[56] Les d\u00e9cisions des juges de premi\u00e8re instance en mati\u00e8re de droit de la famille commandent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence des cours d\u2019appel sauf en cas d\u2019erreur de droit, d\u2019erreur importante dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve, de d\u00e9faut d\u2019examiner tous les facteurs pertinents, de consid\u00e9ration d\u2019un facteur qui n\u2019est pas pertinent, ou lorsque la d\u00e9cision est erron\u00e9e au point de cr\u00e9er une injustice (Nouveau\u2011Brunswick (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services communautaires) c. C. (G.C.), [1988] 1 R.C.S. 1073, p. 1077; Van de Perre c. Edwards, 2001 CSC 60, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 1014, par. 11\u201114; Boston c. Boston, 2001 CSC 43, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 413, par. 73; Tysseland c. Tysseland, 2022 SKCA 39, par. 12 (CanLII), citant Ackerman c. Ackerman, 2014 SKCA 137, 451 Sask. R. 132, par. 23).\n[57] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019accord au moment de r\u00e9partir les biens familiaux. Rien n\u2019indique que l\u2019accord n\u2019\u00e9tait pas obligatoire, qu\u2019une partie a profit\u00e9 de l\u2019autre ou n\u2019a pas compris l\u2019entente. L\u2019accord constituait donc un facteur pertinent qui m\u00e9ritait d\u2019\u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement pris en consid\u00e9ration, et le juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9cider si le contenu de l\u2019accord \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quitable au regard du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif.\nA. Validit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord\n[58] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question pertinente \u00e0 se poser concernant la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord est de savoir s\u2019il y a eu \u00ab accord des volont\u00e9s \u00bb, ou consensus ad idem, sur toutes les modalit\u00e9s essentielles de l\u2019accord (voir Jedfro Investments (U.S.A.) Ltd. c. Jacyk, 2007 CSC 55, [2007] 3 R.C.S. 679, par. 16; J. D. McCamus, The Law of Contracts (3e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 31 et 97; voir aussi Tether c. Tether, 2008 SKCA 126, 314 Sask. R. 121, par. 62).\n[59] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que l\u2019accord ressemblait davantage \u00e0 un \u00ab avant\u2011contrat \u00bb parce qu\u2019il reportait \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure le r\u00e8glement du sort du foyer familial et parce que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait par la suite communiqu\u00e9 avec l\u2019\u00e9poux pour lui demander d\u2019officialiser l\u2019accord conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 38 et d\u2019\u00e9valuer ses int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que ces derni\u00e8res tentatives de communication affaiblissaient l\u2019argument de l\u2019\u00e9pouse selon lequel l\u2019accord \u00e9tait obligatoire. Il a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques [traduction] \u00ab suffi[sait] \u00e0 elle seule pour [le] rendre inex\u00e9cutoire \u00bb, m\u00eame si, comme l\u2019a estim\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel, on ne sait pas avec certitude si ses commentaires sur ce point se rapportaient \u00e0 son analyse de l\u2019accord au regard de l\u2019art. 38 ou de l\u2019art. 40 (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 108; motifs de la C.A., par. 66). La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge avait fait erreur sur tous les points, et que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait obligatoire (par. 100).\n[60] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur de principe en concluant qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un accord obligatoire. L\u2019accord des volont\u00e9s des parties sur toutes les modalit\u00e9s essentielles ne signifie pas qu\u2019elles ne peuvent pas reporter \u00e0 plus tard le r\u00e8glement final d\u2019une question lorsqu\u2019elles ont, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pr\u00e9vu dans leur accord un m\u00e9canisme d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et objectif pour la r\u00e9soudre ult\u00e9rieurement. L\u2019accord stipulait que la maison serait rachet\u00e9e ou vendue, que les parties en obtiendraient une \u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendante, que les objets m\u00e9nagers resteraient dans la maison ou seraient r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s et r\u00e9partis et que les parties r\u00e9soudraient tout litige par la m\u00e9diation.\n[61] Il n\u2019est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019accord r\u00e8gle toutes les questions de partage des biens entre les parties. Il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre un accord partiel et un accord incomplet, et la Loi n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019un accord traite de toutes les questions relatives aux biens familiaux pour qu\u2019on puisse lui donner de l\u2019importance. Les conjoints peuvent par exemple s\u2019entendre pour soustraire certains biens \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales tout en stipulant que tous les autres biens seront partag\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LBF (voir, p. ex., le par. 24(3)).\n[62] Enfin, il vaut la peine de pr\u00e9ciser que, peu importe ce que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance voulait dire par son observation sur l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques, l\u2019intervention d\u2019un conseiller juridique n\u2019est pas une condition indispensable au caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire d\u2019un accord vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 40, comme c\u2019est le cas selon l\u2019art. 38. Je conviens en outre avec la Cour d\u2019appel que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en concluant que les tentatives ult\u00e9rieures faites par l\u2019\u00e9pouse pour communiquer avec l\u2019\u00e9poux permettaient de penser que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait un \u00ab avant\u2011contrat \u00bb. Rien n\u2019indiquait que l\u2019accord \u00e9tait conditionnel \u00e0 la signature d\u2019un accord formel ou qu\u2019il ne constituait pas entre les parties d\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif de la r\u00e9partition de leurs biens familiaux.\n[63] \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu \u00e0 juste titre que l\u2019accord liait les parties.\nB. Int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation\n[64] L\u2019\u00e9poux soutient qu\u2019il serait in\u00e9quitable d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019accord parce que les parties n\u2019ont pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une communication formelle de leur situation financi\u00e8re ni consult\u00e9 un conseiller juridique avant de le signer. Bien que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019ait pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la communication dans ses motifs, il a conclu que les parties [traduction] \u00ab connaissaient de toute \u00e9vidence tr\u00e8s peu la valeur des actifs et des dettes de l\u2019autre \u00bb ou les droits que leur conf\u00e9rait la LBF (par. 111). L\u2019\u00e9poux sugg\u00e8re que la premi\u00e8re partie de cette affirmation refl\u00e8te la grande importance que le juge a accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019absence de communication, ajoutant que la Cour d\u2019appel aurait d\u00fb faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette conclusion. Mais la Cour d\u2019appel a not\u00e9 dans ses motifs que l\u2019\u00e9poux n\u2019avait pas [traduction] \u00ab fait allusion \u00e0 une communication inad\u00e9quate ou \u00e0 une connaissance in\u00e9gale de l\u2019actif et du passif respectif des parties \u00bb au cours de la proc\u00e9dure (par. 103). En ce qui concerne la compr\u00e9hension des parties, la Cour d\u2019appel a mis en \u00e9vidence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui r\u00e9v\u00e9laient que les parties avaient pris connaissance de leur situation financi\u00e8re respective au d\u00e9but du mariage (par. 114).\n[65] En ce qui concerne l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques, la Cour d\u2019appel a fait remarquer que l\u2019intervention d\u2019un conseiller juridique n\u2019est pas une exigence de l\u2019art. 40 et que l\u2019absence de consultation de conseillers juridiques en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019avait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 d\u2019iniquit\u00e9, compte tenu de la dur\u00e9e relativement courte du mariage et de simplicit\u00e9 relative de l\u2019accord (par. 104).\n[66] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que ni l\u2019absence de communication ni le d\u00e9faut de recevoir des conseils juridiques ne justifiaient le rejet de l\u2019accord. Tout d\u2019abord, la communication n\u2019est pas une condition l\u00e9gale pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 respecter pour reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re ex\u00e9cutoire d\u2019un accord sous le r\u00e9gime de la LBF, m\u00eame dans le cas d\u2019un contrat familial. Le paragraphe 27(1) pr\u00e9voit plut\u00f4t que le tribunal peut ordonner la communication de renseignements financiers entre les conjoints lorsqu\u2019une requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite en vertu de la LBF. La pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce est donc diff\u00e9rente de l\u2019affaire Colucci, dans laquelle le r\u00e9gime de pension alimentaire pour enfants reposait enti\u00e8rement sur la communication entre les parties (voir les par. 48\u201150).\n[67] Puisque la communication n\u2019est pas une exigence de la loi, l\u2019absence de communication n\u2019est pertinente que si elle a compromis l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus de n\u00e9gociation. Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 notre Cour \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, la communication est essentielle en droit de la famille pour pr\u00e9venir la d\u00e9sinformation et l\u2019exploitation (voir Rick, par. 47; Colucci, par. 51). Dans les situations abusives, notre Cour a reconnu l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de communiquer pleinement et franchement tous les renseignements financiers pertinents dans les affaires de droit de la famille (Rick, par. 47). Toutefois, m\u00eame pour ce qui est des r\u00e8gles de common law relatives aux situations abusives, l\u2019objectif d\u2019exiger la communication entre les parties contractantes est d\u2019emp\u00eacher une partie d\u2019induire l\u2019autre en erreur ou d\u2019exploiter une asym\u00e9trie d\u2019information (par. 47\u201148, 58 et 63). Le manque de communication ne justifie pas forc\u00e9ment en soi l\u2019intervention du tribunal (par. 49). Le tribunal peut toutefois intervenir lorsque l\u2019absence de communication est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019informations erron\u00e9es, ou lorsqu\u2019elle conduit \u00e0 un accord qui d\u00e9roge de fa\u00e7on marqu\u00e9e aux objectifs de la loi applicable (par. 53). En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019accent est mis sur le pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un acc\u00e8s in\u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019information.\n[68] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019absence de communication ne s\u2019est pas traduite par une injustice pour l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties. M\u00eame si les parties ne connaissaient peut\u2011\u00eatre pas la valeur exacte de leur actif et passif respectifs \u00e0 la date de la s\u00e9paration, aucune d\u2019elles n\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019autre aurait dissimul\u00e9 des renseignements importants ou l\u2019aurait induite en erreur d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re. Il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la communication \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une asym\u00e9trie d\u2019information r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre des forces en pr\u00e9sence dans la relation. En fait, l\u2019\u00e9poux n\u2019a signal\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il aurait subi en raison de l\u2019absence de communication. La pr\u00e9sente affaire est totalement diff\u00e9rente par exemple de l\u2019affaire Rick, dans laquelle notre Cour a annul\u00e9 un accord de s\u00e9paration lorsque le mari avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis de communiquer des actifs importants et avait exploit\u00e9 psychologiquement son \u00e9pouse, qui \u00e9tait mentalement instable, ce qui avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un accord qui d\u00e9rogeait de fa\u00e7on marqu\u00e9e \u00ab aux objectifs inscrits dans les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes et \u00e0 l\u2019intention incontest\u00e9e des parties de se diviser les biens en parts \u00e9gales \u00bb (par. 53).\n[69] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour assurer un processus de n\u00e9gociation \u00e9quitable. En estimant [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s troublante \u00bb l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a insist\u00e9 sur le r\u00f4le de l\u2019avocat de contrer le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre du pouvoir de n\u00e9gociation qui peut par ailleurs \u00ab s\u2019av\u00e9rer d\u00e9terminant \u00bb dans la n\u00e9gociation de contrats conjugaux lorsque les conjoints ne connaissent pas les droits que leur conf\u00e8re la loi (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 108 et 99). Cependant, il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve d\u2019un tel d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre entre les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ainsi que notre Cour l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9, il ne faut pas simplement pr\u00e9sumer la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 parce que les accords sont n\u00e9goci\u00e9s et conclus dans un contexte de stress \u00e9motif; toute conclusion de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 doit reposer sur la preuve (Miglin, par. 82)\n[70] Il ne fait aucun doute, comme l\u2019a reconnu le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que la participation des avocats est une mesure de protection importante pour s\u2019assurer que les parties comprennent les modalit\u00e9s et l\u2019effet de leur accord, de m\u00eame que les droits qui leur sont reconnus par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif applicable et auxquels elles renoncent. Tout comme pour la communication de renseignements financiers, la participation d\u2019avocats \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019un contrat conjugal aide \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les pr\u00e9judices d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la relation des parties ou au processus de n\u00e9gociation. Par exemple, l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants aide \u00e0 compenser les d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibres ou les lacunes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019information qui peuvent se traduire par un accord qui est sensiblement injuste pour l\u2019une des parties ou les deux. De plus, l\u2019obtention de conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants et la communication de renseignements financiers sont souvent interreli\u00e9es sur le plan fonctionnel, en ce sens que les conseils juridiques peuvent jouer un r\u00f4le important dans la r\u00e9alisation des avantages que pr\u00e9sente une communication compl\u00e8te et franche. Par exemple, une partie qui ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas des conseils d\u2019un avocat pourrait ne pas savoir qu\u2019elle peut demander la communication et ne pas comprendre la signification juridique des actifs qui sont divulgu\u00e9s.\n[71] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, rien n\u2019indique que les parties n\u2019ont pas compris les modalit\u00e9s ou l\u2019effet de leur accord. On n\u2019a pas non plus affirm\u00e9 que la relation des parties ou sa rupture \u00e9tait caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9, le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre ou l\u2019exploitation. Et m\u00eame si les parties n\u2019\u00e9taient peut\u2011\u00eatre pas des experts en ce qui concerne le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9partition des biens \u00e9tabli par la LBF, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019accord, \u00e9valu\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous au regard de la Loi, constitue une indication fiable pour s\u2019assurer que toute lacune en mati\u00e8re d\u2019information n\u2019a finalement pas caus\u00e9 de pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des conjoints. Je constate que l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux de \u00ab r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et de consulter un avocat \u00bb avant de signer l\u2019accord, mais que l\u2019\u00e9poux a refus\u00e9 et a sign\u00e9 l\u2019accord sur\u2011le\u2011champ. Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019absence de conseils juridiques n\u2019a pas [traduction] \u00ab supplant\u00e9 l\u2019autonomie de la volont\u00e9 des parties contractantes \u00bb ni entra\u00een\u00e9 par ailleurs d\u2019injustice dans le processus de n\u00e9gociation (par. 67).\n[72] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de ne pas tenir compte de l\u2019accord dans la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux. Les questions qui restent \u00e0 trancher sont de savoir quelle importance il convient d\u2019accorder au contenu de l\u2019accord en application de l\u2019art. 21, et si la r\u00e9partition des biens effectu\u00e9e par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur justifiant l\u2019infirmation de leur d\u00e9cision.\nC. R\u00e9partition des biens familiaux\n[73] Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait abstraction du contenu de l\u2019accord et a \u00e9galis\u00e9 les biens familiaux conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi. Ce faisant, il n\u2019a pas tenu compte d\u2019un facteur pertinent dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, et son ordonnance ne commande donc pas la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Ses conclusions de fait n\u2019ont toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es. Pour \u00e9galiser les biens familiaux, le juge a tir\u00e9 des conclusions sur la valeur des biens \u00e0 trois dates possibles : la date de la requ\u00eate en divorce de l\u2019\u00e9pouse (d\u00e9cembre 2015), la date de la requ\u00eate reconventionnelle de l\u2019\u00e9poux en vue d\u2019obtenir la r\u00e9partition des biens en vertu de la LBF (mai 2017) et la date du proc\u00e8s (juin 2018). Il a \u00e9galis\u00e9 la plupart des biens familiaux en utilisant les valeurs de mai 2017, mais a choisi juin 2018 comme date appropri\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer le foyer familial, les pensions et les investissements des parties, et les int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux, parce que la valeur de ces actifs avait chang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration en raison des forces du march\u00e9 (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 253, 261\u2011262 et 264\u2011265). Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a finalement r\u00e9duit le montant d\u00fb par l\u2019\u00e9pouse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux de 8 000 $ pour tenir compte du silence de l\u2019\u00e9poux au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi la conclusion de l\u2019accord.\n[74] Ayant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019accord devait se voir accorder une grande importance, la Cour d\u2019appel a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 lui donner effet en r\u00e9partissant tous les biens familiaux \u00e0 la date de la requ\u00eate en divorce pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9pouse en d\u00e9cembre 2015. L\u2019\u00e9poux soutient que le choix de cette date d\u2019\u00e9valuation contrevient \u00e0 la Loi, qui pr\u00e9voit que la valeur des biens matrimoniaux est celle qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi ou \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision est rendue (voir le par. 2(1) \u00ab valeur \u00bb). Selon l\u2019\u00e9poux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9pouse n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux dans sa requ\u00eate en divorce, d\u00e9cembre 2015 n\u2019est pas une date d\u2019\u00e9valuation appropri\u00e9e puisqu\u2019aucune requ\u00eate n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la LBF \u00e0 ce moment.\n[75] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e tant par l\u2019un que par l\u2019autre tribunal pour r\u00e9partir les biens familiaux comporte des lacunes, et ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre n\u2019est juste et \u00e9quitable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019accord, du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la LBF et du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019ait pas pris en compte le contenu de l\u2019accord au moment de r\u00e9partir les biens familiaux, la r\u00e9partition effectu\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel a sap\u00e9 activement l\u2019accord et cr\u00e9\u00e9 une injustice. Cette iniquit\u00e9 ressort clairement si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re deux actifs cl\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour d\u2019appel, avec d\u2019importantes cons\u00e9quences pour l\u2019ordonnance d\u00e9finitive : le foyer familial et les int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux. Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont toutes les deux \u00e9galis\u00e9 l\u2019un de ces actifs d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a abouti \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat injuste pour les parties et qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intention de l\u2019accord.\n[76] Examinons d\u2019abord le foyer familial. Il est clair que la date d\u2019\u00e9valuation retenue par la Cour d\u2019appel a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une ordonnance qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas juste et \u00e9quitable, que cette date aille \u00e0 l\u2019encontre ou non du par. 2(1) de la Loi. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a pour sa part \u00e9valu\u00e9 le foyer familial \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s afin de donner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux une part \u00e9gale du patrimoine auquel il avait contribu\u00e9 sans interruption : il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s en juin 2018. De plus, l\u2019intention des parties, telle qu\u2019exprim\u00e9e dans l\u2019accord, \u00e9tait de reporter \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure le r\u00e8glement de la question du foyer. Utiliser la valeur attribu\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 2015 au foyer familial pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux priverait injustement l\u2019\u00e9poux de sa part dans la croissance de la valeur nette de la maison, porterait atteinte \u00e0 la forte pr\u00e9somption de partage \u00e9gal du foyer familial pr\u00e9vue par la Loi et contredirait sensiblement l\u2019accord (voir les al. 21(3)a) et q) et le par. 22(1)). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance pour dire que l\u2019\u00e9poux devrait recevoir la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur nette de la maison \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s.\n[77] Pourtant, m\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9valuation du foyer familial par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9e, le partage des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des dates retenues par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s probl\u00e9matique. L\u2019approche de la Cour d\u2019appel permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de r\u00e9aliser un gain fortuit en \u00e9galisant les int\u00e9r\u00eats en question \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 l\u2019entreprise enregistrait des r\u00e9sultats inhabituellement bons, alors que les parties avaient convenu que l\u2019\u00e9pouse n\u2019aurait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019entreprise. Selon le dossier, 2015 est la seule ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle l\u2019investissement de l\u2019\u00e9poux dans Globe\u2011Elite a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un rendement positif net. Aux termes de l\u2019accord, l\u2019\u00e9pouse avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 tous ses droits sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux au moment de la s\u00e9paration, en juillet 2015, alors que la valeur de l\u2019entreprise \u00e9tait \u00e0 son apog\u00e9e. L\u2019entreprise a perdu de l\u2019argent chaque ann\u00e9e par la suite, et la valeur des int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019\u00e9poux a baiss\u00e9 de 160 000 $ entre d\u00e9cembre 2015 et mai 2017 (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 266). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas [traduction] \u00ab juste, raisonnable ou appropri\u00e9 \u00bb d\u2019utiliser l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9lev\u00e9e de Globe\u2011Elite en d\u00e9cembre 2015, compte tenu du ralentissement financier que l\u2019entreprise avait connu par la suite (par. 181\u2011182). Je suis du m\u00eame avis. Accorder \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse une part gonfl\u00e9e de la participation de l\u2019\u00e9poux dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 serait injuste pour l\u2019\u00e9poux et contredirait directement les intentions claires exprim\u00e9es par les parties au moment de conclure leur accord.\n[78] Mais alors qu\u2019une date d\u2019\u00e9valuation de d\u00e9cembre 2015 permettrait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de r\u00e9aliser un gain fortuit, la date d\u2019\u00e9valuation de juin 2018 retenue par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance la d\u00e9savantagerait consid\u00e9rablement en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 assumer une part du fardeau de la pi\u00e8tre performance de l\u2019entreprise. Tout au long du mariage, l\u2019\u00e9pouse a manifest\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord avec la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019\u00e9poux d\u2019investir dans cette entreprise et a refus\u00e9 de contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019achat d\u2019actions. L\u2019\u00e9poux s\u2019est lourdement endett\u00e9 \u2014 en son nom personnel \u2014 pour financer cet investissement parce que l\u2019\u00e9pouse ne voulait pas y participer (voir l\u2019al. 21(3)o)). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la valeur de l\u2019investissement n\u2019a fait que diminuer au fil du temps, une date d\u2019\u00e9valuation plus tardive profite financi\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux dans toute r\u00e9partition de ces int\u00e9r\u00eats. Compte tenu du fait que l\u2019\u00e9poux a attendu pr\u00e8s de deux ans pour contester l\u2019accord et demander la r\u00e9partition des biens, le choix d\u2019une date d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui non seulement compromet les termes de l\u2019accord, mais r\u00e9compense l\u2019\u00e9poux pour son retard produirait une ordonnance \u00ab injuste et in\u00e9quitable \u00bb dans les circonstances (voir le par. 21(2)). Tout comme l\u2019\u00e9pouse ne devrait pas participer aux profits enregistr\u00e9s par l\u2019entreprise, elle ne devrait pas non plus \u00eatre tenue responsable des pertes subies par l\u2019entreprise apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration.\n[79] Comme la Cour d\u2019appel a clairement mal appliqu\u00e9 la LBF, la question de la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e se pose toujours. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne servirait \u00e0 rien de renvoyer la pr\u00e9sente affaire pour qu\u2019elle soit jug\u00e9e de nouveau apr\u00e8s tout ce temps. En cons\u00e9quence, je passe \u00e0 l\u2019enjeu de l\u2019application du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif sur les biens en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La premi\u00e8re question est de savoir s\u2019il serait juste et \u00e9quitable en vertu de l\u2019al. 21(3)a) de ne pas ordonner la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales, compte tenu de l\u2019accord. Il y a lieu de tenir s\u00e9rieusement compte de l\u2019accord, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il refl\u00e8te la conception qu\u2019avaient les parties d\u2019un partage \u00e9quitable des biens dans le contexte de leur relation au moment de la s\u00e9paration. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, je suis d\u2019avis que la solution propos\u00e9e par les parties \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quitable au regard du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif (par. 120).\n[80] L\u2019accord refl\u00e8te l\u2019intention des parties de se s\u00e9parer en parts \u00e9gales le foyer familial et les objets m\u00e9nagers, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales que la LBF \u00e9tablit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du foyer familial (voir le par. 22(1)), et garde essentiellement s\u00e9par\u00e9s les autres biens familiaux (y compris les placements, entreprises, pensions et dettes de chacune des parties). Comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, au moment du mariage, les deux parties poss\u00e9daient d\u00e9j\u00e0 des maisons, des v\u00e9hicules, des \u00e9conomies et des biens personnels [traduction] \u00ab dans des proportions qui, sans \u00eatre \u00e9gales, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas non plus d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9es au point de constituer une alliance \u00e9conomique abusive \u00bb (par. 9 et 268) (voir l\u2019al. 21(3)d)). Leur mariage a \u00e9t\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e, et rien n\u2019indique que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties ait contribu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re disproportionn\u00e9e aux responsabilit\u00e9s de leur partenariat ou ait souffert de sa rupture (voir les al. 21(3)b) et e) \u00e0 g)). Dans ces conditions, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de permettre \u00e0 chaque partie de conserver ses propres biens et de renoncer \u00e0 toute revendication sur les biens de l\u2019autre.\n[81] Outre le foyer familial et les objets m\u00e9nagers, la r\u00e9partition en parts \u00e9gales des biens familiaux selon la LBF entra\u00eene une injustice. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, les dates d\u2019\u00e9valuation retenues par les deux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures pour un actif important ont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 injustement une des deux parties, compte tenu surtout de l\u2019accord. L\u2019\u00e9galisation \u00e0 laquelle les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 a par ailleurs eu pour effet de partager d\u2019autres biens importants que les parties avaient l\u2019intention de garder s\u00e9par\u00e9s, comme les pensions et les R\u00c9ER des parties, qui constituent des biens personnels que chaque partie poss\u00e9dait avant le mariage et dont la valeur n\u2019a naturellement fait qu\u2019augmenter au fil du temps. Je ne vois pas pourquoi les parties devraient \u00eatre forc\u00e9es de partager cette plus\u2011value deux ans apr\u00e8s leur s\u00e9paration, ce qui serait le r\u00e9sultat pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 si l\u2019on appliquait la Loi. \u00c0 l\u2019exception du foyer familial, des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de l\u2019\u00e9poux et des pensions et placements personnels des parties, le reste des biens familiaux est constitu\u00e9 principalement d\u2019outils, de bijoux et de comptes bancaires qui n\u2019ont pas de valeur significative par rapport aux autres actifs.\n[82] Il serait \u00e9galement in\u00e9quitable d\u2019\u00e9galiser les biens familiaux en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce compte tenu du retard de l\u2019\u00e9poux \u00e0 contester l\u2019accord. \u00c0 la date du proc\u00e8s, en juin 2018, les parties ne faisaient plus vie commune depuis presque aussi longtemps qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9es (voir l\u2019al. 21(3)c)). Le dossier indique qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, les parties consid\u00e9raient depuis pr\u00e8s de deux ans que leurs affaires pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9solues au moyen d\u2019un accord, comme le montrent leurs agissements entre la date de l\u2019accord et la requ\u00eate reconventionnelle de l\u2019\u00e9poux (voir l\u2019al. 21(3)a)). L\u2019\u00e9poux a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 ses meubles qui se trouvaient dans le foyer familial et a encaiss\u00e9 une partie de ses R\u00c9ER, et l\u2019\u00e9pouse a r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9 la camionnette \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux et a vendu une remorque qu\u2019elle utilisait avec l\u2019\u00e9poux pendant le mariage (motifs de la C.A., par. 78 et 122). Le comportement de l\u2019\u00e9poux a amen\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse \u00e0 croire que la question de la r\u00e9partition des biens avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, de sorte qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la r\u00e9partition des biens dans sa requ\u00eate en divorce. Tout retard dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation des actifs ne profite donc qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les changements op\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la valeur d\u2019actifs importants apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration. Selon moi, il serait injuste que l\u2019\u00e9poux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie du retard qu\u2019il a caus\u00e9.\n[83] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019accord devrait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses modalit\u00e9s, comme l\u2019a demand\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse devant la Cour d\u2019appel (bien que, devant notre Cour, elle ait tent\u00e9 de faire confirmer la r\u00e9partition des biens ordonn\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel). Comme la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a reconnu, cette solution [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9sente une certaine logique et un certain attrait \u00bb (par. 132). Les parties \u00e9taient les mieux plac\u00e9es pour organiser les biens familiaux limit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant de leur bref mariage et, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, la solution la plus juste et la plus \u00e9quitable consiste \u00e0 donner effet \u00e0 leur accord peu compliqu\u00e9.\n[84] Les seuls biens dont l\u2019accord pr\u00e9voyait la r\u00e9partition \u00e9taient le foyer familial et les objets m\u00e9nagers. Je limiterais le calcul de l\u2019\u00e9galisation \u00e0 ces seuls actifs. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, il \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable d\u2019\u00e9valuer le foyer familial \u00e0 la date du proc\u00e8s, compte tenu de la contribution constante de l\u2019\u00e9poux au paiement de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et des modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019accord de s\u00e9paration. Aucune circonstance ne justifie que l\u2019on d\u00e9roge \u00e0 la forte pr\u00e9somption de r\u00e9partition \u00e9gale du foyer familial pr\u00e9vue par la LBF (voir le par. 22(1)). La r\u00e9partition des biens en question selon leur valeur au moment du proc\u00e8s se solde pour l\u2019\u00e9pouse en une dette de 43 382,63 $ envers l\u2019\u00e9poux.\nV. Dispositif\n[85] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel concernant la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux et d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux la somme de 43 382,63 $. Comme les deux parties obtiennent partiellement gain de cause devant notre Cour, chacune d\u2019elles supportera ses propres d\u00e9pens devant notre Cour.\nANNEXE\nR\u00e9partition des biens matrimoniaux\n21(1) Sur requ\u00eate d\u2019un conjoint sollicitant la r\u00e9partition des biens familiaux, le tribunal doit, sous r\u00e9serve des exceptions, exemptions et consid\u00e9rations d\u2019equity mentionn\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente loi, ordonner la r\u00e9partition \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales entre les conjoints des biens familiaux ou de leur valeur.\n(2) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 22, le tribunal \u00e9tant convaincu, compte tenu des facteurs mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe (3), qu\u2019il serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable d\u2019ordonner la r\u00e9partition

avant ou apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente loi . . .;\nj) de l\u2019obligation fiscale qui peut \u00eatre support\u00e9e par un conjoint par suite du transfert ou de la vente de biens familiaux ou d\u2019une ordonnance rendue par le tribunal;\nk) du fait qu\u2019un conjoint a dilapid\u00e9 des biens familiaux;\nl) sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe 30(3), de tout avantage qu\u2019a re\u00e7u ou que peut recevoir le conjoint survivant par suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint;\nm) des aliments vers\u00e9s en faveur d\u2019un enfant;\nn) des

familiaux situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la Saskatchewan;\nq) de tous autres faits ou circonstances pertinents.\nR\u00e9partition du foyer conjugal\n22(1) Lorsque le foyer familial fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une requ\u00eate sollicitant une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 21(1), le tribunal, compte tenu de toute incidence fiscale, de tout gr\u00e8vement ou autre dette ou obligation ayant trait au foyer familial, r\u00e9partit entre les conjoints le foyer familial ou sa valeur en parts \u00e9gales, sauf s\u2019il est convaincu:\na) que la r\u00e9partition serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable, compte tenu uniquement de toute circonstance extraordinaire;\nb) que la r\u00e9partition serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable pour le conjoint qui a la garde des enfants.\n. . .\nBiens exclus de la r\u00e9partition\n23(1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (4), la juste valeur marchande au commencement de la relation conjugale des biens familiaux autres qu\u2019un foyer familial ou des objets m\u00e9nagers est exclue de la r\u00e9partition effectu\u00e9e en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie si, selon le cas, ces biens:\na) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis avant le commencement de la relation conjugale par un conjoint du fait d\u2019un don consenti par un tiers, sauf s\u2019il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le don a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 dans l\u2019intention de

paragraphe.\n(4) Le tribunal \u00e9tant convaincu que l\u2019exclusion de biens de la r\u00e9partition serait injuste et in\u00e9quitable peut rendre l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il estime juste et \u00e9quitable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des biens familiaux mentionn\u00e9s au pr\u00e9sent article.\n(5) Pour rendre l\u2019ordonnance vis\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sent article, le tribunal tient compte:\na) des questions mentionn\u00e9es aux alin\u00e9as 21(3)a) \u00e0 p);\nb) des contributions de quelque nature que ce soit que les conjoints ont faites avant le commencement de leur relation

de biens mentionn\u00e9s au pr\u00e9sent article.\nExclusion de biens vis\u00e9s par un contrat familial\n24(1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), mais par d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 toute autre

Pour beaucoup de gens, ses commentaires \u00e9taient d\u00e9sobligeants envers les personnes transgenres et autres personnes 2SLGBTQ+. H, un homme gai, enseignant et ancien pr\u00e9sident d\u2019un grand syndicat d\u2019enseignants de la province, \u00e9tait au premier plan des voix dissidentes, et il a fait des d\u00e9clarations aux m\u00e9dias. H a qualifi\u00e9 les opinions de N de sectaires, transphobes et haineuses; lui a reproch\u00e9 de compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019inclusivit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves transgenres et des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves 2SLGBTQ+ dans les \u00e9coles; et a remis en question son aptitude \u00e0 occuper une charge \u00e9lective.\nN a poursuivi H en diffamation. H a ensuite demand\u00e9 le rejet de l\u2019action en diffamation de N au motif qu\u2019elle constituait une poursuite strat\u00e9gique contre la mobilisation publique (aussi appel\u00e9e \u00ab poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon \u00bb ou \u00ab SLAPP \u00bb) au sens de l\u2019art. 4 de la Protection of Public Participation Act (\u00ab PPPA \u00bb) de la Colombie\u2011Britannique. Le juge en cabinet a accueilli la requ\u00eate et rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action. Il a conclu que H avait une d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal et que la valeur de la protection de son expression l\u2019emportait sur le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par cette expression \u00e0 N. La Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est dite en d\u00e9saccord avec lui sur les deux points et a r\u00e9tabli l\u2019action.\nArr\u00eat (la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 est dissidente) : Le pourvoi est accueilli.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal et O\u2019Bonsawin : Le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public commandait le rejet de l\u2019action sous-jacente ou que N n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 contester ad\u00e9quatement la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal invoqu\u00e9e par H. Par cons\u00e9quent, son ordonnance rejetant l\u2019action en diffamation devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie.\nL\u2019article 4 de la PPPA cr\u00e9e un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s qui donne pour instruction au juge d\u2019ordonner le rejet de l\u2019action qui d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression se rapportant \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, sauf si le demandeur peut convaincre le juge que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de son action est substantiel (sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(i)), que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance (sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii)), et que le pr\u00e9judice que le demandeur a subi du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur est suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de cette expression (al. 4(2)(b)). Une requ\u00eate fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 4 impose tout d\u2019abord au d\u00e9fendeur le fardeau de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019instance d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression qui se rapporte \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (par. 4(1)); le fardeau passant alors au demandeur en application du par. 4(2). L\u2019ordre dans lequel le juge choisit d\u2019aborder chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui figurent au par. 4(2) est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, mais le tribunal doit rejeter l\u2019instance si le demandeur ne s\u2019acquitte pas du fardeau que lui impose soit l\u2019al. 4(2)(a), soit l\u2019al. 4(2)(b). L\u2019article 4 pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s presque identique \u00e0 celui pr\u00e9vu aux par. (3) et (4) de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l\u2019Ontario : la caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de ces deux lois est la reconnaissance du fait que m\u00eame les demandes dont le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 est substantiel seront rejet\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 pr\u00e9server la libre discussion l\u2019emporte sur le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au demandeur que le litige est cens\u00e9 r\u00e9parer. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la grande similitude qui existe entre les lois, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Cour a donn\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 137.1 dans les arr\u00eats 1704604 Ontario Ltd. c. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 CSC 22, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 587, et Bent c. Platnick, 2020 CSC 23, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 645, vaut tout autant pour l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA.\nAux termes de l\u2019al. 4(2)b) de la PPPA, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, le facteur qui milite en faveur de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance est le pr\u00e9judice vraisemblablement subi par le demandeur du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. M\u00eame si, en droit de la diffamation, on pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019adjuger des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation prescrite par l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) exige que le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au demandeur soit suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. Bien que la pr\u00e9somption relative aux dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats puisse \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice, elle ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir que ce pr\u00e9judice est grave.\nPour obtenir gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation, le demandeur doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettent au juge de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice d\u2019une ampleur suffisante pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. De plus, la loi oblige qu\u2019il y ait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettant au juge de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur et le pr\u00e9judice subi. Lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019est pas la seule personne \u00e0 avoir d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 le demandeur, l\u2019inf\u00e9rence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur et le pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur devient \u00e0 la fois plus importante et plus difficile. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu du peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par N au sujet du pr\u00e9judice, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que N n\u2019avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 presque aucune preuve du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il avait subi du fait des d\u00e9clarations de H.\nLe pr\u00e9judice qui importe pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public est le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au demandeur par les d\u00e9clarations du d\u00e9fendeur, et non l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur d\u2019ester en justice. La perte du droit d\u2019ester en justice est un r\u00e9sultat possible de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et non un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de celle-ci. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait que la Cour d\u2019appel a tenu compte de l\u2019effet paralysant d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur de poursuivre son action en diffamation renverse ce concept. La jurisprudence de la Cour sur la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation que le risque de se voir infliger une sanction l\u00e9gale pousse des citoyens \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de commenter des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019infliger une sanction l\u00e9gale \u00e0 H dissuaderait N et d\u2019autres personnes d\u2019exprimer des points de vue impopulaires. Aucun effet paralysant ne d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019\u00e9ventuels demandeurs de museler leurs opposants et d\u2019obtenir des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats par le biais d\u2019une poursuite en diffamation.\nDe l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation, il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. Pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette analyse, la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b) de la Charte assujettit le degr\u00e9 de protection accord\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019expression. De m\u00eame, le tribunal peut tenir compte de consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur le par. 15(1) dans le cadre de cette analyse. Comme le reconna\u00eet la Constitution, les expressions n\u2019ont pas toutes la m\u00eame valeur, et le degr\u00e9 de protection \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 une expression particuli\u00e8re peut varier consid\u00e9rablement selon la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019expression, son objet, la motivation qui la sous\u2011tend et la forme sous laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e. Plus l\u2019expression se rapproche de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des valeurs fondamentales consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b), comme la recherche de v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la participation \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions politiques et la diversit\u00e9 des formes d\u2019enrichissement et d\u2019\u00e9panouissement personnels, plus l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la prot\u00e9ger sera important.\nCertaines personnes prennent la parole dans le but de contribuer au d\u00e9bat public en luttant contre des id\u00e9es ignorantes ou pernicieuses au moyen d\u2019une r\u00e9plique \u00e9clair\u00e9e ou compatissante. Dans la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b), ce concept du \u00ab contre\u2011discours \u00bb d\u00e9coule intrins\u00e8quement de la reconnaissance du fait que la libre circulation des id\u00e9es est une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 respecter si l\u2019on veut donner sa pleine valeur \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression. Bien que le contre\u2011discours ne soit pas n\u00e9cessairement une solution compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es pernicieuses, son lien \u00e9troit avec les valeurs fondamentales de l\u2019al. 2b) est incontestable. Le contre\u2011discours motiv\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense d\u2019un groupe de personnes vuln\u00e9rables ou marginalis\u00e9es de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 met aussi en jeu des valeurs qui constituent l\u2019essence du par. 15(1), \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la dignit\u00e9 de tous les \u00eatres humains. Les personnes qui appartiennent \u00e0 un groupe vuln\u00e9rable de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui font l\u2019objet de propos d\u00e9gradants n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement la capacit\u00e9 ou le pouvoir de combattre elles\u2011m\u00eames efficacement les propos pr\u00e9judiciables. L\u2019\u00e9change des id\u00e9es ne se fait alors pas sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, ce qui rend d\u2019autant plus influent et important le contre\u2011discours des d\u00e9fenseurs les plus puissants du groupe ou de l\u2019individu.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019expression de H est un contre\u2011discours motiv\u00e9 par le d\u00e9sir de promouvoir la tol\u00e9rance et le respect envers un groupe marginalis\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. H a pris la parole pour combattre des propos qu\u2019il estimait faux et nuisibles pour les personnes transgenres et d\u2019autres personnes 2SLGBTQ+, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre potentiellement n\u00e9fastes pour les jeunes transgenres. La communaut\u00e9 transgenre est ind\u00e9niablement un groupe marginalis\u00e9 dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. L\u2019histoire des personnes transgenres au Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par la discrimination et les d\u00e9savantages. Les personnes transgenres et autres personnes de genre non conforme ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es avec suspicion et pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la seconde moiti\u00e9 du XXe si\u00e8cle, et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes selon lesquels elles sont malades ou confuses simplement parce qu\u2019elles s\u2019identifient comme transgenres. D\u2019importantes avanc\u00e9es juridiques en mati\u00e8re de droits des personnes trans n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es qu\u2019au cours des 35 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la plupart des changements ayant eu lieu au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, et les tribunaux reconnaissent de plus en plus la situation difficile dans laquelle se trouvent les personnes transgenres au Canada dans la foul\u00e9e des progr\u00e8s l\u00e9gislatifs. Pourtant, malgr\u00e9 certains gains, des tribunaux judiciaires ou administratifs ont reconnu que les personnes transgenres demeurent parmi les citoyens les plus marginalis\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, et qu\u2019elles continuent de se heurter \u00e0 des d\u00e9savantages, des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9.\nLe contre\u2011discours de H se rapprochait des valeurs fondamentales de l\u2019al. 2b). Il servait \u00e0 rechercher la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et en prenant la parole, H cherchait \u00e0 contrer l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es qui, selon ce que lui et d\u2019autres personnes estimaient, s\u2019attaquaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Il y a un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la libert\u00e9 de parole de H sur de telles questions. L\u2019objet de l\u2019intervention de H (commenter la valeur d\u2019une initiative gouvernementale, le besoin d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00fbres et inclusives et l\u2019aptitude d\u2019un candidat \u00e0 exercer une charge publique), la forme qu\u2019il a choisie pour se prononcer (en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une invitation des m\u00e9dias de pr\u00e9senter un point de vue oppos\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un d\u00e9bat en cours) et la motivation sous\u2011jacente (lutter contre l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es discriminatoires et pr\u00e9judiciables et prot\u00e9ger les jeunes transgenres dans les \u00e9coles) m\u00e9ritent tous une protection importante. Il y a lieu de confirmer la conclusion du juge en cabinet suivant laquelle l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de H l\u2019emportait sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le tort caus\u00e9 \u00e0 N.\nLe juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas non plus commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que N n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 contester la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Selon le sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii) de la PPPA, le tribunal doit rendre une ordonnance de rejet, sauf si le demandeur le convainc qu\u2019il existe des motifs de croire que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance. La d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que les citoyens devraient pouvoir exprimer librement leurs v\u00e9ritables opinions sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sans crainte de subir des repr\u00e9sailles sous forme d\u2019une action en diffamation. La d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal comporte cinq \u00e9l\u00e9ments : le commentaire doit porter sur une question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public; il doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur des faits; il doit \u00eatre reconnaissable en tant que commentaire; il doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re objectif (est\u2011ce que n\u2019importe qui pourrait honn\u00eatement exprimer cette opinion vu les faits prouv\u00e9s?); et la personne qui a pris la parole ne peut \u00eatre anim\u00e9e par la malice. L\u2019analyse des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal exige une \u00e9valuation des propos diffamatoires compte tenu de la totalit\u00e9 du contexte dans lequel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, N n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Premi\u00e8rement, N n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que les d\u00e9clarations de H \u00e9taient d\u00e9pourvues de fondement factuel. Pour constituer un commentaire loyal, la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e doit explicitement ou implicitement indiquer quels sont les faits sur lesquels les propos publi\u00e9s sont fond\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins que les faits soient assez notoires pour \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 compris par l\u2019auditoire. Il n\u2019est toutefois pas n\u00e9cessaire que le commentaire soit \u00e9tay\u00e9 par les faits, en ce sens qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les faits en confirment la v\u00e9racit\u00e9. Au proc\u00e8s, H n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que N est sectaire et transphobe, ou qu\u2019il a foment\u00e9 la haine, car il s\u2019agit simplement de savoir si la d\u00e9claration peut \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 un fondement factuel ad\u00e9quat pour permettre au lecteur de juger de sa valeur de fa\u00e7on \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Le premier message que N a publi\u00e9 en ligne pouvait fournir le fondement factuel exig\u00e9 pour la plupart des d\u00e9clarations en cause, parce que les opinions de N \u00e9taient ais\u00e9ment accessibles aux lecteurs et fondaient les d\u00e9clarations de H. En outre, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une controverse locale tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e qui a dur\u00e9 plus d\u2019un an et qui mettait en cause deux personnalit\u00e9s publiques. Les d\u00e9clarations de N \u00e9taient probablement devenues notoires \u00e0 un point tel que les lecteurs les connaissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nQui plus est, il \u00e9tait loisible au juge en cabinet de conclure que l\u2019affront des d\u00e9clarations de H relevait du commentaire et que les lecteurs l\u2019auraient per\u00e7u comme tel. Pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un commentaire loyal, les propos exprim\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre per\u00e7us par le lecteur raisonnable comme relevant du commentaire et non comme un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait. Le contexte est essentiel pour distinguer les commentaires des faits. N n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que les d\u00e9clarations de H ne seraient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un commentaire dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 ou de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 est une affirmation discutable quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit d\u2019une personne, et elle est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un commentaire. De m\u00eame, l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle un politicien n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une critique, et non comme un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait. En dernier lieu, le lecteur ordinaire ne consid\u00e9rerait pas n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019une accusation de discours haineux s\u2019entend d\u2019une infraction au Code criminel . Ce type d\u2019all\u00e9gation est tellement r\u00e9pandu dans l\u2019espace public qu\u2019il d\u00e9borde largement le cadre du sens \u00e9troit reconnu \u00e0 ce terme en droit. Il est \u00e9vident, lorsqu\u2019on les situe dans leur contexte, que les d\u00e9clarations de H, qui exprimaient les convictions de celui\u2011ci, \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur sa propre interpr\u00e9tation des d\u00e9clarations de N.\nEnfin, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur dans son analyse de la malveillance. Une conclusion de croyance subjective honn\u00eate exclut la possibilit\u00e9 de conclure \u00e0 la malveillance; il est possible de tirer pareille conclusion \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve du d\u00e9fendeur, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son ensemble. En fin de compte, le juge en cabinet a conclu qu\u2019il ressortait clairement de l\u2019affidavit de H que ce dernier croyait sinc\u00e8rement aux opinions qu\u2019il d\u00e9fendait, et il lui \u00e9tait loisible de le faire.\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 (dissidente) : Le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de savoir si la Cour est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties, mais de savoir s\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter l\u2019action de N au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instance. Elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. N m\u00e9rite de se faire entendre.\nIl y a d\u00e9saccord avec la structure de l\u2019analyse faite par la majorit\u00e9, laquelle commence par l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, puis examine la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal invoqu\u00e9e par H. Ce n\u2019est pas ainsi qu\u2019il faut effectuer l\u2019analyse. Lorsqu\u2019une requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, le demandeur dans l\u2019instance doit d\u2019abord franchir l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien-fond\u00e9 en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il y a des motifs de croire que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel et que le requ\u00e9rant sous le r\u00e9gime de la PPPA n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cela que le tribunal doit proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public command\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 4(2)b), la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse. En affirmant que l\u2019ordre dans lequel le juge choisit d\u2019aborder chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui figurent au par. 4(2) est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du tribunal, la majorit\u00e9 ignore en fait le r\u00e9cent arr\u00eat Pointes de la Cour, et mine l\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l\u2019Ontario, tout comme de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, soit de faire en sorte qu\u2019un demandeur ayant une demande l\u00e9gitime ne soit pas ind\u00fbment priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire valoir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9.\nSelon le sous\u2011al. 4(2)a)(ii) de la PPPA, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance. La norme n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s exigeante : elle exige la d\u00e9monstration que le droit et le dossier permettent de conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9fense valable, compte tenu du stade de l\u2019instance au cours duquel la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Pour avoir gain de cause, le demandeur n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que chaque d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e ne peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une d\u00e9fense valable; il suffit qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense valable ne puisse \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour certaines d\u00e9clarations ou m\u00eame une seule. Pour cette raison, il importe d\u2019examiner l\u2019affront diffamatoire de chacune des d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es et leur contexte afin de d\u00e9cider si un moyen de d\u00e9fense peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9terminant lorsqu\u2019on fait valoir une d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer pareille d\u00e9fense d\u00e9pend notamment d\u2019un examen attentif de la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la publication dans laquelle elle figure pour d\u00e9cider si elle est reconnaissable en tant que commentaire, et non en tant qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait.\nIl existe une diff\u00e9rence entre un commentaire ou une critique et une all\u00e9gation de fait. Le commentaire a pour caract\u00e9ristique d\u00e9terminante qu\u2019il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impossible d\u2019en faire la preuve. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le commentaire doit \u00eatre clairement reconnaissable en tant que tel et ne pas \u00eatre entrem\u00eal\u00e9 avec des all\u00e9gations de fait \u00e0 un point tel qu\u2019on ne peut distinguer les inf\u00e9rences des faits. Toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doit profiter au demandeur. L\u2019analyse est objective et vise \u00e0 discerner la perception de l\u2019observateur ou du lecteur raisonnable. Le juge en cabinet a superficiellement examin\u00e9 la question. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es \u00e9taient fort semblables \u00e0 celles de l\u2019affaire WIC Radio c. Simpson, 2008 CSC 40, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 420, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des commentaires. Qualifier un propos de commentaire ou d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait participe d\u2019une analyse contextuelle qui d\u00e9bouche tout au plus sur une conclusion mixte de droit et de fait. Transposer une conclusion mixte de droit et de fait dans une autre affaire est une pratique douteuse qu\u2019il convient d\u2019\u00e9viter.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a des motifs de croire que deux des d\u00e9clarations de H ne peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, parce qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en tant qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits, et non en tant que commentaires. Ces d\u00e9clarations ont l\u2019affront diffamatoire suivant lequel N a tenu un discours haineux. Affirmer que N a tenu un discours haineux est bien diff\u00e9rent du fait de porter un jugement ou de faire une remarque dont il est impossible de faire la preuve. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es dans leur contexte, ces all\u00e9gations paraissent semblables aux all\u00e9gations de fraude, de vol ou d\u2019autre conduite criminelle qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits qui ne peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal.\n\u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public suivant l\u2019al. 4(2)b) de la PPPA, ce que le demandeur est tenu de faire, ce n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice ou le lien de causalit\u00e9, mais uniquement de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettront au juge de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019existence du pr\u00e9judice et du lien de causalit\u00e9 pertinent. On peut inf\u00e9rer la gravit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice de celle des d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es, et les all\u00e9gations de discours haineux se situent en haut de l\u2019\u00e9chelle de gravit\u00e9. Que la conduite soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une infraction criminelle ou comme l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, accuser quelqu\u2019un d\u2019avoir tenu un discours haineux ou d\u2019avoir foment\u00e9 la haine contre un groupe identifiable nuit \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de cette personne.\nL\u2019absence d\u2019excuse est un autre facteur aggravant qui accro\u00eet le pr\u00e9judice inflig\u00e9, tout comme la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur. Plus grande est la r\u00e9putation du d\u00e9fendeur, plus les r\u00e9percussions de cette diffamation sur le demandeur devraient \u00eatre importantes. De plus, le contexte de la publication et de la plate\u2011forme sur laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration. L\u2019anonymat procur\u00e9 par Internet, conjugu\u00e9 \u00e0 une accessibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 une diffusion de l\u2019information accrues, peut causer un tort plus grand \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de quelqu\u2019un. Qui plus est, il est erron\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9carter la contribution du d\u00e9fendeur au pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur parce que d\u2019autres ont exprim\u00e9 des critiques du m\u00eame ordre \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de ce dernier. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce stade de l\u2019instance de statuer de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive sur la contribution du d\u00e9fendeur au pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur. En outre, le fait que les d\u00e9clarations du d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019ont pas fait taire le demandeur n\u2019\u00e9carte pas le pr\u00e9judice que ce dernier all\u00e8gue avoir subi.\nLe r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par le tribunal dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public selon la PPPA ne consiste pas et ne devrait pas consister \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la justesse des positions respectives des parties sur un enjeu. La libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression est neutre au plan du contenu et serait s\u00e9rieusement mise \u00e0 mal si l\u2019issue de l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u00e9pendait de la concordance entre les opinions exprim\u00e9es par le d\u00e9fendeur et celles du tribunal. La majorit\u00e9 suit un mauvais raisonnement quand elle justifie le r\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019ordonnance de rejet rendue par le juge en cabinet par le fait que l\u2019expression de H favorise l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une des valeurs oppos\u00e9es en jeu dans une loi visant \u00e0 d\u00e9courager les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons; la protection de la r\u00e9putation de la personne et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression le sont. Qui plus est, la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas l\u2019une des valeurs essentielles qui sous\u2011tendent la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression. Attribuer \u00e0 la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 quelque r\u00f4le que ce soit dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger une expression va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la th\u00e9orie de la neutralit\u00e9 du contenu accept\u00e9e par la Cour dans sa jurisprudence. Fait plus important, la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est aucunement reli\u00e9e au texte de l\u2019al. 4(2)b), et pour cette seule raison, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur pertinent dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nEnfin, restreindre la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019intenter une poursuite en responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle pour diffamation peut avoir un effet paralysant. Dans le contexte du contre\u2011discours diffamatoire, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 priver les parties diffam\u00e9es ayant subi un grave pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019occasion de se faire entendre pourrait fort bien nuire au d\u00e9bat public. Cela peut emp\u00eacher les tenants d\u2019opinions controvers\u00e9es ou impopulaires de venir sur la place publique pour les transmettre. Cette conclusion ne d\u00e9nature pas la notion d\u2019effet paralysant. Priver une partie, par ordonnance judiciaire, de son droit de faire valoir une demande l\u00e9gitime revient \u00e0 lui imposer une sanction juridique.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge en cabinet a ignor\u00e9 \u00e0 tort des facteurs aggravant le pr\u00e9judice que subit ou a vraisemblablement subi N, malgr\u00e9 le fait que ce dernier les a express\u00e9ment plaid\u00e9s. En outre, il ne s\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s longtemps attard\u00e9 aux int\u00e9r\u00eats publics oppos\u00e9s et n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 son attention sur la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019expression, ce qui constitue une erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision. Le juge en cabinet a \u00e9galement eu tort de ne pas tenir compte de l\u2019effet paralysant que le rejet de la demande de N pourrait avoir sur l\u2019expression future d\u2019opinions par d\u2019autres personnes. Le pr\u00e9judice que N subit ou a subi vraisemblablement milite fortement en faveur du fait de permettre la poursuite de l\u2019instance, et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 permettre l\u2019instruction de la r\u00e9clamation de N l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de H.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Karakatsanis\nArr\u00eats appliqu\u00e9s : WIC Radio Ltd. c.

Introduction\n[1] Au c\u0153ur du droit de la diffamation se trouvent deux valeurs oppos\u00e9es : la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et la protection de la r\u00e9putation. L\u2019une et l\u2019autre sont essentielles au maintien d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie fonctionnelle. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi offre l\u2019occasion de clarifier le juste \u00e9quilibre entre ces deux valeurs lorsque les propos exprim\u00e9s en litige portent sur une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[2] Une poursuite en diffamation constitue un des moyens dont dispose une personne pour d\u00e9fendre sa r\u00e9putation personnelle ou professionnelle face \u00e0 une attaque, mais elle peut avoir pour effet ind\u00e9sirable d\u2019\u00e9touffer le d\u00e9bat public qui constitue la pierre angulaire d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique. Pour cette raison, certaines l\u00e9gislatures provinciales se sont attaqu\u00e9es aux poursuites strat\u00e9giques contre la mobilisation publique (aussi appel\u00e9es poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons ou SLAPP) ou aux actions qui r\u00e9priment abusivement la libre expression d\u2019opinions sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. La pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce concerne l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 4 de la loi anti\u2011SLAPP de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, la Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (PPPA).\n[3] La poursuite en diffamation qui est au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente instance d\u00e9coule d\u2019un d\u00e9bat public tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9 qui a fait rage dans la presse \u00e9crite traditionnelle, sur Internet, lors de rassemblements et de manifestations et au cours d\u2019une campagne \u00e9lectorale locale, et qui concernait les mesures prises par la Colombie\u2011Britannique pour lutter contre la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des jeunes transgenres et autres jeunes 2SLGBTQ+.\n[4] Les parties sont toutes deux des personnalit\u00e9s publiques locales. Barry Neufeld, un conseiller scolaire du conseil des \u00e9coles publiques de Chilliwack, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, a publi\u00e9 des messages en ligne dans lesquels il critiquait une initiative du gouvernement provincial visant \u00e0 doter les enseignants d\u2019outils leur permettant d\u2019instruire les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre et l\u2019orientation sexuelle. Les commentaires publi\u00e9s par M. Neufeld ont d\u00e9clench\u00e9 une vive controverse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle locale, suscitant des protestations et des appels \u00e0 sa d\u00e9mission. Pour beaucoup de gens, ses commentaires \u00e9taient d\u00e9sobligeants envers les personnes transgenres et autres personnes 2SLGBTQ+. Glen Hansman, un homme gai, enseignant et ancien pr\u00e9sident de la British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation (BCTF), un grand syndicat d\u2019enseignants de la province, \u00e9tait au premier plan des voix dissidentes, et il a fait des d\u00e9clarations aux m\u00e9dias. Il a qualifi\u00e9 les opinions de M. Neufeld de sectaires, transphobes et haineuses, lui reprochant de compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019inclusivit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves transgenres et des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves 2SLGBTQ+ dans les \u00e9coles et remettant en question son aptitude \u00e0 occuper une charge \u00e9lective.\n[5] Monsieur Neufeld a intent\u00e9 une poursuite en diffamation. Monsieur Hansman a ensuite demand\u00e9 le rejet de l\u2019action en diffamation de M. Neufeld au motif qu\u2019elle constituait une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon au sens de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA. La caract\u00e9ristique centrale de la PPPA est le fait qu\u2019elle donne pour instruction aux tribunaux de rejeter m\u00eame les demandes fond\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le tort caus\u00e9 au demandeur. Elle oblige \u00e9galement le demandeur \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re li\u00e9 au bien\u2011fond\u00e9 en d\u00e9montrant d\u2019une part qu\u2019il existe des motifs de croire que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel et, d\u2019autre part, que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance.\n[6] Le juge en cabinet a conclu que l\u2019action en diffamation de M. Neufeld avait pour effet d\u2019\u00e9touffer ind\u00fbment le d\u00e9bat sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et il a rejet\u00e9 la poursuite (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205). Le juge en cabinet a conclu que M. Hansman avait une d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal et que la valeur de la protection de son expression l\u2019emportait sur le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par cette expression \u00e0 M. Neufeld. La Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est dite en d\u00e9saccord avec lui sur les deux points et a r\u00e9tabli l\u2019action (2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217).\n[7] Je partage l\u2019opinion du juge en cabinet. Monsieur Neufeld a plaid\u00e9 devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et notre Cour qu\u2019il n\u2019avait fait que critiquer une politique et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais exprim\u00e9 de haine envers la communaut\u00e9 transgenre, ajoutant que ses propos n\u2019avaient pas eu pour effet de cr\u00e9er un environnement scolaire \u00e0 risque pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves transgenres. Mais ses arguments passent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la question. Le droit de M. Neufeld de critiquer une initiative gouvernementale n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9. La question centrale est plut\u00f4t de savoir si M. Hansman avait le droit de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 M. Neufeld de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il a choisie sans risquer d\u2019engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 civile. \u00c0 mon avis, il avait ce droit.\n[8] Dans le cadre de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, il s\u2019agit de se demander si une personne pourrait honn\u00eatement partager les opinions exprim\u00e9es par M. Hansman, et si les propos de ce dernier se rapportaient \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et \u00e9taient reconnaissables en tant que commentaires fond\u00e9s sur des faits. Le juge en cabinet a conclu que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas ad\u00e9quatement contest\u00e9 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, et il lui \u00e9tait loisible de rejeter l\u2019instance pour ce motif.\n[9] Or, m\u00eame si M. Neufeld s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, il \u00e9tait loisible au juge en cabinet de rejeter l\u2019action en diffamation parce que le pr\u00e9judice limit\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld ne l\u2019emportait pas sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Les propos de M. Hansman ne constituaient pas une r\u00e9action disproportionn\u00e9e ou gratuite aux d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld, et il y avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat public substantiel \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger son contre\u2011discours. Monsieur Hansman a pris la parole pour d\u00e9noncer des propos que lui et d\u2019autres personnes estimaient discriminatoires et pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des jeunes transgenres et autres jeunes 2SLGBTQ+ \u2014 des groupes particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 l\u2019expression d\u2019opinions qui d\u00e9pr\u00e9cient leur valeur et leur dignit\u00e9 aux yeux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui remettent en question leur identit\u00e9 m\u00eame. Non seulement la protection de l\u2019expression de M. Hansman pr\u00e9serve\u2011t\u2011elle la libert\u00e9 de discussion sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, mais elle favorise aussi l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, une autre valeur d\u00e9mocratique fondamentale.\n[10] Je suis d\u2019avis de r\u00e9tablir l\u2019ordonnance par laquelle le juge en cabinet a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action en diffamation.\nII. Contexte\n[11] Le d\u00e9bat public \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi s\u2019articulait autour des mesures prises par la province en vue de favoriser l\u2019inclusion des personnes transgenres et autres personnes 2SLGBTQ+ et de contrer la discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard dans les \u00e9coles. En 2016, la Colombie\u2011Britannique a modifi\u00e9 son Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, pour y ajouter \u00e0 la liste des motifs de distinction illicite [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 ou l\u2019expression de genre \u00bb. L\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience intime et personnelle de son genre v\u00e9cue profond\u00e9ment par chacun ou au syst\u00e8me social de r\u00f4les, de comportements et d\u2019expressions associ\u00e9s \u00e0 son sexe \u00e0 la naissance[1]. Le concept d\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre est diff\u00e9rent de celui d\u2019expression de genre. On entend par expression de genre la mani\u00e8re dont une personne exprime ouvertement son genre, notamment par son habillement, son comportement, son langage et le choix d\u2019un pronom[2]. Alors que le genre n\u2019\u00e9tait autrefois d\u00e9fini qu\u2019en fonction du mod\u00e8le binaire \u00ab masculin \u00bb ou \u00ab f\u00e9minin \u00bb, aujourd\u2019hui, la conception du genre que se fait la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019est \u00e9largie pour englober un \u00e9ventail d\u2019identit\u00e9s de genre, de modes d\u2019expression et de termes connexes, qui continuent tous d\u2019\u00e9voluer[3].\n[12] Les personnes transgenres sont des personnes dont l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre ne correspond pas au sexe qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance[4]. En avril 2022, le Canada est devenu le premier pays au monde \u00e0 publier des donn\u00e9es de recensement sur les personnes transgenres et non binaires[5]. Le recensement a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019en mai 2021, il y avait plus de 100 000 personnes transgenres ou non binaires \u00e2g\u00e9es de 15 ans et plus au Canada, soit environ une personne sur 300.\n[13] Peu apr\u00e8s la modification apport\u00e9e par la Colombie\u2011Britannique \u00e0 son Human Rights Code en 2016, le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation a ordonn\u00e9 aux conseils scolaires de la Colombie\u2011Britannique d\u2019ajouter \u00ab l\u2019identit\u00e9 ou l\u2019expression de genre \u00bb \u00e0 la liste des motifs de distinction illicite dans leurs codes de conduite des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le minist\u00e8re a \u00e9galement collabor\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres organismes, y compris la BCTF, pour \u00e9laborer un document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 \u00bb ([traduction] \u00ab L\u2019orientation sexuelle et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre 123 \u00bb) (SOGI 123), une initiative visant \u00e0 guider les enseignants sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019enseigner l\u2019orientation sexuelle et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre. La SOGI 123 vise \u00e0 favoriser l\u2019inclusion et le respect \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui, en raison de leur identit\u00e9 ou expression, peuvent \u00eatre victimes de discrimination dans les \u00e9coles de la Colombie\u2011Britannique.\n[14] Monsieur Neufeld a publiquement critiqu\u00e9 la SOGI 123. Sa premi\u00e8re critique a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e sur Facebook le 23 octobre 2017. Il y consid\u00e9rait la SOGI 123 comme un [traduction] \u00ab outil de propagande \u00bb qui enseigne la \u00ab th\u00e9orie biologiquement absurde \u00bb selon laquelle \u00ab le genre n\u2019est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 biologiquement, mais est une construction sociale \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 16). Il d\u00e9plorait \u00e9galement le fait que les enfants se voyaient [traduction] \u00ab enseigner que le mariage h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuel n\u2019est plus la norme \u00bb (p. 16). Il a exprim\u00e9 son soutien envers les [traduction] \u00ab valeurs familiales traditionnelles \u00bb et a fait l\u2019\u00e9loge de pays comme la Russie et le Paraguay, qui ont \u00ab eu le courage de tenir t\u00eate \u00e0 ces nihilistes culturels radicaux \u00bb (p. 16). Il a reconnu qu\u2019en publiant ces propos, il risquait [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019\u00eatre tax\u00e9 d\u2019homophobe sectaire \u00bb, mais il estimait que sa voix devait \u00eatre entendue (p. 16).\n[15] Le message de M. Neufeld a fait rapidement l\u2019objet de vives critiques. Dans les heures qui ont suivi, les grands m\u00e9dias ont publi\u00e9 le message et ont cit\u00e9 des citoyens, des professionnels de l\u2019enseignement et d\u2019autres personnalit\u00e9s publiques qui d\u00e9non\u00e7aient les opinions de M. Neufeld. L\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident du conseil scolaire de Vancouver a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9mission de M. Neufeld et des excuses de ce dernier. Le pr\u00e9sident du conseil consultatif des parents du district de Chilliwack a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab les propos [de M. Neufeld] pr\u00e9conisent l\u2019exclusion et l\u2019isolement d\u2019un sous\u2011groupe croissant d\u2019enfants, y compris ceux qui ont des parents de m\u00eame sexe \u00bb et des \u00e9l\u00e8ves transgenres, ce qui allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de \u00ab l\u2019obligation [de M. Neufeld] d\u2019assurer un environnement d\u2019apprentissage s\u00fbr et positif pour tous \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 144).\n[16] Monsieur Hansman faisait partie des critiques les plus actifs de M. Neufeld. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur les 11 publications o\u00f9 l\u2019on cite des d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Hansman aux m\u00e9dias en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident de la BCTF. Monsieur Hansman a admis avoir fait les d\u00e9clarations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es (motifs du juge en cabinet, par. 44).\n[17] Les trois premi\u00e8res d\u00e9clarations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es le lendemain de la publication du message de M. Neufeld sur Facebook, lorsque les m\u00e9dias ont communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Hansman pour recueillir ses commentaires. Un article du Vancouver Sun contenait la citation suivante :\n[traduction] [Monsieur Neufeld] devrait d\u00e9missionner ou \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 . . .\nCe n\u2019est pas acceptable. Le syst\u00e8me scolaire public de notre province et du Canada a l\u2019obligation d\u2019assurer un environnement scolaire s\u00fbr et inclusif pour tous les enfants, peu importe leur race, nationalit\u00e9 ou religion. Les responsables du syst\u00e8me scolaire doivent s\u2019attaquer en amont au sexisme, \u00e0 la misogynie, \u00e0 la transphobie, \u00e0 l\u2019homophobie et au racisme.\nJe doute que M. Neufeld ignore cette obligation. Je doute qu\u2019il ne soit pas au courant s\u2019il est un conseiller scolaire depuis un certain temps.\n(avis de r\u00e9clamation civile modifi\u00e9, d.a., vol. I, p. 80 (ARCM), par. 14) (d\u00e9claration 1)\n[18] Puis, dans une entrevue accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Global News, M. Hansman a jug\u00e9 les opinions de M. Neufeld [traduction] \u00ab intol\u00e9rantes [et] sectaires \u00bb et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab que . . . cela plaise ou non [\u00e0 M. Neufeld], les membres de la communaut\u00e9 scolaire LGBTQ sont l\u00e0 pour rester \u00bb (ARCM, par. 15) (d\u00e9claration 2).\n[19] Enfin, un article du Huffington Post a rapport\u00e9 que M. Hansman [traduction] \u00ab disait que M. Neufeld devrait d\u00e9missionner parce que ce dernier a[vait] manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir en tant que conseiller scolaire de s\u2019assurer que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et le personnel b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un environnement s\u00fbr et inclusif \u00bb (ARCM, par. 16). Toujours selon cet article, [traduction] \u00ab Hansman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conseillers scolaires qui ont des opinions fond\u00e9es sur leurs convictions religieuses doivent trouver une fa\u00e7on de faire leur travail dans un syst\u00e8me scolaire public la\u00efque \u00bb ou se chercher du travail ailleurs (ARCM, par. 16) (d\u00e9claration 3).\n[20] D\u2019autres personnes ont ajout\u00e9 leur voix au concert de critiques publiques condamnant le message publi\u00e9 par M. Neufeld sur Facebook, notamment le pr\u00e9sident de la British Columbia School Trustees Association, d\u2019autres membres du conseil scolaire de Chilliwack, des militants transgenres et le ministre de l\u2019\u00c9ducation, qui a qualifi\u00e9 les propos de M. Neufeld de [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9pass\u00e9s et sectaires \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 169). De nombreuses personnes ont exprim\u00e9 leur opposition ou leur soutien sur la page Facebook de M. Neufeld.\n[21] Deux jours apr\u00e8s avoir publi\u00e9 son message, M. Neufeld a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses publiques sur sa page Facebook, en affirmant qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab critiquait une ressource documentaire \u00e9ducative, et non des personnes \u00bb et qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab cro[yait] en l\u2019inclusion et en un environnement d\u2019apprentissage s\u00fbr \u00bb pour tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (motifs de la C.A., par. 12).\n[22] Mais les choses n\u2019en sont pas rest\u00e9es l\u00e0. Messieurs Neufeld et Hansman ont continu\u00e9 de s\u2019exprimer publiquement au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui a suivi. D\u2019autres personnes ont \u00e9galement continu\u00e9 de d\u00e9noncer M. Neufeld.\n[23] Environ un mois apr\u00e8s son premier message, M. Neufeld a pris la parole lors d\u2019un rassemblement organis\u00e9 par un groupe appel\u00e9 Culture Guard, qui s\u2019est donn\u00e9 pour mission de mettre fin \u00e0 la [traduction] \u00ab tyrannie politique de l\u2019idiotologie de la rectitude morale \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 70). Dans le cadre de son offensive, Culture Guard cherche \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab ABOLIR la SOGI 123 \u00bb (p. 87). Pendant son discours, M. Neufeld a d\u00e9peint la SOGI 123 comme [traduction] \u00ab une institutionnalisation de la cod\u00e9pendance qui encourage et favorise des comportements et des sch\u00e8mes de pens\u00e9e dysfonctionnels [et qui] cautionne et encourage ce que je consid\u00e8re comme une d\u00e9pendance sexuelle envers la confusion des genres \u00bb (d.a., vol. V, p. 10). Il a pr\u00e9tendu que le fait d\u2019utiliser les ressources de la SOGI 123 dans les salles de classe \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab [u]n d\u00e9tournement cognitif \u00bb et \u00e0 \u00ab une attaque contre le fondement m\u00eame de l\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019enfant, ce qui constitue une forme de maltraitance envers les enfants \u00bb (p. 10).\n[24] Monsieur Neufeld n\u2019a pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la SOGI 123 ses commentaires lors du rassemblement. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le genre est [. . .] indissociable de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 biologique \u00bb et a d\u00e9plor\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019attention que les m\u00e9dias accordaient \u00e0 des personnes transgenres c\u00e9l\u00e8bres avait suscit\u00e9 une \u00ab nouvelle tendance \u00bb de \u00ab confusion des genres \u00bb (p. 11). Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le recours syst\u00e9matique \u00e0 des bloqueurs de pubert\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019hormonoth\u00e9rapie et \u00e0 la r\u00e9assignation sexuelle [est] une forme de maltraitance envers les enfants \u00bb et il a d\u00e9crit la chirurgie de r\u00e9assignation sexuelle comme consistant \u00e0 \u00ab charcuter des parties du corps parfaitement saines \u00bb (p. 10\u201111).\n[25] En janvier 2018, la Chilliwack Teachers\u2019 Association (CTA) a adopt\u00e9 une motion de censure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du conseil scolaire de Chilliwack en raison de son d\u00e9faut d\u2019intervenir dans la foul\u00e9e des d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld sur la SOGI 123. Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e aux m\u00e9dias, la CTA a fait \u00e9tat de pr\u00e9occupations croissantes pour [traduction] \u00ab la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9motionnelle et physique des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, du personnel et des enseignants \u00bb (d.a., vol. IV, p. 157). Reprenant les propos de M. Hansman, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab [i]l arrive parfois que nos convictions, nos valeurs et nos responsabilit\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019\u00e9ducateurs professionnels soient remises en question par des gens qui pr\u00f4nent la haine \u00bb (ARCM, par. 20) (d\u00e9claration 4). Cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e dans deux journaux locaux.\n[26] Par la suite, le conseil scolaire de Chilliwack et le ministre de l\u2019\u00c9ducation ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld de d\u00e9missionner. Il a refus\u00e9 et a publi\u00e9 un communiqu\u00e9 de presse dans lequel il d\u00e9clarait qu\u2019il soutenait tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur orientation sexuelle, leur identit\u00e9 de genre, leur race, leur religion ou leurs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Il a conclu :\n[traduction] Je me suis seulement \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre un aspect des ressources documentaires d\u2019apprentissage SOGI 1\u20112\u20113, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019enseignement de la th\u00e9orie controvers\u00e9e de la fluidit\u00e9 du genre, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme un fait. Malgr\u00e9 les pressions exerc\u00e9es sur moi pour que je d\u00e9missionne, je crois que je dois continuer \u00e0 si\u00e9ger au conseil scolaire pour \u00eatre une voix solitaire prot\u00e9geant des enfants impressionnables qui, je crois, risquent d\u2019\u00eatre confus et l\u00e9s\u00e9s, ce qui entra\u00eenera une augmentation des cas de dysphorie de genre chez les enfants \u00e0 risque.\n(d.a., vol. V, p. 18)\n[27] La dysphorie de genre est un diagnostic clinique que re\u00e7oivent certaines personnes transgenres et autres personnes de diverses identit\u00e9s de genre. Elle se caract\u00e9rise par une [traduction] \u00ab aversion pour une partie ou la totalit\u00e9 des caract\u00e9ristiques physiques ou des r\u00f4les sociaux \u00bb associ\u00e9s au sexe assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance[6].\n[28] \u00c0 la fin de janvier 2018, la BCTF et la CTA ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conjointement devant le tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique une plainte contre M. Neufeld dans laquelle elles reprochaient \u00e0 M. Neufeld d\u2019avoir viol\u00e9 le Human Rights Code de cette province. Selon la plainte, M. Neufeld a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un environnement de travail discriminatoire pour les syndiqu\u00e9s et a publi\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations qui sont discriminatoires ou [traduction] \u00ab susceptible d\u2019exposer les personnes transgenres \u00e0 la haine \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 116). La section locale du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (SCFP) avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte semblable contre M. Neufeld et le conseil scolaire de Chilliwack plus t\u00f4t ce mois\u2011l\u00e0.\n[29] En avril 2018, M. Hansman a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 par divers m\u00e9dias au sujet de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les enseignants. Dans un article, M. Hansman aurait qualifi\u00e9 les commentaires de M. Neufeld de [traduction] \u00ab transphobes \u00bb et reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld d\u2019avoir \u00ab cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour les membres [de la BCTF] et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves un environnement scolaire discriminatoire et hostile \u00bb (ARCM, par. 24) (d\u00e9claration 5). Dans un autre article, M. Hansman aurait dit que M. Neufeld [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019[\u00e9tait] aventur\u00e9 assez loin dans le discours haineux \u00bb et n\u2019avait pas rempli son devoir d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves (par. 25) (d\u00e9claration 6). Un troisi\u00e8me article indiquait que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qualifiait les propos de M. Neufeld de [traduction] \u00ab haineux \u00bb, et qu\u2019ils avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 un environnement scolaire dangereux; il citait en outre M. Hansman, qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019on ne devait pas laisser M. Neufeld \u00ab s\u2019approcher des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00bb (par. 26) (d\u00e9claration 7).\n[30] Toujours en avril, des rassemblements de groupes d\u00e9fendant des positions oppos\u00e9es ont eu lieu devant les bureaux de la BCTF, le premier groupe soutenant la SOGI 123 et l\u2019autre, organis\u00e9 par Culture Guard, s\u2019y opposant. Interview\u00e9 par les m\u00e9dias au sujet de ces rassemblements, M. Hansman s\u2019est dit r\u00e9joui de constater l\u2019appui manifest\u00e9 par le public envers la SOGI 123, compte tenu des [traduction] \u00ab commentaires haineux \u00bb faits par M. Neufeld et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que les \u00e9coles soient \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute discrimination et qu\u2019elles soient un lieu s\u00fbr pour tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (ARCM, par. 28) (d\u00e9claration 8).\n[31] \u00c0 l\u2019approche des \u00e9lections municipales de Chilliwack en octobre 2018, M. Hansman a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 par les m\u00e9dias sur ce qu\u2019il pensait de la liste de candidats anti\u2011SOGI qui briguaient des si\u00e8ges au conseil scolaire de Chilliwack. En septembre, un journal local a publi\u00e9 un article rapportant les propos suivants de M. Hansman :\n[traduction] Il est extr\u00eamement probl\u00e9matique qu\u2019une personne qui se pr\u00e9sente comme candidat \u00e0 un poste de conseiller scolaire continue de r\u00e9pandre la haine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes LGBTQ, et en particulier des personnes trans . . .\n(ARCM, par. 29) (d\u00e9claration 9)\nMonsieur Hansman a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que le racisme et la misogynie existaient toujours au sein du syst\u00e8me scolaire britanno\u2011colombien et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que les candidats \u00e0 un poste de conseiller scolaire [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019engagent \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre ces probl\u00e8mes, et non \u00e0 propager la haine et \u00e0 r\u00e9pandre le sectarisme \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 34). L\u2019article ne mentionnait pas le nom de M. Neufeld ou d\u2019autres candidats, mais soulignait que [traduction] \u00ab certains candidats \u00bb avaient exprim\u00e9 \u00ab des points de vue controvers\u00e9s sur des questions comme le soutien apport\u00e9 aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et aux personnes LGBTQ dans les \u00e9coles \u00bb (p. 33).\n[32] Un mois avant le jour du scrutin, l\u2019avocat de M. Neufeld a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Hansman pour exiger qu\u2019il r\u00e9tracte les d\u00e9clarations qu\u2019il avait faites au sujet de M. Neufeld [traduction] \u00ab sur une p\u00e9riode de plusieurs mois \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 139). La lettre indiquait que des poursuites seraient engag\u00e9es \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une r\u00e9tractation et des excuses ne soient re\u00e7ues dans les 10 jours.\n[33] Le lendemain, lors d\u2019une entrevue accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un journal local, M. Neufeld a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il poursuivait M. Hansman pour diffamation. L\u2019avocat de M. Hansman a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Neufeld pour lui expliquer que M. Hansman ne pr\u00e9senterait pas d\u2019excuses, compte tenu de cette entrevue. La lettre affirmait que la demande d\u2019excuses n\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab dans le meilleur des cas pas sinc\u00e8re, et fort probablement un stratag\u00e8me politique \u00bb, car, alors m\u00eame que M. Neufeld \u00ab exig[eait] des excuses comme moyen d\u2019\u00e9viter une poursuite \u00bb, il \u00ab d\u00e9clar[ait] son intention d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec cette poursuite \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 147\u2011148).\n[34] Huit jours avant le jour du scrutin, M. Neufeld a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et signifi\u00e9 son action en diffamation contre M. Hansman. Les m\u00e9dias ont pris connaissance de la poursuite et ont communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Hansman pour recueillir ses commentaires. Monsieur Hansman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 un journal local qu\u2019il maintenait ce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 et que, en plus des propos que M. Neufeld avait tenus au sujet de la SOGI 123, [traduction] \u00ab ses autres d\u00e9clarations misogynes et probl\u00e9matiques rapport\u00e9es par le Press Progress sont \u00e9galement alarmantes et ne sont pas dignes de la part d\u2019un conseiller scolaire \u00bb (ARCM, par. 42) (d\u00e9claration 10).\n[35] L\u2019article du Press Progress auquel M. Hansman faisait allusion \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 \u00ab This Man is Probably The Worst School Trustee in British Columbia \u00bb ([traduction] \u00ab Cet homme est probablement le pire conseiller scolaire de la Colombie\u2011Britannique \u00bb) (d.a., vol. II, p. 46). En plus de relater la campagne men\u00e9e par M. Neufeld contre la SOGI 123, l\u2019article reproduisait des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran de messages ant\u00e9rieurs publi\u00e9s sur Facebook par M. Neufeld, y compris un message dans lequel M. Neufeld soutenait que le liquide s\u00e9minal masculin \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019un des antid\u00e9presseurs naturels les plus sous\u2011estim\u00e9s pour les femmes \u00bb (p. 49), ajoutant que les femmes qui avaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des rapports sexuels non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e9taient plus heureuses et moins suicidaires que celles qui avaient des rapports prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, fournissant un lien vers un article portant sur une \u00e9tude controvers\u00e9e ayant tir\u00e9 la m\u00eame conclusion. L\u2019article du Press Progress citait un autre message publi\u00e9 sur Facebook dans lequel M. Neufeld a \u00e9crit que lui et d\u2019autres candidats \u00e0 des postes de conseillers scolaires [traduction] \u00ab sont inquiets au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des enfants, \u00e0 qui l\u2019on enseigne des choses stupides selon lesquelles ils peuvent choisir leur sexe et se font dire qu\u2019ils doivent approuver les familles \u201carc\u2011en\u2011ciel\u201d gaies \u00bb (p. 50). Monsieur Neufeld reprochait aux \u00e9glises chr\u00e9tiennes [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019avoir tard\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019opposer \u00e0 ce programme n\u00e9faste \u00bb et affirmait que les \u00e9glises plus tol\u00e9rantes \u00e9taient contamin\u00e9es par le \u00ab christianisme rose \u00bb (p. 50).\n[36] Monsieur Neufeld a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lu pour un autre mandat au conseil scolaire de Chilliwack. Interview\u00e9 au sujet des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019\u00e9lection, M. Hansman a parl\u00e9 de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que la BCTF avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Neufeld et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a haine et le sectarisme n\u2019ont pas leur place dans les conseils scolaires \u00bb (ARCM, par. 44) (d\u00e9claration 11).\n[37] L\u2019instruction de l\u2019action en diffamation de M. Neufeld \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue pour d\u00e9cembre 2019. En mars, la PPPA a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e. M. Hansman a demand\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, le rejet de l\u2019action en diffamation intent\u00e9e par M. Neufeld contre lui. L\u2019article 4 cr\u00e9e un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s qui donne pour instruction au juge d\u2019ordonner le rejet de l\u2019action qui d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression se rapportant \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, sauf si le demandeur peut convaincre le juge que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de son action est substantiel, que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance, et que le pr\u00e9judice que le demandeur a subi du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur est suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de cette expression.\nIII. Historique proc\u00e9dural\nA. Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205 (le juge Ross)\n[38] Le juge en cabinet a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019action pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Hansman. Il a conclu que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli des motifs de croire que M. Hansman n\u2019avait pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance (par. 135). Il a jug\u00e9 que M. Hansman avait une d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal, se fondant sur le raisonnement suivi par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio Ltd. c. Simpson, 2008 CSC 40, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 420, et sur le fait que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas contest\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re convaincante ce moyen de d\u00e9fense (par. 126 et 137).\n[39] Au cas o\u00f9 il se trompait quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, le juge en cabinet a examin\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de son analyse : l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (par. 144 et suiv.). Il a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de M. Hansman l\u2019emportait sur le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019avait vraisemblablement subi M. Neufeld (par. 145). Monsieur Neufeld n\u2019avait [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 presque aucune preuve du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il avait subi \u00bb (par. 161), et il n\u2019avait pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui auraient permis au juge de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le pr\u00e9judice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman (par. 147\u2011150 et 158).\n[40] Le juge en cabinet a estim\u00e9 que, dans bon nombre de ses d\u00e9clarations, M. Hansman avait ou bien formul\u00e9 des commentaires sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00fbres et inclusives ou bien n\u2019avait pas mentionn\u00e9 M. Neufeld. Ces d\u00e9clarations m\u00e9ritaient une protection importante. L\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation militait donc en faveur du rejet de l\u2019action (par. 160).\nB. Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217 (les juges Willcock, Fenlon et Voith)\n[41] S\u2019exprimant au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel, la juge Fenlon a fait droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et a r\u00e9tabli l\u2019action en diffamation. Elle a conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis plusieurs erreurs dans son analyse de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Le juge en cabinet s\u2019\u00e9tait, selon elle, fond\u00e9 \u00e0 tort sur l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences marqu\u00e9es entre cette affaire et la pr\u00e9sente, et en [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019en remettant \u00e0 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du type de commentaires faits par M. Hansman au lieu d\u2019aborder les opinions pr\u00e9cises qu\u2019il avait exprim\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 26\u201127 et 34). Cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse avait amen\u00e9 le juge en cabinet \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal (par. 27\u201129). Selon la juge Fenlon, il y avait des raisons de croire que plusieurs d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient d\u00e9pourvues de fondement factuel, ce qui emp\u00eachait M. Hansman d\u2019invoquer ce moyen de d\u00e9fense. La juge Fenlon a \u00e9galement conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur dans son \u00e9valuation de la malveillance.\n[42] La juge Fenlon a \u00e9galement conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Tout d\u2019abord, le juge en cabinet s\u2019\u00e9tait concentr\u00e9 sur l\u2019objet des d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman sans aucunement se demander si celles-ci constituaient un affront diffamatoire (par. 61\u201162). Ensuite, le juge en cabinet avait selon elle commis une erreur dans son analyse du pr\u00e9judice en [traduction] \u00ab ne donnant pas plein effet \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption suivant laquelle il y a lieu d\u2019accorder des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de diffamation et en pr\u00e9sumant \u00e0 tort qu\u2019il serait difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 parce que d\u2019autres personnes avaient fait des commentaires semblables au sujet de M. Neufeld \u00bb (par. 51).\n[43] Enfin, la juge Fenlon a estim\u00e9 que le juge en cabinet aurait d\u00fb tenir compte, dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation, de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant potentiel sur l\u2019expression future d\u2019opinions \u00bb par le demandeur ou d\u2019autres personnes se trouvant dans la m\u00eame situation que lui \u00ab sur cette question ou sur d\u2019autres questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui soul\u00e8vent les passions \u00bb que le rejet de l\u2019action pourrait entra\u00eener (par. 65).\nIV. Analyse\n[44] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions :\n(i) Le juge en cabinet a\u2011t\u2011il commis une erreur dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019al. 4(2)b) de la PPPA en concluant que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression de M. Hansman commandait le rejet de l\u2019action sous\u2011jacente?\n(ii) Le juge en cabinet a\u2011t\u2011il commis une erreur en concluant que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au sous\u2011al. 4(2)a)(ii) de la PPPA, l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que M. Hansman n\u2019avait pas de d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal ?\n[45] Une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces questions emporte rejet de l\u2019action. Je suis d\u2019avis de r\u00e9pondre \u00ab non \u00bb aux deux questions. La Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb infirmer les conclusions du juge en cabinet sur la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Qui plus est, m\u00eame si M. Neufeld avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Hansman n\u2019avait pas de d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal valable \u00e0 faire valoir, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de M. Hansman commande le rejet de l\u2019action sous-jacente. Avant de passer aux deux questions dont la Cour est saisie, je r\u00e9sume le cadre l\u00e9gislatif applicable.\nA. L\u2019article 4 de la PPPA\n[46] Une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon ou SLAPP est une action strat\u00e9gique qui vise \u00e0 r\u00e9primer l\u2019expression d\u2019opinions sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon ne vise pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 obtenir une victoire juridique, mais plut\u00f4t une victoire politique, en intimidant et en \u00e9touffant les critiques par la menace de poursuites co\u00fbteuses (V. Pelletier, Les poursuites strat\u00e9giques contre la mobilisation publique \u2014 les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons (SLAPP) (et autres poursuites abusives), ao\u00fbt 2008 (en ligne), par. 4). L\u2019une des principales caract\u00e9ristiques des poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons est le recours strat\u00e9gique au syst\u00e8me de justice pour faire taire ceux qui ont un point de vue contraire. Le juge Binnie d\u00e9crit avec justesse le probl\u00e8me pos\u00e9 par de telles tactiques judiciaires dans l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio :\nLa fonction du d\u00e9lit de diffamation est de permettre le r\u00e9tablissement de la r\u00e9putation, mais de nombreux tribunaux ont conclu qu\u2019il faudrait peut\u2011\u00eatre modifier les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs traditionnels de ce d\u00e9lit pour faire plus de place \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression. On redoute en effet que, par crainte des co\u00fbts de plus en plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s et des probl\u00e8mes engendr\u00e9s par les poursuites en diffamation, les diffuseurs passent sous silence des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. [. . .] In\u00e9vitablement, lorsqu\u2019il y a controverse, il y a souvent poursuite, non seulement pour des motifs s\u00e9rieux (comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce), mais simplement \u00e0 des fins d\u2019intimidation. Bien s\u00fbr, il n\u2019est pas intrins\u00e8quement mauvais que les propos faux et diffamatoires soient \u00ab r\u00e9prim\u00e9s \u00bb, mais lorsque le d\u00e9bat sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u00e9gitimes est r\u00e9prim\u00e9, on peut se demander s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas censure ou autocensure indues. La controverse publique a parfois de rudes exigences, et le droit doit respecter ses exigences. [En italique dans l\u2019original; par. 15.]\n[47] Les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons ont vu le jour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis en tant que tendance de certaines entreprises puissantes de brandir la menace de poursuites judiciaires pour neutraliser les efforts de mobilisation publique contre elles (R. A. Macdonald, P. Noreau et D. Jutras, Les poursuites strat\u00e9giques contre la mobilisation publique \u2014 les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons (SLAPP) (2007), p. 2). En raison de ces origines, l\u2019auteur type d\u2019une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u00e9peint comme un demandeur puissant ou riche qui n\u2019a subi qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice insignifiant et qui recourt aux tribunaux contre un d\u00e9fendeur qui ne dispose en comparaison que de ressources limit\u00e9es en vue de faire taire les critiques (voir Platnick c. Bent, 2018 ONCA 687, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 60, par. 99).\n[48] Mais les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons n\u2019incarnent pas toujours les caract\u00e9ristiques de cet arch\u00e9type. Une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e par des personnes riches et puissantes, mais pas toujours. De m\u00eame, le demandeur n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019habitude de recourir aux tribunaux ou de menacer d\u2019y recourir pour faire taire les critiques. Mais, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, une poursuite\u2011b\u00e2illon se caract\u00e9rise invariablement par le fait qu\u2019elle vise \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le d\u00e9fendeur au silence et, plus largement, \u00e0 r\u00e9primer le d\u00e9bat sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 r\u00e9parer un pr\u00e9judice grave subi par le demandeur.\n[49] Une loi anti\u2011SLAPP telle la PPPA instaure un m\u00e9canisme de filtrage pr\u00e9liminaire des instances d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019expression sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Des mesures l\u00e9gislatives anti\u2011SLAPP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es en Colombie\u2011Britannique, en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec. En Ontario, la Loi de 2015 sur la protection du droit \u00e0 la participation aux affaires publiques, L.O. 2015, c. 23, art. 3, a modifi\u00e9 la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires, L.R.O. 1990, c. C.43, de la province en y ajoutant l\u2019art. 137.1, qui cr\u00e9e un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s visant \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illons. Notre Cour a r\u00e9cemment analys\u00e9 l\u2019art. 137.1 dans deux d\u00e9cisions rendues simultan\u00e9ment : 1704604 Ontario Ltd. c. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 CSC 22, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 587, et Platnick c. Bent, 2020 CSC 23, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 645.\n[50] La PPPA de la Colombie\u2011Britannique s\u2019inspire du mod\u00e8le de la Loi uniforme sur la protection de la participation publique (2017), 1er mai 2017 (en ligne), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la Conf\u00e9rence pour l\u2019harmonisation des lois au Canada et qui s\u2019inspirait elle\u2011m\u00eame de la loi ontarienne. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l\u2019Ontario, l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA cr\u00e9e un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s qui permet \u00e0 la partie d\u00e9fenderesse de demander au tribunal d\u2019ordonner le rejet d\u2019une instance introduite contre elle, \u00e0 condition de satisfaire \u00e0 certains crit\u00e8res. L\u2019article 4 dispose :\n[traduction]\nDemande en justice\n4 (1) Une personne contre qui une instance judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite peut demander au tribunal d\u2019ordonner le rejet de l\u2019instance en vertu du paragraphe (2) si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) l\u2019instance d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression du requ\u00e9rant;\nb) l\u2019expression se rapporte \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n(2) Si le requ\u00e9rant convainc le tribunal que l\u2019instance d\u00e9coule d\u2019une expression vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1), le tribunal doit ordonner le rejet de l\u2019instance, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne convainque le tribunal de ce qui suit :\na) il existe des motifs de croire :\n(i) d\u2019une part, que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel,\n(ii) d\u2019autre part, que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance;\nb) le pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019intim\u00e9 subit ou a subi vraisemblablement du fait de l\u2019expression du requ\u00e9rant est suffisamment grave pour que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de cette expression.\n[51] L\u2019article 4 pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable au proc\u00e8s presque identique \u00e0 celui pr\u00e9vu aux par. (3) et (4) de l\u2019art. 137.1. La caract\u00e9ristique essentielle de ces deux lois est la reconnaissance du fait que m\u00eame les demandes dont le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 est substantiel seront rejet\u00e9es lorsque l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 pr\u00e9server la libre discussion l\u2019emporte sur le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au demandeur que le litige est cens\u00e9 r\u00e9parer. Ainsi, les lois anti\u2011SLAPP donnent pour instruction aux juges de refuser \u00e0 certains demandeurs la possibilit\u00e9 de faire valoir leurs droits en justice m\u00eame si leur demande est fond\u00e9e, compte tenu de l\u2019existence d\u2019un objectif social plus imp\u00e9rieux (Pointes, par. 62).\n[52] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la grande similitude qui existe entre les lois ontarienne et britanno\u2011colombienne, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que notre Cour a donn\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 137.1 dans les arr\u00eats Pointes et Bent vaut tout autant pour l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA.\n[53] L\u2019article 4 impose tout d\u2019abord au requ\u00e9rant (le d\u00e9fendeur dans l\u2019instance) le fardeau de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019instance d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression se rapportant \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (par. 4(1); voir Pointes, par. 18 et 31). Si le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019acquitte de ce fardeau, il incombe alors en application du par. 4(2) \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 (le demandeur) de convaincre le tribunal qu\u2019il existe des motifs de croire : (1) d\u2019une part, que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel (sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(i)); (2) d\u2019autre part, que les moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur dans l\u2019instance ne sont pas valables, en ce sens qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont aucune possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de succ\u00e8s (sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii)). Le tribunal doit ordonner le rejet de l\u2019instance s\u2019il n\u2019est pas convaincu que le demandeur s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait en ce qui concerne l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre crit\u00e8re ou les deux. Toutefois, m\u00eame si le demandeur s\u2019acquitte de son fardeau, le tribunal doit proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 4(2)(b); le demandeur doit alors convaincre le tribunal que le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il subit ou a subi vraisemblablement du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de cette expression. Autrement dit, une fois convaincu que l\u2019instance d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019une expression qui se rapporte \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, le tribunal doit ordonner le rejet de l\u2019instance si le demandeur ne s\u2019acquitte pas du fardeau que lui impose soit l\u2019al. 4(2)(a), soit l\u2019al. b). L\u2019ordre dans lequel le juge choisit d\u2019aborder chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui figurent au par. 4(2) est, bien s\u00fbr, laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion.\n[54] Seules l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9montrer que le d\u00e9fendeur \u00ab n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable \u00bb (sous\u2011al. 4(2)a)(ii)) et l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (al. 4(2)b)) sont en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[55] Comme dans le cas d\u2019une motion d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 137.1, la motion fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 4 comporte des exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve qui se distinguent de celles qui r\u00e9gissent d\u2019autres motions pr\u00e9liminaires. Par exemple, dans le cadre d\u2019une motion en jugement sommaire, les parties peuvent produire un dossier exhaustif, alors qu\u2019une motion en radiation est tranch\u00e9e sur la base des seuls actes de proc\u00e9dure. Par contraste, l\u2019art. 4 envisage la production par les parties d\u2019un dossier qui va au\u2011del\u00e0 des actes de proc\u00e9dure, mais est n\u00e9anmoins limit\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est pas dans le cadre d\u2019une motion fond\u00e9e sur une disposition anti\u2011SLAPP que sont tranch\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement les questions en litige (Pointes, par. 38). Selon la PPPA, la preuve doit \u00eatre soumise sous forme d\u2019affidavits, et les auteurs de ces affidavits peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire limit\u00e9 (voir par. 9(4) et (5)).\n[56] Sauf erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le, la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le juge sur la motion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 4 (Bent, par. 77, citant Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 8 et 36).\nB. Premi\u00e8re question : l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public\n[57] La principale question \u00e0 trancher dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est de savoir si le juge en cabinet a commis une erreur dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en application de l\u2019al. 4(2)b). Cette question \u00e9tait la plus controvers\u00e9e soumise \u00e0 notre Cour, et a re\u00e7u beaucoup d\u2019attention autant de la part des parties que des intervenants. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que le juge en cabinet ait trait\u00e9 des questions dans un autre ordre, je vais \u00e9valuer les conclusions qu\u2019il a tir\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public avant de passer \u00e0 sa conclusion suivant laquelle M. Hansman avait une d\u00e9fense valable \u00e0 faire valoir dans l\u2019instance.\n[58] M\u00eame lorsque le demandeur d\u00e9montre que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel et que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable, \u00ab [l\u2019instance] demeure vuln\u00e9rable au rejet sommaire en raison de l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public [. . .], qui fournit aux tribunaux un solide filet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour assurer la protection de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression \u00bb (Pointes, par. 53). L\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes d\u00e9crit cet exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation comme l\u2019essence de l\u2019analyse, car il permet au tribunal de trouver le juste \u00e9quilibre entre la protection de la r\u00e9putation de la personne et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, les valeurs oppos\u00e9es au c\u0153ur de toute loi anti\u2011SLAPP.\n[59] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 4(2)b) oblige le demandeur \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019en raison du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il \u00ab subit ou a subi vraisemblablement \u00bb du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance l\u2019emporte sur les \u00ab effets pr\u00e9judiciables [de l\u2019instance] \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et \u00e0 la participation aux affaires publiques \u00bb (Pointes, par. 82).\n[60] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes, notre Cour a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 plusieurs facteurs qui peuvent aider les juges \u00e0 entreprendre l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation, \u00e0 condition que ces facteurs soient \u00ab li\u00e9[s] au texte de [la disposition] et aux consid\u00e9rations explicitement envisag\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur pour effectuer l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00bb (par. 80) :\nPar exemple, les facteurs suivants, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sans ordre particulier d\u2019importance, peuvent \u00e9clairer le juge des motions : l\u2019importance de l\u2019expression, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des litiges pass\u00e9s entre les parties, l\u2019existence d\u2019effets indirects ou \u00e0 plus grande \u00e9chelle produits sur d\u2019autres expressions relativement \u00e0 des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, l\u2019effet paralysant potentiel pour l\u2019expression d\u2019une partie ou d\u2019autres personnes dans l\u2019avenir; le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s militantes ou de d\u00e9fense de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public men\u00e9es par le d\u00e9fendeur ant\u00e9rieurement, toute disproportion entre les ressources mises \u00e0 contribution dans la poursuite et le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 ou l\u2019octroi \u00e9ventuel de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats et la question de savoir si l\u2019expression ou la demande pourrait \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019un groupe reconnu comme \u00e9tant vuln\u00e9rable ou d\u2019un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte ou par une loi sur les droits de la personne. [En italique dans l\u2019original; par. 80.]\n[61] Le juge en cabinet a conclu que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il avait subi \u00e9tait suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019important int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur dans son analyse du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld et dans son examen de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour d\u2019appel a estim\u00e9 que le juge en cabinet aurait d\u00fb tenir compte, dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse du pr\u00e9judice, de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant potentiel sur l\u2019expression future \u00bb d\u2019\u00e9ventuels demandeurs qui pourraient vouloir participer \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats passionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019espace public, mais qui choisiraient de ne pas le faire \u00ab par crainte de se voir affubl\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9tiquettes n\u00e9gatives et d\u2019\u00eatre accus\u00e9s de propos haineux sans avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger leur r\u00e9putation \u00bb (par. 65). Enfin, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge en cabinet avait impos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld un fardeau trop lourd en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9monstration de son pr\u00e9judice et qu\u2019il avait commis une erreur en accordant une protection importante \u00e0 l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Pour ce motif, et sans proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation explicite, la Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019action de M. Neufeld m\u00e9ritait d\u2019\u00eatre instruite.\n[62] Comme je l\u2019explique plus loin, je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec la Cour d\u2019appel tant en ce qui concerne l\u2019ampleur du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld qu\u2019en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Tout d\u2019abord, M. Neufeld n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat de pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9cis qui d\u00e9coulerait des d\u00e9clarations et qui serait suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Ensuite, la Cour d\u2019appel a examin\u00e9 le facteur de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant \u00bb sans tenir compte de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il convenait de donner \u00e0 l\u2019al. 4(2)b), ce qui allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la conception que la jurisprudence sur la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression se fait de l\u2019effet paralysant. Enfin, l\u2019expression de M. Hansman est un contre-discours motiv\u00e9 par le d\u00e9sir de promouvoir la tol\u00e9rance et le respect envers un groupe marginalis\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui, \u00e0 ce titre, m\u00e9ritait une protection importante. Je suis d\u2019avis de confirmer la conclusion du juge en cabinet suivant laquelle l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression de M. Hansman l\u2019emportait sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le tort caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld.\n(1) Le pr\u00e9judice que le demandeur subit ou a subi vraisemblablement du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur\n[63] Aux termes de l\u2019al. 4(2)b), le facteur qui milite en faveur de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance est le pr\u00e9judice vraisemblablement subi par le demandeur du fait de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur.\na) Preuve du pr\u00e9judice et de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9\n[64] Monsieur Neufeld a plaid\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019il avait subi une atteinte \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation et souffert de trouble \u00e9motionnel en raison des d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman. Il a soutenu que ces affirmations \u00e9taient corrobor\u00e9es par quelques exemples de mesures prises contre lui par d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s : le conseil scolaire de Chilliwack a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 sa d\u00e9mission et l\u2019a somm\u00e9 de se tenir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart des \u00e9coles (il a refus\u00e9 et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 agir comme conseiller scolaire); et il s\u2019est vu retirer des invitations \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e annuelle des conseillers scolaires et \u00e0 prendre la parole lors de c\u00e9r\u00e9monies de remise de dipl\u00f4mes d\u2019\u00e9tudes secondaires. Monsieur Neufeld a \u00e9galement soutenu que l\u2019on pouvait d\u00e9duire un pr\u00e9judice des facteurs circonstanciels, notamment l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019accusateur, l\u2019ampleur et la diffusion des d\u00e9clarations et la republication des d\u00e9clarations (motifs du juge en cabinet, par. 155).\n[65] Tout en reconnaissant que M. Neufeld n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de soumettre un dossier exhaustif sur les dommages subis dans le cadre d\u2019une demande fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 4 (par. 157), le juge en cabinet a estim\u00e9 que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab de vagues affirmations \u00bb de pr\u00e9judice, de sorte qu\u2019il disposait de \u00ab bien peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00bb penchant en faveur de M. Neufeld au titre de l\u2019al. 4(2)b) (par. 147 et 152). Il a \u00e9galement conclu que, [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 part un paragraphe de son affidavit \u00bb, M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre le pr\u00e9judice minime qu\u2019il affirmait avoir subi et les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman (par. 158).\n[66] La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019analyse du juge en cabinet \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e de deux erreurs. En premier lieu, le juge en cabinet n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 effet au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral suivant lequel on pr\u00e9sume en droit de la diffamation qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats (par. 51). La Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 que M. Neufeld avait cit\u00e9 des exemples d\u2019atteintes \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation et affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019on pouvait d\u00e9duire l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 partir des facteurs circonstanciels (par. 57\u201158). Ensuite, le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il serait difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 parce que d\u2019autres personnes avaient fait des d\u00e9clarations semblables au sujet de M. Neufeld (par. 51\u201159). Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[67] M\u00eame si, en droit de la diffamation, on pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019adjuger des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, l\u2019al. 4(2)b) prescrit une d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui oblige le demandeur \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il a subi est suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. Bien que la pr\u00e9somption relative aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats puisse \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice, elle ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir que ce pr\u00e9judice est \u00ab grave \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Lachaux c. Independent Print Ltd., [2019] UKSC 27, [2020] A.C. 612, par. 13; voir aussi United Soils Management Ltd. c. Mohammed, 2019 ONCA 128, 23 C.E.L.R. (4th) 11, par. 22; Levant c. DeMelle, 2022 ONCA 79, 79 C.P.C. (8th) 437, par. 68). Conclure autrement reviendrait \u00e0 faire pencher par le jeu d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption la balance en faveur du demandeur dans les affaires de diffamation et \u00e0 vider de sa substance la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Pour obtenir gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019issue de cette d\u00e9marche, le demandeur doit plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettent au juge \u00ab de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 \u00bb de l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice d\u2019une ampleur suffisante pour l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur (Pointes, par. 71; Bent, par. 154). La pr\u00e9somption relative aux dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux n\u2019est pas suffisante \u00e0 cette fin, pas plus que ne le sont de vagues affirmations de pr\u00e9judice.\n[68] Toutefois, m\u00eame lorsque le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il a subi est grave, la loi oblige aussi le demandeur \u00e0 soumettre au juge des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettant \u00e0 ce dernier de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur et le pr\u00e9judice subi (Pointes, par. 71). Lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019est pas la seule personne \u00e0 avoir d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 le demandeur, l\u2019inf\u00e9rence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur et le pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur devient \u00e0 la fois plus importante (par. 72) et plus difficile.\n[69] Les motifs du juge en cabinet sur cette question sont plus fragmentaires parce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que M. Neufeld ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal et qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public comme un moyen subsidiaire. Il n\u2019a donc pas trait\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement des arguments circonstanciels pertinents que M. Neufeld avait fait valoir pour d\u00e9montrer l\u2019ampleur du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il avait subi. Pourtant, la conclusion ultime du juge au vu du dossier est claire. M\u00eame en tenant compte des facteurs circonstanciels invoqu\u00e9s par M. Neufeld, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de modifier l\u2019\u00e9valuation que le juge a faite du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld. Et, comme le juge l\u2019a reconnu, d\u2019autres facteurs circonstanciels permettaient clairement de conclure que l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation subie par M. Neufeld \u00e9tait minime : en effet, M. Neufeld avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer les m\u00eames opinions controvers\u00e9es malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9action du public, et il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lu un an plus tard.\n[70] Je ne suis pas non plus d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le juge en cabinet a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 simplement parce que M. Hansman n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une des nombreuses personnes \u00e0 avoir d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 M. Neufeld. Pour \u00e9tablir un lien entre les quelques exemples de pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il affirmait avoir subi et M. Hansman, M. Neufeld s\u2019est content\u00e9 d\u2019all\u00e9guer que l\u2019attention n\u00e9gative dont il avait fait l\u2019objet avait [traduction] \u00ab commenc\u00e9 \u00bb apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman (motifs du juge en cabinet, par. 147). Le juge en cabinet a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 aussi d\u2019une affirmation sommaire, qui \u00e9tait par ailleurs d\u00e9mentie par le dossier dont il disposait. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que d\u2019autres personnes et d\u2019autres groupes avaient de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante r\u00e9agi n\u00e9gativement aux opinions de M. Neufeld et que rien n\u2019indiquait que leurs r\u00e9actions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9es ou motiv\u00e9es par les commentaires de M. Hansman (par. 150).\n[71] Je suis d\u2019avis de m\u2019en remettre aux conclusions du juge en cabinet. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, les opinions exprim\u00e9es par M. Neufeld ont d\u00e9clench\u00e9 sur\u2011le\u2011champ un toll\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qui a commenc\u00e9 le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 il a publi\u00e9 son premier message sur Facebook, et ce, m\u00eame avant que M. Hansman ne fasse sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration aux m\u00e9dias. Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je suis d\u2019avis de ne pas modifier la conclusion du juge en cabinet suivant laquelle, pour prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9, il fallait plus qu\u2019une affirmation sommaire selon laquelle le pr\u00e9judice avait commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman.\n[72] Compte tenu du peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Neufeld au sujet du pr\u00e9judice, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00ab presque aucune preuve du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il avait subi \u00bb du fait des d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman. Faute d\u2019erreur isolable, ses conclusions commandent la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence (Bent, par. 77).\nb) L\u2019effet paralysant sur le demandeur et d\u2019autres personnes se trouvant dans une situation semblable\n[73] La Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9galement conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant \u00bb que le rejet de l\u2019instance aurait sur \u00ab d\u2019autres personnes qui pourraient vouloir participer \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats sur [. . .] [des] questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licates \u00bb (par. 65). La Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9mis l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que des gens puissent [traduction] \u00ab se retirer ou refuser de d\u00e9battre de ces questions dans l\u2019espace public par crainte de se voir affubl\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9tiquettes n\u00e9gatives et d\u2019\u00eatre accus\u00e9s de discours haineux sans avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger leur r\u00e9putation \u00bb (par. 65). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la [traduction] \u00ab grave atteinte \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation \u00bb que des accusations de discours haineux \u00e9taient susceptibles de porter, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis une erreur en n\u00e9gligeant \u00ab l\u2019effet indirect que le fait d\u2019emp\u00eacher M. Neufeld de se d\u00e9fendre contre des accusations aussi graves pourrait avoir sur la volont\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes de s\u2019exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019avenir sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (par. 68).\n[74] Ce raisonnement va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la jurisprudence et n\u2019est pas \u00ab li\u00e9 au texte de [la disposition applicable] \u00bb (Pointes, par. 80). Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019al. 4(2)b) d\u00e9finit [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance \u00bb en fonction du \u00ab pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019intim\u00e9 subit ou a subi vraisemblablement du fait de l\u2019expression du requ\u00e9rant \u00bb. Le pr\u00e9judice qui importe pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public est le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld par les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman, et non son incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019ester en justice. La perte du droit d\u2019ester en justice est un r\u00e9sultat possible de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et non un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de celle-ci.\n[75] L\u2019\u00ab effet paralysant \u00bb dont parle la Cour d\u2019appel ne constitue pas, pour les besoins de l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation, un \u00ab pr\u00e9judice \u00bb subi par M. Neufeld. Le concept d\u2019effet paralysant a un sens clair en droit canadien de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression. On conclut \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un effet paralysant sur l\u2019expression lorsque l\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e ou \u00e0 l\u2019application d\u2019une loi limitant ou interdisant l\u2019expression cr\u00e9e un risque que des gens refusent de s\u2019exprimer par crainte de violer la loi en question (voir, p. ex., Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) c. Whatcott, 2013 CSC 11, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 467, par. 32; R. c. Khawaja, 2012 CSC 69, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 555, par. 79; R. c. M\u00e9dia Vice Canada Inc., 2018 CSC 53, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 374, par. 26; R. c. Sharpe, 2001 CSC 2, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 45, par. 104; Canadian Newspapers Co. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1988] 2 R.C.S. 122, p. 133). Ainsi que la juge McLachlin, dissidente, mais non sur ce point, l\u2019expliquait dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Keegstra, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 697, p. 850 :\nUne seconde caract\u00e9ristique propre \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression est que les restrictions qui lui sont impos\u00e9es tendent \u00e0 avoir une incidence sur d\u2019autres expressions que celle vis\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis l\u2019effet paralysant. \u00c0 moins que la restriction ne soit r\u00e9dig\u00e9e avec beaucoup de pr\u00e9cision, il y aura toujours un doute quant \u00e0 savoir si une forme particuli\u00e8re d\u2019expression enfreint l\u2019interdiction. [. . .] [L\u2019omission de d\u00e9finir une limite avec pr\u00e9cision] pourrait dissuader non seulement l\u2019expression vis\u00e9e mais \u00e9galement l\u2019expression l\u00e9gitime. Le citoyen respectueux des lois qui ne veut pas commettre d\u2019infraction d\u00e9cidera de ne pas courir le risque dans un cas douteux. La cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9change b\u00e9n\u00e9fique d\u2019id\u00e9es en souffriront.\n[76] En mati\u00e8re civile, les tribunaux ont pris soin d\u2019encadrer le d\u00e9lit de diffamation pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019il ait un effet paralysant sur l\u2019expression l\u00e9gitime, conform\u00e9ment aux objectifs des lois anti\u2011SLAPP (voir Bent, par. 165, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, et par. 262, la juge Abella). Ainsi que l\u2019intervenant le Centre for Free Expression le souligne, depuis que les arr\u00eats Pointes et Bent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, l\u2019effet paralysant qu\u2019une poursuite peut avoir sur le d\u00e9bat public est examin\u00e9 par les tribunaux dans le cadre de la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation uniquement pour d\u00e9terminer si le fait de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019instance de suivre son cours aura pour effet de dissuader le d\u00e9fendeur et d\u2019autres personnes qui pourraient \u00eatre poursuivies pour diffamation de s\u2019exprimer (voir, p. ex., Schwartz & Red Lake Outfitters c. Collette, 2020 ONSC 6580, par. 123 (CanLII); Catalyst Capital Group Inc. c. West Face Capital Inc., 2021 ONSC 7957, par. 463 (CanLII); Smith c. Nagy, 2021 ONSC 4265, 156 O.R. (3d) 770, par. 91; Galloway c. A.B., 2021 BCSC 2344, par. 784 (CanLII); Gill c. Maciver, 2022 ONSC 1279, par. 179 (CanLII); Volpe c. Wong\u2011Tam, 2022 ONSC 3106, 512 C.R.R. (2d) 153, par. 402\u2011403).\n[77] Le fait que la Cour d\u2019appel a tenu compte de \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant \u00bb d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur de poursuivre son action en diffamation renverse ce concept. Notre jurisprudence r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation que le risque de se voir infliger une sanction l\u00e9gale pousse des citoyens \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de commenter des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019infliger une sanction l\u00e9gale \u00e0 M. Hansman dissuaderait M. Neufeld et d\u2019autres personnes d\u2019exprimer des points de vue impopulaires. En termes simples, aucun effet paralysant ne d\u00e9coule du fait d\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019\u00e9ventuels demandeurs de museler leurs opposants et d\u2019obtenir des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats par le biais d\u2019une poursuite en diffamation. Tout comme notre droit prot\u00e8ge le droit de M. Neufeld d\u2019exprimer ses opinions sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, il prot\u00e8ge aussi le droit d\u2019autres personnes, comme M. Hansman, de r\u00e9pondre. Ainsi que la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a elle\u2011m\u00eame reconnu, [traduction] \u00ab la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression est \u201cla pierre angulaire de toute d\u00e9mocratie pluraliste\u201d et [. . .] on doit avoir la latitude n\u00e9cessaire pour faire valoir ses id\u00e9es avec fermet\u00e9 et m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on intempestive dans l\u2019espace public \u00bb (par. 70).\n[78] Monsieur Hansman a incontestablement employ\u00e9 des mots susceptibles de causer une grave atteinte \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation. Mais l\u2019analyse de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 permettre que l\u2019instance suive son cours doit \u00eatre ax\u00e9e sur le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld, sur le plan de sa r\u00e9putation ou autrement, par les propos exprim\u00e9s par M. Hansman, et non sur \u00ab l\u2019effet paralysant \u00bb que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 pour M. Neufeld de poursuivre son action en diffamation pourrait avoir sur d\u2019autres personnes.\n(2) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur\n[79] L\u2019autre volet de la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation consiste \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression du d\u00e9fendeur. Pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette analyse, la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00ab assujettit le degr\u00e9 de protection [accord\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur] \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019expression \u00bb (Pointes, par. 77). De m\u00eame, le tribunal peut, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, tenir compte de consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur le par. 15(1) dans le cadre de cette analyse. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes, par. 80, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 mentionne, au nombre des facteurs pertinents dont le tribunal peut tenir compte, la possibilit\u00e9 que \u00ab l\u2019expression ou la demande [soit] \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019hostilit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019un groupe reconnu comme \u00e9tant vuln\u00e9rable ou d\u2019un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte ou par une loi sur les droits de la personne \u00bb. Comme le reconna\u00eet notre Constitution, les expressions n\u2019ont pas toutes la m\u00eame valeur, et le degr\u00e9 de protection \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 une expression particuli\u00e8re peut varier consid\u00e9rablement selon la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019expression, son objet, la motivation qui la sous-tend et la forme sous laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e (voir Pointes, par. 74, 76 et 120). Plus l\u2019expression se rapproche de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des valeurs fondamentales consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b), comme la recherche de v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la participation \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions politiques et la diversit\u00e9 des formes d\u2019enrichissement et d\u2019\u00e9panouissement personnels, \u00ab plus l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la prot\u00e9ger sera important \u00bb (par. 77).\n[80] Certaines personnes prennent la parole dans le but de contribuer au d\u00e9bat public en luttant contre des id\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019ignorance et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s au moyen d\u2019une r\u00e9plique \u00e9clair\u00e9e ou compatissante (M. Lepoutre, \u00ab Can \u201cMore Speech\u201d Counter Ignorant Speech? \u00bb (2019), 16 J. Ethics & Soc. Philos. 155, p. 155\u2011156; P. Horwitz, \u00ab Citizenship and Speech. A Review of Owen M.

Suivant cette th\u00e9orie, les voix dissidentes peuvent [traduction] \u00ab en venir \u00e0 \u00e9clipser les discours plus pernicieux \u00bb dans la libre circulation des id\u00e9es (C.

Rev. 35, p. 47), ce qui d\u00e9montre que [traduction] \u00ab bien que certains citoyens puissent exprimer des id\u00e9es ignobles, le poids de l\u2019opinion publique joue contre eux \u00bb (Horwitz, p. 464). Dans la jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine relative au Premier amendement, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle le concept du [traduction] \u00ab contre\u2011discours \u00bb (Whitney c.

Bien que le contre\u2011discours ne soit pas n\u00e9cessairement une solution compl\u00e8te \u00e0 l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es pernicieuses (voir Keegstra, p. 763; Whatcott, par. 104), son lien \u00e9troit avec les valeurs fondamentales de l\u2019al. 2b) est incontestable.\n[82] Le contre\u2011discours motiv\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense d\u2019un groupe de personnes vuln\u00e9rables ou marginalis\u00e9es de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 met aussi en jeu des valeurs qui constituent l\u2019essence du par. 15(1), \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la dignit\u00e9 de tous les \u00eatres humains (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

Les personnes qui appartiennent \u00e0 un groupe vuln\u00e9rable de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui font l\u2019objet de propos d\u00e9gradants n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement la capacit\u00e9 ou le pouvoir de combattre elles\u2011m\u00eames efficacement les propos pr\u00e9judiciables (Lepoutre, p. 157). L\u2019\u00e9change des id\u00e9es ne se fait alors pas sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, ce qui rend d\u2019autant plus influent et important le contre\u2011discours des d\u00e9fenseurs les plus puissants du groupe ou de l\u2019individu (Zwibel, p. 333; voir Whatcott, par. 75 (reconnaissant l\u2019importance de s\u2019assurer que \u00ab le groupe cibl\u00e9 [dispose des] moyen[s] de riposter ou de r\u00e9torquer \u00bb).\n[83] Monsieur Hansman a pris la parole pour combattre des propos qu\u2019il estimait faux et nuisibles pour les personnes transgenres et d\u2019autres personnes 2SLGBTQ+, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre potentiellement n\u00e9fastes pour les jeunes transgenres.\n[84] La communaut\u00e9 transgenre est ind\u00e9niablement un groupe marginalis\u00e9 dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. L\u2019histoire des personnes transgenres au Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par la discrimination et les d\u00e9savantages. Bien que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre transgenre [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019implique aucun affaiblissement du jugement, de la stabilit\u00e9, de la fiabilit\u00e9 ou des capacit\u00e9s sociales ou professionnelles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00bb (J. Drescher et E. Haller, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, 2018 (en ligne)), les personnes transgenres et autres personnes de genre non conforme ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es avec suspicion et pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la seconde moiti\u00e9 du XXe si\u00e8cle.\n[85] De fait, les personnes transgenres sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es d\u2019une fa\u00e7on unique dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que, pendant longtemps, la psychiatrie a assimil\u00e9 \u00ab la transidentit\u00e9 et [d\u2019autres identit\u00e9s 2SLGBTQ+] aux maladies mentales \u00bb, recourant m\u00eame \u00e0 une \u00ab th\u00e9rapie de conversion \u00bb nuisible en vue de [traduction] \u00ab rem\u00e9dier \u00bb \u00e0 la dysphorie de genre et \u00ab r\u00e9habiliter \u00bb la personne afin de r\u00e9duire le \u00ab comportement transgenre \u00bb (A.

Elles sont victimes de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes selon lesquels elles sont malades ou confuses simplement parce qu\u2019elles s\u2019identifient comme transgenres (Nixon c. Vancouver Rape Relief Society (No. 2), 2002 BCHRT 1, 42 C.H.R.R. D\/20, par. 136\u2011137).\n[86] Les personnes transgenres se heurtent \u00e0 la discrimination dans de nombreux aspects de la vie en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au Canada. Statistique Canada a constat\u00e9 que les personnes transgenres sont plus \u00e0 risque de subir de la violence et qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentent des taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de troubles de sant\u00e9 mentale, d\u2019id\u00e9es suicidaires et de toxicomanie afin de faire face \u00e0 la maltraitance ou la violence qu\u2019elles ont subies (voir Les exp\u00e9riences de victimisation avec violence et de comportements sexuels non d\u00e9sir\u00e9s v\u00e9cues par les personnes gaies, lesbiennes, bisexuelles et d\u2019une autre minorit\u00e9 sexuelle, et les personnes transgenres au Canada, 2018 (septembre 2020)). Des \u00e9tudes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de logement, d\u2019emploi et de soins de sant\u00e9 (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada, Un regard qualitatif sur les probl\u00e8mes juridiques graves : Les personnes trans, bispirituelles et non binaires au Canada (2022), p. 11\u201112; XY c.

Singer, \u00ab Trans Rights Are Not Just Human Rights : Legal Strategies for Trans Justice \u00bb (2020), 35 R.C.D.S. 293, p. 298). Alors que les personnes transgenres victimes de discrimination \u00e9taient nagu\u00e8re oblig\u00e9es d\u2019invoquer la [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9ficience physique \u00bb comme motif de discrimination (B. Findlay et autres, Finding Our Place : Transgendered Law Reform Project (1996), p. 20\u201121), l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre et\/ou l\u2019expression de genre sont maintenant des motifs de distinction illicite interdits par les codes des droits de la personne partout au pays, en plus d\u2019\u00eatre inclus dans l\u2019interdiction de propos haineux pr\u00e9vue par le Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c.

Et en 2021, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec a jug\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre est l\u2019un des motifs analogues \u00e0 ceux \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 15(1) de la Charte canadienne \u00bb parce que \u00ab [l]\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre est une caract\u00e9ristique immuable \u00bb (Centre de lutte contre l\u2019oppression des genres c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021 QCCS 191, par. 104 et 106 (CanLII)).\n[89] Pourtant, divers tribunaux judiciaires ou administratifs ont \u00e9galement reconnu que [traduction] \u00ab malgr\u00e9 certains gains, les personnes transgenres demeurent parmi les citoyens les plus marginalis\u00e9s de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (Oger, par. 62), et qu\u2019elles doivent continuer de se heurter \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab des d\u00e9savantages, des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (C.F. c. Director of Vital Statistics (Alta.), 2014 ABQB 237, 587 A.R. 332, par. 58).\n[90] Le droit de M. Neufeld de s\u2019exprimer n\u2019est pas remis en question, et il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 notre Cour de poser un jugement de valeur sur ses opinions. Mais les d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld rev\u00eatent une importance capitale pour qualifier le moyen qu\u2019a choisi M. Hansman pour s\u2019exprimer et qui est en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Malgr\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il affirme, il est \u00e9vident que les propos que M. Neufeld a tenus allaient au\u2011del\u00e0 d\u2019une simple critique d\u2019un programme gouvernemental. Par exemple, dans le premier message qu\u2019il a publi\u00e9, M. Neufeld d\u00e9non\u00e7ait le fait que les documents de la SOGI 123 enseignaient aux enfants que [traduction] \u00ab le genre n\u2019est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 biologiquement, mais est un concept social \u00bb, et il affirmait que le fait de permettre \u00e0 des enfants de \u00ab d\u00e9cider de changer de sexe n\u2019est ni plus ni moins que de la maltraitance envers les enfants \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 16). Dans le m\u00eame message, M. Neufeld se disait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que l\u2019on [traduction] \u00ab enseignait [aux enfants] que le mariage h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuel n\u2019est plus la norme \u00bb et que \u00ab [d]e plus en plus d\u2019enfants grandissent dans des foyers avec des parents de m\u00eame sexe \u00bb (p. 16). Et dans le discours qu\u2019il a prononc\u00e9 lors du rassemblement organis\u00e9 par Culture Guard environ un mois apr\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re publication, M. Neufeld a affirm\u00e9 que la SOGI 123 [traduction] \u00ab favoris[e] des comportements et des sch\u00e8mes de pens\u00e9e dysfonctionnels [et] cautionne et encourag[e] ce qu[\u2019il] consid\u00e8re comme une d\u00e9pendance sexuelle envers la confusion des genres \u00bb. Monsieur Hansman r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ces d\u00e9clarations et \u00e0 d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations semblables.\n[91] Le contre\u2011discours de M. Hansman se rapprochait des valeurs fondamentales de l\u2019al. 2b). Il servait \u00e0 rechercher la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, car des m\u00e9dias avaient communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Hansman pour que ce dernier pr\u00e9sente un point de vue diff\u00e9rent dans le cadre d\u2019un d\u00e9bat portant sur une question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. En prenant la parole, il cherchait \u00e0 contrer l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es qui, selon ce que lui et d\u2019autres personnes percevaient, s\u2019attaquaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Enfin, ses propos sur l\u2019aptitude d\u2019un candidat \u00e0 une \u00e9lection \u00e9taient l\u2019expression d\u2019une opinion politique, laquelle repr\u00e9sente \u00ab la forme d\u2019expression la plus importante et la plus prot\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00bb (Harper c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CSC 33, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 827, par. 11, la juge en chef McLachlin et le juge Major, dissidents en partie, mais non sur ce point; voir aussi Able Translations Ltd. c. Express International Translations Inc., 2018 ONCA 690, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 568, par. 41\u201144 (dans lequel le tribunal a, en vertu de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l\u2019Ontario, accord\u00e9 une solide protection \u00e0 l\u2019expression d\u2019une opinion sur l\u2019aptitude d\u2019une personne \u00e0 se porter candidat \u00e0 une charge \u00e9lective)).\n[92] M\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision de quelqu\u2019un de se livrer \u00e0 un contre\u2011discours ne signifie pas que \u00ab la chasse \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation est ouverte \u00bb (Grant, par. 58), et les personnes qui prennent la parole doivent toujours choisir soigneusement leurs mots (Pointes, par. 75), dans l\u2019ensemble, les propos de M. Hansman ne constituaient pas une r\u00e9action disproportionn\u00e9e ou gratuite aux d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld. Lorsqu\u2019ils sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des opinions qu\u2019ils jugent discriminatoires, les gens emploient souvent des mots comme \u00ab sectaire \u00bb, \u00ab intol\u00e9rant \u00bb, ou m\u00eame parfois \u00ab haineux \u00bb. Or, je constate que les propos exprim\u00e9s par M. Hansman mettaient en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral l\u2019accent sur les points de vue que M. Neufeld avait exprim\u00e9s, et qu\u2019ils ne le visaient pas lui en tant que personne.\n[93] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge en cabinet pour dire qu\u2019il y a un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la libert\u00e9 de parole de M. Hansman sur de telles questions. L\u2019objet de l\u2019intervention de M. Hansman (commenter la valeur d\u2019une initiative gouvernementale, le besoin d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00fbres et inclusives et l\u2019aptitude d\u2019un candidat \u00e0 exercer une charge publique), la forme qu\u2019il a choisie pour se prononcer (en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une invitation des m\u00e9dias de pr\u00e9senter un point de vue oppos\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un d\u00e9bat en cours) et la motivation sous\u2011jacente (lutter contre l\u2019expression d\u2019id\u00e9es discriminatoires et pr\u00e9judiciables et prot\u00e9ger les jeunes transgenres dans les \u00e9coles) m\u00e9ritent tous une protection importante. Comme M. Neufeld n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a subi un pr\u00e9judice suffisamment grave pour l\u2019emporter sur cet important int\u00e9r\u00eat public, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 4(2)b) commandait le rejet de l\u2019action sous-jacente.\nC. Deuxi\u00e8me question : l\u2019absence de d\u00e9fense valable\n[94] Bien que l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation puisse constituer l\u2019essence de la loi anti\u2011SLAPP, le juge en cabinet a tout d\u2019abord fond\u00e9 son rejet de l\u2019action sur la conclusion que M. Hansman avait une d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Selon le sous\u2011al. 4(2)a)(ii), le tribunal doit rendre une ordonnance de rejet, sauf si le demandeur le convainc qu\u2019il existe des motifs de croire que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance. Le d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u2019abord faire \u00e9tat de tout moyen de d\u00e9fense qu\u2019il entend invoquer au proc\u00e8s, apr\u00e8s quoi le fardeau passe au demandeur. L\u2019expression \u00ab motifs de croire \u00bb signifie \u00ab davantage qu\u2019un simple soup\u00e7on, mais rest[e] moins stricte que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s \u00bb (Pointes, par. 40, citant Mugesera c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2005 CSC 40, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 100, par. 114). Pour s\u2019acquitter de ce fardeau, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que les moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur \u00ab ne sont pas juridiquement d\u00e9fendables, ou ne prennent pas appui sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve raisonnablement dignes de foi, de sorte qu\u2019il est permis d\u2019affirmer que ces moyens n\u2019ont aucune possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de succ\u00e8s \u00bb (Pointes, par. 59).\n(1) La d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal\n[95] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa demande fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 4, M. Hansman invoque la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Le droit de faire des commentaires loyaux constitue [traduction] \u00ab une protection fondamentale contre le pouvoir politique irresponsable \u00bb (C. Sappideen et P. Vines, dir., Fleming\u2019s The Law of Torts (10e \u00e9d. 2011), p. 668). La d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que les citoyens devraient pouvoir exprimer librement leur v\u00e9ritable opinion sur des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sans crainte de subir des repr\u00e9sailles sous forme d\u2019une action en diffamation (Cherneskey c. Armadale Publishers Ltd., [1979] 1 R.C.S. 1067, p. 1086, citant Slim c. Daily Telegraph Ltd., [1968] 1 All E.R. 497, p. 503 (C.A.)). Ce d\u00e9bat d\u00e9mocratique est une caract\u00e9ristique d\u00e9terminante d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et ouverte. Ainsi, en mati\u00e8re de diffamation, la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal vise \u00e0 concilier deux valeurs concurrentes : la protection de la r\u00e9putation de l\u2019individu contre des attaques injustifi\u00e9es, d\u2019une part, et la libert\u00e9 de d\u00e9bat, \u00ab dont on a dit qu\u2019elle constitue [traduction] \u201cl\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment vital de notre libert\u00e9 et des institutions libres\u201d, d\u2019autre part \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 1, citant Price c. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. (1915), 51 R.C.S. 179, p. 194). Le tribunal charg\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ce moyen de d\u00e9fense a pour t\u00e2che de concilier ces deux valeurs, et non pas d\u2019en privil\u00e9gier une par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre (WIC Radio, par. 2).\n[96] La d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal comporte cinq \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Premi\u00e8rement, le \u00ab commentaire doit porter sur une question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (Grant, par. 31). Deuxi\u00e8mement, le commentaire doit \u00eatre \u00ab fond\u00e9 sur des faits \u00bb (par. 31). Troisi\u00e8mement, \u00ab le commentaire peut comprendre des conclusions de fait, mais doit \u00eatre reconnaissable en tant que commentaire \u00bb (par. 31). Quatri\u00e8mement, il doit r\u00e9pondre au crit\u00e8re objectif suivant : \u00ab est\u2011ce que n\u2019importe qui pourrait honn\u00eatement exprimer cette opinion vu les faits prouv\u00e9s? \u00bb (par. 31). Enfin, m\u00eame si le commentaire r\u00e9pond \u00e0 tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, \u00ab la d\u00e9fense peut \u00e9chouer si le demandeur prouve que le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait anim\u00e9 par la malice \u00bb (par. 31). L\u2019analyse des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal exige une \u00e9valuation des propos diffamatoires compte tenu de la totalit\u00e9 du contexte dans lequel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s (WIC Radio, par. 55\u201156). Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments en cause sont les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense, ainsi que la question de la malveillance.\n[97] Lorsqu\u2019il invoque cette d\u00e9fense au proc\u00e8s, le d\u00e9fendeur doit prouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal avant que le fardeau de la preuve ne passe au demandeur, \u00e0 qui il incombe alors d\u2019\u00e9carter ce moyen de d\u00e9fense en \u00e9tablissant la malveillance du d\u00e9fendeur (par. 52). Cependant, dans le cas d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 4, c\u2019est au demandeur qu\u2019il incombe de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe des motifs de croire que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir un ou plusieurs de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sorte que la d\u00e9fense n\u2019a aucune possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de succ\u00e8s.\n[98] Comme je l\u2019explique plus loin, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas non plus commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 contester la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal.\na) Les propos exprim\u00e9s \u00e9taient\u2011ils fond\u00e9s sur des faits ?\n[99] Pour constituer un commentaire loyal, la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e doit explicitement ou implicitement indiquer, au moins d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, quels sont les faits sur lesquels les propos publi\u00e9s sont fond\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins que les faits soient \u00ab assez notoire[s] pour \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 compris par l\u2019auditoire \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 34). \u00ab Si le fondement factuel n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9 ou s\u2019il est inconnu ou faux \u00bb, la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e (par. 31).\n[100] Il n\u2019est toutefois pas n\u00e9cessaire que le commentaire soit \u00e9tay\u00e9 par les faits, en ce sens qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les faits en confirment la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 (par. 31). Les propos exprim\u00e9s doivent se rapporter aux faits sur lesquels ils sont fond\u00e9s, mais point n\u2019est besoin qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent une r\u00e9ponse raisonnable ou proportionnelle (par. 39, 51 et 59). Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne vise pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les propos exprim\u00e9s sont loyaux, mais \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les faits sur lesquels ils sont fond\u00e9s sont connus du lecteur pour lui permettre \u00ab de se faire [sa] propre opinion \u00bb de leur valeur (par. 31).\n[101] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge en cabinet a conclu que M. Neufeld n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9es sur des faits, soulignant que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman faisaient suite au premier message publi\u00e9 sur Facebook par M. Neufeld (par. 134). Monsieur Neufeld soutient \u2014 et la Cour d\u2019appel lui donne raison \u2014 qu\u2019il y avait des motifs de croire que M. Hansman ne serait pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir que certaines des d\u00e9clarations reposaient sur des faits.\n[102] Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de se demander si les faits sous\u2011jacents attestaient la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations. Au proc\u00e8s, M. Hansman n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que M. Neufeld est sectaire et transphobe, qu\u2019il a foment\u00e9 la haine ou qu\u2019il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un environnement dangereux pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Il s\u2019agit simplement de savoir si la d\u00e9claration peut \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 un fondement factuel ad\u00e9quat pour permettre au lecteur de juger de sa valeur de fa\u00e7on \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge en cabinet pour dire que le premier message que M. Neufeld a publi\u00e9 sur Facebook pouvait fournir le fondement factuel exig\u00e9 pour la plupart des d\u00e9clarations en cause. Voici le texte int\u00e9gral de ce message :\n[traduction] Bon. Je ne peux plus rester les bras crois\u00e9s. Il faut que je prenne position. Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, le ministre lib\u00e9ral de l\u2019\u00c9ducation a lanc\u00e9 un nouveau programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes cens\u00e9 lutter contre l\u2019intimidation. Mais ce programme s\u2019est rapidement transform\u00e9 en un outil de propagande pour inculquer aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves la derni\u00e8re marotte dans toutes les mati\u00e8res enseign\u00e9es depuis la maternelle jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la 12e ann\u00e9e : la th\u00e9orie du genre. Le programme \u00ab Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity \u00bb (SOGI) enseigne aux enfants que le genre n\u2019est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 biologiquement, mais est un concept social. Au risque d\u2019\u00eatre tax\u00e9 d\u2019homophobe sectaire, je dois dire que je soutiens les valeurs familiales traditionnelles et que je suis d\u2019accord avec le Coll\u00e8ge des p\u00e9diatres pour dire que le fait de permettre \u00e0 de jeunes enfants de d\u00e9cider de changer de sexe n\u2019est ni plus ni moins que de la maltraitance. Mais voil\u00e0 que le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation de la Colombie\u2011Britannique appuie le lobby LGBTQ et impose cette th\u00e9orie biologiquement absurde aux enfants de nos \u00e9coles. On enseigne aux enfants que le mariage h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuel n\u2019est plus la norme. Les enseignants ne peuvent plus parler de \u00ab gar\u00e7ons \u00bb et de \u00ab filles \u00bb; ils doivent parler simplement d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves. Ils ne peuvent pas non plus parler de m\u00e8re ou de p\u00e8re. (De plus en plus d\u2019enfants grandissent dans des foyers avec des parents de m\u00eame sexe) Si cela repr\u00e9sente les valeurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne, alors l\u00e0, je ne marche pas! Je m\u2019identifie plut\u00f4t \u00e0 des pays comme la Russie et le Paraguay, qui ont r\u00e9cemment eu le courage de tenir t\u00eate \u00e0 ces nihilistes culturels radicaux. [Lien vers un article publi\u00e9 intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Parents Defeat Gender Ideology in Paraguay \u00bb (\u00ab Victoire des parents contre l\u2019id\u00e9ologie du genre au Paraguay \u00bb)].\n(d.a., vol. III, p. 16)\n[103] Tous les articles publi\u00e9s contest\u00e9s reproduisaient, citaient ou commentaient le premier message publi\u00e9 sur Facebook par M. Neufeld ou renfermaient un lien vers ce dernier, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019un seul, qui ne mentionnait pas M. Neufeld, comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus loin. La plupart des articles rapportaient \u00e9galement le point de vue anti\u2011SOGI 123 de M. Neufeld, ainsi que ses opinions sur la dysphorie de genre en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Certains d\u2019entre eux reprenaient \u00e9galement d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Neufeld, y compris sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle le sperme est un antid\u00e9presseur naturel pour les femmes, fournissant ainsi \u00e0 M. Hansman un fondement factuel lui permettant de reprocher \u00e0 M. Neufeld ses \u00ab autres d\u00e9clarations misogynes et probl\u00e9matiques \u00bb. D\u2019autres articles faisaient r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux propos que M. Neufeld avait tenus lors du rassemblement organis\u00e9 par Culture Guard au cours duquel il avait affirm\u00e9 que la SOGI 123 encourageait et favorisait \u00ab des comportements et des sch\u00e8mes de pens\u00e9e dysfonctionnels \u00bb, \u00e0 savoir \u00ab une d\u00e9pendance sexuelle envers la confusion des genres \u00bb. Les lecteurs pouvaient donc ais\u00e9ment prendre connaissance des opinions de M. Neufeld en consultant les articles en question, soit dans le texte lui\u2011m\u00eame, soit en cliquant sur des hyperliens menant \u00e0 d\u2019autres articles et explications. Monsieur Hansman s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur ces opinions pour r\u00e9clamer la d\u00e9mission de M. Neufeld et affirmer que ce dernier avait exprim\u00e9 des opinions sectaires, intol\u00e9rantes, transphobes, misogynes ou haineuses, qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab aventur\u00e9 \u00bb dans le discours haineux, qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9pandu ou foment\u00e9 la haine contre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves 2SLGBTQ+ et qu\u2019il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 ou contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement dangereux ou discriminatoire.\n[104] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge en cabinet, M. Neufeld ne peut gu\u00e8re soutenir que son message publi\u00e9 sur Facebook ne fournissait pas de fondement factuel aux d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman alors qu\u2019il a lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9crit qu\u2019il publiait ce message au risque d\u2019\u00ab \u00eatre tax\u00e9 d\u2019homophobe sectaire \u00bb. En ce qui concerne les quelques articles qui ne rapportent pas en d\u00e9tail les d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld, les journalistes semblent s\u2019\u00eatre fi\u00e9s au fait que ces opinions \u00e9taient devenues assez notoires pour pr\u00e9sumer que les lecteurs les connaissaient d\u00e9j\u00e0. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une controverse locale tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e qui a dur\u00e9 plus d\u2019un an. Les deux hommes \u00e9taient des personnalit\u00e9s publiques. Le message que M. Neufeld a publi\u00e9 sur Facebook a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement repris par les principaux m\u00e9dias dans les heures qui ont suivi sa publication, et les m\u00e9dias ont continu\u00e9 de faire rapport sur le diff\u00e9rend \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019il \u00e9voluait. Dans ces conditions, il \u00e9tait raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exposer de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e le contexte de la controverse dans chacune des 11 publications.\n[105] Mais M. Neufeld dit que le message original qu\u2019il a publi\u00e9 sur Facebook ne permettait pas \u00e0 M. Hansman de d\u00e9clarer au Huffington Post que \u00ab les conseillers scolaires qui ont des opinions fond\u00e9es sur leurs convictions religieuses doivent trouver une fa\u00e7on de faire leur travail dans un syst\u00e8me scolaire public la\u00efque \u00bb ou se chercher du travail ailleurs. Monsieur Neufeld affirme que les propos en question de M. Hansman ne reposaient sur aucun fondement, car, dans son premier message, il n\u2019avait pas parl\u00e9 de ses convictions religieuses (ces messages sont venus plus tard). Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. L\u2019article mentionne le fait que M. Neufeld est un sous\u2011diacre de l\u2019\u00e9glise et qu\u2019il est aum\u00f4nier de prison, ce qui fournit un fondement factuel pour la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e.\n[106] Dans la m\u00eame veine, M. Neufeld soutient que le message publi\u00e9 sur Facebook est insuffisant pour fonder le commentaire que M. Hansman a fait le 16 septembre 2018 \u00e0 un m\u00e9dia local selon lequel [traduction] \u00ab [i]l est extr\u00eamement probl\u00e9matique qu\u2019une personne qui se pr\u00e9sente comme candidat \u00e0 un poste de conseiller scolaire continue de r\u00e9pandre la haine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes LGBTQ [. . .] et qu\u2019il soit l\u00e0, \u00e0 tenir d\u2019inf\u00e2mes propos au sujet des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et des immigrants \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 34). Les parties ne s\u2019entendaient pas devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures sur la question de savoir si cette d\u00e9claration visait M. Neufeld ou, comme le soutient M. Hansman, un autre candidat au poste de conseiller scolaire, vu que le message publi\u00e9 ne nomme personne en particulier. Je souscris \u00e0 la concession faite par l\u2019avocat de M. Neufeld devant le juge en cabinet suivant lequel le commentaire semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait [traduction] \u00ab en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un autre conseiller scolaire \u00bb (d.a., vol. V, p. 86), et ne devrait donc pas \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration.\n[107] En somme, M. Neufeld n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman \u00e9taient d\u00e9pourvues de fondement factuel. Comme dans l\u2019affaire WIC Radio, les faits g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend \u00e9taient vraisemblablement connus des lecteurs et mentionn\u00e9s dans les articles eux\u2011m\u00eames (par. 34).\nb) Les propos exprim\u00e9s \u00e9taient\u2011ils reconnaissables en tant que commentaires et non comme une imputation de faits ?\n[108] Pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un commentaire loyal, les propos exprim\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre per\u00e7us par le lecteur raisonnable comme relevant du commentaire et non comme un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait (WIC Radio, par. 27). Par commentaire, on entend notamment [traduction] \u00ab les d\u00e9ductions, inf\u00e9rences, conclusions, critiques, jugements, remarques et observations, dont il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impossible de faire la preuve \u00bb (par. 26, citant Ross c. New Brunswick Teachers\u2019 Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 112, par. 56). Le crit\u00e8re est peu exigeant; \u00ab la notion de \u201ccommentaire\u201d doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 30).\n[109] Il peut \u00eatre difficile de tracer la ligne entre un commentaire et un fait, en particulier dans le cas \u00ab d\u2019\u00e9ditoriaux relatifs \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats, commentaires, campagnes m\u00e9diatiques et discours publics de nature politique, dont les propos sont exprim\u00e9s dans un langage familier, figur\u00e9 ou hyperbolique \u00bb (par. 26). Les opinions sont exprim\u00e9es plus souvent sous forme de faits que sous forme de points de vue personnels, de sorte que les d\u00e9clarations qui semblent v\u00e9hiculer des faits pourraient \u00eatre davantage interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme des commentaires (R. D. McConchie et D. A. Potts, Canadian Libel and Slander Actions (2004), p. 342). Le contexte est essentiel pour distinguer les commentaires des faits.\n[110] Monsieur Neufeld s\u2019appuie sur une poign\u00e9e de d\u00e9cisions pour soutenir que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des commentaires, mais des imputations de faits. Dans l\u2019affaire Lascaris c. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, par. 34, le tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019un observateur raisonnable pourrait conclure que les d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles l\u2019appelant appuyait les terroristes \u00e9taient des d\u00e9clarations de fait et non une opinion. Dans l\u2019affaire Bondfield Construction Company Ltd. c. Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 144 O.R. (3d) 291, par. 17, le tribunal a jug\u00e9 que des d\u00e9clarations laissant entendre que le processus d\u2019appel d\u2019offres \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 de corruption et de collusion pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des all\u00e9gations de fait. Et, dans l\u2019affaire Pan c. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, par. 104, le tribunal a conclu que la d\u00e9claration selon laquelle quelqu\u2019un \u00e9tait un [traduction] \u00ab menteur imp\u00e9nitent \u00bb \u00e9tait un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait. Mais ces d\u00e9cisions ne nous aident pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de commentaires. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur contexte, les d\u00e9clarations dont il \u00e9tait question dans ces affaires permettaient de penser que l\u2019on avait effectivement eu connaissance d\u2019actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles ant\u00e9rieurs, ce qui se distingue des critiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[111] Il existe un grand nombre d\u2019affaires plus pertinentes dans lesquelles les tribunaux canadiens ont conclu que des termes \u00ab familier[s], figur\u00e9[s] ou hyperbolique[s] \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 26) tels que homophobe, transphobe, sectaire, raciste ou sexiste pouvaient \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de commentaires et non de faits (voir Mondal c. Evans\u2011Bitten, 2022 ONSC 809, 82 C.C.L.T. (4th) 327, par. 3\u20117 et 34; voir aussi Awan c. Levant, 2016 ONCA 970, 133 O.R. (3d) 401, par. 84 ([traduction] \u00ab accuser quelqu\u2019un d\u2019avoir des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s constitue normalement une conclusion ou une opinion \u00bb); Volpe, par. 232 (la d\u00e9claration selon laquelle une personne \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab homophobe, transphobe ou anti\u2011LGBTQ2S+ \u00bb relevait du commentaire); Bernier c. Kinsella, 2021 ONSC 7451, 73 C.P.C. (8th) 280, par. 50 ([traduction] \u00ab L\u2019affirmation selon laquelle une personne est raciste ou misogyne est une g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation ou une conclusion qui n\u2019est pas en soi vraie ou fausse. \u00bb)). Je conviens qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 ou de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 est [traduction] \u00ab une affirmation discutable quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit [d\u2019une personne] \u00bb et qu\u2019elle est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un commentaire (P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5e \u00e9d. 2022), p. 298\u2011299).\n[112] Quelques d\u00e9clarations se rapprochent sans doute davantage de la ligne entre un commentaire et un fait. Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas strictement n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la question, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ma conclusion sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge en cabinet pour dire qu\u2019eu \u00e9gard au contexte sp\u00e9cifique de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et compte tenu des faits invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de chacun des articles publi\u00e9s, un lecteur raisonnable aurait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations comme l\u2019expression de l\u2019opinion de M. Hansman. Par exemple, on pourrait interpr\u00e9ter comme une imputation de fait l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle M. Neufeld manquait \u00e0 ses obligations \u00e0 titre de conseiller scolaire, d\u2019autant plus que le r\u00f4le que jouait M. Hansman en tant que pr\u00e9sident de la BCTF pouvait donner au lecteur l\u2019impression qu\u2019il \u00e9tait une autorit\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re. Mais l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle un politicien n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une critique, et non comme un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait. Monsieur Neufeld n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que de tels propos ne seraient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un commentaire dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[113] De plus, M. Neufeld soutient que, comme le Code criminel cr\u00e9e une infraction de fomentation volontaire de la haine (voir le par. 319(2)), l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab aventur\u00e9 [. . .] dans le discours haineux \u00bb serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une imputation de responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que le lecteur ordinaire consid\u00e9rerait n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019une accusation de discours haineux s\u2019entend d\u2019une infraction au Code criminel . Ce type d\u2019all\u00e9gation est tellement r\u00e9pandu dans l\u2019espace public qu\u2019il d\u00e9borde largement le cadre du sens \u00e9troit reconnu \u00e0 ce terme en droit. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des propos haineux a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un d\u00e9bat public en cours dans un \u00e9ditorial o\u00f9 on demandait \u00e0 M. Hansman de commenter la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui venait d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Il est \u00e9vident, lorsqu\u2019on la situe dans son contexte, que cette d\u00e9claration, qui exprimait la conviction de M. Hansman selon laquelle M. Neufeld s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab aventur\u00e9 [. . .] dans le discours haineux \u00bb, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur sa propre interpr\u00e9tation des d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld. Une affirmation qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait dans un contexte pourrait \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme relevant du commentaire dans un autre contexte (WIC Radio, par. 26; voir Awan, par. 76 (traiter quelqu\u2019un de \u00ab menteur \u00bb peut \u00eatre un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait ou un commentaire selon le contexte)).\n[114] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9 globalement, il \u00e9tait loisible au juge en cabinet de conclure, en vertu du sous\u2011al. 4(2)a)(ii), que l\u2019\u00ab affront \u00bb des d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman relevait du \u00ab commentaire et que les [lecteurs] l\u2019auraient per\u00e7u comme tel \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 27).\nc) Le demandeur a\u2011t\u2011il fait \u00e9chec \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal en d\u00e9montrant la malveillance ?\n[115] Une d\u00e9monstration de malveillance fait \u00e9chec \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal. Cette d\u00e9monstration se fait en \u00e9tablissant que le d\u00e9fendeur savait que la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il faisait \u00e9tait fausse, qu\u2019il a manifest\u00e9 une insouciance t\u00e9m\u00e9raire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa v\u00e9racit\u00e9, qu\u2019il a voulu l\u00e9ser le demandeur par vengeance ou par animosit\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par tout autre but ill\u00e9gitime (WIC Radio, par. 100\u2011101 et 104; voir aussi Bent, par. 136; Smith c. Cross, 2009 BCCA 529, 314 D.L.R. (4th) 457, par. 34). La preuve de la malveillance \u00ab peut \u00eatre intrins\u00e8que ou extrins\u00e8que selon qu\u2019elle provient de la formulation m\u00eame des propos ou des circonstances de la diffusion du commentaire \u00bb (WIC Radio, par. 100). Une conclusion de croyance subjective honn\u00eate exclut la possibilit\u00e9 de conclure \u00e0 la malveillance (par. 53).\n[116] Monsieur Neufeld a soutenu que M. Hansman \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par la malveillance lorsqu\u2019il a fait les d\u00e9clarations incrimin\u00e9es \u2014 une all\u00e9gation que le juge en cabinet a jug\u00e9e non fond\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge en cabinet avait commis deux erreurs importantes dans son analyse de la malveillance : (1) en consid\u00e9rant comme un fait que, dans son affidavit, M. Hansman avait [traduction] \u00ab affirm\u00e9 \u00bb croire honn\u00eatement en la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des opinions qu\u2019il exprimait, alors que cet affidavit ne contenait pas une telle affirmation; (2) en concluant que, d\u00e8s lors que le d\u00e9fendeur affirmait croire subjectivement \u00e0 ses commentaires, la malveillance ne pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que par une admission compl\u00e8te du d\u00e9fendeur lors d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire (par. 43\u201144). Je suis en d\u00e9saccord sur les deux points.\n[117] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio, notre Cour a mis en garde contre une analyse de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal qui atteint un \u00ab degr\u00e9 de formalisme inqui\u00e9tant \u00bb (par. 35). Il est possible de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une croyance honn\u00eate subjective \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve du d\u00e9fendeur, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son ensemble. En fin de compte, le juge en cabinet a conclu qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ressort[ait] clairement \u00bb de l\u2019affidavit de M. Hansman que ce dernier croyait sinc\u00e8rement aux opinions qu\u2019il d\u00e9fendait (par. 141), et il lui \u00e9tait loisible de le faire.\n[118] Je ne suis pas non plus d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que le juge en cabinet a estim\u00e9 en droit que, d\u00e8s lors que le d\u00e9fendeur affirme qu\u2019il croit honn\u00eatement \u00e0 ses commentaires, la malveillance ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que par une admission lors d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire. Le juge en cabinet a signal\u00e9 que, bien que la PPPA permette de contre\u2011interroger l\u2019auteur d\u2019un affidavit, M. Neufeld ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9valu de cette possibilit\u00e9. Le juge a conclu qu\u2019\u00e0 moins que M. Hansman n\u2019admette sa malveillance en contre\u2011interrogatoire, il \u00e9tait difficile d\u2019imaginer comme on pouvait conclure \u00e0 la malveillance au vu de la [traduction] \u00ab preuve dont [il] disposai[t] \u00bb (par. 141). Il s\u2019agissait simplement d\u2019une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle M. Neufeld ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de persuasion qui lui incombait dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 4.\n[119] Je conviens avec le juge en cabinet que M. Neufeld n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. C\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il incombait de r\u00e9futer la d\u00e9fense, et pourtant, M. Neufeld n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve [. . .] qui justifierait une attaque contre la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal \u00bb (par. 126). Il \u00e9tait donc loisible au juge de rejeter l\u2019instance pour ce motif.\nd) Autres erreurs relev\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019appel\n[120] En plus de s\u2019inscrire en faux contre la conclusion finale tir\u00e9e par le juge en cabinet au sujet de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, la Cour d\u2019appel lui a \u00e9galement reproch\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont il avait effectu\u00e9 son analyse. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que le juge en cabinet avait fait erreur : (1) en s\u2019en remettant \u00e0 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Hansman; (2) en tablant trop sur l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me penche en d\u00e9tail sur ces pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es erreurs; il suffit de dire que l\u2019analyse du juge en cabinet \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances et qu\u2019elle r\u00e9pondait aux arguments des parties. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, les motifs du juge ne donnent pas \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re diffamatoire de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des d\u00e9clarations, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur contexte, ou un aspect essentiel de l\u2019analyse. Et, contrairement \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que le juge en cabinet a commis une erreur en se fondant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio. WIC Radio est un arr\u00eat de principe de notre Cour en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, et ses faits ressemblent \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Tant cette affaire que la pr\u00e9sente portaient sur des poursuites en diffamation d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un d\u00e9bat public dans les m\u00e9dias sur des politiques et pratiques d\u2019enseignement visant la communaut\u00e9 2SLGBTQ+. Dans chacune, le demandeur \u00e9tait une personnalit\u00e9 publique qui avait exprim\u00e9 des opinions per\u00e7ues par le d\u00e9fendeur comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires et qui avaient suscit\u00e9 de vives critiques de la part du d\u00e9fendeur. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019arr\u00eat WIC Radio \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pertinent, voire d\u00e9terminant, dont le juge devait tenir compte.\nD. Requ\u00eate en pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve\n[121] Monsieur Hansman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en vertu du par. 62(3) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame , L.R.C. 1985, c. S\u201126 , et de la r\u00e8gle 47 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, DORS\/2002\u2011156, une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 notre Cour deux affidavits \u00e0 titre de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Bien que j\u2019aie de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019ils r\u00e9pondent au crit\u00e8re d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Palmer (Palmer c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Barendregt c. Grebliunas, 2022 CSC 22, par. 29\u201134, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour trancher le pourvoi et je n\u2019ai donc pas \u00e0 statuer sur cette requ\u00eate.\nV. Dispositif\n[122] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et de r\u00e9tablir l\u2019ordonnance par laquelle le juge en cabinet a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action en diffamation. Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019adjuger \u00e0 l\u2019appelant les d\u00e9pens entre parties devant notre Cour et les d\u00e9pens ordinaires devant la Cour d\u2019appel, ainsi que les d\u00e9pens devant la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique sur une base d\u2019indemnisation int\u00e9grale, conform\u00e9ment au par. 7(1) de la PPPA.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nI. Survol\n[123] Dans une c\u00e9l\u00e8bre opinion concordante, le juge de la Cour supr\u00eame des \u00c9.\u2011U. Louis Brandeis a opin\u00e9 que le rem\u00e8de \u00e0 des propos choquants [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est de permettre davantage de parole et non d\u2019imposer le silence \u00bb (Whitney c. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), p. 377). L\u2019argument que le contre\u2011discours est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 la censure ou au fait de r\u00e9duire au silence des id\u00e9es per\u00e7ues comme \u00e9tant fausses ou offensantes se rapporte au concept de la \u00ab libre circulation des id\u00e9es \u00bb qui encourage la concurrence entre des points de vue contradictoires. Le contre\u2011discours ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie toutefois pas d\u2019une protection constitutionnelle absolue, et il n\u2019a pas en soi plus de valeur que le discours auquel il r\u00e9pond.\n[124] En fait, le contre\u2011discours peut m\u00eame entraver les valeurs qui sous\u2011tendent l\u2019engagement de notre pays envers la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression (C. F. Zwibel, \u00ab The Right to Protest and Counter\u2011Protest : Complexities and Considerations \u00bb, dans E. Macfarlane, dir., Dilemmas of Free Expression (2022), 111, p. 111 et 120\u2011125). Par exemple, le contre\u2011discours visant \u00e0 supprimer enti\u00e8rement de la sph\u00e8re publique l\u2019id\u00e9e exprim\u00e9e au d\u00e9part para\u00eet incompatible avec la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. R\u00e9duire au silence les opinions contraires et impopulaires semble antith\u00e9tique \u00e0 notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9rale, pluraliste et d\u00e9mocratique, laquelle est vou\u00e9e au libre \u00e9change d\u2019id\u00e9es dans la qu\u00eate de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[125] En effet, la libre circulation des id\u00e9es est favorable \u00e0 la tenue de d\u00e9bats vigoureux sur des enjeux controvers\u00e9s. Pareille confrontation permet de fa\u00e7onner, de renforcer ou m\u00eame de changer le point de vue de quelqu\u2019un. Apr\u00e8s tout, celui [traduction] \u00ab qui ne conna\u00eet que sa version des faits en sait peu \u00e0 ce sujet \u00bb (J. S. Mill, On Liberty (1859 (r\u00e9imprim\u00e9 1978)), p. 35). Les membres de la communaut\u00e9 parviennent \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en tablant sur leur libre arbitre et leur jugement autonome, notamment lors d\u2019un d\u00e9bat public (R. Moon, \u00ab The Social Character of Freedom of Expression \u00bb (2009), 2:1 Amst. L. Forum 43, p. 46; en ce qui concerne le lien entre la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et la dignit\u00e9 humaine et l\u2019autonomie, voir aussi Ward c. Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse), 2021 CSC 43, par. 59; T. M. Scanlon, The Difficulty of Tolerance \u2014 Essays in Political Philosophy (2003), p. 14\u201116).\n[126] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les contre\u2011discours n\u2019ont pas tous la m\u00eame valeur (R. c. Keegstra, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 697, p. 760\u2011761). Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte sur un contre\u2011discours diffamatoire et sur la question de savoir s\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter, avant instruction et en vertu de l\u2019art. 4 de la Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (\u00ab PPPA \u00bb), une action en diffamation intent\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de ce contre\u2011discours.\n[127] Les d\u00e9bats publics sur des enjeux controvers\u00e9s peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 des propos immod\u00e9r\u00e9s, offensants ou durs visant \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter un adversaire (Keegstra, p. 832, la juge McLachlin (plus tard juge en chef), dissidente). Bien que la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression prot\u00e8ge de tels propos, la protection qu\u2019elle offre n\u2019est pas absolue. Elle est limit\u00e9e, entre autres, par le droit d\u2019une personne de prot\u00e9ger sa r\u00e9putation (Hill c. \u00c9glise de scientologie de Toronto, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 1130, par. 102\u2011106; Bou Malhab c. Diffusion M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia CMR inc., 2011 CSC 9, [2011] 1 R.C.S. 214, par. 17).\n[128] Comme la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, la protection que notre droit assure \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation est \u00e9galement ancr\u00e9e dans la notion de dignit\u00e9 humaine qui sous\u2011tend les droits garantis par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (Hill, par. 120\u2011121; voir aussi Gilles E. N\u00e9ron Communication Marketing inc. c. Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec, 2004 CSC 53, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 95, par. 52\u201153). Bien qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas d\u2019un droit autonome, le respect de la r\u00e9putation est essentiel \u00e0 la participation au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (R. c. Lucas, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 439, par. 48, le juge Cory). La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a donc fortement int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les citoyens puissent prot\u00e9ger leur bonne r\u00e9putation, car une \u00ab r\u00e9putation ternie par le libelle peut rarement regagner son lustre pass\u00e9 \u00bb (Hill, par. 108).\n[129] Les poursuites en diffamation comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce appellent les tribunaux \u00e0 \u00e9tablir avec prudence un juste \u00e9quilibre entre la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et la protection de la r\u00e9putation (Grant c. Torstar Corp., 2009 CSC 61, [2009] 3 R.C.S. 640, par. 3; voir aussi Bou Malhab, par. 19). Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de rejeter l\u2019action en diffamation intent\u00e9e par Barry Neufeld contre Glen Hansman \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9coce du litige, notre Cour doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit cet \u00e9quilibre et prendre grand soin de ne pas le rompre (Bent c. Platnick, 2020 CSC 23, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 645, par. 168). H\u00e9las, et je le dis en tout respect, ma coll\u00e8gue rompt cet \u00e9quilibre en rejetant l\u2019action de M. Neufeld.\n[130] \u00c0 mon avis, ma coll\u00e8gue s\u2019aventure au\u2011del\u00e0 des limites restreintes du r\u00f4le du tribunal lorsque vient le temps de statuer sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la PPPA. L\u2019objet de l\u2019article 4 de cette loi, tout comme celui de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires, L.R.O. 1990, c. C.43 (\u00ab LTJ \u00bb), dont il s\u2019inspire, est de servir de m\u00e9canisme permettant le rejet de poursuites avant la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s (1704604 Ontario Ltd. c. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 CSC 22, [2020] 2 R.C.S. 587, par. 16). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut se garder de transformer l\u2019analyse d\u2019une motion fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 137.1 de la LTJ en une motion en jugement sommaire de facto, ce qui, \u00ab \u00e0 ce stade\u2011l\u00e0, serait insurmontable \u00bb (Pointes, par. 52; voir aussi par. 38).\n[131] La m\u00eame r\u00e9serve vaut pour l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les limites analogues en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure et de preuve qui figurent dans la loi. Par exemple, une requ\u00eate en rejet peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 tout moment apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instance (PPPA, par. 9(2)). Une fois que le demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019instance a re\u00e7u signification d\u2019une requ\u00eate en rejet en application de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties ne peut aller plus avant dans l\u2019instance tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate (art. 5). En outre, sauf autorisation du tribunal, le demandeur ne peut modifier son acte de proc\u00e9dure afin de pr\u00e9venir ou d\u2019\u00e9viter une ordonnance de rejet (art. 6). De m\u00eame, la preuve doit \u00eatre produite par affidavit (par. 9(4)). La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de ces restrictions est qu\u2019une requ\u00eate fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9e servir \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance sous\u2011jacente (Pointes, par. 50\u201152). Elle se veut plut\u00f4t un moyen exp\u00e9ditif et \u00e9conomique de rejeter des instances qui restreignent ind\u00fbment la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[132] Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne s\u2019agit pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de savoir si notre Cour est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par M. Neufeld, ou avec le contre\u2011discours de M. Hansman d\u2019ailleurs. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi ne porte que sur la question de savoir s\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter l\u2019action de M. Neufeld au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instance. Contrairement \u00e0 ma coll\u00e8gue, je conclus qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Ce faisant, je ne pr\u00e9juge aucunement le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019action de M. Neufeld en diffamation; j\u2019estime uniquement que M. Neufeld m\u00e9rite de se faire entendre.\nII. Analyse\n[133] Tout d\u2019abord, je diverge d\u2019opinion avec ma coll\u00e8gue concernant la structure de son analyse. M\u00eame si, au par. 37 de ses motifs, ma coll\u00e8gue d\u00e9crit correctement le cadre applicable, elle ne l\u2019applique pas. En fait, ma coll\u00e8gue commence par l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, puis examine la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal invoqu\u00e9e par M. Hansman. Avec \u00e9gards, ce n\u2019est pas ainsi qu\u2019il faut effectuer l\u2019analyse (Pointes, par. 18 et 61\u201163).\n[134] \u00c0 mon avis, le demandeur dans l\u2019instance (soit M. Neufeld) doit d\u2019abord franchir l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il y a des \u00ab motifs de croire \u00bb que le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019instance est substantiel (PPPA, sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(i)) et que le requ\u00e9rant sous le r\u00e9gime de la PPPA (soit M. Hansman) [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance \u00bb (PPPA, sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii)). Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s pareille d\u00e9monstration que le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si le demandeur a \u00e9tabli que le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il subit ou a vraisemblablement subi du fait de l\u2019expression du requ\u00e9rant est suffisamment grave pour que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la poursuite de l\u2019instance l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de cette expression (al. 4(2)(b)). L\u2019alin\u00e9a 4(2)(b) de la PPPA est la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse. Si le demandeur ne d\u00e9montre pas que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable, la demande sous\u2011jacente doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et point n\u2019est besoin d\u2019effectuer l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation command\u00e9 par l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) (Pointes, par. 58).\n[135] Ma coll\u00e8gue affirme sans donner d\u2019explication (et sans citer quelque source que ce soit \u00e0 l\u2019appui) que l\u2019\u00ab ordre dans lequel le juge choisit d\u2019aborder chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui figurent au par. 4(2) est, bien s\u00fbr, laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion \u00bb (par. 53). En affirmant cela, elle ignore en fait le r\u00e9cent arr\u00eat Pointes de notre Cour.\n[136] Il ressort clairement de l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes que l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 doit \u00eatre franchie avant que le tribunal n\u2019analyse l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Le fait qu\u2019on doive proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019analyse dans cet ordre a influenc\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont notre Cour a d\u00e9fini la norme du \u00ab bien\u2011fond\u00e9 substantiel \u00bb dans Pointes. En effet, nous avons conclu que la norme ne devrait pas \u00eatre stricte au point d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, laquelle constitue l\u2019essence de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 137.1(4) de la LTJ :\nToutefois, bien que les poursuites frivoles ne soient clairement pas suffisantes, \u00ab quelque chose de plus \u00bb ne peut non plus requ\u00e9rir une d\u00e9monstration que la demande sera vraisemblablement accueillie, comme certaines parties l\u2019ont soutenu. Le terme \u00ab substantiel \u00bb, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant son sens ordinaire ou sa d\u00e9finition juridique, ne correspond pas \u00e0 une norme de \u00ab vraisemblance de succ\u00e8s \u00bb. Le contexte l\u00e9gislatif et statutaire ne permet pas non plus de retenir une telle norme. Si le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab bien\u2011fond\u00e9 [. . .] substantiel \u00bb obligeait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la demande sera vraisemblablement accueillie, cela pourrait emp\u00eacher ind\u00fbment les juges des motions de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape essentielle de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation prescrit par l\u2019al. 137.1(4)b). Compte tenu de l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 cet exercice d\u2019\u00e9valuation durant le processus l\u00e9gislatif, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pu vouloir qu\u2019il en soit ainsi. De fait, rien dans l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif [. . .] ne permet de dire que la norme de la \u00ab vraisemblance de succ\u00e8s \u00bb soit le seuil permettant au demandeur d\u2019avoir gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 137.1. Bien que le demandeur n\u2019ait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer de fa\u00e7on concluante que sa demande sera vraisemblablement accueillie, celle\u2011ci doit n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre suffisamment solide pour que le fait d\u2019y mettre fin \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire mine l\u2019objectif du l\u00e9gislateur de faire en sorte qu\u2019un demandeur ayant une demande l\u00e9gitime ne soit pas ind\u00fbment priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire valoir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9.\n. . .\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire est un exercice contextuel qui requiert qu\u2019une disposition soit examin\u00e9e en regard des autres dispositions et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de celles\u2011ci : par cons\u00e9quent, si le seuil fix\u00e9 aux sous\u2011al. 137.1(4)a)(i) ou (ii) est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, le juge des motions ne pourra jamais passer au volet suivant de l\u2019analyse, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019al. 137.1(4)b) \u2014 ce qui n\u2019est certainement pas ce qu\u2019envisageait le l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif et la volont\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 137.1. Le l\u00e9gislateur a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises l\u2019importance du principe de la proportionnalit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de rejeter une poursuite. L\u2019\u00e9valuation du droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et du droit \u00e0 la participation aux affaires publiques en regard de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la protection d\u2019une demande fond\u00e9e est un th\u00e8me cl\u00e9 qui traverse la gen\u00e8se l\u00e9gislative de la disposition, et cela indique comment l\u2019art. 137.1 doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par les tribunaux. [Je souligne; par. 48 et 63.]\n[137] L\u2019un des objectifs de l\u2019art. 137.1 de la LTJ, tout comme de l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, est de faire en sorte \u00ab qu\u2019un demandeur ayant une demande l\u00e9gitime ne soit pas ind\u00fbment priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire valoir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 \u00bb (Pointes, par. 48 (je souligne); voir aussi par. 63\u201164). La l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 d\u2019une demande est \u00e9valu\u00e9e d\u2019abord et avant tout \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9, laquelle concerne \u00ab la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019instance sous\u2011jacente \u00bb (par. 60). J\u2019estime qu\u2019en concluant que l\u2019ordre dans lequel se fait l\u2019analyse n\u2019est pas pertinent et rel\u00e8ve simplement du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal, ma coll\u00e8gue adopte un raisonnement qui mine cet objectif l\u00e9gislatif.\n[138] L\u2019analyse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 guide celle effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Un aspect de cette \u00e9tape exige que l\u2019on \u00e9value la gravit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019intim\u00e9 (le demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019instance sous-jacente) du fait de l\u2019expression du requ\u00e9rant, une t\u00e2che difficile, voire impossible \u00e0 accomplir sans se pencher sur la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019instance sous\u2011jacente. Voici un exemple \u00e0 titre d\u2019illustration. Dans une action en diffamation, le pr\u00e9judice est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 (Pointes, par. 71). Cependant, on d\u00e9termine si une demande a une possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de satisfaire au test applicable \u00e0 la diffamation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 (Bent, par. 91 et suiv.).\n[139] De deux choses l\u2019une : soit l\u2019approche de ma coll\u00e8gue escamote l\u2019analyse du pr\u00e9judice, soit elle fusionne l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 \u00e0 celle relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Aucune de ces options n\u2019est souhaitable. En effet, la premi\u00e8re fait pencher la balance en faveur du requ\u00e9rant et rompt l\u2019\u00e9quilibre qu\u2019il faut garder avec soin entre la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et la protection de la r\u00e9putation de la personne. La deuxi\u00e8me option r\u00e9\u00e9crit en fait le par. 137.1(4) de la LTJ et l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, ce que notre Cour n\u2019a de toute \u00e9vidence pas le droit de faire.\n[140] J\u2019ai cherch\u00e9 en vain dans les motifs de ma coll\u00e8gue une raison pour laquelle elle a jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019inverser l\u2019ordre de l\u2019analyse, m\u00eame si aucune partie n\u2019a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de le faire. Non seulement ni l\u2019appelant ni l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour d\u2019adopter un cadre autre que celui appliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes, mais ils ont tous les deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs arguments en traitant d\u2019abord de l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9, puis de l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, comme ils devaient le faire. Le juge en cabinet et la Cour d\u2019appel ont \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans cet ordre, comme l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes leur avait indiqu\u00e9 de le faire. Le fait que les parties et les intervenants ont consacr\u00e9 la majeure partie de leurs observations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public n\u2019est gu\u00e8re une bonne raison ou une raison de principe pour modifier le cadre \u00e9tabli dans Pointes.\n[141] Certes, je reconnais que l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public command\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) de la PPPA est le \u00ab n\u0153ud \u00bb ou l\u2019\u00ab essence \u00bb de l\u2019analyse, mais il faut d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir que la demande sous\u2011jacente d\u00e9coule du fait de l\u2019expression du requ\u00e9rant sur une affaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et qu\u2019elle franchit l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 (Pointes, par. 18 et 61\u201163; Bent, par. 139). En fin de compte, c\u2019est \u00ab le fait de permettre aux poursuites bien fond\u00e9es d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant \u00bb qui est mis en balance avec \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression sur des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (Pointes, par. 18 (je souligne)).\n[142] Les juges des tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure peuvent vouloir ouvrir la porte \u00e0 un examen convenable en appel et tirer d\u2019autres conclusions sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public m\u00eame si une demande ne franchit pas l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9. La bonne fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der consiste \u00e0 suivre la d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e par notre Cour dans Pointes : trancher d\u2019abord la question de savoir si la demande franchit l\u2019\u00e9tape du bien\u2011fond\u00e9, puis aborder l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (Pointes, par. 112\u2011113; voir aussi Echelon Environmental Inc. c. Glassdoor Inc., 2022 ONCA 391, par. 12 (CanLII)). De plus, cette approche cadre parfaitement avec l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur qui sous\u2011tend l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA, en particulier l\u2019al. 4(2)(b).\n[143] Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais d\u2019abord analyser la question de savoir si le juge en cabinet a fait erreur en concluant que M. Hansman a une d\u00e9fense valable de commentaire loyal. Par la suite, je vais analyser si le juge a commis une erreur en se pronon\u00e7ant sur l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus loin, je suis d\u2019avis que le juge en cabinet a commis des erreurs susceptibles de r\u00e9vision dans son examen de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal et dans son analyse de l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. En effet, le juge en cabinet a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le test applicable sous le r\u00e9gime du sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii) et de l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) de la PPPA. En outre, il a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le droit relatif \u00e0 la diffamation et \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, et il ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019expression en litige au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la prot\u00e9ger. Par cons\u00e9quent, la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable est celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 les conclusions du juge en cabinet ne sont pas vici\u00e9es par ces erreurs (Bent, par. 77, citant Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 8 et 36).\nA. D\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal\n(1) Il existe des motifs de croire que M. Hansman ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal au moins pour certaines de ses d\u00e9clarations\n[144] Selon le sous\u2011al. 4(2)(a)(ii) de la PPPA, le demandeur doit d\u00e9montrer que [traduction] \u00ab le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9fense valable dans l\u2019instance \u00bb. La norme n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s exigeante. Elle exige la d\u00e9monstration que le droit et le dossier permettent de conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9fense valable, compte tenu du stade de l\u2019instance au cours duquel la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e (Pointes, par. 37\u201139; Bent, par. 103).\n[145] Pour avoir gain de cause, le demandeur n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que chaque d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e ne peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une d\u00e9fense valable; il suffit qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense valable ne puisse \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour certaines d\u00e9clarations ou m\u00eame une seule. Il en est ainsi parce que l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA pr\u00e9voit le rejet de toute une instance (voir l\u2019art. 1 de la PPPA qui d\u00e9finit le terme [traduction] \u00ab ordonnance de rejet \u00bb comme \u00ab une ordonnance vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 4 rejetant une instance \u00bb). Il ne permet pas de rejeter l\u2019instance en partie ou de radier des parties de la demande. Ceci respecte en tout point l\u2019objectif de la PPPA, qui est de limiter les poursuites afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des d\u00e9fendeurs soient entra\u00een\u00e9s ind\u00fbment dans le processus judiciaire (Pointes, par. 16 et 62).\n[146] Pour cette raison, il importe d\u2019examiner l\u2019affront diffamatoire de chacune des d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es et leur contexte afin de d\u00e9cider si un moyen de d\u00e9fense peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9. Je conviens donc avec la Cour d\u2019appel que le juge en cabinet a fait erreur en n\u2019examinant pas chacune des d\u00e9clarations attaqu\u00e9es contenues dans les 11 publications. Cette erreur s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9terminante parce que M. Hansman faisait valoir une d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer pareille d\u00e9fense d\u00e9pend notamment d\u2019un examen attentif de la d\u00e9claration contest\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la publication dans laquelle elle figure pour d\u00e9cider si elle est reconnaissable en tant que commentaire, et non en tant qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait (WIC Radio Ltd. c. Simpson, 2008 CSC 40, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 420, par. 28).\n[147] Il existe en effet une diff\u00e9rence entre [traduction] \u00ab un commentaire ou une critique et une all\u00e9gation de fait, comme l\u2019affirmation que des actes honteux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00bb (Davis c. Shepstone (1886), 11 App. Cas. 187 (C.P.), p. 190, cit\u00e9 dans WIC Radio, par. 70, le juge LeBel, motifs concordants). Le commentaire a pour caract\u00e9ristique d\u00e9terminante qu\u2019il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impossible d\u2019en faire la preuve (WIC Radio, par. 26, citant Ross c. New Brunswick Teachers\u2019 Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 112, par. 56). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le commentaire doit \u00eatre clairement reconnaissable en tant que tel et ne pas \u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab entrem\u00eal\u00e9 [avec des all\u00e9gations de fait] \u00e0 un point tel qu\u2019on ne peut distinguer les inf\u00e9rences des faits \u00bb (R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation : Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States (2e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)) (\u00ab Brown on Defamation \u00bb), \u00a7 15:5). Toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doit profiter au demandeur (R. E. Brown, The Law of Defamation in Canada (2e \u00e9d. (feuilles mobiles)), p. 15\u201127, cit\u00e9 dans Ager c. Canjex Publishing Ltd., 2005 BCCA 467, 259 D.L.R. (4th) 727, par. 43). L\u2019analyse est objective et vise \u00e0 discerner la perception de l\u2019observateur ou du lecteur raisonnable (Brown on Defamation, \u00a7 15:4).\n[148] Le juge en cabinet a superficiellement examin\u00e9 la question. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es \u00e9taient fort semblables \u00e0 celles de l\u2019affaire WIC Radio, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des commentaires. Il a conclu en derni\u00e8re analyse [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019aucun juge raisonnable instruisant la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne pourrait distinguer les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et ceux de l\u2019affaire WIC \u00bb (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205, par. 137; voir aussi par. 178). En agissant ainsi, il a commis une erreur.\n[149] Qualifier un propos de commentaire ou d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait participe d\u2019une analyse contextuelle qui d\u00e9bouche tout au plus sur une conclusion mixte de droit et de fait. La pr\u00e9sente affaire illustre bien pourquoi le simple fait de transposer une conclusion mixte de droit et de fait dans une autre affaire est une pratique douteuse qu\u2019il convient d\u2019\u00e9viter. Contrairement au d\u00e9fendeur dans WIC Radio, M. Hansman n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un commentateur controvers\u00e9 bien connu lorsqu\u2019il a fait les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es; il prenait la parole en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident de la British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation (\u00ab BCTF \u00bb), un syndicat form\u00e9 de 45 000 enseignants (motifs de la C.A., 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217, par. 35). Qui plus est, contrairement aux faits de l\u2019affaire WIC Radio, les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es dans un \u00e9ditorial; elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9es dans des articles de presse. Il s\u2019agit de diff\u00e9rences importantes, car tant la r\u00e9putation d\u2019un d\u00e9fendeur, comme M. Hansman, que la forme de la publication comptent lorsque vient le temps de cat\u00e9goriser une expression comme un commentaire ou un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait, et de d\u00e9terminer, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, s\u2019il est possible d\u2019invoquer la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal (WIC Radio, par. 27 et 48). Plus fondamentalement, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 avec justesse la Cour d\u2019appel, le jugement du tribunal dans WIC Radio r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur le fond rendue au proc\u00e8s, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce (par. 39).\n[150] Selon moi, il y a des motifs de croire que deux des d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman ne peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal, parce qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en tant qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits.\n[151] En janvier 2018, des articles de presse concernant M. Neufeld ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s dans le Fraser Valley News et le Agassiz Harrison Observer. Les deux articles, accessibles en ligne, reproduisaient un communiqu\u00e9 de presse de la Chilliwack Teachers\u2019 Association. Le communiqu\u00e9 de presse annon\u00e7ait l\u2019adoption d\u2019une motion de censure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du conseil scolaire de Chilliwack en raison de son inaction per\u00e7ue relativement aux d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld sur l\u2019initiative qui a pour nom \u00ab Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 \u00bb (\u00ab SOGI 123 \u00bb). Monsieur Hansman aurait tenu les propos suivants :\n[traduction] Il arrive parfois que nos convictions, nos valeurs et nos responsabilit\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019\u00e9ducateurs professionnels soient remises en question par des gens qui pr\u00f4nent la haine. C\u2019est souvent le cas lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit du programme de sant\u00e9 sexuelle dans les \u00e9coles et des efforts que nous d\u00e9ployons pour offrir des \u00e9coles s\u00fbres et inclusives \u00e0 tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, y compris les \u00e9l\u00e8ves LGBTQ . . . [Je souligne; soulignement dans l\u2019original omis.]\n(d.a., vol. I, p. 87)\n[152] Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e selon son sens ordinaire et eu \u00e9gard au communiqu\u00e9 de presse, cette d\u00e9claration sous\u2011entend que M. Neufeld a foment\u00e9 la haine d\u2019un groupe identifiable, en l\u2019occurrence les \u00e9l\u00e8ves LGBTQ.\n[153] Puis, en avril 2018, un article de presse a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 sur le site Web de CityNews 1130. L\u2019article portait sur la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Neufeld par la BCTF. Dans l\u2019article, on cite M. Hansman, qui aurait affirm\u00e9 que M. Neufeld [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019\u00e9tait aventur\u00e9 assez loin dans le discours haineux \u00bb (d.a., vol. I, p. 89 (soulignement omis)). Cette d\u00e9claration est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019action en diffamation intent\u00e9e par M. Neufeld (motifs du juge en cabinet, par. 25).\n[154] Les deux d\u00e9clarations ont l\u2019affront diffamatoire suivant lequel M. Neufeld a tenu un discours haineux. Notre droit requiert que soit satisfaite une norme exigeante et objective pour que des propos constituent des propos haineux (Keegstra, p. 777\u2011778, le juge en chef Dickson; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) c. Whatcott, 2013 CSC 11, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 467, par. 56). Cela se comprend, car permettre aux sensibilit\u00e9s subjectives d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019analyse compromettrait la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des lois contre les propos haineux. Ainsi, les propos haineux ne sont pas des propos qui \u00e9voquent un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019\u00e9motions, mais qui suscitent plut\u00f4t des sentiments profonds de d\u00e9testation et de calomnie (Keegstra, p. 777; R. c. Andrews (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 161 (C.A.), p. 179, le juge Cory, conf. par [1990] 3 R.C.S. 870). Ces propos s\u2019\u00e9loignent sensiblement de l\u2019expression d\u2019opinions offensantes ou blessantes qui \u00ab n\u2019incitent pas \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cration, au d\u00e9nigrement et au rejet qui risquent d\u2019emporter la discrimination et d\u2019autres effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00bb (Whatcott, par. 57; voir aussi par. 46).\n[155] \u00c0 mon humble avis, affirmer que M. Neufeld a tenu un discours haineux est bien diff\u00e9rent du fait de porter un jugement ou de faire une remarque dont il est impossible de faire la preuve. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es dans leur contexte, les all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es de discours haineux paraissent semblables aux all\u00e9gations de fraude, de vol ou d\u2019autre conduite criminelle qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits qui ne peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal (voir, p. ex., Nanda c. McEwan, 2019 ONSC 3357, par. 48 (CanLII) (concernant des all\u00e9gations de vol et de corruption), conf. par 2020 ONCA 431, 450 D.L.R. (4th) 145; Hall c. Kyburz, 2006 ABQB 294, par. 33 (CanLII) (concernant des all\u00e9gations de divers actes criminels tels la fraude, l\u2019enl\u00e8vement et l\u2019extorsion), conf. par 2007 ABCA 228). La pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce me para\u00eet semblable aux affaires Lascaris c. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, et Bondfield Construction Company Limited c. The Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 501, o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a statu\u00e9 respectivement que des d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles une partie [traduction] \u00ab appuyait les terroristes \u00bb (Lascaris, par. 34) ou \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e dans de la corruption et de la collusion (Bondfield, par. 17) pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de fait. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi a \u00e9galement des points communs avec l\u2019affaire Pan c. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, dans laquelle la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a jug\u00e9 que traiter quelqu\u2019un de [traduction] \u00ab menteur aguerri \u00bb \u00e9tait un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de fait (par. 101\u2011104).\n[156] Ma coll\u00e8gue distingue l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe des affaires Lascaris, Bondfield et Pan, car \u00ab [e]u \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur contexte, les d\u00e9clarations dont il \u00e9tait question dans ces affaires permettaient de penser que l\u2019on avait effectivement eu connaissance d\u2019actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles ant\u00e9rieurs, ce qui se distingue des critiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (par. 110). Mais accuser quelqu\u2019un de tenir un discours haineux diff\u00e8re du fait de formuler une \u00ab critique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb. Au contraire, cela revient \u00e0 imputer des actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 cette personne (par. 110).\n[157] Pour cette raison, je conclus \u00e0 l\u2019existence de motifs de croire que les deux d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es constituaient des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits, et non des commentaires, et que M. Hansman ne serait donc pas en mesure d\u2019invoquer la d\u00e9fense de commentaire loyal. Je passe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nB. L\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public\n(1) Le pr\u00e9judice que M. Neufeld subit ou a subi vraisemblablement est tr\u00e8s grave\n[158] Monsieur Neufeld r\u00e9clame des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice non p\u00e9cuniaire. Il veut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour le stress, l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019humiliation, les souffrances morales ainsi que le tort \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation caus\u00e9 par les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman (d.a., vol. I, p. 97\u201198). Le juge en cabinet a signal\u00e9 que M. Neufeld n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve, hormis un paragraphe de son affidavit, d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il avait subi un pr\u00e9judice pouvant \u00eatre reli\u00e9 aux d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman. Il vaut la peine de souligner que ce que M. Neufeld \u00e9tait tenu de faire \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice ou le lien de causalit\u00e9, mais uniquement de \u00ab pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettront au juge . . . de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019existence du pr\u00e9judice et du lien de causalit\u00e9 pertinent \u00bb (Pointes, par. 71). \u00c0 mon avis, et comme je le d\u00e9montrerai plus loin, le juge en cabinet a ignor\u00e9 \u00e0 tort des facteurs aggravant le pr\u00e9judice que subit ou a vraisemblablement subi M. Neufeld, malgr\u00e9 le fait que ce dernier les a express\u00e9ment plaid\u00e9s (par. 155).\n[159] Premi\u00e8rement, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas tenu compte du fait qu\u2019on peut inf\u00e9rer la gravit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice de celle des d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es. En effet, la [traduction] \u00ab nature du commentaire diffamatoire est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus important dans la d\u00e9termination du montant des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb (Brown on Defamation, \u00a7 25:19; voir aussi P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5e \u00e9d. 2022), \u00a714.01[2][b]). Par exemple, les all\u00e9gations de conduite criminelle se situent en haut de l\u2019\u00e9chelle de gravit\u00e9 (Grant, par. 111; voir aussi Lascaris, par. 40\u201141, cit\u00e9 avec approbation dans Canadian Union of Postal Workers c. B\u2019nai Brith Canada, 2021 ONCA 529, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 245, par. 39, le juge Jamal (maintenant juge de notre Cour); Clark c. East Sooke Rural Association, 2004 BCSC 1120, par. 132 (CanLII); Manno c. Henry, 2008 BCSC 738, par. 79 (CanLII); Lalli c. Athwal, 2017 BCSC 1931, par. 141 (CanLII); Mann c. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 2012 BCSC 181, par. 73 (CanLII)).\n[160] On peut en dire autant des all\u00e9gations de discours haineux. Elles renvoient \u00e0 une conduite objectivement et ind\u00e9niablement r\u00e9pugnante, qui peut donner lieu \u00e0 une poursuite criminelle (Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146, par. 319(2) ). De tels propos exposent les membres d\u2019un groupe identifiable aux \u00e9motions extr\u00eames et profondes de d\u00e9testation et de calomnie (Whatcott, par. 59; Keegstra, p. 777\u2011778). Ils \u00ab pr\u00e9parent le terrain en vue de porter des attaques plus virulentes contre les groupes vuln\u00e9rables. Ces attaques peuvent prendre la forme de mesures discriminatoires, d\u2019ostracisme, de s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, d\u2019expulsion et de violences et, dans les cas les plus extr\u00eames, de g\u00e9nocide \u00bb (Whatcott, par. 74). Que la conduite soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une infraction criminelle au sens du Code criminel ou comme l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, accuser quelqu\u2019un de s\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab aventur\u00e9 assez loin dans le discours haineux \u00bb ou d\u2019avoir foment\u00e9 la haine contre un groupe identifiable nuit \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de quelqu\u2019un. \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour d\u2019appel a eu raison de faire remarquer qu\u2019une telle accusation [traduction] \u00ab peut causer une grave atteinte \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation \u00bb (par. 68).\n[161] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019absence d\u2019excuse de la part de M. Hansman, un autre facteur aggravant qui accro\u00eet le pr\u00e9judice inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Neufeld (Barrick Gold Corp. c. Lopehandia (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 416 (C.A.), par. 51).\n[162] Troisi\u00e8mement, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas pris en consid\u00e9ration la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Hansman qui, durant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, agissait \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sident de la BCTF. Ceci a probablement amplifi\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice subi par M. Neufeld. En effet, [traduction] \u00ab plus grande est la r\u00e9putation du d\u00e9fendeur, plus les r\u00e9percussions de la diffamation sur le demandeur devraient \u00eatre importantes \u00bb (Downard, \u00a714.01[2][g]; Bent, par. 161).\n[163] Enfin, le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas tenu compte du contexte de la publication et de la plate\u2011forme sur laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es les d\u00e9clarations contest\u00e9es (Downard, \u00a714.01[2][c]). Les d\u00e9clarations accusant M. Neufeld d\u2019avoir tenu un discours haineux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es par des m\u00e9dias dans des articles parus sur Internet (d.a., vol. I, p. 87 et 89). L\u2019anonymat procur\u00e9 par Internet, conjugu\u00e9 \u00e0 une accessibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 une diffusion de l\u2019information accrues, peut causer un tort plus grand \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de quelqu\u2019un (Crookes c. Newton, 2011 CSC 47, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 269, par. 37; Barrick Gold, par. 31\u201134; Pineau c. KMI Publishing and Events Ltd., 2022 BCCA 426, par. 69 (CanLII)).\n[164] Tous ces facteurs aggravants se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019expression de M. Hansman et accroissent l\u2019ampleur des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, qui sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s dans les affaires de diffamation (Bent, par. 144; motifs de la C.A., par. 55 et 57). Ces facteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9s \u00e0 tort par le juge en cabinet. Il a aussi commis une erreur en \u00e9cartant la contribution de M. Hansman au pr\u00e9judice subi par M. Neufeld parce que d\u2019autres ont exprim\u00e9 des critiques du m\u00eame ordre \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de ce dernier (par. 150). Je reconnais que M. Hansman n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le seul \u00e0 critiquer M. Neufeld, mais la Cour d\u2019appel a eu raison de souligner qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce stade de l\u2019instance de statuer de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive sur la contribution de M. Hansman au pr\u00e9judice subi par M. Neufeld (Pointes, par. 71\u201172; motifs de la C.A., par. 59). Toute autre conclusion imposerait un fardeau trop lourd \u00e0 M. Neufeld \u00e0 un stade aussi pr\u00e9coce de l\u2019instance. En outre, comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pointes, le lien de causalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une \u00ab affaire de tout ou rien \u00bb (par. 72).\n[165] Le fait que M. Neufeld a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lu en tant que conseiller scolaire peut constituer un facteur att\u00e9nuant, mais cela ne r\u00e9duit pas sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 n\u00e9ant, ni ne rend minime son pr\u00e9judice. M\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on ne pr\u00eate pas foi \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration diffamatoire, des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats peuvent \u00eatre octroy\u00e9s pour indemniser le demandeur des blessures morales, de l\u2019impact psychologique et des inconv\u00e9nients caus\u00e9s par la diffamation (Bent, par. 149; Downard, \u00a714.01[2][f] et [h]). Dans la m\u00eame veine, le fait que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hansman n\u2019ont pas fait taire M. Neufeld n\u2019\u00e9carte pas le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue avoir subi. Sinon, les personnalit\u00e9s publiques ne pourraient r\u00e9clamer que des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats symboliques pour de la diffamation, sauf si elles ont perdu leur tribune \u00e0 cause de celle\u2011ci. Cela n\u2019est pas, et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit. Certes, le fait qu\u2019un demandeur se soit \u00e9loign\u00e9 de la sph\u00e8re publique \u00e0 la suite de remarques diffamatoires peut certainement faire augmenter les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s, mais ce n\u2019est pas le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019aune duquel on mesure le pr\u00e9judice.\n[166] \u00c0 mon avis, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les facteurs aggravants examin\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le pr\u00e9judice de M. Neufeld aurait d\u00fb se situer quelque part entre le milieu et l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019\u00e9chelle de gravit\u00e9.\n(2) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 permettre l\u2019instruction de la r\u00e9clamation de M. Neufeld l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019expression de M. Hansman.\n[167] Vu le caract\u00e8re subsidiaire de cet enjeu, le juge en cabinet ne s\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s longtemps attard\u00e9 aux int\u00e9r\u00eats publics oppos\u00e9s. Il a mentionn\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement que l\u2019expression de M. Hansman m\u00e9ritait [traduction] \u00ab une protection importante \u00bb, parce que bon nombre de ses d\u00e9clarations portaient sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des \u00e9coles s\u00fbres et inclusives, ou ne mentionnaient pas M. Neufeld, et il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette expression favoriserait le d\u00e9bat public \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les dommages limit\u00e9s subis par M. Neufeld (par. 160\u2011161).\n[168] Le juge en cabinet n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 son attention sur la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019expression (Pointes, par. 74). Ceci constitue une erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision. En toute justice, il ne disposait pas de la d\u00e9cision rendue par notre Cour dans Pointes. Pareille analyse est toutefois essentielle pour d\u00e9terminer \u00ab les tenants et aboutissants \u00bb de l\u2019affaire, ce qui, en fin de compte, est l\u2019exercice envisag\u00e9 par l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) de la PPPA (Pointes, par. 81; Bent, par. 172).\n[169] Notre Cour n\u2019a pas et ne devrait pas avoir pour r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuer la justesse des positions respectives de M. Hansman ou de M. Neufeld sur la SOGI 123 (motifs de la C.A., par. 2; motifs du juge en cabinet, par. 177). La libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression est neutre au plan du contenu, ce qui explique pourquoi elle englobe m\u00eame l\u2019expression \u00ab impopulair[e], d\u00e9plaisant[e] ou contestatair[e] \u00bb (Irwin Toy Ltd. c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 927, p. 968). Cette libert\u00e9 fondamentale serait s\u00e9rieusement mise \u00e0 mal si l\u2019issue de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public suivant la PPPA d\u00e9pendait de la concordance entre les opinions exprim\u00e9es par le requ\u00e9rant et celles du tribunal.\n[170] \u00c0 mon avis, ma coll\u00e8gue suit un mauvais raisonnement quand elle justifie le r\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019ordonnance de rejet rendue par le juge en cabinet par le fait que l\u2019expression de M. Hansman \u00ab favorise [. . .] l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb, elle aussi une \u00ab valeur d\u00e9mocratique fondamentale \u00bb (par. 9). L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une des valeurs oppos\u00e9es en jeu dans une loi visant \u00e0 d\u00e9courager les poursuites strat\u00e9giques contre la mobilisation publique (aussi appel\u00e9es \u00ab poursuites\u2011b\u00e2illon \u00bb ou \u00ab SLAPP \u00bb, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019appellation anglaise Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation); \u00ab la protection de la r\u00e9putation de la personne et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression \u00bb le sont (par. 58).\n[171] Qui plus est, la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas l\u2019une des valeurs essentielles qui sous\u2011tendent la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression (en l\u2019occurrence la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la participation au processus d\u00e9cisionnel politique et social ainsi qu\u2019une diversit\u00e9 de formes de r\u00e9alisation de soi et d\u2019\u00e9panouissement humain) (Keegstra, p. 728; Irwin Toy, p. 976). Attribuer \u00e0 la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 quelque r\u00f4le que ce soit dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection d\u2019une expression va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la th\u00e9orie de la neutralit\u00e9 du contenu accept\u00e9e par notre Cour dans sa jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019al. 2b) de la Charte (voir, p. ex., Irwin Toy, p. 968; Keegstra, p. 729; R. c. Zundel, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 731, p. 753\u2011758). Plus nous \u00e9valuons la valeur d\u2019une expression \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de valeurs \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, plus nous nous \u00e9loignons de la neutralit\u00e9 sur le plan du contenu. Fait plus important, la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019est aucunement reli\u00e9e au texte de l\u2019al. 4(2)(b) de la PPPA, et pour cette seule raison, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur pertinent dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (Pointes, par. 80).\n[172] En derni\u00e8re analyse, tant M. Hansman que M. Neufeld avaient le droit de s\u2019exprimer sur la SOGI 123. Il se peut que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Neufeld aient d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les bornes et qu\u2019il ait enfreint le Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, mais il appartient au tribunal des droits de la personne de cette province d\u2019en juger \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre M. Neufeld.\n[173] Le contre\u2011discours de M. Hansman concernait ind\u00e9niablement l\u2019importance d\u2019offrir des \u00e9coles inclusives aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves LGBTQ par la mise en \u0153uvre de la SOGI 123. Mais M. Hansman ne s\u2019est pas content\u00e9 de critiquer les opinions de M. Neufeld sur la SOGI 123 ou de manifester son soutien envers les \u00e9coles inclusives. Il s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des attaques personnelles et \u00e0 de graves accusations de propos haineux qui \u00e9taient susceptibles de causer ou qui ont effectivement caus\u00e9 un tort consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 M. Neufeld. Cela diminue l\u2019importance de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger son expression, car [traduction] \u00ab les d\u00e9clarations diffamatoires et les attaques personnelles ont des liens \u201ctr\u00e8s t\u00e9nus\u201d avec les valeurs fondamentales qui sous\u2011tendent l\u2019al. 2b) de la Charte \u00bb (Thorman c. McGraw, 2022 ONCA 851, 476 D.L.R. (4th) 577, par. 15; voir aussi Hill, par. 106; Pointes, par. 74\u201175; Bent, par. 163).\n[174] Ce dont il est v\u00e9ritablement question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce n\u2019est pas une tentative d\u2019\u00e9touffer l\u2019expression de M. Hansman. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t \u00ab d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 une partie tente d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration pour un pr\u00e9judice apparemment l\u00e9gitime subi du fait d\u2019une communication diffamatoire \u00bb (Bent, par. 172). Autrement dit, le pr\u00e9judice que M. Neufeld subit ou a subi vraisemblablement milite fortement en faveur du fait de permettre la poursuite de l\u2019instance (par. 159).\n[175] Restreindre la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019intenter une poursuite en responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle pour diffamation peut avoir un effet paralysant. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Globe and Mail Ltd. c. Boland, [1960] R.C.S. 203, notre Cour a refus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tendre la d\u00e9fense d\u2019immunit\u00e9 aux d\u00e9clarations diffamatoires concernant l\u2019aptitude de candidats politiques, notamment parce que cela dissuaderait d\u2019\u00e9ventuels candidats de briguer les suffrages (p. 208\u2011209; voir aussi Hill, par. 106). De m\u00eame, dans le contexte du contre\u2011discours diffamatoire, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 priver les parties diffam\u00e9es ayant subi un grave pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019occasion de se faire entendre pourrait fort bien nuire au d\u00e9bat public. Cela peut emp\u00eacher les tenants d\u2019opinions controvers\u00e9es ou impopulaires de venir sur la place publique pour les transmettre. Cette conclusion ne d\u00e9nature pas la notion d\u2019effet paralysant, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend ma coll\u00e8gue (par. 77). Ma coll\u00e8gue affirme que la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur cette notion \u00ab r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation que le risque de se voir infliger une sanction l\u00e9gale pousse des citoyens \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de commenter des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (par. 77). Toutefois, priver une partie, par ordonnance judiciaire, de son droit de faire valoir une demande l\u00e9gitime revient \u00e9galement \u00e0 lui imposer une sanction juridique.\n[176] Je conviens donc avec la Cour d\u2019appel que le juge en cabinet a eu tort de ne pas tenir compte de l\u2019effet paralysant que le rejet de l\u2019action de M. Neufeld pourrait avoir sur l\u2019expression future d\u2019opinions par d\u2019autres personnes (Pointes, par. 80; motifs de la C.A., par. 65).\n[177] Les lois anti\u2011SLAPP comme la PPPA ne sont pas des autorisations \u00e0 diffamer (Park Lawn Corporation c. Kahu Capital Partners Ltd., 2023 ONCA 129, 478 D.L.R. (4th) 514, par. 33). \u00catre la cible d\u2019un contre\u2011discours diffamatoire n\u2019est pas le prix que doivent inexorablement payer ceux et celles qui prennent part au d\u00e9bat public en exprimant des opinions minoritaires sur des sujets controvers\u00e9s. Ce n\u2019est pas ce qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019art. 4 de la PPPA qui, tout comme l\u2019art. 137.1 de la LTJ, vise \u00e0 garantir \u00ab qu\u2019un demandeur ayant une demande l\u00e9gitime ne soit pas ind\u00fbment priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire valoir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 \u00bb (Pointes, par. 48). \u00c0 mon avis, et malgr\u00e9 tout le respect que je lui dois, ma coll\u00e8gue prive M. Neufeld de cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[178] Quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de M. Hansman en vue de pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle preuve, j\u2019estime que les deux affidavits qu\u2019il d\u00e9sire produire ne sont pas pertinents pour les questions \u00e0 trancher en appel et qu\u2019ils ne r\u00e9pondent donc pas au crit\u00e8re d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une nouvelle preuve \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Palmer c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759. Le premier affidavit vise \u00e0 contredire la pr\u00e9tention de M. Neufeld selon laquelle le rejet de son action aurait un effet paralysant sur lui en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il a continu\u00e9 de s\u2019exprimer apr\u00e8s que le juge en cabinet eut rejet\u00e9 son action en diffamation. Cependant, la question en litige soumise \u00e0 notre Cour n\u2019est pas de savoir si l\u2019expression de M. Neufeld a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9e en raison de l\u2019ordonnance de rejet rendue par le juge en cabinet. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de savoir si l\u2019expression d\u2019autres personnes pourrait l\u2019\u00eatre. Le second affidavit expose les d\u00e9veloppements survenus concernant la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la BCTF; cela n\u2019est pas pertinent pour trancher le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[179] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi et d\u2019adjuger \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens entre parties devant notre Cour et les d\u00e9pens ordinaires devant la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique. Conform\u00e9ment au par. 7(2) de la PPPA, je ne rendrais aucune ordonnance sur les d\u00e9pens aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la requ\u00eate fond\u00e9e sur la PPPA devant la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique.\nPourvoi accueilli avec d\u00e9pens, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 est dissidente.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant : British Columbia Teachers\u2019 Federation, Vancouver; Michael Sobkin, Ottawa.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 : Paul E.

C-46 , on one count of sexual assault.\nWe are all of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, substantially for the reasons of the Court of Appeal. Mr. Hay\u2019s defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent had no air of reality, and the evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible.

Toutefois, le par. 111(5) pr\u00e9voit des restrictions au report de pertes par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en cas d\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par une personne ou un groupe de personnes, \u00e0 moins que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 poursuive une entreprise similaire ou identique \u00e0 celle qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 les pertes. Avant les op\u00e9rations en cause, Deans Knight Income Corporation (\u00ab Deans Knight \u00bb), agissant \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque sous le nom Forbes Medi\u2011Tech Inc. (\u00ab Forbes \u00bb), avait accumul\u00e9 environ 90 M$ en pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, en d\u00e9penses pour la recherche scientifique et le d\u00e9veloppement et en cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019investissement inutilis\u00e9s, mais compte tenu de ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, elle ne disposait pas de revenus qui pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9duits par ses pertes ant\u00e9rieures. Elle a conclu une convention d\u2019investissement avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de capital de risque Matco, et un arrangement complexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour profiter de la d\u00e9duction pour report des pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1) a) sans d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de la restriction pr\u00e9vue au par. 111(5) . Premi\u00e8rement, les actifs et les passifs de Forbes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re, Newco. Deuxi\u00e8mement, aux termes de la convention d\u2019investissement, Matco a achet\u00e9 une d\u00e9benture convertible en un certain nombre d\u2019actions votantes et en la totalit\u00e9 des actions non votantes que Newco d\u00e9tenait dans Forbes. Bien que Newco ne f\u00fbt pas tenue de vendre ses actions \u00e0 Matco, elle avait re\u00e7u la promesse qu\u2019elle recevrait au moins un montant garanti si elle vendait les actions ou si aucune occasion d\u2019affaires ne se pr\u00e9sentait. Troisi\u00e8mement, Matco devait trouver une nouvelle entreprise pour Forbes, laquelle servirait \u00e0 lever des fonds au moyen d\u2019un premier appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne (\u00ab PAPE \u00bb). Les profits de cette entreprise seraient \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019imp\u00f4t gr\u00e2ce aux attributs fiscaux dont Forbes ne pouvait se servir au d\u00e9part. Sauf dans le contexte de la mise en \u0153uvre de la convention d\u2019investissement, Newco et Forbes ne pouvaient pas s\u2019adonner \u00e0 diverses activit\u00e9s sans le consentement de Matco. Les op\u00e9rations pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019arrangement se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es comme pr\u00e9vu. Matco a trouv\u00e9 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de gestion de fonds communs de placement, Deans Knight Capital Management, qui a accept\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser Forbes pour un PAPE gr\u00e2ce auquel elle l\u00e8verait des fonds pour investir dans des instruments de cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 haut rendement. Le nom de Forbes a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 pour Deans Knight. Le PAPE et l\u2019entreprise d\u2019investissement ont eu du succ\u00e8s. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009 \u00e0 2012, Deans Knight a d\u00e9duit la plupart de ses pertes autres qu\u2019en capital pour r\u00e9duire ses obligations fiscales.\nLe ministre a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation pour Deans Knight et a refus\u00e9 les d\u00e9ductions. Deans Knight a contest\u00e9 la nouvelle cotisation et interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. En plus d\u2019autres arguments, le ministre a fait valoir que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 245 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (\u00ab RGA\u00c9 \u00bb) s\u2019appliquait pour refuser les d\u00e9ductions parce que les op\u00e9rations constituaient des mesures d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a reconnu que les op\u00e9rations constituaient des op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 un avantage fiscal, mais a conclu qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas abusives. En appel, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que les op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient abusives et que la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019appliquait pour justifier le refus des avantages fiscaux. Elle a annul\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de Deans Knight \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des nouvelles cotisations.\nArr\u00eat (la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 est dissidente) : L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal et O\u2019Bonsawin : Les op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient abusives et, par cons\u00e9quent, la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019applique pour refuser les avantages fiscaux. Le paragraphe 111(5) a pour esprit et objet d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. En proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie complexe d\u2019op\u00e9rations, Deans Knight a subi une transformation fondamentale qui accomplit ce que le Parlement cherchait \u00e0 \u00e9viter, tout en contournant tout juste le libell\u00e9 du par. 111(5). Sans d\u00e9clencher une \u00ab acquisition de contr\u00f4le \u00bb, Matco a obtenu le pouvoir d\u2019un actionnaire majoritaire et transform\u00e9 fondamentalement les actifs, les passifs, l\u2019identit\u00e9 des actionnaires ainsi que l\u2019entreprise de Deans Knight. Cela a rompu la continuit\u00e9 qui est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5). Le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations a contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5) et constituait donc un abus.\nLa RGA\u00c9 repr\u00e9sente le fruit d\u2019un choix du Parlement d\u2019adopter une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour compl\u00e9ter ses efforts sp\u00e9cifiques pour contrer l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. Bien que l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif puisse consister en strat\u00e9gies fiscales qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues, la r\u00e8gle est con\u00e7ue plus largement pour englober des situations qui minent l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me fiscal en contrecarrant l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions invoqu\u00e9es par le contribuable. Il est in\u00e9vitable que l\u2019adoption d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entra\u00eene une certaine incertitude, mais l\u2019\u00e9quilibre qu\u2019\u00e9tablit la RGA\u00c9 donne un degr\u00e9 de certitude raisonnable. Une analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 fait appel \u00e0 un test en trois \u00e9tapes structur\u00e9, et pose les questions suivantes : (1) y a\u2011t\u2011il eu avantage fiscal; (2) l\u2019op\u00e9ration ayant g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019avantage fiscal \u00e9tait\u2011elle une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement; et (3) l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9tait\u2011elle abusive?\nPour analyser si les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement sont abusives, il faut d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions pertinentes et d\u00e9cider si le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations contrecarre cet objet et cet esprit. L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions repr\u00e9sentent la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend des dispositions particuli\u00e8res ou interd\u00e9pendantes de la Loi. Il est crucial de distinguer la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une disposition des moyens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis pour y donner effet. L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition doivent \u00eatre formul\u00e9s comme une description de sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Le tribunal ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas le crit\u00e8re qui y est applicable et ne cr\u00e9e pas non plus un nouveau crit\u00e8re secondaire; l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit sont plut\u00f4t une br\u00e8ve description de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend la disposition, comme le fondement de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019accorder un avantage, la conduite que le Parlement souhaitait encourager, ou le r\u00e9sultat ou le m\u00e9fait que le Parlement a voulu pr\u00e9venir.\nLa mani\u00e8re dont le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet d\u2019une disposition sont utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir la raison d\u2019\u00eatre diff\u00e8re de celle qu\u2019on en fait dans le contexte de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative classique. Puisque dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , il faut cerner la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous-tend les mots, le fait de consid\u00e9rer le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition permet d\u2019assurer que la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que utilis\u00e9e pour cerner cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre reste li\u00e9e \u00e0 la disposition elle\u2011m\u00eame. Examiner le texte d\u2019une disposition suppose de se demander en quoi il renseigne sur l\u2019objet de la disposition, car le texte ainsi que la structure de la disposition peuvent \u00e9clairer quant aux pr\u00e9occupations sous\u2011jacentes du Parlement. Les tribunaux doivent aussi examiner le contexte de la disposition, plus particuli\u00e8rement la relation entre la disposition dont le contribuable aurait abus\u00e9 et le r\u00e9gime particulier auquel elle appartient. Il est crucial de comprendre l\u2019objet de la disposition pour effectuer l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , et l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif et la preuve extrins\u00e8que donnent des indices quant \u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques.\nUne fois que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis, l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations contrecarre l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition. Les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement seront jug\u00e9es abusives lorsque leur r\u00e9sultat : donne lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat que les dispositions invoqu\u00e9es visent \u00e0 emp\u00eacher; va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de ces dispositions; ou contourne l\u2019application de certaines dispositions de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 contrecarrer leur objet ou leur esprit. Le tribunal doit aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la forme juridique qu\u2019ont prise les op\u00e9rations et leur respect technique des dispositions; il doit comparer leur r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition et d\u00e9terminer si cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre est contrecarr\u00e9e. Pour tirer une telle conclusion, l\u2019op\u00e9ration doit \u00eatre manifestement abusive. Toutefois, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019appliquer la RGA\u00c9 lorsque la Loi pr\u00e9voit des conditions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il faut satisfaire pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat en particulier, comme dans le cas d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti-\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique; m\u00eame les dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques r\u00e9dig\u00e9es minutieusement sont susceptibles d\u2019abus.\nUn examen du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet du par. 111(5) r\u00e9v\u00e8le sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre. En ce qui a trait au texte de la disposition, le par. 111(5) constitue une restriction \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable d\u2019utiliser les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital subies durant une autre ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Premi\u00e8rement, le texte du par. 111(5) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant contr\u00f4le de jure. Le crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le de jure consiste \u00e0 se demander si la partie qui d\u00e9tient le contr\u00f4le a, en vertu des actions qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de, la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lire la majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil d\u2019administration. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le contr\u00f4le doit \u00eatre acquis par \u00ab une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00bb. Troisi\u00e8mement, le par. 111(5) cr\u00e9e une exception selon laquelle les pertes restent d\u00e9ductibles si, apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 exploite la m\u00eame entreprise ou une entreprise similaire. Ainsi, le lien avec les pertes subies dans le pass\u00e9 n\u2019est rompu que lorsque le contr\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis et qu\u2019il y a rupture avec les activit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le texte du par. 111(5) refl\u00e8te le souci de refuser le report des pertes en cas de manque de continuit\u00e9 au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en fonction \u00e0 la fois de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ses actionnaires majoritaires et de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales.\nUne analyse contextuelle permet aussi de mieux saisir la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente du par. 111(5). Tout d\u2019abord, ce dernier doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 compte tenu des principes fondamentaux qui sous\u2011tendent la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu . Selon la Loi, chaque personne, y compris une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, est un contribuable distinct, et un principe fondateur pr\u00e9voit que les contribuables sont assujettis \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t en fonction de leurs propres revenus. Apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le et la cessation de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le m\u00eame contribuable. En outre, le par. 111(5) d\u00e9limite la port\u00e9e de la disposition conf\u00e9rant l\u2019avantage fiscal, soit l\u2019al. 111(1)a). Cet alin\u00e9a modifie la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle chaque contribuable est impos\u00e9 en fonction de son revenu et de ses pertes au cours d\u2019une seule ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pour permettre qu\u2019un contribuable puisse d\u00e9duire des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital du revenu d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition future ou ant\u00e9rieure, mais seul le contribuable qui a subi la perte peut la d\u00e9duire. Le paragraphe 111(5) garantit que ce principe s\u2019\u00e9tend aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Bien que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 reste la m\u00eame personne sur le plan juridique apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui sont derri\u00e8re la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a chang\u00e9. Le paragraphe 111(5) fonctionne de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que les avantages fiscaux li\u00e9s aux pertes en cause ne profitent pas \u00e0 un nouvel actionnariat qui exploite une nouvelle entreprise. Cette restriction est compatible avec plusieurs autres dispositions de la Loi qui traitent aussi une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un nouveau contribuable apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le. Plusieurs raisons expliquent pourquoi le Parlement a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure comme marqueur pour l\u2019application du par. 111(5) : il s\u2019agit d\u2019un rep\u00e8re plus clair que le contr\u00f4le de facto, qui conf\u00e8re une plus grande certitude \u00e0 la plupart des op\u00e9rations qui ne sont pas motiv\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. Toutefois, le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure n\u2019explique pas enti\u00e8rement la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition; celle du par. 111(5) devient plus claire apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen de dispositions connexes qui \u00e0 la fois \u00e9tendent et restreignent les circonstances dans lesquelles une acquisition de contr\u00f4le s\u2019est produite, notamment en allant au\u2011del\u00e0 de la documentation habituelle consid\u00e9r\u00e9e pour l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure. Ces dispositions sugg\u00e8rent que le contr\u00f4le de jure ne refl\u00e8te pas parfaitement ni n\u2019explique compl\u00e8tement le m\u00e9fait auquel le Parlement souhaitait s\u2019attaquer.\nIl est aussi n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques de l\u2019objet que poursuivait le Parlement. L\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif du par. 111(5) illustre que celui\u2011ci voulait s\u2019attaquer au commerce de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9ficitaires, lequel sapait l\u2019assiette fiscale et \u00e9tait source d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 entre les contribuables. M\u00eame si les moyens que le Parlement a choisis pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps, la raison pour laquelle il a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 la restriction au report des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 change de mains, et que l\u2019entreprise d\u00e9ficitaire cesse d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9e, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est en pratique un nouveau contribuable qui ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital accumul\u00e9es par l\u2019ancien contribuable. L\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des affaires a \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse pour favoriser le r\u00e9tablissement d\u2019entreprises non rentables qui n\u00e9cessitent un nouvel investissement de la part de nouveaux propri\u00e9taires afin de renforcer l\u2019entreprise de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Bien que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ait pu changer de mains, le lien de continuit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 par un autre marqueur et la justification de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) conserve sa pertinence. Cela confirme que le par. 111(5) sert essentiellement \u00e0 d\u00e9limiter les circonstances dans lesquelles le fondement de la r\u00e8gle sur le report de pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) est inexistant.\nConsid\u00e9r\u00e9s ensemble, l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) est d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. Le Parlement a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 garantir que l\u2019absence de continuit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soit accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une rupture correspondante dans la capacit\u00e9 de reporter des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital. Voil\u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition et ce qui explique correctement ce qui a incit\u00e9 le Parlement \u00e0 adopter le par. 111(5).\nUne analyse des op\u00e9rations en cause d\u00e9montre que leur r\u00e9sultat a servi \u00e0 contrecarrer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) : les op\u00e9rations ont atteint le r\u00e9sultat que le Parlement voulait pr\u00e9venir et ont fourni \u00e0 Matco les avantages d\u2019une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, tout en contournant tout juste l\u2019application du par. 111(5). Elles ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la transformation quasi totale de Deans Knight : elle est devenue une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9e de nouveaux actifs et passifs, de nouveaux actionnaires et d\u2019une nouvelle entreprise dont le seul lien qui subsistait avec son ancienne vie en tant que personne morale \u00e9tait les attributs fiscaux. Elle a servi de coquille pour une tout autre entreprise choisie par Matco. Cette derni\u00e8re est parvenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quivalent fonctionnel d\u2019une acquisition du contr\u00f4le au moyen de la convention d\u2019investissement, tout en contournant le par. 111(5), parce que les op\u00e9rations d\u00e9mantelaient les droits et avantages dont jouirait normalement un actionnaire majoritaire. Premi\u00e8rement, elle a obtenu par contrat la facult\u00e9 de s\u00e9lectionner les administrateurs de Deans Knight. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la convention d\u2019investissement a eu pour effet de restreindre grandement les pouvoirs du conseil d\u2019administration qui, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019op\u00e9ration court\u2011circuit ayant eu lieu dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, surviendrait normalement par la voie d\u2019une convention unanime des actionnaires et qui d\u00e9clencherait une acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure. Troisi\u00e8mement, les op\u00e9rations ont permis \u00e0 Matco de retirer des avantages financiers importants, tout en privant Newco, l\u2019actionnaire votant majoritaire sur papier, de tous les droits essentiels qu\u2019elle aurait pu habituellement exercer.\nToute libert\u00e9 r\u00e9siduelle qu\u2019avait Deans Knight \u00e9tait illusoire, ce qui ne sert qu\u2019\u00e0 renforcer \u00e0 quel point les op\u00e9rations ont contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5). L\u2019acceptation par Deans Knight de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires que lui a procur\u00e9e Matco \u00e9tait un fait accompli, parce que la convention interdisait \u00e0 Deans Knight de se livrer \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 autre que l\u2019\u00e9tude et l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires, et parce que le refus de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires \u00e9tait lourd de cons\u00e9quences. Pour ce qui est de la capacit\u00e9 de Newco de vendre les actions restantes \u00e0 une partie autre que Matco ou de choisir de ne pas les vendre du tout, les agissements de Deans Knight \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 neutralis\u00e9s par la convention d\u2019investissement, et les principaux avantages de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019actions \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 annul\u00e9s par leur assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de Matco. La capacit\u00e9 de recevoir le montant garanti sans vendre les actions restantes \u00e0 Matco \u00e9tait importante, car, dans certaines circonstances, l\u2019achat par Matco des actions pouvait d\u00e9clencher une acquisition de contr\u00f4le de jure. La s\u00e9rie complexe d\u2019op\u00e9rations et la souplesse de la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires uniquement parce que les parties contractantes voulaient commettre le m\u00e9fait m\u00eame que le par. 111(5) visait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir. Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations a clairement contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5).\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 (dissidente) : L\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre accueilli et le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli. Les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement n\u2019ont pas contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5), et il n\u2019y a donc pas eu d\u2019abus. La RGA\u00c9 exige une mise en balance minutieuse entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du contribuable de minimiser ses imp\u00f4ts gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des moyens techniquement l\u00e9gitimes et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gislatif de garantir l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime fiscal. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019adoption non \u00e9quivoque par le Parlement du crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le de jure au par. 111(5) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, les juges majoritaires ont souscrit \u00e0 une approche ad hoc qui \u00e9largit la notion de contr\u00f4le en y incluant un vaste \u00e9ventail de facteurs op\u00e9rationnels. Cette approche ouvre la voie \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir judiciaire discr\u00e9tionnaire illimit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sultera en l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles sur la restriction des pertes pr\u00e9vues au par. 111(5) sur la base d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments circonstanciels.\nL\u2019approche qu\u2019adoptent les juges majoritaires afin de cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) ne tient pas compte du principe fondamental selon lequel la RGA\u00c9 ne sert pas et ne peut pas servir \u00e0 passer outre l\u2019intention sp\u00e9cifique du Parlement quant \u00e0 des dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques de la Loi. L\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 repose sur la m\u00e9thode qu\u2019emploie la Cour pour toute interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, et n\u2019est gu\u00e8re plus qu\u2019une forme sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention du Parlement. Il ne faut pas tenir pour acquis que la RGA\u00c9 joue un r\u00f4le dans toutes les op\u00e9rations et dans tous les contextes. Il y a accord avec les juges majoritaires pour dire que rien n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019appliquer la RGA\u00c9 lorsque la Loi pr\u00e9voit des conditions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il faut satisfaire pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat en particulier, comme dans le cas d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique; toutefois, le texte d\u2019une disposition peut parfois s\u2019av\u00e9rer d\u00e9terminant et expliquer enti\u00e8rement la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. La question cl\u00e9 est celle de savoir si le Parlement avait sp\u00e9cifiquement l\u2019intention d\u2019emp\u00eacher ou de permettre un certain type d\u2019op\u00e9rations. Lorsqu\u2019il est possible de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une disposition anti\u2011\u00e9vitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement con\u00e7ue de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inclure certaines situations et \u00e0 en exclure d\u2019autres, il est raisonnable d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que le Parlement a choisi de limiter sa port\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence. La RGA\u00c9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue dans le but d\u2019identifier des strat\u00e9gies fiscales qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues, mais si le Parlement r\u00e9dige une disposition anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique qui laisse ouvert un vide hautement pr\u00e9visible, il est plus probable que ce vide soit intentionnel, et le fait de se fonder sur lui ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant abusif.\nLe paragraphe 111(5) est une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique qui limite ce qui constituerait autrement des d\u00e9ductions permises aux termes de l\u2019al. 111(1)a), qui permet aux contribuables de d\u00e9duire les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital pour les fins du calcul du revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Lors d\u2019une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, le par. 111(5) emp\u00eache une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de reporter ses pertes \u00e0 moins que l\u2019entreprise exploit\u00e9e par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a subi le changement de contr\u00f4le continue d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9rant des profits ou avec une attente raisonnable de profits. Il emp\u00eache les acquisitions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s faites dans le seul but d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des attributs fiscaux en restreignant l\u2019utilisation de ces derniers s\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus lors d\u2019une prise de contr\u00f4le. Les tribunaux ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb pour les fins de la Loi renvoie au contr\u00f4le de jure. Celui\u2011ci correspond \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un nombre suffisant d\u2019actions conf\u00e9rant la majorit\u00e9 des voix lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection du conseil d\u2019administration de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les documents constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e8rent le contr\u00f4le de jure puisqu\u2019ils restreignent la capacit\u00e9 des actionnaires d\u2019exercer leur droit de vote librement. En revanche, les documents externes cr\u00e9ent des obligations contractuelles et non des obligations juridiques ou tenant d\u2019un acte constitutif. Par cons\u00e9quent, la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et de facto r\u00e9side dans l\u2019\u00e9tendue des facteurs qui peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer qui a le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) est de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux attributs fiscaux lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 acc\u00e8de \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci au moyen d\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le de jure. Une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique du par. 111(5) r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Parlement n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019intention que les tribunaux examinent des facteurs autres que ceux relatifs \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019actions pour d\u00e9terminer qui a le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les juges majoritaires introduisent la notion d\u2019\u00e9quivalence fonctionnelle, qui assimile la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e0 un acte constitutif de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les fins de l\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le. Celle\u2011ci ne tient pas compte du fait que les actes constitutifs et les accords externes sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s de mani\u00e8res radicalement diff\u00e9rentes : un contrat ordinaire ne peut jamais \u00eatre l\u2019\u00e9quivalent fonctionnel d\u2019un acte constitutif. La RGA\u00c9 ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour passer outre l\u2019intention claire du Parlement, et l\u2019approche des juges majoritaires s\u2019\u00e9carte de l\u2019expression claire par le Parlement au par. 111(5) d\u2019un test fond\u00e9 sur le contr\u00f4le de jure pour restreindre l\u2019utilisation des pertes.\nD\u00e9terminer si une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement est abusive requiert un examen approfondi des faits et soul\u00e8ve une question mixte de fait et de droit. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de principe isolable, l\u2019application du droit aux faits est assujettie \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Aucune erreur du genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme la notion de contr\u00f4le de jure est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), la question cl\u00e9 est celle de d\u00e9terminer si Matco a acquis le contr\u00f4le de jure de Deans Knight et si la relation entre Matco et Deans Knight est le point central de l\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait raisonnablement appuy\u00e9e par ses conclusions factuelles et son interpr\u00e9tation de la convention d\u2019investissement. Il n\u2019y a aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans la conclusion de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t selon laquelle Matco n\u2019a pas acquis le contr\u00f4le \u00ab effectif \u00bb de Deans Knight. Jamais Matco n\u2019a\u2011t\u2011elle d\u00e9tenu ou eu le droit de d\u00e9tenir suffisamment d\u2019actions pour devenir une actionnaire majoritaire. La convention d\u2019investissement n\u2019a aucune pertinence pour d\u00e9terminer si Matco avait acquis le contr\u00f4le de jure. Elle n\u2019accordait pas \u00e0 Matco le contr\u00f4le sur la vente des actions restantes de Newco apr\u00e8s la conversion par Matco des d\u00e9bentures et n\u2019exigeait pas que Matco pr\u00e9sente l\u2019occasion de vente de ces actions \u00e0 des tiers. Le crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tabli par le Parlement est nettement ax\u00e9 sur les droits de vote d\u00e9coulant de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le droit aux dividendes est sans aucune pertinence. Le seul droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui importe est le droit de vote \u2014 ce que la convention d\u2019investissement n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a tir\u00e9 une conclusion pr\u00e9cise en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sur le fait que Deans Knight est demeur\u00e9e libre de ses agissements tout au long des op\u00e9rations. La caract\u00e9risation erron\u00e9e du par. 111(5) n\u2019a pas vici\u00e9 cette importante conclusion en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Matco n\u2019a pas vraiment acquis Deans Knight au sens pratique du terme.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi en mati\u00e8re fiscale soul\u00e8ve la question de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement (la \u00ab RGA\u00c9 \u00bb) aux op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante, Deans Knight Income Corporation, en vue de mon\u00e9tiser des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital et d\u2019autres d\u00e9ductions.\n[2] Aux termes de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu , L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5 e suppl .) (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), les imp\u00f4ts d\u2019un contribuable sont habituellement calcul\u00e9s en fonction du revenu et des pertes de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition (art. 2). La Loi autorise toutefois le report prospectif de pertes autres qu\u2019en capital sur une p\u00e9riode de 3 ans ainsi que le report r\u00e9trospectif de ces pertes sur une p\u00e9riode de 20 ans afin de r\u00e9duire les revenus imposables de ces ann\u00e9es\u2011l\u00e0 (al. 111(1)a)). La possibilit\u00e9 de reporter des pertes est toutefois limit\u00e9e : notamment, en cas d\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition ne peuvent \u00eatre report\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 poursuive une entreprise similaire ou identique \u00e0 celle qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 les pertes (par. 111(5)). Une acquisition de contr\u00f4le survient lorsqu\u2019une personne ou un groupe de personnes acquiert le contr\u00f4le de jure, qui consiste g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en l\u2019acquisition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un nombre d\u2019actions suffisant pour \u00e9lire la majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil d\u2019administration (Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. c. Canada, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 795). Elle est \u00e9galement r\u00e9put\u00e9e survenir lorsque le contribuable acquiert le droit d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir de telles actions, si l\u2019acquisition de ce droit visait \u00e0 \u00e9viter l\u2019application d\u2019une restriction au report de pertes (par. 256(8) et al. 251(5)b); voir annexe).\n[3] L\u2019appelante a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 profiter de la r\u00e8gle sur le report des pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) sans d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de la restriction pr\u00e9vue au par. 111(5). Bien que les op\u00e9rations \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi seront expliqu\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans la prochaine section, il convient d\u2019en faire bri\u00e8vement le r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Avant les op\u00e9rations en cause, l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne en difficult\u00e9 qui avait accumul\u00e9 environ 90 M$ en pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, en d\u00e9penses pour la recherche scientifique et le d\u00e9veloppement (d\u00e9penses pour les \u00ab RS & DE \u00bb) et en cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019investissement (\u00ab CII \u00bb) (collectivement, les \u00ab attributs fiscaux \u00bb). Compte tenu de ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, elle ne disposait pas de revenus imposables qui pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9duits par ses pertes ant\u00e9rieures. Elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 mon\u00e9tiser la valeur de ces derni\u00e8res et a conclu une entente avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de capital de risque Matco Capital Ltd. (\u00ab Matco \u00bb) pour ce faire. Un arrangement complexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u autour des op\u00e9rations suivantes. Premi\u00e8rement, tous les actifs et les passifs de l\u2019appelante seraient transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e. Deuxi\u00e8mement, Matco obtiendrait une d\u00e9benture pouvant \u00eatre convertie en actions de l\u2019appelante, et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante avait re\u00e7u la promesse qu\u2019elle recevrait au moins un montant garanti pour la vente de ses actions restantes. Troisi\u00e8mement, Matco trouverait une nouvelle entreprise pour l\u2019appelante, qui servirait \u00e0 lever des fonds au moyen d\u2019un premier appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne (\u00ab PAPE \u00bb). Les profits de cette entreprise seraient \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019imp\u00f4t gr\u00e2ce aux attributs fiscaux dont l\u2019appelante ne pouvait se servir au d\u00e9part. Les op\u00e9rations pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019arrangement se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es comme pr\u00e9vu. Pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009 \u00e0 2012, l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9duit la plupart de ses attributs fiscaux pour r\u00e9duire ses obligations fiscales. Le ministre du Revenu national a toutefois \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation et a refus\u00e9 les d\u00e9ductions d\u00e9crites pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[4] Devant la Cour, les parties conviennent que l\u2019appelante a respect\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 de la Loi . Autrement dit, les parties sont toutes d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019\u00ab acquisition de contr\u00f4le \u00bb et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la restriction au report des pertes pr\u00e9vue au par. 111(5) ne s\u2019applique pas. La principale question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est donc celle de savoir si l\u2019art. 245 de la Loi \u2014 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement ou la RGA\u00c9 \u2014 s\u2019applique pour refuser les d\u00e9ductions. La RGA\u00c9 sert \u00e0 supprimer des avantages fiscaux d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une op\u00e9ration conforme \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale des dispositions de la Loi , mais qui constitue n\u00e9anmoins une mesure d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif. Elle s\u2019applique \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration en pr\u00e9sence des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 245 : (1) un \u00ab avantage fiscal \u00bb; (2) une op\u00e9ration qui constitue une op\u00e9ration \u00ab d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00bb, en ce sens qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas effectu\u00e9e principalement pour un objet v\u00e9ritable \u2014 l\u2019obtention de l\u2019avantage fiscal n\u2019\u00e9tant pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un objet v\u00e9ritable; et (3) une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement qui procure l\u2019avantage fiscal et qui constitue un \u00ab abus \u00bb dans l\u2019application des dispositions de la Loi (ou de lois connexes).\n[5] La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a jug\u00e9 que les op\u00e9rations constituaient des op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 un avantage fiscal, mais elle a conclu qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas abusives. En appel, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que les op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient abusives, de telle sorte que la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019appliquait pour justifier le refus des avantages fiscaux. Je note que les parties et les tribunaux d\u2019instances inf\u00e9rieures ont concentr\u00e9 leur analyse sur les d\u00e9ductions pour pertes autres qu\u2019en capital puisque les dispositions sur la RS & DE et sur les CII fonctionnent de fa\u00e7on semblable. Comme en Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la seule question dont la Cour est saisie est celle de savoir si la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un \u00e9vitement fiscal abusif.\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi. Les op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient abusives. Le paragraphe 111(5) de la Loi a pour esprit et objet d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. Or, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie complexe d\u2019op\u00e9rations, l\u2019appelante a subi une transformation fondamentale qui a accompli ce que le Parlement cherchait \u00e0 \u00e9viter, tout en contournant tout juste le libell\u00e9 du par. 111(5). Le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations a donc contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. Comme la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019applique pour refuser les avantages fiscaux d\u00e9coulant de ces op\u00e9rations, la nouvelle cotisation du ministre doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie.\nII. Faits\n[7] Avant de proc\u00e9der aux op\u00e9rations en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, l\u2019appelante exploitait une entreprise de recherche sur des m\u00e9dicaments et de vente d\u2019additifs alimentaires nutritionnels portant le nom de Forbes Medi\u2011Tech Inc. Ses actions \u00e9taient cot\u00e9es en bourse sur le NASDAQ et le TSX. En 2007, l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait en difficult\u00e9 et elle risquait l\u2019exclusion de ses actions de la bourse NASDAQ parce que le prix de ses actions ordinaires avait chut\u00e9 en de\u00e7\u00e0 du prix minimal exig\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re. Durant une r\u00e9union du conseil d\u2019administration de l\u2019appelante en mai 2007, David Goold, qui en \u00e9tait alors le directeur financier, a fait part aux autres membres d\u2019une m\u00e9thode pour tirer parti de la valeur des attributs fiscaux accumul\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous forme de pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, de d\u00e9penses pour la RS & DE et de CII. Au terme de 2007, ces attributs fiscaux inutilis\u00e9s totalisaient pr\u00e8s de 90 M$. Monsieur Goold a inform\u00e9 le conseil d\u2019administration qu\u2019une r\u00e9organisation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, suivie d\u2019une prise en charge par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, permettrait de mon\u00e9tiser les attributs fiscaux \u00e0 raison de 4 \u00e0 4,5 cents par dollar pour un total de 3,5 \u00e0 4 M$. Il \u00e9tait devenu improbable que l\u2019appelante soit en mesure d\u2019utiliser elle-m\u00eame ses attributs fiscaux; de fait, en novembre 2007, elle ne disposait plus que de six mois de flux de tr\u00e9sorerie.\n[8] L\u2019appelante a entrepris des n\u00e9gociations avec Matco et sign\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019intention en novembre 2007. Cependant, l\u2019entreprise dont Matco voulait compenser les revenus avec les attributs fiscaux de l\u2019appelante a p\u00e9riclit\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2007, et Matco a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle ne donnerait pas suite \u00e0 l\u2019entente.\n[9] Au d\u00e9but de 2008, l\u2019appelante a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9organisation et d\u2019une restructuration au moyen d\u2019un plan d\u2019arrangement approuv\u00e9 par le tribunal. Le conseil d\u2019administration avait jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du meilleur moyen pour assurer le respect des exigences d\u2019inscription du NASDAQ relativement au cours acheteur minimal tout en facilitant une d\u00e9marche future pour mon\u00e9tiser ses attributs fiscaux. Une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9, 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (\u00ab Newco \u00bb), a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e, et toutes les actions ordinaires, les options et les bons de souscription restants de l\u2019appelante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s pour des actions ordinaires et des options de Newco sur une base de huit pour un. L\u2019appelante est donc devenue une filiale en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive de Newco. Les actions de Newco ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se n\u00e9gocier sur le NASDAQ en lieu et place de celles de l\u2019appelante.\n[10] Le 4 mars 2008, l\u2019appelante et Matco ont convenu d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me lettre d\u2019intention. Le 19 mars 2008, l\u2019appelante a conclu une convention d\u2019investissement avec Newco et Matco (la \u00ab convention d\u2019investissement \u00bb).\n[11] Aux termes de la convention d\u2019investissement, Newco recevrait environ 3,8 M$ de la fa\u00e7on suivante. Premi\u00e8rement, Matco ach\u00e8terait une d\u00e9benture convertible au prix de 3 M$, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019ajustements (art. 2.2 et 2.3 de la convention d\u2019investissement, reproduits au d.a., vol. II, p. 86). La d\u00e9benture serait convertible en 35 p. 100 des actions votantes et 100 p. 100 des actions non votantes de l\u2019appelante que d\u00e9tenait Newco (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. 79 p. 100 des actions de l\u2019appelante). Deuxi\u00e8mement, Matco garantirait que Newco serait en mesure de vendre les actions de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait encore pour un montant minimal de 800 000 $ (le \u00ab montant garanti \u00bb), sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019ajustements (art. 5.5). Ces actions restantes repr\u00e9sentaient plus de la moiti\u00e9 (65 p. 100) des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante. Newco ne serait pas tenue de vendre ses actions \u00e0 Matco. Advenant qu\u2019aucune occasion ne se pr\u00e9sente pour que Newco vende ses actions restantes durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, Matco aurait toujours l\u2019obligation de payer le montant garanti.\n[12] L\u2019appelante subirait une r\u00e9organisation : ses actifs, ses passifs et le montant pay\u00e9 par Matco pour la d\u00e9benture convertible seraient transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 Newco (art. 3.2). Newco mettrait tout en \u0153uvre pour garantir que les trois seuls dirigeants de l\u2019appelante soient Charles Butt (pr\u00e9sident et PDG de l\u2019appelante), David Goold et un repr\u00e9sentant choisi par Matco. Les deux premiers allaient d\u00e9missionner apr\u00e8s l\u2019acception d\u2019une occasion d\u2019affaires (art. 3.4).\n[13] Matco aurait un an pour pr\u00e9senter cette occasion d\u2019affaires \u2014 une occasion d\u2019affaires qui permettrait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019exploiter une nouvelle entreprise, et ce, vraisemblablement avec une nouvelle \u00e9quipe de direction. C\u2019est cette nouvelle entreprise qui g\u00e9n\u00e9rerait les profits desquels seraient d\u00e9duits les attributs fiscaux. Newco disposerait d\u2019un court laps de temps pour accepter ou refuser l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires (art. 4.1), mais, si elle la refusait, Matco n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 payer le montant garanti (al. 5.5(d)).\n[14] S\u2019il survenait une acquisition du contr\u00f4le de l\u2019appelante ou de Newco, Matco n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 payer le montant garanti et Newco aurait l\u2019obligation de racheter la d\u00e9benture convertible de Matco et de lui payer 1 M$ suppl\u00e9mentaire (al. 5.5(f)). En outre, sauf dans le contexte de la mise en \u0153uvre de la convention d\u2019investissement, Newco et l\u2019appelante ne pouvaient pas s\u2019adonner aux activit\u00e9s suivantes sans le consentement de Matco (art. 6.1) :\n- \u00e9mettre des actions, des options, des bons de souscription, des options d\u2019achat, des privil\u00e8ges de conversion ou tout autre droit pour acqu\u00e9rir des actions de l\u2019appelante,\n- vendre, transf\u00e9rer, nantir, grever ou ali\u00e9ner, ou accepter de vendre, de transf\u00e9rer, de nantir, de grever ou d\u2019ali\u00e9ner des actions ou des options, des bons de souscription, des options d\u2019achat, des privil\u00e8ges de conversion ou tout autre droit pour acqu\u00e9rir des actions de l\u2019appelante,\n- modifier les actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou ses r\u00e8glements administratifs,\n- fractionner, regrouper ou reclassifier les actions restantes de l\u2019appelante,\n- racheter ou acheter des actions de l\u2019appelante,\n- r\u00e9organiser, regrouper ou fusionner l\u2019appelante,\n- prendre ou envisager quelques mesure ou engagement que ce soit quant \u00e0 une liquidation totale ou partielle, une dissolution ou une cessation des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante,\n- d\u00e9clarer ou payer des dividendes ou r\u00e9duire le capital de l\u2019appelante,\n- prendre quelque mesure que ce soit qui entra\u00eenerait ou pourrait entra\u00eener un changement du contr\u00f4le de Newco ou de l\u2019appelante, autre que les circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques envisag\u00e9es dans la convention d\u2019investissement,\n- conclure, transf\u00e9rer, r\u00e9silier ou modifier quelque contrat ou convention que ce soit en lien avec l\u2019appelante,\n- grever quelque actif que ce soit de l\u2019appelante,\n- en ce qui concerne l\u2019appelante, cr\u00e9er, contracter, garantir ou assumer une dette pour de l\u2019argent emprunt\u00e9 ou devenir autrement responsable des obligations de toute autre personne,\n- en ce qui concerne l\u2019appelante, consentir des pr\u00eats, des avances de fonds ou des contributions en capital \u00e0 toute autre personne ou investir en elle,\n- modifier de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit les principes ou pratiques comptables appliqu\u00e9s par Newco ou l\u2019appelante, autre que les changements requis par un changement connexe de politique,\n- se livrer \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 autre que l\u2019examen et la recherche de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires.\n[15] Avant la signature de la convention d\u2019investissement, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Matco, Alan Ross, a achet\u00e9 100 actions de l\u2019appelante de Newco par l\u2019entremise de sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille poss\u00e9d\u00e9e en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive, 1250280 Alberta Ltd. Ce faisant, il visait notamment \u00e0 garantir que la convention d\u2019investissement ne constituerait pas une convention unanime des actionnaires.\n[16] La convention d\u2019investissement a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e le 9 mai 2008. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente, les actifs et les passifs de l\u2019appelante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 Newco en \u00e9change d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre que l\u2019appelante a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre filiale de Newco; Matco a souscrit une d\u00e9benture convertible pour un montant de pr\u00e8s de 3 M$ que l\u2019appelante a transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autre filiale. Comme pr\u00e9vu, tous les dirigeants de l\u2019appelante ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 sauf M. Butt, et MM. Goold et Ross ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus administrateurs.\n[17] Matco a tent\u00e9 de trouver une entreprise qui pourrait se servir des attributs fiscaux de l\u2019appelante. En d\u00e9cembre 2008, Matco a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une occasion d\u2019affaires comme le pr\u00e9voyait la convention d\u2019investissement. Deans Knight Capital Management (\u00ab DKCM \u00bb), une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de gestion de fonds communs de placement, \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 investir dans des instruments de cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 haut rendement qui se vendaient \u00e0 bas prix en raison de la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008. DKCM pr\u00e9voyait lever les fonds pour effectuer ces investissements au moyen d\u2019un PAPE. Matco a propos\u00e9 que DKCM utilise l\u2019appelante comme v\u00e9hicule pour le PAPE envisag\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que de constituer une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9, parce que les attributs fiscaux de l\u2019appelante constitueraient un abri fiscal pour la presque totalit\u00e9 du revenu et des gains en capital du portefeuille.\n[18] Les membres du conseil d\u2019administration de l\u2019appelante ont discut\u00e9 de la proposition, effectu\u00e9 quelques recherches sur DKCM et approuv\u00e9 la proposition. En d\u00e9cembre 2008, DKCM et l\u2019appelante ont sign\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019intention. Celle\u2011ci pr\u00e9cisait que l\u2019appelante devait d\u00e9tenir au moins 95 M$ de montants d\u00e9ductibles qui pourraient servir \u00e0 compenser le revenu g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au Canada. Afin que l\u2019appelante puisse servir au projet d\u2019affaires de DKCM, celle\u2011ci serait nomm\u00e9e pour diriger l\u2019appelante : 4 des 5 administrateurs de l\u2019appelante seraient nomm\u00e9s par DKCM, et l\u2019appelante servirait dans un PAPE de 100 M$ minimum, dont le produit servirait \u00e0 acheter des titres de cr\u00e9ance qui g\u00e9n\u00e9reraient un revenu et des gains, lesquels seraient mis \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019imp\u00f4t par les attributs fiscaux. Le prix du PAPE serait tel que les actions ordinaires existantes de l\u2019appelante (qui, ultimement, seraient d\u00e9tenues par Matco apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle aurait converti sa d\u00e9benture) se verraient attribuer une valeur de l\u2019actif net de 5 M$.\n[19] En f\u00e9vrier 2009, le nom de l\u2019appelante est devenu ce qu\u2019il est aujourd\u2019hui, \u00ab Deans Knight Income Corporation \u00bb. Le pr\u00e9sident de DKCM est devenu administrateur de l\u2019appelante. En mars 2009, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Matco ainsi que quatre candidats propos\u00e9s par DKCM ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s administrateurs de l\u2019appelante, et trois membres de la direction de DKCM en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s dirigeants.\n[20] Tout juste avant le PAPE, Matco a converti sa d\u00e9benture en 35 p. 100 des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante et 100 p. 100 de ses actions non votantes. Matco a aussi obtenu une exception \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019immobilisation post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 un PAPE afin de pouvoir acheter le reste des actions d\u00e9tenues par Newco avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance envisag\u00e9e par la convention d\u2019investissement.\n[21] Le PAPE a eu lieu le 18 mars 2009. Il convient de noter que le prospectus pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019il existait un risque que l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada [traduction] \u00ab conteste avec succ\u00e8s le montant de tels attributs fiscaux ou le fait que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puisse s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 30). Un total de 10 036 890 actions a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis \u00e0 10 $ par action, \u00e9mission qui a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 plus de 100 M$. Dans les circonstances, les actions de l\u2019appelante dont Matco \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire valaient pr\u00e8s de 4 M$.\n[22] En avril 2009, Matco, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9e, a offert \u00e0 Newco d\u2019acheter ses actions restantes pour le montant garanti. Bien que ce montant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieur au prix du PAPE, Newco a accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre. Elle l\u2019a fait parce qu\u2019elle avait besoin des fonds pour ses propres op\u00e9rations et parce que son conseil d\u2019administration estimait que le prix de l\u2019action pouvait baisser avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019engagement de non\u2011cession post\u00e9rieure au PAPE.\n[23] L\u2019entreprise d\u2019investissement de l\u2019appelante a eu du succ\u00e8s, de sorte qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement pay\u00e9 des dividendes \u00e0 ses actionnaires durant les quatre premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de son exploitation. Comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 liquider l\u2019entreprise en question durant la cinqui\u00e8me ann\u00e9e.\n[24] Lorsqu\u2019elle a produit ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009 \u00e0 2012 et calcul\u00e9 ses revenus, l\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 des d\u00e9ductions pour des attributs fiscaux datant de 2007 et ant\u00e9rieurement. Elle a d\u00e9duit pratiquement 65 M$ de ses attributs fiscaux afin de r\u00e9duire son obligation fiscale d\u00e9coulant de son entreprise relative aux titres de cr\u00e9ances.\n[25] Le ministre a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation pour ces ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition afin de refuser les d\u00e9ductions pour ces pertes et d\u00e9penses. L\u2019appelante a contest\u00e9 la nouvelle cotisation et interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\nIII. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, 2019 CCI 76\n[26] Le juge Paris de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait saisi de deux questions. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait celle de savoir si Matco avait obtenu une option d\u2019achat de la majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante, acqu\u00e9rant de ce fait le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 selon le par. 256(8) et l\u2019al. 251(5) b) de la Loi . Le juge Paris a conclu que Matco n\u2019a pas obtenu un tel droit et, en cons\u00e9quence, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019\u00ab acquisition du contr\u00f4le \u00bb d\u00e9clenchant l\u2019application du par. 111(5). Cette conclusion n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e ni en appel ni devant la Cour.\n[27] La deuxi\u00e8me question \u00e9tait celle de savoir si la RGA\u00c9 pouvait s\u2019appliquer pour refuser la d\u00e9duction des attributs fiscaux. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, le juge Paris devait d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existait une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations qui avaient entra\u00een\u00e9 un avantage fiscal, si les op\u00e9rations visaient principalement l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal et si elles avaient donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un abus dans l\u2019application des dispositions de la Loi . Le juge Paris a choisi de se concentrer sur les dispositions relatives aux pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, puisque les restrictions aux d\u00e9ductions pour la RS & DE et les CII fonctionnaient de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Apr\u00e8s avoir appliqu\u00e9 chacune des \u00e9tapes du test relatif \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 , le juge Paris a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Il a aussi conclu que la convention d\u2019investissement, la restructuration de l\u2019appelante ainsi que toutes les op\u00e9rations connexes visaient principalement \u00e0 mon\u00e9tiser les attributs fiscaux. Les op\u00e9rations en cause pouvaient donc \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement. Cependant, le juge Paris a conclu que ces op\u00e9rations n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abusives parce qu\u2019elles ne contrecarraient pas l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions de la Loi .\n[28] Premi\u00e8rement, le juge Paris s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) ainsi que des par. 111(5) et 256(8). Il a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019objet et esprit du premier consistait \u00e0 \u00ab offrir un all\u00e8gement aux contribuables qui ont subi des pertes \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00c9tat, quand il pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve un imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, tire profit de leurs revenus \u00bb (par. 99 (CanLII)).\n[29] Quant au par. 111(5), le juge Paris a \u00e9crit que le Parlement a introduit le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le \u00ab aux fins de qualification d\u2019une perte qui en th\u00e9orie a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 une partie non li\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 103). Il a indiqu\u00e9 que la notion de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tait essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019application du par. 111(5) et que, depuis longtemps, il est reconnu que cette notion renvoie au contr\u00f4le de jure. Le juge Paris a aussi examin\u00e9 l\u2019historique de ce paragraphe et il a reconnu que le Parlement a adopt\u00e9 des dispositions selon lesquelles le contr\u00f4le de jure est r\u00e9put\u00e9 exister ou non dans certaines circonstances, ce qui permet au ministre d\u2019effectuer un examen sans \u00ab se limiter au registre des actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer qui d\u00e9tient le contr\u00f4le essentiel \u00bb (par. 111 et 115). Il a toutefois not\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de facto au par. 256(5.1) n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9. Le juge Paris s\u2019est ensuite pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019objet du par. 111(5) et, selon lui, il \u00e9tait \u00ab manifeste que le par. 111(5) visait l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9changes de pertes fiscales. La restriction concernant l\u2019utilisation des pertes est assortie d\u2019un petit nombre d\u2019exceptions (le redressement d\u2019une entreprise d\u00e9ficitaire et le transfert des pertes entre des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sous contr\u00f4le commun) \u00bb (par. 126). Il a reconnu que la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente du choix de refuser les reports de pertes \u00e9tait qu\u2019\u00ab apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le [. . .] la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est assimilable \u00e0 un nouveau contribuable puisqu\u2019elle a de nouveaux actionnaires \u00bb (par. 128). Il a en outre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le a servi de marqueur raisonnable pour d\u00e9terminer \u00ab si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 participe librement \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration ou si elle en est une participante passive, \u00e0 la solde d\u2019une nouvelle personne ou d\u2019un nouveau groupe de personnes dont le seul motif est de tirer avantage de ses pertes ou de ses attributs fiscaux \u00bb (par. 134).\n[30] Se fondant sur cette analyse, le juge Paris a conclu que le par. 111(5) a pour objet et pour esprit \u00ab la restriction des manipulations des pertes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par une nouvelle personne ou un nouveau groupe de personnes qui assume le contr\u00f4le effectif des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 134). Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement pench\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement sur l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 256(8) et a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019\u00ab emp\u00eacher un contribuable de contourner les dispositions sur l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal en acqu\u00e9rant le contr\u00f4le sur les actions ou les droits de vote rattach\u00e9s aux actions pour s\u2019approprier le contr\u00f4le effectif d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 138).\n[31] Le juge Paris s\u2019est ensuite demand\u00e9 si l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrecarr\u00e9 par les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement et il a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait \u00ab de d\u00e9terminer si, m\u00eame si elle n\u2019a pas acquis le contr\u00f4le de jure, Matco a acquis le contr\u00f4le effectif de l\u2019appelante d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui contournait l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du paragraphe 111(5) et des restrictions relatives au transfert d\u2019attributs fiscaux \u00bb (par. 144). Il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument selon lequel un changement de direction, d\u2019entreprise commerciale, d\u2019actifs et de passifs, ainsi que de nom \u00e9tait pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si Matco avait acquis le contr\u00f4le effectif. Il s\u2019est donc concentr\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si celle-ci d\u00e9tenait le contr\u00f4le effectif de la majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante avant le PAPE et il a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. \u00c0 son avis, \u00ab [l]\u2019appelante a particip\u00e9 de son plein gr\u00e9 aux op\u00e9rations ayant permis la d\u00e9duction des attributs fiscaux du revenu de l\u2019entreprise d\u2019investissement \u00bb (par. 152).\n[32] Le juge Paris n\u2019a pas non plus accept\u00e9 la th\u00e8se voulant que les op\u00e9rations aient contrecarr\u00e9 l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 256(8) de la Loi . Il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de la Couronne selon lequel Matco d\u00e9tenait le contr\u00f4le effectif des actions restantes de l\u2019appelante d\u00e9tenues par Newco : celle\u2011ci aurait pu vendre les actions sans le consentement de Matco; la convention d\u2019investissement ne stipulait pas que seule Matco pouvait pr\u00e9senter une occasion pour que Newco vende ses actions restantes; et les restrictions aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9quivalaient pas \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de ses actions.\n[33] Compte tenu de sa conclusion que la RGA\u00c9 ne s\u2019appliquait pas, le juge Paris a accueilli l\u2019appel de la nouvelle cotisation.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 2021 CAF 160\n[34] Devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la seule question en litige portait sur la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , soit celle de savoir si les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9taient abusives. La juge Woods, au nom d\u2019une cour unanime, a accueilli l\u2019appel du ministre et conclu que les op\u00e9rations contrecarraient l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) de la Loi .\n[35] Selon la juge Woods, l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par le juge Paris pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) \u00e9tait la bonne. Elle a toutefois remplac\u00e9 le terme \u00ab contr\u00f4le effectif \u00bb par \u00ab contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el \u00bb, puisque le premier avait sem\u00e9 la confusion. Ainsi, elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de cette disposition \u00e9tait de \u00ab vise[r] \u00e0 restreindre l\u2019utilisation de certaines pertes, y compris les pertes autres que les pertes en capital, lorsqu\u2019une personne ou un groupe de personnes acquiert le contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el des actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, par un contr\u00f4le de jure ou autrement \u00bb (par. 72 (CanLII) (je souligne)).\n[36] La juge Woods a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument selon lequel l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) \u00e9tait exprim\u00e9 en totalit\u00e9 par son libell\u00e9. Elle a not\u00e9 que la disposition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour interdire le trafic d\u2019actions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui disposaient de pertes \u00e0 reporter et que la RGA\u00c9 elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9tait, en partie, une r\u00e9ponse aux recours non souhait\u00e9s aux reports de pertes. De plus, elle a cit\u00e9 la reconnaissance par la Cour que \u00ab la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu a comme politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019interdire le transfert de pertes entre contribuables, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions pr\u00e9cises \u00bb et que \u00ab [c]ette politique [est] \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (par. 81, citant Mathew c. Canada, 2005 CSC 55, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 643, par. 49). La juge Woods a reconnu que sa formulation de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) \u00ab inclut des formes de contr\u00f4le de jure et de contr\u00f4le de facto \u00bb, mais elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el est diff\u00e9rent de celui du contr\u00f4le de facto (par. 83).\n[37] Se penchant ensuite sur la question de savoir si les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement contrecarraient l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), la juge Woods a conclu que les clauses de la convention d\u2019investissement conf\u00e9raient \u00e0 Matco le contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el des actions de l\u2019appelante, tant en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que pour l\u2019approbation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires. Sur le plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les restrictions stipul\u00e9es dans la convention d\u2019investissement ont eu pour effet de transf\u00e9rer le contr\u00f4le \u00e0 Matco. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires, la juge Woods a not\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab il n\u2019existait aucune r\u00e9elle probabilit\u00e9 [de rejet de] l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires \u00bb (par. 104) puisque cela aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 la perte du montant garanti. M\u00eame si l\u2019appelante a discut\u00e9 de la proposition et effectu\u00e9 certaines recherches avant de l\u2019approuver, elle n\u2019agissait pas librement : la juge Woods a soulign\u00e9 que ses recherches se sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que l\u2019\u00ab entreprise ne dispara\u00eetrait pas du jour au lendemain \u00bb (par. 108).\n[38] La juge Woods a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu abus dans l\u2019application du par. 111(5). En cons\u00e9quence, il \u00e9tait satisfait aux conditions d\u2019application de la RGA\u00c9 et l\u2019avantage fiscal devait \u00eatre refus\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a donc fait droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et annul\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\nIV. Questions en litige\n[39] Seule la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 fait l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats devant la Cour. Les questions en litige peuvent donc \u00eatre formul\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n(1) La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a\u2011t\u2011elle commis une erreur dans sa formulation de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) de la Loi ?\n(2) La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a\u2011t\u2011elle commis une erreur en concluant que les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9taient abusives?\nV. Analyse\nA. Contexte de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement\n[40] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que la Cour se penche sur la RGA\u00c9 . Un examen de ses origines et de son r\u00f4le dans le cadre de la Loi permet n\u00e9anmoins un \u00e9clairage utile sur le contexte de cette disposition.\n[41] En 1988, le Parlement a adopt\u00e9 la RGA\u00c9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 245 de la Loi , en partie en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stubart Investments Ltd. c. La Reine, [1984] 1 R.C.S. 536. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour avait rejet\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale de la Loi . Cependant, elle avait \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une pr\u00e9curseure de la RGA\u00c9 qui aurait exig\u00e9 que des op\u00e9rations aient un v\u00e9ritable objectif commercial. La Cour avait plut\u00f4t fourni des directives pour limiter les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal inacceptables. Le Parlement a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019arr\u00eat Stubart \u00e9tait une r\u00e9ponse inad\u00e9quate au probl\u00e8me de l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal (Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601, par. 14).\n[42] En outre, l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif \u00e9tait devenu une source de pr\u00e9occupation importante pour le Parlement. \u00c0 l\u2019aide des conseils de sp\u00e9cialistes, des contribuables concevaient de plus en plus des op\u00e9rations juridiques complexes pour \u00e9viter l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement. Une fois que les m\u00e9canismes d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9taient mis au jour \u2014 dans le cadre soit de demandes de d\u00e9cision anticip\u00e9e soit de cotisations fiscales \u2014, le Parlement r\u00e9agissait pour \u00ab colmater \u00bb les failles de la Loi afin d\u2019interdire l\u2019usage futur des m\u00e9canismes en question. Or, les r\u00e8gles de plus en plus alambiqu\u00e9es \u00e9taient vuln\u00e9rables et cr\u00e9aient de nouvelles failles \u00e0 exploiter. La Cour a d\u00e9crit le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stubart comme un cycle \u00ab incessant d\u2019action et de r\u00e9action produit par des mesures fiscales complexes et pr\u00e9cises qui visent des pratiques commerciales compliqu\u00e9es d\u2019une part et la r\u00e9action in\u00e9vitable, experte et tout aussi sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e du contribuable \u00bb (p. 580; voir aussi D. A. Dodge, \u00ab A New and More Coherent Approach to Tax Avoidance \u00bb (1988), 36 Rev. fisc. can. 1, p. 4). Tandis que ce \u00ab cycle d\u2019action et de r\u00e9action \u00bb de la part de fiscalistes cr\u00e9atifs et du Parlement se poursuivait, la Loi a gagn\u00e9 tant en volume qu\u2019en complexit\u00e9 (Minist\u00e8re des Finances, Principes directeurs de la r\u00e9forme fiscale au Canada (1986), p. 7).\n[43] En d\u00e9pit de ces efforts, le Parlement \u00e9tait incapable de freiner la prolif\u00e9ration des tactiques d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. Pour l\u2019exercice 1985\u20111986, les imp\u00f4ts sur le revenu des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieurs de 1,2 M$ aux pr\u00e9visions budg\u00e9taires \u00bb, un manque \u00e0 gagner qui \u00ab d\u00e9coulait largement de l\u2019application impr\u00e9vue des reports de pertes \u00bb (Dodge, p. 3; voir aussi W. J. Strain, D. A. Dodge et V. Peters, \u00ab Tax Simplification : The Elusive Goal \u00bb, dans Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 4:1, p. 4:43 et 4:52\u20114:53).\n[44] La RGA\u00c9 \u00e9tait le m\u00e9canisme qu\u2019a choisi le Parlement pour mettre fin \u00e0 ce cycle. Dans le Livre blanc de 1987 sur la r\u00e9forme fiscale, le gouvernement a reconnu que des r\u00e8gles anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifiques ne sont \u00ab pas toujours souhaitables \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elles \u00ab rendent le r\u00e9gime fiscal plus complexe, cr\u00e9ent parfois d\u2019autres \u00e9chappatoires impr\u00e9vues, et ne portent pas sur les op\u00e9rations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications \u00bb (voir Minist\u00e8re des Finances, Livre blanc : R\u00e9forme fiscale 1987 (1987), p. 59; voir aussi B. J. Arnold et J. R. Wilson, \u00ab The General Anti\u2011Avoidance Rule \u2014 Part 2 \u00bb (1988), 36 Rev. fisc. can. 1123, p. 1140). Une nouvelle r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement visait \u00e0 surmonter certains de ces d\u00e9savantages. L\u2019approche novatrice de la RGA\u00c9 explique pourquoi, au moment de son adoption, le Parlement a pu retirer certaines r\u00e8gles anti\u2011\u00e9vitement portant sur des op\u00e9rations qui, selon lui, \u00e9taient suffisamment couvertes par une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (Livre blanc, p. 59-60; Triad Gestco Ltd. c. Canada, 2012 CAF 258, [2014] 2 R.C.F. 199, par. 52\u201153; Minist\u00e8re des Finances, R\u00e9forme fiscale 1987 : R\u00e9forme de l\u2019imp\u00f4t direct (1987), p. 139-140; Dodge, p. 8; Minist\u00e8re des Finances, Moderniser et renforcer la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti\u2011\u00e9vitement : Document de consultation, 2022 (en ligne), p. 17-18 et 20-22; voir aussi Arnold et Wilson, p. 1148).\n[45] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il convient de consid\u00e9rer la RGA\u00c9 comme un moyen de surmonter les d\u00e9savantages d\u2019un syst\u00e8me fond\u00e9 exclusivement sur des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9cifiques (Livre blanc, p. 59-60; Dodge, p. 8). Elle repr\u00e9sente le fruit d\u2019un choix du Parlement d\u2019adopter une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de compl\u00e9ter ses efforts sp\u00e9cifiques pour contrer l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. Pour atteindre cet objectif, la RGA\u00c9 \u00ab trace une ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre la r\u00e9duction maximale l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif \u00bb (Trustco, par. 16). L\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif peut consister en strat\u00e9gies fiscales qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues (Canada c. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 CSC 49, par. 80). Par exemple, dans Alta Energy, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que la preuve de la connaissance et de l\u2019acceptation par le Parlement de la strat\u00e9gie fiscale en cause \u00e9tait une consid\u00e9ration pertinente pour l\u2019examen de son intention. Cependant, la RGA\u00c9 ne s\u2019applique pas uniquement aux situations impr\u00e9vues; comme la Cour l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, elle est con\u00e7ue pour englober des situations qui minent l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me fiscal en contrecarrant l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions invoqu\u00e9es par le contribuable (Lipson c. Canada, 2009 CSC 1, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 3, par. 2; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. c. Canada, 2011 CSC 63, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 721, par. 71\u201172; voir aussi Gladwin Realty Corporation c. Canada, 2020 CAF 142, par. 85 (CanLII); D. G.

Le lien entre la RGA\u00c9 , le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster et l\u2019incertitude\n[46] Il faut \u00e9galement consid\u00e9rer la RGA\u00c9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son lien avec le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commissioners of Inland Revenue c. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), dans lequel le lord Tomlin a reconnu le principe fondateur que [traduction] \u00ab [c]haque particulier est en droit, s\u2019il en a les moyens, de r\u00e9gler ses affaires de mani\u00e8re telle que l\u2019imp\u00f4t qui en d\u00e9coule en vertu des lois en vigueur soit inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il aurait autrement vers\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 19). Le principe voulant que les contribuables puissent r\u00e9gler leurs affaires pour minimiser le montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 payer a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises (voir, p. ex., Stubart, p. 552; Trustco, par. 11; Copthorne, par. 65).\n[47] Cependant, le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster \u00ab n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 absolu \u00bb (Lipson, par. 21) et il est loisible au Parlement d\u2019y d\u00e9roger. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait au moyen de la RGA\u00c9 . Celle-ci n\u2019\u00e9carte pas le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la planification fiscale l\u00e9gitime. Elle reconna\u00eet plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il existe une diff\u00e9rence entre la planification fiscale l\u00e9gitime \u2014 que constitue la vaste majorit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations et qui demeure permise, conform\u00e9ment au principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster \u2014 et la planification fiscale qui a pour effet d\u2019abuser des r\u00e8gles du r\u00e9gime fiscal \u2014 auquel cas l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime fiscal est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e en refusant l\u2019avantage fiscal, m\u00eame si les op\u00e9rations qui g\u00e9n\u00e8rent cet avantage respectent le libell\u00e9 des dispositions invoqu\u00e9es. Ainsi, les contribuables sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 mener des op\u00e9rations, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019elles visent \u00e0 minimiser l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles n\u2019entra\u00eenent un abus dans l\u2019application des dispositions de la Loi (Lipson, par. 25). Lorsqu\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019op\u00e9ration est abusive, le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster est \u00ab att\u00e9nu[\u00e9] \u00bb par la RGA\u00c9 (Trustco, par. 13).\n[48] En \u00e9tablissant une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui servirait \u00e0 refuser des avantages fiscaux au cas par cas, le Parlement \u00e9tait conscient de l\u2019incidence qu\u2019elle aurait sur le degr\u00e9 de certitude en mati\u00e8re de planification fiscale. Le Parlement a cherch\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre \u00ab la protection de l\u2019assiette fiscale et le besoin de certitude des contribuables \u00bb (Minist\u00e8re des Finances, Notes explicatives sur le projet de loi concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (1988), p. 492). La RGA\u00c9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de \u00ab mesure de dernier recours \u00bb pour contrer uniquement l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif et elle n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue comme source d\u2019incertitude g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de planification fiscale (Trustco, par. 21; Copthorne, par. 66). Il est in\u00e9vitable que l\u2019adoption d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entra\u00eene une certaine incertitude (Dodge, p. 21; Copthorne, par. 123). Cependant, l\u2019\u00e9quilibre qu\u2019\u00e9tablit la RGA\u00c9 donne un degr\u00e9 de certitude raisonnable.\n[49] Premi\u00e8rement, comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 la professeure Jinyan Li, [traduction] \u00ab les causes relatives \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 portent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur des situations qui ne touchent pas la majorit\u00e9 des contribuables, et les op\u00e9rations en cause sont bien planifi\u00e9es et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es sur le fondement de conseils prodigu\u00e9s par des fiscalistes \u00bb (\u00ab \u201cEconomic Substance\u201d : Drawing the Line Between Legitimate Tax Minimization and Abusive Tax Avoidance \u00bb (2006), 54 Rev. fisc. can. 23, p. 40). La RGA\u00c9 ne cible que des op\u00e9rations motiv\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal, et m\u00eame une op\u00e9ration effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 de telles fins qui est compatible avec l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la Loi , n\u2019est pas touch\u00e9e par la RGA\u00c9 (voir Notes explicatives, p. 492). Compte tenu de l\u2019examen rigoureux que requiert l\u2019art. 245 , la RGA\u00c9 ne touche qu\u2019un petit sous-ensemble d\u2019op\u00e9rations, pour la plupart men\u00e9es par des parties tr\u00e8s bien renseign\u00e9es qui ont la capacit\u00e9 de bien \u00e9valuer les risques inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 une nouvelle cotisation fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 . C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : le prospectus relatif au PAPE de l\u2019appelante reconnaissait express\u00e9ment le risque d\u2019une contestation fructueuse de la d\u00e9duction des attributs fiscaux.\n[50] Deuxi\u00e8mement, une application appropri\u00e9e de la m\u00e9thodologie pr\u00e9vue par la RGA\u00c9 sert \u00e0 garantir un degr\u00e9 de certitude raisonnable dans la planification fiscale (P. Samtani et J. Kutyan, \u00ab GAAR Revisited : From Instinctive Reaction to Intellectual Rigour \u00bb (2014), 62 Rev. fisc. can. 401, p. 403). La RGA\u00c9 n\u2019est pas un outil pour sanctionner la conduite que les tribunaux jugent immorale (Copthorne, par. 65; Alta Energy, par. 48). Les tribunaux doivent plut\u00f4t proc\u00e9der \u00e0 \u00ab une analyse objective, approfondie et point par point \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 68). Dans le cadre de cette analyse, les principes de certitude, de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne jouent pas de r\u00f4le ind\u00e9pendant; ils sont plut\u00f4t pris en compte dans le crit\u00e8re minutieusement calibr\u00e9 con\u00e7u par le Parlement, et d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019art. 245 de la Loi , ainsi que dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ce dernier par la Cour. C\u2019est sur ce crit\u00e8re que je vais maintenant me pencher.\nC. La mise en \u0153uvre de la RGA\u00c9\n[51] Comme le juge Rothstein l\u2019a \u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Copthorne, \u00ab [l]e r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la RGA\u00c9 est relativement simple \u00e0 exposer, mais beaucoup plus difficile \u00e0 appliquer \u00bb (par. 32). Il en est ainsi parce que cette r\u00e8gle conf\u00e8re aux tribunaux la \u00ab t\u00e2che inhabituelle d\u2019aller au\u2011del\u00e0 du texte de la disposition \u00bb (par. 66). Bien que la t\u00e2che prescrite par la RGA\u00c9 soit inhabituelle, l\u2019analyse fait appel \u00e0 un test en trois \u00e9tapes structur\u00e9 qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019\u00e9tudes approfondies par la Cour. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019applique, il faut poser les questions suivantes (par. 33, citant Trustco, par. 18, 21 et 36) :\n1. Y a\u2011t\u2011il eu avantage fiscal? . . .\n2. L\u2019op\u00e9ration ayant g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019avantage fiscal \u00e9tait\u2011elle une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement? . . .\n3. L\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement ayant g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019avantage fiscal \u00e9tait\u2011elle abusive?\n[52] Il incombe au contribuable de r\u00e9futer la th\u00e8se du ministre qu\u2019il y a avantage fiscal (Copthorne, par. 34; Trustco, par. 63) et de prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019un objet v\u00e9ritable non fiscal (Copthorne, par. 63; Trustco, par. 66). En revanche, \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, le ministre a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement entra\u00eene un abus (Lipson, par. 21).\n(1) Avantage fiscal\n[53] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un avantage fiscal d\u00e9coule d\u2019une op\u00e9ration ou d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations (par. 245(2) de la Loi ; Trustco, par. 18). Un avantage fiscal est d\u00e9fini comme une \u00ab [r]\u00e9duction, [un] \u00e9vitement ou [un] report d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00bb ou une \u00ab augmentation d\u2019un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t ou d\u2019un autre montant \u00bb pay\u00e9 en application de la Loi (par. 245(1) de la Loi ). L\u2019existence d\u2019un avantage fiscal peut \u00eatre \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des op\u00e9rations elles-m\u00eames; elle peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre \u00e9tablie en envisageant d\u2019autres arrangements qui [traduction] \u00ab aurai[ent] pu raisonnablement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9[s] n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019avantage fiscal \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 35, citant D. G. Duff et autres, Canadian Income Tax Law (3e \u00e9d. 2009), p. 187).\n(2) Op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement\n[54] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019op\u00e9ration ou la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations est principalement effectu\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir un avantage fiscal (par. 245(3) de la Loi ; Trustco, par. 17, 21 et 66). Cette exigence soustrait la majorit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations de la port\u00e9e de la RGA\u00c9 , y compris celles qui sont men\u00e9es \u00e0 des fins familiales ou \u00e0 des fins de placement (Trustco, par. 21 et 33). Une op\u00e9ration peut avoir \u00e0 la fois un objet fiscal et un objet non fiscal; dans un tel cas, le contribuable doit convaincre le tribunal qu\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure que l\u2019objet non fiscal \u00e9tait le principal des deux (par. 27 et 29).\n[55] En outre, en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, si au moins l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles constitue une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement, il est satisfait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape (Copthorne, par. 64). Comme la Cour l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Trustco, une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations comprend des op\u00e9rations qui sont [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9termin\u00e9e[s] d\u2019avance de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 produire un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9 [alors qu\u2019]il n\u2019existait aucune probabilit\u00e9 pratique que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements planifi\u00e9s d\u2019avance ne se produiraient pas dans l\u2019ordre envisag\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 25, citant Craven c. White, [1989] A.C. 398 (H.L.), p. 514, le lord Oliver). Une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations comprend aussi les \u00ab op\u00e9rations et \u00e9v\u00e9nements li\u00e9s [. . .] en vue de r\u00e9aliser la s\u00e9rie \u00bb (par. 248(10)), ce qui renvoie \u00e0 des op\u00e9rations et \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant ou apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9rie qui ont eu lieu \u00ab \u201cen raison de\u201d la s\u00e9rie ou \u201crelativement \u00e0\u201d celle\u2011ci \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 46, citant Trustco, par. 26).\n(3) \u00c9vitement fiscal abusif\n[56] La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 est souvent la plus litigieuse. D\u2019ailleurs, il s\u2019agit de la seule \u00e9tape en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel. Pour analyser si les op\u00e9rations sont abusives, il faut d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions pertinentes; ensuite, il faut d\u00e9cider si le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations contrecarre cet objet et cet esprit (Trustco, par. 44; Copthorne, par. 69\u201171).\n[57] L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit repr\u00e9sente la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. Le texte de la disposition, son contexte et son objet contribuent \u00e0 faire la lumi\u00e8re sur cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Une fois que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit est \u00e9tabli, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus se concentre sur la question de savoir si le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations contrecarre la raison d\u2019\u00eatre en question. J\u2019offre ci-apr\u00e8s des lignes directrices au sujet de ces aspects de l\u2019analyse.\na) L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit refl\u00e8te la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition\n[58] Pour d\u00e9terminer si une op\u00e9ration est abusive, le tribunal doit cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions dont il y aurait abus, eu \u00e9gard aux dispositions elles-m\u00eames, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi et aux moyens extrins\u00e8ques admissibles (Trustco, par. 55). L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend des dispositions particuli\u00e8res ou interd\u00e9pendantes de la Loi \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 69, citant V. Krishna, The Fundamentals of Income Tax Law (2009), p. 818).\n[59] \u00c0 ce stade, il est crucial de distinguer la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une disposition des moyens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis pour y donner effet. Le processus de r\u00e9daction consiste \u00e0 traduire les objectifs du gouvernement sous forme l\u00e9gislative afin de cr\u00e9er des r\u00e8gles intelligibles et juridiquement efficaces (voir, p. ex., Canada, Bureau du Conseil priv\u00e9, Lois et r\u00e8glements : l\u2019essentiel (2e \u00e9d. 2001), p. 127\u2011135). Les moyens choisis par les l\u00e9gistes et adopt\u00e9s par le Parlement sont des indices pertinents dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet, puisqu\u2019ils peuvent donner un \u00e9clairage sur la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend la disposition. Cela \u00e9tant dit, les moyens n\u2019expliquent pas n\u00e9cessairement de mani\u00e8re exhaustive pourquoi la disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e (Canada c. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 CAF 30, [2018] 4 R.C.F. 3, par. 101). Ce constat ne signifie pas que le Parlement est incapable d\u2019exprimer ses objectifs sous forme de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives efficaces \u2014 bien au contraire : lorsqu\u2019il con\u00e7oit des crit\u00e8res juridiques, le Parlement cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une norme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui soit la plus fid\u00e8le \u00e0 ses objectifs, \u00e0 partir des choix qui s\u2019offrent \u00e0 lui et qui sont r\u00e9alisables. Toutefois, m\u00eame l\u2019application de la disposition r\u00e9dig\u00e9e le plus minutieusement possible est susceptible d\u2019abus, ce qui explique l\u2019existence de la RGA\u00c9 qui sert \u00e0 en prot\u00e9ger la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente.\n[60] L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition doit \u00eatre formul\u00e9 comme une description de sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre (Copthorne, par. 69). Lorsqu\u2019il formule l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition, le tribunal ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas le crit\u00e8re qui y est applicable et ne cr\u00e9e pas non plus un nouveau crit\u00e8re secondaire qui s\u2019appliquera aux op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement. Cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9crire; le tribunal ne fait que prendre un pas de recul pour formuler une br\u00e8ve description de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend la disposition, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de laquelle il faut examiner une op\u00e9ration qui y est autrement conforme (Trustco, par. 57; Copthorne, par. 69).\n[61] Par exemple, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une disposition qui conf\u00e8re un avantage fiscal pourrait avoir trait au fondement expliquant l\u2019all\u00e8gement de la charge des contribuables dans les circonstances vis\u00e9es ou, dans le cas d\u2019un all\u00e8gement cibl\u00e9, la conduite que le Parlement a souhait\u00e9 encourager. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique pourrait \u00eatre li\u00e9e au r\u00e9sultat particulier ou au m\u00e9fait que le Parlement a voulu pr\u00e9venir.\nb) Le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition servent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre\n[62] M\u00eame si l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 prend en consid\u00e9ration le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition, la mani\u00e8re dont ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont employ\u00e9s diff\u00e8re de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative \u00ab classique \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70; Alta Energy, par. 30, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, et par. 116, les juges Rowe et Martin, dissidents, mais non sur ce point; Oxford Properties Group, par. 40\u201144). Il convient de rappeler que la RGA\u00c9 constitue une mesure de dernier recours (Trustco, par. 21; Copthorne, par. 66). Il y a une distinction entre l\u2019application d\u2019une disposition en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et celle de la RGA\u00c9 \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration motiv\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. Si un tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , les op\u00e9rations contest\u00e9es sont n\u00e9cessairement conformes aux dispositions de la Loi , bien interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es (voir Copthorne, par. 88; D. G. Duff, \u00ab The Interpretive Exercise Under the General Anti\u2011Avoidance Rule \u00bb, dans B. J. Arnold, dir., The General Anti\u2011Avoidance Rule \u2014 Past, Present, and Future (2021), 383, p. 391). Cela va de soi : s\u2019il existe une disposition sp\u00e9cifique que le contribuable n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9e, le ministre n\u2019a pas besoin de recourir \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 .\n[63] Dans le cadre d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative classique, le tribunal tient compte du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la disposition pour discerner le sens des mots qui figurent dans la loi. En revanche, dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , il faut cerner \u00ab [l]a raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition \u00bb qui \u00ab peut ne pas ressortir de la seule signification des mots eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70 (je souligne); Triad Gestco, par. 51). L\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition sert un but pr\u00e9cis : d\u00e9celer la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de cette derni\u00e8re. Une prise en compte du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la disposition structure cette analyse. En effet, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit ne doit pas servir \u00e0 porter un \u00ab jugement de valeur quant \u00e0 ce qui est bien ou mal non plus qu\u2019[un jugement] sur ce que devrait \u00eatre une loi fiscale ou sur l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle devrait avoir \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70). Elle ne doit pas non plus servir \u00e0 \u00ab chercher une politique pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante de la Loi \u00bb qui n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet des dispositions en cause (Trustco, par. 41; Alta Energy, par. 49). Une approche qui se fonde plut\u00f4t sur le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition permet d\u2019assurer que la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que utilis\u00e9e pour cerner la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition reste li\u00e9e \u00e0 la disposition elle\u2011m\u00eame. \u00c0 cette fin, il est utile de traiter bri\u00e8vement de l\u2019approche qu\u2019il faut adopter pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette analyse.\n[64] Le texte de la disposition est pertinent lors de l\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition (Alta Energy, par. 58). Sans perdre de vue la recherche de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition, le tribunal peut se demander en quoi ce libell\u00e9 renseigne sur ce que la disposition visait \u00e0 accomplir. Autrement dit, qu\u2019est-ce que la disposition \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e accomplir? (Copthorne, par. 88). Il convient d\u2019examiner ce que le texte de la disposition permet ou interdit express\u00e9ment. De m\u00eame, le texte ainsi que la structure de la disposition peuvent parfois \u00e9clairer quant aux pr\u00e9occupations sous\u2011jacentes du Parlement. Le texte peut \u00e9galement contribuer \u00e0 identifier la nature de la disposition (ou le \u00ab type \u00bb de disposition en cause), ce qui peut \u00eatre pertinent pour comprendre sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente.\n[65] Il est possible que, dans certaines circonstances, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente d\u2019une disposition puisse ne pas avoir une port\u00e9e plus grande que son libell\u00e9, parce que, compte tenu de son contexte et de son objet, son texte \u00ab explique enti\u00e8rement \u00bb sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre (Copthorne, par. 110). Cela dit, le tribunal ne doit pas perdre de vue l\u2019objectif de l\u2019exercice \u2014 soit discerner la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition \u2014 de m\u00eame que le fait que cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab peut ne pas ressortir de la seule signification des mots eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70). Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge en chef No\u00ebl de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00ab [b]ien que l\u2019on ne puisse \u00e9carter la possibilit\u00e9 que la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une disposition ressorte enti\u00e8rement des mots, il faut tout de m\u00eame le d\u00e9montrer en examinant la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition \u00bb (Oxford Properties Group, par. 88, citant Copthorne, par. 110\u2011111).\n[66] En sus du libell\u00e9 de la disposition, le tribunal doit en examiner le contexte. Cette analyse contextuelle \u00ab suppose l\u2019examen d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi , ainsi que des moyens extrins\u00e8ques admissibles \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 91; Trustco, par. 55). Bien entendu, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019examiner toutes les autres dispositions de la Loi . La \u00ab pertinence [de l\u2019exercice] tient en fait au [traduction] \u201cregroupement\u201d des dispositions ou \u00e0 leur \u201cinteraction pour la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un plan plausible et coh\u00e9rent\u201d \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 91, citant R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5e \u00e9d. 2008), p. 361 et 364).\n[67] C\u2019est la relation entre la disposition dont le contribuable aurait abus\u00e9 et le r\u00e9gime particulier auquel elle appartient qui importe (Triad Gestco, par. 26 et suiv.). M\u00eame si la Loi est longue et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, la compr\u00e9hension de sa structure peut contribuer \u00e0 identifier la fonction de la disposition en cause. Par exemple, une restriction sp\u00e9cifique peut aider \u00e0 mieux comprendre la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une r\u00e8gle conf\u00e9rant un avantage fiscal, et vice\u2011versa.\n[68] Finalement, il est crucial de comprendre l\u2019objet de la disposition pour effectuer l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 . Une analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique permet au tribunal d\u2019examiner \u00e0 la fois l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif et la preuve extrins\u00e8que (voir R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7e \u00e9d. 2022), \u00a7 9.03, par. 7\u20118). Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments permettent de mieux cerner la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques. Bien entendu, les dispositions fiscales peuvent poursuivre toute une gamme d\u2019objectifs ind\u00e9pendants et interd\u00e9pendants (Trustco, par. 53). Elles sont tout de m\u00eame destin\u00e9es \u00e0 favoriser des objectifs particuliers, de sorte que les tribunaux doivent d\u00e9terminer quel r\u00e9sultat le Parlement a voulu atteindre par l\u2019entremise de la disposition ou des dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques (Copthorne, par. 113).\nc) L\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations contrecarre l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition\n[69] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019abus, les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement seront jug\u00e9es abusives lorsque leur r\u00e9sultat \u00ab a) [. . .] donne lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat que les dispositions invoqu\u00e9es visent \u00e0 emp\u00eacher, b) [. . .] va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de ces dispositions ou c) [. . .] contourne l\u2019application de certaines dispositions de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 contrecarrer leur objet ou leur esprit \u00bb (Lipson, par. 40, citant Trustco, par. 45). Ces consid\u00e9rations ne jouent pas ind\u00e9pendamment les unes des autres, et elles se chevauchent fr\u00e9quemment (Copthorne, par. 72). En d\u00e9finitive, l\u2019analyse reste strictement ax\u00e9e sur le caract\u00e8re abusif. Le tribunal doit aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la forme juridique qu\u2019ont prise les op\u00e9rations et leur respect technique des dispositions; il doit comparer leur r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition et d\u00e9terminer si cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre est contrecarr\u00e9e. Pour tirer une telle conclusion, l\u2019op\u00e9ration \u00ab doit \u00eatre manifestement abusive \u00bb (Trustco, par. 62 et 66; Copthorne, par. 68; Alta Energy, par. 33).\n[70] La jurisprudence de la Cour jette un \u00e9clairage sur les types de circonstances qui s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent au niveau de l\u2019abus. Par exemple, si la disposition a pour raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente d\u2019encourager des relations ou des activit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res, le tribunal conclura au caract\u00e8re abusif si les relations et les op\u00e9rations en cause \u00ab diff\u00e8rent compl\u00e8tement de [celles] pr\u00e9vus par les dispositions \u00bb, comme dans l\u2019affaire Mathew (par. 57, citant Trustco, par. 60). De m\u00eame, lorsque des op\u00e9rations qui ont recours \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique en pervertissent le sens pour permettre l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal, le tribunal conclura vraisemblablement que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait abusif, comme cela s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019affaire Lipson (par. 42; voir aussi Fiducie financi\u00e8re Satoma c. La Reine, 2018 CAF 74, 2018 D.T.C. 5049, par. 52). Il peut \u00e9galement y avoir abus dans certaines circonstances o\u00f9 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations \u00ab a produit un r\u00e9sultat que la disposition visait \u00e0 emp\u00eacher \u00bb, tout en \u00e9vitant de justesse l\u2019application de cette derni\u00e8re, comme dans l\u2019affaire Copthorne (par. 124\u2011127). Ces exemples ne sont pas exhaustifs, mais ils fournissent des indications utiles sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de diff\u00e9rents types de dispositions fiscales peut \u00eatre contrecarr\u00e9.\n[71] Il importe de souligner que rien n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019appliquer la RGA\u00c9 lorsque la Loi pr\u00e9voit des conditions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il faut satisfaire pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat en particulier, comme dans le cas d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique. Je suis donc en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante voulant que, lorsque le Parlement formule une disposition avec pr\u00e9cision \u2014 comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 le report de pertes est interdit dans des circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques \u2014, la RGA\u00c9 n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9e entrer en jeu. Bien entendu, la RGA\u00c9 ne s\u2019applique pas dans toutes les circonstances \u2014 l\u2019analyse est, par sa nature m\u00eame, sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 chaque cas. D\u2019ailleurs, la formulation d\u2019une disposition importe dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet, puisqu\u2019elle peut donner un \u00e9clairage sur la conduite qu\u2019a voulu viser le Parlement et sur la fa\u00e7on dont il s\u2019y est pris pour le faire. Cela dit, la proposition selon laquelle la RGA\u00c9 peut n\u2019avoir presque aucun r\u00f4le lorsque le Parlement a adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique revient \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter sans justification l\u2019art. 245 comme s\u2019il comporte une restriction. Cette pr\u00e9tention ne tient pas compte du fait que la RGA\u00c9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en partie parce que les r\u00e8gles anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e9taient contourn\u00e9es au moyen de mesures de planification fiscale abusives, ni du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un des types de r\u00e8gles qui m\u00e8nent le plus souvent \u00e0 une conclusion d\u2019abus selon les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 (J. Li, \u00ab The Misuse or Abuse Exception : The Role of Economic Substance \u00bb, dans Arnold, The General Anti\u2011Avoidance Rule, 295, p. 299, note 25, et p. 316).\n[72] De plus, la position de l\u2019appelante est contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence de la Cour. Comme les juges majoritaires l\u2019ont reconnu dans Alta Energy, \u00ab [u]n m\u00e9canisme qui \u201ccontourne l\u2019application de certaines dispositions, comme des r\u00e8gles anti\u2011\u00e9vitement particuli\u00e8res, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re contraire \u00e0 l\u2019objet ou \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de ces dispositions\u201d peut \u00e9galement donner lieu \u00e0 un \u00e9vitement fiscal abusif \u00bb (par. 32 (je souligne), citant Trustco, par. 45). En outre, dans Copthorne, la Cour a essentiellement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument voulant que, lorsque le Parlement a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 des dispositions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, le contribuable qui s\u2019y est techniquement conform\u00e9 ne peut en contrecarrer la raison d\u2019\u00eatre (par. 108\u2011111). En termes simples, les dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques r\u00e9dig\u00e9es minutieusement sont, elles aussi, susceptibles d\u2019abus. Comme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toute autre disposition, la RGA\u00c9 garantit que la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de telles dispositions n\u2019est pas contrecarr\u00e9e par des strat\u00e9gies fiscales abusives.\nd) R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[73] En somme, \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 :\n- L\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition est une description de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition. Les moyens pr\u00e9vus dans la loi (le comment) n\u2019expliquent pas toujours enti\u00e8rement ce qu\u2019est cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre (le pourquoi).\n- Le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet d\u2019une disposition donnent des indices de ce qu\u2019est sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Le texte peut permettre de mieux comprendre ce que la disposition visait \u00e0 encourager ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il permet ou interdit express\u00e9ment, aux termes choisis pour la r\u00e9diger, \u00e0 sa structure et \u00e0 sa nature. De m\u00eame, le contexte peut servir \u00e0 cerner la fonction de la disposition au sein d\u2019un r\u00e9gime coh\u00e9rent. Enfin, son objet peut aider \u00e0 discerner les r\u00e9sultats que le Parlement cherchait \u00e0 atteindre ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir.\n- Une fois que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif va au\u2011del\u00e0 de la forme juridique des op\u00e9rations ou de leur respect technique de la disposition pour examiner si le r\u00e9sultat obtenu en contrecarre la raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\n[74] Maintenant que j\u2019ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la d\u00e9marche \u00e0 suivre pour appliquer la RGA\u00c9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence de la Cour, je vais me pencher sur les op\u00e9rations en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVI. Application\nA. Quelles sont les dispositions en cause?\n[75] Les parties ne contestent pas que les op\u00e9rations respectaient le libell\u00e9 de la Loi . Il est plut\u00f4t question de savoir si la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019applique pour refuser les d\u00e9ductions et confirmer la nouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 les conclusions de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un avantage fiscal et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement. Ainsi, la seule question en litige est celle de savoir si ces op\u00e9rations ont abus\u00e9 des dispositions de la Loi (la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 ). Cette \u00e9tape exige, d\u2019abord, de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition et, ensuite, de d\u00e9cider si les op\u00e9rations ont contrecarr\u00e9 cet objet et esprit. Avant de proc\u00e9der, il convient de pr\u00e9ciser quelles dispositions devraient faire l\u2019objet de l\u2019analyse.\n[76] Le ministre a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation quant aux demandes de d\u00e9duction de l\u2019appelante pour les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, les d\u00e9penses en RS & DE et les CII. Cependant, comme les restrictions sur le report des pertes dans chaque contexte s\u2019appliquent de fa\u00e7on similaire, une violation de la RGA\u00c9 dans un cas m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 une conclusion similaire pour les autres cas. Cette affirmation est d\u2019ailleurs conforme \u00e0 l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par les parties pour plaider la cause et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont tant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019ont analys\u00e9e (motifs de la C.C.I., par. 87; motifs de la C.A., par. 5).\n[77] Les tribunaux d\u2019instances inf\u00e9rieures se sont concentr\u00e9s sur trois dispositions relatives aux pertes autres qu\u2019en capital : l\u2019al. 111(1)a), qui pr\u00e9voit la r\u00e8gle conf\u00e9rant un avantage qui autorise le report des d\u00e9ductions pour pertes autres qu\u2019en capital; le par. 111(5), qui interdit le report des pertes lorsque le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par une personne ou un groupe de personnes, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il existe une continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise; et le par. 256(8), qui \u00e9nonce qu\u2019il y a prise de contr\u00f4le en cas d\u2019obtention de certains droits relatifs aux actions. Comme elles appartiennent au m\u00eame r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation du report des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, ces dispositions sont interreli\u00e9es et se compl\u00e8tent les unes les autres. Compte tenu de ce qui suit, il suffit d\u2019une analyse du par. 111(5) pour disposer du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nB. Quel est l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5)?\n[78] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif, soit cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions en cause, est une question de droit isolable, assujettie \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte (voir Alta Energy, par. 50, citant Trustco, par. 44; Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 8). Pour cerner la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente du par. 111(5), il faut consid\u00e9rer le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition (Copthorne, par. 70). Un tel examen r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019interdire que des tiers n\u2019ayant aucun lien avec une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qui en acqui\u00e8rent le contr\u00f4le et en changent l\u2019entreprise puissent en d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es. J\u2019\u00e9noncerais donc ainsi l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) : emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties avec qui elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pour r\u00e9duire le revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit des nouveaux actionnaires. Pour expliquer comment cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9coule du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet du par. 111(5), j\u2019amorce l\u2019analyse en me penchant sur son texte.\n(1) Le texte de la disposition\n[79] Exprim\u00e9 en termes larges, le par. 111(5) constitue une restriction \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable d\u2019utiliser les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital subies durant une autre ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les op\u00e9rations en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, la portion pertinente du par. 111(5) \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n(5) En cas d\u2019acquisition, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, du contr\u00f4le d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par une personne ou un groupe de personnes, aucun montant au titre d\u2019une perte autre qu\u2019une perte en capital ou d\u2019une perte agricole pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant avant ce moment n\u2019est d\u00e9ductible par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant apr\u00e8s ce moment et aucun montant au titre d\u2019une perte autre qu\u2019une perte en capital ou d\u2019une perte agricole pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant apr\u00e8s ce moment n\u2019est d\u00e9ductible par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant avant ce moment. Toutefois :\na) la fraction de la perte autre qu\u2019une perte en capital ou de la perte agricole subie par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant avant ce moment qu\u2019il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer comme r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise et, si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 exploitait une entreprise au cours de cette ann\u00e9e, la fraction de la perte autre qu\u2019une perte en capital qu\u2019il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer comme se rapportant \u00e0 un montant d\u00e9ductible en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 110(1)k) dans le calcul de son revenu imposable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e, ne sont d\u00e9ductibles par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition donn\u00e9e se terminant apr\u00e8s ce moment :\n(i) que si, tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, cette entreprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9e par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vue d\u2019en tirer un profit ou dans une attente raisonnable de profit,\n(ii) qu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du total du revenu de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 provenant de cette entreprise pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e et \u2014 dans le cas o\u00f9 des biens sont vendus, lou\u00e9s ou mis en valeur ou des services rendus dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise avant ce moment \u2014 de toute autre entreprise dont la presque totalit\u00e9 du revenu est d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la vente, de la location ou de la mise en valeur, selon le cas, de biens semblables ou de la prestation de services semblables . . .\nTrois \u00e9l\u00e9ments du texte m\u00e9ritent d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9s : la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qu\u2019il fait au contr\u00f4le; l\u2019accent mis sur l\u2019acquisition par une personne ou un groupe de personnes; et l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise. Bien que le par. 111(5) ait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 depuis les op\u00e9rations en cause, la disposition comporte encore ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux, quoique structur\u00e9s autrement (voir le par. 111(5.4)).\n[80] Premi\u00e8rement, le texte du par. 111(5) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb. Bien que ce terme ne soit pas express\u00e9ment d\u00e9fini dans la disposition ou ailleurs dans la Loi , la Cour a conclu dans Duha Printers qu\u2019il correspond au contr\u00f4le de jure. Le crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le de jure consiste \u00e0 se demander si \u00ab la partie qui d\u00e9tient le contr\u00f4le a, en vertu des actions qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de, la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lire la majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil d\u2019administration \u00bb (Duha Printers, par. 36; R. Taylor et M.\u2011C. Marcil, \u00ab Duha Printers Revisited : Issues Regarding Corporate Control \u00bb (2022), 70 Rev. fisc. can. 495, p. 504-507; G. Lord et autres, Les principes de l\u2019imposition au Canada (13e \u00e9d. 2002), section 3.3; Notes explicatives, p. 536\u2011539; en common law, voir Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. c. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 R.C. de l\u2019\u00c9. 299). La capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lir la majorit\u00e9 des administrateurs \u00e9quivaut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au pouvoir de choisir ceux qui g\u00e8rent les affaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve, notamment, de la teneur des actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d\u2019une convention unanime des actionnaires (Duha Printers, par. 85; voir aussi Loi canadienne sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201144 (\u00ab LCSA \u00bb), par. 2(3) et 102(1); Loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions, L.R.O. 1990, c. B.16, par. 1(5) et 115(1); Loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions, RLRQ, c. S\u201131.1, art. 2 \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb et 112; Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, art. 310, 335 et 336). Je reviendrai plus loin sur la notion de contr\u00f4le de jure, par opposition \u00e0 celle de contr\u00f4le de facto.\n[81] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le par. 111(5) ne renvoie pas \u00e0 un simple changement dans le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais bien \u00e0 une situation \u00ab d\u2019acquisition \u00bb par \u00ab une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00bb. La disposition indique que le Parlement se concentrait sur les circonstances o\u00f9 le contr\u00f4le change vraiment de main, plut\u00f4t que, par exemple, sur celles o\u00f9 les actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9e en bourse font l\u2019objet de nombreuses transactions (Silicon Graphics Ltd. c. Canada, 2002 CAF 260, [2003] 1 C.F. 447, par. 36).\n[82] Troisi\u00e8mement, le par. 111(5) cr\u00e9e une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019il \u00e9nonce : les pertes restent d\u00e9ductibles si, apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 exploite la m\u00eame entreprise ou une entreprise similaire. Ainsi, le lien avec les pertes subies dans le pass\u00e9 n\u2019est rompu que lorsque le contr\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis et qu\u2019il y a rupture avec les activit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le texte du par. 111(5) refl\u00e8te le souci de refuser le report des pertes en cas de manque de continuit\u00e9 au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en fonction \u00e0 la fois de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ses actionnaires majoritaires et de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales.\n[83] L\u2019appelante soutient que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition se limite au crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure d\u00e9crit au par. 111(5). Dans certains cas, l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit peut ne pas avoir une plus grande port\u00e9e que la disposition elle\u2011m\u00eame. Ce n\u2019est toutefois le cas que lorsque son libell\u00e9 explique enti\u00e8rement sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente (Copthorne, par. 110). Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il en est de m\u00eame pour le par. 111(5), il faut d\u2019abord examiner son contexte et son objet.\n(2) Le contexte de la disposition\n[84] Il serait difficile de comprendre le r\u00f4le du par. 111(5) dans la Loi sans tenir compte de la fonction qu\u2019il joue dans le r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du calcul du revenu imposable. En effet, le par. 111(5) constitue une \u00e9tape au sein d\u2019un processus plus large.\na) Le paragraphe 111(5) doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 compte tenu des principes fondamentaux qui sous\u2011tendent la Loi\n[85] Les assises du r\u00e9gime d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu que cr\u00e9e la Loi sont d\u00e9crites aux art. 2 \u00e0 4 (Li (2021), p. 307). Le paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est pay\u00e9 \u00ab pour chaque ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, sur le revenu imposable de toute personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00bb. La Loi traite chaque \u00ab personne \u00bb comme une unit\u00e9 fiscale; chaque \u00ab personne \u00bb, y compris une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, est un contribuable distinct. M\u00eame si cette disposition de la Loi est de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle refl\u00e8te le principe fondateur selon lequel \u00ab les contribuables sont assujettis \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t en fonction de leurs propres revenus, et non de ceux d\u2019autrui \u00bb (Canada c. 594710 British Columbia Ltd., 2018 CAF 166, par. 54 (CanLII)). En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019effet du par. 111(5) s\u2019\u00e9claire lorsqu\u2019il est lu \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019art. 2 : il sugg\u00e8re que, sur le plan conceptuel, apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le et la cessation de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 l\u2019origine des pertes, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le m\u00eame contribuable pour les fins du report des pertes d\u00e9coulant de ses activit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures.\nb) Le paragraphe 111(5) d\u00e9limite la port\u00e9e de la disposition conf\u00e9rant l\u2019avantage fiscal, soit l\u2019al. 111(1)a)\n[86] Le paragraphe 111(5) s\u2019inscrit dans un r\u00e9gime de report des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital. Les dispositions fondatrices de la Loi reconnaissent que chaque contribuable est impos\u00e9 en fonction de son revenu et de ses pertes au cours d\u2019une seule ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition; cependant, l\u2019al. 111(1)a) modifie cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un contribuable peut d\u00e9duire des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital du revenu d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition future ou ant\u00e9rieure. Il s\u2019agit de la disposition conf\u00e9rant un avantage fiscal sur laquelle s\u2019est fond\u00e9e l\u2019appelante pour obtenir ses avantages fiscaux. Sans une telle r\u00e8gle sur le report de pertes, un contribuable qui gagne un revenu \u00e9lev\u00e9 une ann\u00e9e et qui subit une perte l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante serait confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res parce qu\u2019il serait tenu de payer des imp\u00f4ts pour la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e sans obtenir d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour la seconde (Krishna, p. 595). Le contribuable dont les revenus fluctuent serait d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 celui qui se lance dans une entreprise moins risqu\u00e9e et qui paie de l\u2019imp\u00f4t au fil du temps sur un revenu plus stable.\n[87] De ce point de vue, le par. 111(5) ne s\u2019applique pas isol\u00e9ment; il sert plut\u00f4t de compl\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a). Il est logique de permettre le report des pertes subies. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que l\u2019objet sp\u00e9cifique de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 de mesurer le revenu avec plus d\u2019exactitude et de fournir un all\u00e8gement au contribuable individuel, en tenant compte de la fluctuation de son revenu au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Des modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 cette disposition ont \u00e9largi la capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital (voir, p. ex., S.C. 1958, c. 32, par. 12(1), qui a modifi\u00e9 l\u2019al. 27(1)e) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148), mais jamais au point d\u2019avantager un nouveau contribuable qui n\u2019est pas lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019origine des pertes. Seul le contribuable qui a subi la perte peut la d\u00e9duire.\n[88] Le paragraphe 111(5) garantit que ce principe s\u2019\u00e9tend aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Bien que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 reste la m\u00eame personne sur le plan juridique apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui sont derri\u00e8re la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a chang\u00e9. Le paragraphe 111(5) fonctionne de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que les avantages fiscaux li\u00e9s aux pertes en cause ne profitent pas \u00e0 un nouvel actionnariat qui exploite une nouvelle entreprise.\n[89] Cette restriction au principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) favorise la coh\u00e9rence avec d\u2019autres dispositions du r\u00e9gime de calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le par. 249(4) pr\u00e9cise que lorsque survient une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est r\u00e9put\u00e9e prendre fin et une nouvelle ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition commencer. Ainsi, une acquisition de contr\u00f4le rompt le lien entre les activit\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition et celles qui y sont post\u00e9rieures. Il serait incompatible avec plusieurs autres dispositions que la Loi permette malgr\u00e9 tout \u00e0 cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de reporter les pertes comme si le lien n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu.\n[90] Ainsi, le par. 111(5) sert \u00e0 circonscrire la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) et \u00e0 promouvoir la coh\u00e9rence avec les autres dispositions qui, dans les faits, traitent la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un nouveau contribuable apr\u00e8s une acquisition de contr\u00f4le (Li (2021), p. 314; Strain, Dodge et Peters, p. 4:52\u20114:54).\nc) Le choix du Parlement quant aux crit\u00e8res de contr\u00f4le diff\u00e8re d\u2019une disposition \u00e0 l\u2019autre de la Loi\n[91] L\u2019appelante met l\u2019accent sur le par. 256(5.1) de la Loi, qui d\u00e9finit le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de facto. Ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019introduction du par. 111(5) et, bien que de nombreuses dispositions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es pour soit adopter soit rejeter le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de facto, le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure pr\u00e9vu au par. 111(5) est rest\u00e9 inchang\u00e9. L\u2019appelante soutient que l\u2019adoption du crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de facto dans d\u2019autres dispositions indique que [traduction] \u00ab le Parlement s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur la question du contr\u00f4le tout au long de la Loi. [. . .] [I]l comprenait la diff\u00e9rence entre les contr\u00f4les de facto et de jure et il souhaitait cette diff\u00e9rence \u00bb (m.a., par. 64 (soulignement dans l\u2019original)). Pour l\u2019appelante, cela suffit pour r\u00e9gler le sort du litige, et r\u00e9duit l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) au crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure.\n[92] \u00c0 mon avis, le contexte de la Loi r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, confront\u00e9 \u00e0 un choix entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et le contr\u00f4le de facto comme crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le Parlement a opt\u00e9 pour le premier. Plusieurs raisons expliquent pourquoi le Parlement aurait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re comme marqueur pour l\u2019application du par. 111(5), un sujet dont la Cour a trait\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers, par. 58 :\n\u00c0 mon avis, la norme de jure a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue parce qu\u2019\u00e0 certains \u00e9gards elle repr\u00e9sente un concept pertinent et relativement certain et pr\u00e9visible pour l\u2019examen du contr\u00f4le. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019expression de jure renvoie aux sources juridiques qui d\u00e9terminent le contr\u00f4le; \u00e0 savoir la loi qui r\u00e9git la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les actes constitutifs de cette derni\u00e8re, y compris ses statuts et ses r\u00e8glements administratifs. La notion de facto a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle oblige \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier qui exerce le contr\u00f4le de fait, ce qui peut conduire \u00e0 une multitude d\u2019indices susceptibles d\u2019exister outre ces sources. [Soulignement dans l\u2019original.]\n[93] Il ne fait aucun doute que le contr\u00f4le de jure est un rep\u00e8re plus clair que le contr\u00f4le de facto, ce qui conf\u00e8re une plus grande certitude \u00e0 la plupart des op\u00e9rations qui ne sont pas motiv\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal. En revanche, le contr\u00f4le de facto est un concept large auquel il peut \u00eatre satisfait par une simple influence indirecte, et qui ne requiert donc pas l\u2019existence de droits ex\u00e9cutoires (par. 256(5.1); Krishna, p. 695). La port\u00e9e d\u2019un tel crit\u00e8re aurait englob\u00e9 une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de situations allant bien au\u2011del\u00e0 du souci du Parlement de garantir qu\u2019un contribuable ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas des pertes d\u2019un autre. Par exemple, bien que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des administrateurs et des actionnaires d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre stable, un pr\u00eat important visant \u00e0 aider une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9orienter ses activit\u00e9s pourrait cr\u00e9er une relation de d\u00e9pendance suffisante pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de facto, m\u00eame si l\u2019influence du cr\u00e9ancier n\u2019est jamais exerc\u00e9e. Ainsi, face \u00e0 deux crit\u00e8res imparfaits, il est logique que le Parlement ait choisi le contr\u00f4le de jure.\n[94] Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure explique enti\u00e8rement la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. Le contr\u00f4le de jure \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t le marqueur qui offrait un indicateur raisonnable pour la plupart des circonstances dont le Parlement se pr\u00e9occupait \u2014 particuli\u00e8rement compte tenu du fait que la RGA\u00c9 puisse trouver application en dernier recours. Pour \u00e9tablir la raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous\u2011tend le par. 111(5), il faut plus que le simple fait que le Parlement ait opt\u00e9 pour ce crit\u00e8re pour mettre en \u0153uvre son intention.\n[95] En effet, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5) devient plus clair apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen de dispositions connexes qui \u00e0 la fois \u00e9tendent et restreignent les circonstances dans lesquelles une acquisition de contr\u00f4le s\u2019est produite. Ces dispositions sugg\u00e8rent que le contr\u00f4le de jure ne refl\u00e8te pas parfaitement ni n\u2019explique compl\u00e8tement le m\u00e9fait auquel le Parlement souhaitait s\u2019attaquer.\nd) Le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le pr\u00e9vu au par. 111(5) est \u00e9tendu et restreint par d\u2019autres dispositions \u00ab d\u00e9terminatives \u00bb\n[96] Le paragraphe 256(8) pr\u00e9voit que le contr\u00f4le est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis lorsque, pour contourner certaines dispositions, un contribuable obtient, entre autres, le droit : d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des actions; d\u2019obliger une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 racheter, \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir ou \u00e0 annuler des actions; d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir ou de contr\u00f4ler les droits de vote; ou de faire r\u00e9duire les droits de vote d\u2019autres actionnaires (voir l\u2019al. 251(5)b)). Si le droit pr\u00e9vu, lorsqu\u2019il est exerc\u00e9, conf\u00e8re au contribuable le contr\u00f4le de jure de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le par. 256(8) pr\u00e9voit que ce contr\u00f4le est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis lorsque le droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis. Ce paragraphe m\u00e9rite notre attention puisque, m\u00eame s\u2019il traite principalement des droits relatifs aux actions, il va au\u2011del\u00e0 de la documentation habituelle consid\u00e9r\u00e9e pour l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure. En effet, il pr\u00e9voit l\u2019\u00e9valuation des droits juridiques, y compris ceux d\u00e9coulant de contrats. Le paragraphe 256(8) comble une lacune qui aurait permis aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir un droit contractuel qui, s\u2019il \u00e9tait exerc\u00e9, leur aurait permis de contr\u00f4ler la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Fiscal Statement (1980), p. 40; G. W. Flynn, \u00ab Tax Planning for Corporations with Net Capital and Noncapital Losses \u00bb, dans Corporate Management Tax Conference, Current Developments in Measuring Business Income for Tax Purposes (1982), 208, p. 209). Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, il d\u00e9montre que le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure pr\u00e9vu au par. 111(5) ne vise pas, \u00e0 lui seul, l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des situations que le Parlement souhaitait viser; il doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un indicateur visant \u00e0 donner effet aux objectifs plus larges du Parlement tout en offrant un certain degr\u00e9 de clart\u00e9 et de stabilit\u00e9 dans la plupart des cas.\n[97] Pour sa part, le par. 256(7) pr\u00e9voit que le contr\u00f4le est r\u00e9put\u00e9 ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis dans certaines circonstances afin de donner convenablement effet \u00e0 des dispositions similaires \u00e0 celles du par. 111(5). Par exemple, il garantit que des transferts entre parties li\u00e9es peuvent survenir sans que les d\u00e9ductions pour pertes inutilis\u00e9es soient perdues \u00e0 cause d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab changement technique dans le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (A. R. A. Scace et D. S. Ewens, The Income Tax Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. 1983), p. 106; al. 256(7)a) et b)). Cela sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui ont acquis le contr\u00f4le importe lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme un nouveau contribuable. En ce sens, le par. 111(5) et les dispositions connexes ne visent pas simplement un changement formel de contr\u00f4le : si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 de main, la Loi reconna\u00eet la continuit\u00e9 entre ses pertes pass\u00e9es et ses activit\u00e9s commerciales futures. Ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019une partie non li\u00e9e prend les r\u00eanes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019autorisation de reporter les pertes porterait atteinte aux principes fondamentaux qui sous\u2011tendent la Loi ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle sur le report des pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a).\n[98] Je souligne que l\u2019art. 256.1, adopt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les op\u00e9rations en cause, pr\u00e9voit que le contr\u00f4le est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis lors d\u2019une acquisition importante de capitaux propres. Cela \u00e9tant dit, puisqu\u2019elle est post\u00e9rieure aux op\u00e9rations de l\u2019appelante, il n\u2019est ni n\u00e9cessaire ni utile d\u2019en faire l\u2019examen dans le cas qui nous occupe (voir aussi Oxford Properties Group, par. 46 et 86).\n[99] L\u2019analyse contextuelle qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de permet de mieux saisir la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente du par. 111(5). Toutefois, pour mieux en \u00e9tablir l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques de l\u2019objet que poursuivait le Parlement tout au long de l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif de cette disposition.\n(3) L\u2019objet de la disposition\n[100] L\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif du par. 111(5) illustre que le Parlement voulait s\u2019attaquer au commerce de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9ficitaires, lequel sapait l\u2019assiette fiscale et \u00e9tait source d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 entre les contribuables. Cela t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un souci particulier qui s\u2019inscrit dans la politique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Loi d\u2019interdire le transfert de pertes entre contribuables, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019exceptions pr\u00e9cises (Mathew, par. 53).\n[101] De surcro\u00eet, une analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique du par. 111(5) d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que, m\u00eame si les moyens que le Parlement a choisis pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps \u2014 ce dernier optant au bout du compte pour le contr\u00f4le de jure \u2014, la raison pour laquelle il a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 la restriction au report des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9.\n[102] L\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif du par. 111(5) remonte \u00e0 1958. Cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0, l\u2019al. 27(1)e) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148 \u2014 le pr\u00e9curseur de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab afin d\u2019autoriser l\u2019utilisation des pertes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour r\u00e9duire le revenu tir\u00e9 non seulement de la m\u00eame entreprise, mais \u00e9galement de toute autre entreprise que poursuit le contribuable \u00bb (Strain, Dodge et Peters, p. 4:42). Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une lib\u00e9ralisation consid\u00e9rable des r\u00e8gles sur le report de pertes; auparavant, celles\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles que du revenu tir\u00e9 de la m\u00eame entreprise pendant d\u2019autres ann\u00e9es.\n[103] Dans le cadre de la m\u00eame modification, le par. 27(5) \u2014 le pr\u00e9curseur du par. 111(5) \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi . Ce paragraphe \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n(5) L\u2019alin\u00e9a e) du paragraphe (1) ne s\u2019applique pas de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 autoriser une corporation \u00e0 d\u00e9duire, aux fins du calcul de son revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, une perte commerciale subie par elle dans une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition ant\u00e9rieure, lorsque\na) plus de 50 p. 100 des actions du capital social de la corporation ont, entre la fin de ladite ann\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieure et la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, \u00e9t\u00e9 acquises par une ou plusieurs personnes qui, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de ladite ann\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieure, ne poss\u00e9daient aucune des actions du capital social de la corporation; et\nb) la corporation n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, les affaires dans lesquelles la perte a \u00e9t\u00e9 subie.\n(S.C. 1958, c. 32, par. 12(2))\n[104] Au cours des d\u00e9bats au S\u00e9nat, on a expliqu\u00e9 que, sans une restriction de ce genre, \u00ab il serait bien facile d\u2019acheter les compagnies qui ont \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des pertes pour profiter \u00bb du report (D\u00e9bats du S\u00e9nat, 1re sess., 24e l\u00e9g., 21 ao\u00fbt 1958, p. 696 (l\u2019hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson)). Autrement dit, la restriction a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab dans le but de surveiller la pratique du commerce des compagnies enregistrant des pertes fiscales \u00bb (H. D. McGurran, \u00ab Principles of Income Tax : 2. Taxable Income from a Business \u00bb (1958), 6 Rev. fisc. can. 455, p. 465). Par contre, la restriction au report des pertes commerciales introduite par le par. 27(5) pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9e si l\u2019entreprise dans le cadre de laquelle la perte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 subie \u00e9tait toujours exploit\u00e9e (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s). Fait \u00e0 noter, le crit\u00e8re qu\u2019a adopt\u00e9 le Parlement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque (l\u2019acquisition de plus de 50 p. 100 des actions du capital social des corporations par un ou plusieurs nouveaux actionnaires en une seule ann\u00e9e) se distinguait du marqueur actuel (le contr\u00f4le de jure).\n[105] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption du par. 27(5), les auteurs n\u2019ont pas tard\u00e9 \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer des probl\u00e8mes et des \u00e9chappatoires. Par exemple, un auteur a d\u00e9crit comment il \u00e9tait possible de contourner la nouvelle restriction au report de pertes en faisant simplement preuve d\u2019un peu de pr\u00e9voyance :\n[traduction] Si un acheteur potentiel avait la pr\u00e9voyance d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir un petit nombre d\u2019actions, ou une seule action tant qu\u2019\u00e0 y \u00eatre, avant la fin de l\u2019exercice financier, toutes les pertes seraient alors pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es, peu importe le type d\u2019entreprise exploit\u00e9 dans le futur. Peut\u2011\u00eatre vaut\u2011il mieux n\u00e9gocier l\u2019achat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9ficitaires pendant les derni\u00e8res semaines de leur exercice financier.\n(C. W. Leach, \u00ab Making the Most of Your Losses \u00bb, dans Canadian Tax Papers No. 19, Corporate Management Conference (1960), 27, p. 29)\n[106] En 1963, le Parlement a modifi\u00e9 l\u2019al. 27(5)a) pour faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une acquisition du contr\u00f4le d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par une ou plusieurs personnes qui ne la contr\u00f4laient pas \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019exercice pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, tout en continuant d\u2019appliquer aux op\u00e9rations ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la modification l\u2019ancien crit\u00e8re concernant l\u2019acquisition de 50 p. 100 de ses actions (S.C. 1963, c. 21, par. 6(1) et (2), substituant l\u2019al. 27(5)a) et ajoutant le par. 27(5a)). Lors de la deuxi\u00e8me lecture du projet de loi \u00e0 la Chambre des communes, le ministre des Finances de l\u2019\u00e9poque, Walter L. Gordon, a exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet du trafic d\u2019actions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9ficitaires :\nLe public et le monde des affaires ont tendance \u00e0 n\u2019avoir aucun respect pour un gouvernement qui leur permet de profiter librement des \u00e9chappatoires \u00e9videntes d\u2019une loi. [. . .] [I]l pourrait sembler souhaitable de faire dispara\u00eetre certaines dispositions qui permettent aux contribuables de se soustraire au paiement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et j\u2019aimerais donner quatre exemples.\n. . .\nLe deuxi\u00e8me cas que je tiens \u00e0 mentionner est celui qui permet, \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle, aux termes de la loi, aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s subissant des pertes au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de les reporter sur les ann\u00e9es suivantes en les d\u00e9duisant des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s pendant la nouvelle p\u00e9riode.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte un trafic des actions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui ont ferm\u00e9 leurs portes, mais qui, du point de vue technique, ont le droit de reporter sur les ann\u00e9es suivantes certaines pertes d\u00e9ductibles. Par exemple, le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une entreprise prosp\u00e8re peut acqu\u00e9rir les actions d\u2019une de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et y transf\u00e9rer son commerce qui marche bien. Il peut alors d\u00e9duire les pertes ant\u00e9rieures encourues par l\u2019autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans des affaires peut\u2011\u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui ont rapport\u00e9 le revenu imposable de sa propre entreprise. Il me semble que le Parlement n\u2019a jamais eu pareille intention au moment o\u00f9 la proposition a \u00e9t\u00e9, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, incorpor\u00e9e dans la loi, et qu\u2019il y aurait lieu de mettre fin \u00e0 cette pratique. [Je souligne.]\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. IV, 1re sess., 26e l\u00e9g., 16 octobre 1963, p. 3821\u20113822 (l\u2019hon. Walter L. Gordon))\n[107] Ult\u00e9rieurement, le ministre des Finances a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 propos de l\u2019objet de la disposition :\nCet article vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher une compagnie qui a droit \u00e0 un report de perte de passer en d\u2019autres mains, ce qui permettrait au nouveau propri\u00e9taire de se lancer dans une entreprise totalement diff\u00e9rente apr\u00e8s le jour du budget et de se pr\u00e9valoir de ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la nouvelle entreprise. . .\n. . .\n. . . Le droit de reporter la perte dispara\u00eet s\u2019il y a eu changement de propri\u00e9taire. La raison en est patente. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019usage chez les propri\u00e9taires de commerces rentables acquittant des imp\u00f4ts sur leurs b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de se porter acqu\u00e9reurs de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, qui n\u2019\u00e9taient souvent que des carcasses, mais qui avaient droit \u00e0 un report de pertes; ce droit leur servait \u00e0 d\u00e9falquer ces pertes de leurs propres b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et leur \u00e9vitait des paiements d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Cette disposition tend \u00e0 emp\u00eacher de tels agissements. Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019en th\u00e9orie, si l\u2019on examine la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a ce droit du fait d\u2019\u00eatre une personne morale distincte, elle prend [sic] ses droits, quand elle devient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre. Toutefois, c\u2019est exactement cela que nous voulons enrayer. [Je souligne.]\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. V, 1re sess., 26e l\u00e9g., 1er novembre 1963, p. 4513 (l\u2019hon. Walter L. Gordon))\n[108] En 1966, la commission Carter a examin\u00e9 la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreuses recommandations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es par le Parlement au cours des ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes. La commission a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer, sur le plan conceptuel, l\u2019objet de la restriction au report de pertes :\nLe r\u00e9gime fiscal actuel n\u2019accorde aucune d\u00e9duction au nouveau propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une entreprise non constitu\u00e9e en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions pour les pertes non report\u00e9es par l\u2019ancien propri\u00e9taire. C\u2019est aussi le cas lors de l\u2019achat des actifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions dont les pertes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es. Dans chacune de ces circonstances, l\u2019acheteur, \u00e9tant un contribuable distinct du vendeur, n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019utiliser les pertes du vendeur aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n. . .\nNous avons d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 notre avis une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un interm\u00e9diaire pour les actionnaires. La d\u00e9duction tr\u00e8s lib\u00e9rale que nous proposons \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pertes, ne vise pas \u00e0 autoriser un contribuable \u00e0 d\u00e9duire des pertes encourues par un autre et \u00e0 ainsi diff\u00e9rer ou \u00e9viter le paiement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Nous recommandons, par cons\u00e9quent, que les pertes ne soient pas transf\u00e9rables d\u2019un contribuable \u00e0 un autre et que le droit de reporter les pertes soit refus\u00e9 \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lorsque le contr\u00f4le a chang\u00e9 de mains, soit par la vente d\u2019actions, soit par l\u2019octroi du droit d\u2019acquisition des int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rants, (\u00e0 moins que ce droit puisse s\u2019exercer seulement \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ou encore au d\u00e9faut de remplir une obligation ou bien en vertu d\u2019un arrangement comportant un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence), soit par fusion statutaire.

Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 limiter les reports en cas d\u2019une acquisition de contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir une exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s. Le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab 50 p. 100 des actions \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9, et le par. 111(5) ne faisait d\u00e9sormais \u00e9tat que d\u2019une acquisition du contr\u00f4le (S.C. 1970\u201172, c. 63, art. 1). Les restrictions quant au report des pertes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 resserr\u00e9es par des modifications l\u00e9gislatives subs\u00e9quentes (Strain, Dodge et Peters, p. 4:42); le crit\u00e8re est toutefois demeur\u00e9 le m\u00eame depuis.\n[110] L\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9montre que, m\u00eame si le Parlement a eu \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab red\u00e9finir des conditions en vue de faire respecter son intention \u00bb (G. W. Riehl, Incorporation and Income Tax in Canada (4e \u00e9d. 1965), p. 69), la disposition a toujours restreint le report de pertes autres qu\u2019en capital lors d\u2019un changement du lieu de contr\u00f4le d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019un groupe de personnes \u00e0 une ou un autre, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s. Lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 change de mains, et que l\u2019entreprise d\u00e9ficitaire cesse d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9e, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est en pratique un nouveau contribuable qui ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital accumul\u00e9es par l\u2019ancien contribuable. L\u2019extrait suivant fournit une explication utile :\n[traduction] En premier lieu, les reports de pertes apr\u00e8s un changement de contr\u00f4le ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas permis en termes de politiques fiscales. En principe, un contribuable ne peut pas utiliser \u00e0 son profit les pertes d\u2019un autre contribuable. Dans le cas d\u2019une entit\u00e9 artificielle comme une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, on consid\u00e8re essentiellement qu\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le au sein d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en fait un nouveau contribuable puisque des actionnaires diff\u00e9rents acqui\u00e8rent indirectement le droit de tirer profit de sa r\u00e9ussite financi\u00e8re. [Je souligne.]\n(Strain, Dodge et Peters, p. 4:52)\n[111] La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s concorde avec cette conclusion : bien que la r\u00e8gle en question puisse \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme conf\u00e9rant des avantages aux nouveaux actionnaires, l\u2019exception est l\u00e0 pour une raison. Elle favorise [traduction] \u00ab le r\u00e9tablissement d\u2019entreprises non rentables \u00bb (Strain, Dodge et Peters, p. 4:53), ce qui pourrait n\u00e9cessiter un nouvel investissement de la part des nouveaux propri\u00e9taires. Quand cela se produit, [traduction] \u00ab la prise de contr\u00f4le s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif commercial positif de transformer une entreprise non rentable en une entreprise rentable, et on ne voit pas pourquoi elle ne devrait pas continuer \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir des pertes non utilis\u00e9es des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la prise de contr\u00f4le \u00bb (P. W. Hogg, J. E. Magee et T. Cook, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (3e \u00e9d. 1999), p. 408, cit\u00e9 avec approbation dans OSFC Holdings Ltd. c. Canada, 2001 CAF 260, [2002] 2 C.F. 288, par. 91). En effet, l\u2019existence d\u2019une continuit\u00e9 d\u2019activit\u00e9s porte \u00e0 croire que ceux qui ont pris les r\u00eanes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 souhaitaient renforcer l\u2019entreprise de cette derni\u00e8re, plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019en servir comme plate\u2011forme pour des activit\u00e9s non connexes qui d\u00e9natureraient son identit\u00e9. Bien que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ait pu changer de mains, le lien de continuit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 par un autre marqueur : la stabilit\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s. Qui plus est, la justification de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) \u2014 mesurer avec plus d\u2019exactitude le revenu et venir en aide \u00e0 un contribuable dont le revenu fluctue au fil du temps \u2014 conserve sa pertinence, vu cette continuit\u00e9. Cela confirme que le par. 111(5) sert essentiellement \u00e0 d\u00e9limiter les circonstances dans lesquelles le fondement de la r\u00e8gle sur le report de pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) est inexistant.\n[112] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif du par. 111(5) d\u00e9montre que l\u2019intention du Parlement \u00e9tait de contrer un m\u00e9fait particulier. Si les moyens qu\u2019il a choisis pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps, la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la restriction au report de pertes dans la Loi est demeur\u00e9e la m\u00eame.\n(4) Conclusion sur l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit\n[113] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le par. 111(5) a pour raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. Le Parlement a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 garantir que l\u2019absence de continuit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soit accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une rupture correspondante dans la capacit\u00e9 de reporter des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital. Voil\u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition et ce qui explique correctement ce qui a incit\u00e9 le Parlement \u00e0 adopter le par. 111(5).\n[114] Lorsqu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9 l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t s\u2019est attard\u00e9e \u00e0 la notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le effectif \u00bb (par. 134), un terme employ\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement par le juge Iacobucci dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers (par. 36). La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu que ce terme n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair, et elle l\u2019a remplac\u00e9 par \u00ab contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el \u00bb (par. 72\u201173). Cela semble avoir exacerb\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me, et a amen\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 soutenir que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait substitu\u00e9 au crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure \u00e9tabli par le Parlement un crit\u00e8re ambigu \u00e9quivalant au contr\u00f4le de facto. L\u2019appelante a propos\u00e9 une formulation de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit ax\u00e9e sur le contr\u00f4le de jure.\n[115] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, tant les tribunaux d\u2019instances inf\u00e9rieures que l\u2019appelante ont formul\u00e9 l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit comme un crit\u00e8re juridique, plut\u00f4t que comme l\u2019expression de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. Cela a eu pour effet de fausser leur analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 . Le contr\u00f4le de jure, le contr\u00f4le \u00ab effectif \u00bb et le contr\u00f4le \u00ab r\u00e9el \u00bb n\u2019indiquent ni pourquoi le Parlement se souciait de l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le ni le m\u00e9fait auquel il voulait s\u2019attaquer (Oxford Properties Group, par. 101). Que l\u2019on d\u00e9finisse l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) en fonction du crit\u00e8re choisi par le Parlement ou en substituant \u00e0 son choix un autre crit\u00e8re, cela reviendrait, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 accorder la priorit\u00e9 aux moyens (le comment) plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre (le pourquoi).\n[116] Au paragraphe 111(5), le Parlement a clairement opt\u00e9 pour un crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le : le contr\u00f4le de jure. Celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait un marqueur raisonnable des situations o\u00f9 l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a chang\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit donc avant tout d\u2019un moyen de donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019objectif du Parlement, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019une expression exhaustive de l\u2019objectif lui\u2011m\u00eame. Comme pour toute disposition, le Parlement a d\u00fb choisir un crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour le par. 111(5) parmi les choix disponibles : il avait de bonnes raisons de choisir le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure plut\u00f4t que le crit\u00e8re large du contr\u00f4le de facto, qui aurait englob\u00e9 une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de conduites n\u2019ayant rien \u00e0 voir avec ses objectifs. Il convient de rappeler que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 employer pour la simple application du par. 111(5) n\u2019est pas en litige. Par contre, le choix du contr\u00f4le de jure n\u2019explique pas, en soi, ce qui pr\u00e9occupait le Parlement, comme le d\u00e9montre amplement une analyse minutieuse de la preuve intrins\u00e8que et extrins\u00e8que. Avec \u00e9gards, les motifs de ma coll\u00e8gue confondent les moyens \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le texte d\u2019une disposition (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le contr\u00f4le de jure) avec la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente de la disposition. Or, cette approche aurait des incidences sur une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de dispositions qui font appel \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re relatif au contr\u00f4le, de telle sorte que, dans les faits, la RGA\u00c9 ne s\u2019appliquerait pas.\n[117] Avant de continuer, je ferai deux autres commentaires. Premi\u00e8rement, le fait d\u2019\u00e9noncer avec exactitude l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit qui sous\u2011tend la disposition ne change pas le crit\u00e8re applicable dans la disposition. Tant que le Parlement ne l\u00e9gif\u00e8rera pas autrement, le contr\u00f4le de jure demeure la norme pour l\u2019application du par. 111(5). Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, dans le cadre de cette analyse, les tribunaux ne formulent pas un nouveau crit\u00e8re juridique lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition; ils cherchent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 en saisir la raison d\u2019\u00eatre, et ainsi \u00e0 offrir une synth\u00e8se de ce que la disposition visait \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser ou \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir. Les tribunaux n\u2019\u00ab appliquent \u00bb pas non plus l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit dans l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un nouveau crit\u00e8re de d\u00e9marcation. L\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus est de nature comparative : pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu abus dans l\u2019application d\u2019une disposition dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 , on \u00e9value le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations \u2014 des op\u00e9rations d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualifi\u00e9es comme ayant pour objectif premier d\u2019\u00e9viter de payer des imp\u00f4ts \u2014 par rapport \u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition, pour d\u00e9cider si cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre est contrecarr\u00e9e (Trustco, par. 57; Copthorne, par. 69).\n[118] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le par. 111(5) d\u00e9montre que le Parlement voulait emp\u00eacher les tiers qui prennent les r\u00eanes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et en modifient l\u2019entreprise de se pr\u00e9valoir des pertes inutilis\u00e9es. Cela explique ce que le Parlement cherchait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir par la disposition, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son texte, de son contexte et de son objet.\n[119] Deuxi\u00e8mement, je souligne que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que sugg\u00e8re ma coll\u00e8gue, la pr\u00e9sente cause ne ressemble pas \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Alta Energy, qui portait sur la clause d\u2019exception d\u2019un trait\u00e9 international allouant au pays de la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019une personne le droit d\u2019imposer certains gains en capital sur les biens immobiliers. Dans cet arr\u00eat, les juges majoritaires ont statu\u00e9 que, par cet accord, le Canada cherchait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 \u00ab renoncer \u00e0 son droit d\u2019imposer \u00bb certains gains en capital, parce qu\u2019il souhaitait \u00ab encourager les r\u00e9sidents luxembourgeois \u00e0 investir dans des actifs commerciaux int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 des biens immobiliers situ\u00e9s au Canada \u00bb (par. 6 et 89). La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cet incitatif s\u2019appliquait, peu importe si les r\u00e9sidents luxembourgeois avaient des liens \u00e9conomiques suffisant ou non ou qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 de simples r\u00e9sidents selon des crit\u00e8res formels : le Luxembourg \u00e9tait bien connu \u00e0 titre de paradis fiscal international, et la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab davantage dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat national [du Canada] d\u2019attirer des investisseurs \u00e9trangers \u2014 qui utiliseraient le Luxembourg comme relais afin de se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019exon\u00e9ration \u2014 que de percevoir des recettes fiscales plus importantes sur les gains en capital \u00bb (par. 87). En revanche, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Parlement n\u2019a ni fait le choix d\u2019autoriser les strat\u00e9gies fond\u00e9es sur le commerce des pertes, ni consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un compromis acceptable. L\u2019existence du par. 111(5), ainsi que la modification continue par le Parlement des dispositions connexes afin d\u2019en \u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e, d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de permettre \u00e0 un tel r\u00e9sultat et qu\u2019il a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 des comportements qui n\u2019avaient aucun rapport avec l\u2019objectif du report des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital, comme l\u2019illustre une analyse du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 111(5).\n[120] La seule question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de savoir si le r\u00e9sultat de la s\u00e9rie particuli\u00e8re d\u2019op\u00e9rations en cause est incompatible avec la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5). C\u2019est sur cette question que je vais maintenant me pencher.\nC. Y a\u2011t\u2011il eu abus dans l\u2019application du par. 111(5)?\n[121] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif, soit celle qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les op\u00e9rations sont abusives, \u00ab d\u00e9pend n\u00e9cessairement des faits \u00bb (Trustco, par. 44; Oxford Properties Group, par. 39). Il faut donc faire preuve de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (Housen, par. 10). Toutefois, la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019abus en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne commande aucune d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) et, par cons\u00e9quent, sur une erreur de droit isolable (Trustco, par. 46). Les conclusions de fait du juge de premi\u00e8re instance quant aux op\u00e9rations elles\u2011m\u00eames doivent tout de m\u00eame faire l\u2019objet de retenue, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une erreur manifeste et dominante; cela \u00e9tant dit, les faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cisifs pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la mauvaise question juridique ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement aussi importants pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la bonne question. Ainsi, ces conclusions peuvent \u00eatre plus ou moins pertinentes lorsque les op\u00e9rations sont envisag\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition en cause.\n[122] Une analyse des op\u00e9rations en cause d\u00e9montre que leur r\u00e9sultat a servi \u00e0 contrecarrer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) : compte tenu des circonstances dans leur ensemble, les op\u00e9rations ont atteint le r\u00e9sultat que le Parlement voulait pr\u00e9venir et ont fourni \u00e0 Matco les avantages d\u2019une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, tout en contournant tout juste l\u2019application du par. 111(5). Je note qu\u2019une conclusion selon laquelle une op\u00e9ration qui n\u2019a pas procur\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le de jure aux acqu\u00e9reurs a constitu\u00e9 un abus dans l\u2019application du par. 111(5) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne signifie pas que toutes les op\u00e9rations qui ne procurent pas le contr\u00f4le de jure constituent un abus dans l\u2019application de cette disposition. En effet, il ne s\u2019agit pas de savoir si Matco d\u00e9tient le contr\u00f4le de jure ou si elle satisfait \u00e0 un autre crit\u00e8re comme celui du contr\u00f4le de facto. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif est de nature comparative : elle exige que le tribunal examine les op\u00e9rations en cause \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition pour d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations contrecarre cette raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Il l\u2019a clairement fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[123] La conclusion que la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations auxquelles l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e9tait abusive d\u00e9coule directement d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation appropri\u00e9e de ce que le par. 111(5) visait \u00e0 accomplir et de la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019appelant a contourn\u00e9 cette issue. Dans l\u2019analyse qui suit, j\u2019examine le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations, en m\u2019attardant tout particuli\u00e8rement (1) \u00e0 la transformation fondamentale de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante et (2) aux droits et aux avantages obtenus par Matco.\n[124] Le paragraphe 111(5) a pour esprit et objet d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, le par. 111(5) refl\u00e8te la proposition selon laquelle, lorsque l\u2019identit\u00e9 du contribuable a effectivement chang\u00e9, la continuit\u00e9 au c\u0153ur de la r\u00e8gle sur le report de pertes pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) n\u2019existe plus. De ce point de vue, le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint par le truchement des op\u00e9rations contest\u00e9es. En effet, les op\u00e9rations de r\u00e9organisation ont entra\u00een\u00e9 la transformation quasi totale de l\u2019appelante : ses actifs et passifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 Newco, si bien qu\u2019il ne restait que ses attributs fiscaux. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 vid\u00e9e de tout vestige de son ancienne \u00ab vie \u00bb en tant que personne morale et elle est devenue une coquille vide dot\u00e9e d\u2019attributs fiscaux.\n[125] De surcro\u00eet, les attributs fiscaux d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ficitaire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s au profit d\u2019une autre partie. De fait, les paiements dont a convenu Matco aux termes de la convention d\u2019investissement visaient \u00e0 lui permettre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier financi\u00e8rement des attributs fiscaux en remplissant la coquille avec l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e et en demeurant un actionnaire important. Pareille conclusion est renforc\u00e9e par la clause de rajustement de la convention d\u2019investissement. Les sommes dues par Matco aux termes de la convention devaient \u00eatre rajust\u00e9es en fonction de la valeur r\u00e9elle des attributs fiscaux; ainsi, la contrepartie que devait fournir Matco \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la mon\u00e9tisation des attributs fiscaux (art. 2.3 et al. 5.5(a) et 5.5(b)).\n[126] De plus, l\u2019actionnariat de la contribuable a profond\u00e9ment chang\u00e9 tout au long des op\u00e9rations : l\u2019appelante a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 une filiale en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive de Newco, et elle a fini par devenir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cot\u00e9e en bourse pour financer une nouvelle entreprise, dont Matco \u00e9tait devenue un des nouveaux actionnaires.\n[127] Quant \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, l\u2019appelante a servi de coquille pour une tout autre entreprise organis\u00e9e par DKCM et choisie par Matco. Le seul lien qui subsistait entre l\u2019appelante apr\u00e8s les op\u00e9rations et son ancienne \u00ab vie \u00bb en tant que personne morale \u00e9tait donc les attributs fiscaux; \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9gards, il s\u2019agissait, en pratique, d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9e de nouveaux actifs et passifs et de nouveaux actionnaires qui exploitaient une nouvelle entreprise. Par cons\u00e9quent, les op\u00e9rations ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un changement profond de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la contribuable. La capacit\u00e9 continue de l\u2019appelante de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des d\u00e9ductions pour report de pertes contrecarre la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la d\u00e9cision du Parlement de rompre la continuit\u00e9 du traitement fiscal au par. 111(5), surtout compte tenu des droits et avantages obtenus par Matco.\n[128] Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9, le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 au par. 111(5) comme moyen de mettre en \u0153uvre les objectifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le Parlement parce que ce crit\u00e8re reconna\u00eet \u00e0 juste titre que l\u2019obtention d\u2019une majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes conf\u00e8re la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lire le conseil d\u2019administration et, partant, de contr\u00f4ler la gestion des affaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Buckerfield\u2019s, p. 302\u2011303; Duha Printers, par. 35\u201136). Matco est parvenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quivalent fonctionnel d\u2019une telle acquisition du contr\u00f4le au moyen de la convention d\u2019investissement, tout en contournant le par. 111(5), parce qu\u2019elle a utilis\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations distinctes pour d\u00e9manteler les droits et avantages dont jouirait normalement un actionnaire majoritaire. Plusieurs aspects des op\u00e9rations en cause illustrent cette \u00e9quivalence fonctionnelle, ce par quoi je veux dire que Matco a atteint le r\u00e9sultat que le Parlement visait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir, sans directement acqu\u00e9rir les droits qui auraient d\u00e9clench\u00e9 l\u2019application du par. 111(5) (Trustco, par. 57; Copthorne, par. 69).\n[129] Premi\u00e8rement, Matco a obtenu par contrat la facult\u00e9 de s\u00e9lectionner les administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La clause 3.4 de la convention d\u2019investissement est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en ces termes :\n[traduction]\n3.4 D\u00e9mission des dirigeants et administrateurs\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re met tout en \u0153uvre pour voir \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de Matco se joigne au conseil d\u2019administration de la filiale et que ce repr\u00e9sentant ainsi que Charles Butt et David Goold soient les seuls dirigeants et administrateurs de la filiale, et ce, \u00e0 compter de la date de prise d\u2019effet. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re met tout en \u0153uvre pour obliger ces administrateurs \u00e0 conserver leurs fonctions d\u2019administrateurs de la filiale jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une occasion d\u2019affaires soit trouv\u00e9e, et elle mettra alors tout en \u0153uvre pour obliger Charles Butt et David Goold \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner en qualit\u00e9 de dirigeants et d\u2019administrateurs et \u00e0 renoncer r\u00e9ciproquement sans condition \u00e0 toute r\u00e9clamation qu\u2019il pourrait avoir contre la filiale et vice\u2011versa, sauf \u00e0 des demandes d\u2019indemnisation.\n(d.a., vol. II, p. 87)\n[130] En cons\u00e9quence, m\u00eame si elle ne d\u00e9tenait pas de participations majoritaires, Matco a exig\u00e9 par contrat que Newco, qui avait le contr\u00f4le de la plupart des actions restantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente, s\u2019assure que les trois administrateurs de l\u2019appelante soient M. Butt, M. Goold et un administrateur choisi par Matco. C\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est produit au cours de l\u2019\u00e9lection qui s\u2019est tenue apr\u00e8s la signature de la convention d\u2019investissement. Matco a donc veill\u00e9 par contrat \u00e0 la composition du conseil d\u2019administration. Comme le pr\u00e9voit la clause 3.4, une fois l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires trouv\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e, MM. Butt et Goold devaient d\u00e9missionner et \u00eatre remplac\u00e9s par des administrateurs choisis par DKCM pour mettre en \u0153uvre sa propre entreprise tout en monnayant les attributs fiscaux de l\u2019appelante. L\u00e0 encore, c\u2019est exactement ce qui s\u2019est produit.\n[131] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la convention d\u2019investissement a eu pour effet de restreindre grandement les pouvoirs du conseil d\u2019administration. Il \u00e9tait interdit \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de prendre une foule de mesures, notamment : \u00e9mettre des actions, des options, des bons de souscription, des options d\u2019achat, des privil\u00e8ges de conversion ou tout autre droit pour acqu\u00e9rir des actions de l\u2019appelante; modifier ses actes constitutifs ou r\u00e8glements administratifs; r\u00e9organiser, regrouper, fusionner l\u2019appelante ou la proroger avec toute autre personne morale; prendre toute mesure relative \u00e0 la liquidation, \u00e0 la dissolution ou \u00e0 la cessation des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante; d\u00e9clarer des dividendes; conclure un contrat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelante; et se livrer \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 autre que l\u2019examen et la recherche d\u2019une occasion d\u2019affaires (art. 6.1). Plusieurs de ces d\u00e9cisions vont tellement au c\u0153ur des fonctions des administrateurs que, selon la loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, les administrateurs ne sont habituellement pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer pareils pouvoirs \u00e0 un administrateur ou \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 (par. 115(3) de la LCSA ). Les activit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es qu\u2019avec le [traduction] \u00ab consentement \u00e9crit pr\u00e9alable de Matco \u00bb (art. 6.1 de la convention d\u2019investissement).\n[132] Les restrictions en faveur de Matco ressemblent \u00e0 l\u2019entrave \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui surviendrait normalement par la voie d\u2019une convention unanime des actionnaires et qui d\u00e9clencherait une acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure (Duha Printers, par. 71). C\u2019est uniquement parce qu\u2019il existe une op\u00e9ration court\u2011circuit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu abus dans l\u2019application du par. 111(5) : l\u2019administrateur de Matco a achet\u00e9 100 actions par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille, 1250280 Alberta Ltd., qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la convention, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que celle\u2011ci soit sign\u00e9e par tous les actionnaires. En d\u00e9pit de cette man\u0153uvre, le r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 semblable : dans les faits les pouvoirs des administrateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 neutralis\u00e9s pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de la convention.\n[133] Troisi\u00e8mement, les op\u00e9rations ont permis \u00e0 Matco de retirer des avantages importants. En effet, gr\u00e2ce aux op\u00e9rations en cause, Matco est devenu un actionnaire important et a conserv\u00e9 une participation dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une valeur de 4,5 M$ \u00e0 la suite du PAPE. Cependant, plut\u00f4t que le simple achat de la majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes, elle a utilis\u00e9 un accord contractuel distinct pour obtenir l\u2019\u00e9quivalent fonctionnel du droit de vote majoritaire pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires. Durant cet intervalle, Matco a priv\u00e9 Newco, l\u2019actionnaire votant majoritaire sur papier, de tous les droits essentiels qu\u2019elle aurait pu habituellement exercer. On n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 examiner les trois droits traditionnels de l\u2019actionnaire \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au par. 24(3) de la LCSA : ceux de voter \u00e0 toute assembl\u00e9e, de recevoir tout dividende d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de se partager le reliquat des biens lors de la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Bien que Newco ait conserv\u00e9 ses droits de vote en th\u00e9orie, la plupart des d\u00e9cisions qui feraient habituellement l\u2019objet d\u2019un vote des actionnaires \u2014 comme une modification des r\u00e8glements administratifs \u2014 ne pouvaient \u00eatre prises qu\u2019avec le consentement de Matco (sous\u2011al. 6.1(b)(iii) de la convention d\u2019investissement). Similairement, m\u00eame si Newco avait droit \u00e0 des dividendes sur papier, ceux\u2011ci ne pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s qu\u2019avec le consentement de Matco (sous-al. 6.1(c)(iv)). Enfin, m\u00eame si Newco avait droit au reliquat des biens lors de dissolution de l\u2019appelante, l\u00e0 encore, il \u00e9tait interdit aux administrateurs de prendre une mesure de ce genre sans l\u2019approbation de Matco (sous-al. 6.1(c)(iii)). De toute fa\u00e7on, tous les actifs de l\u2019appelante en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s au moyen des op\u00e9rations de r\u00e9organisation. Ainsi, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appelante avait chang\u00e9 de mains, mais Matco a obtenu ce r\u00e9sultat par une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en acqu\u00e9rant une majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante.\n[134] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019elle pouvait toujours agir librement. \u00c0 mon avis, toute libert\u00e9 r\u00e9siduelle conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e9tait illusoire, et ne sert qu\u2019\u00e0 renforcer \u00e0 quel point les op\u00e9rations ont contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5).\n[135] Bien que l\u2019appelante ait pu, en th\u00e9orie, refuser l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires que lui a procur\u00e9e Matco (art. 4.1 de la convention d\u2019investissement), une lecture attentive de la convention d\u2019investissement r\u00e9v\u00e8le que son acceptation de cette occasion \u00e9tait un fait accompli.\n[136] En premier lieu, la convention interdisait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de se livrer \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 autre que l\u2019\u00e9tude et l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires (al. 6.1(d)). En termes simples, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a continu\u00e9 d\u2019exister que pour servir de coquille pour l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires choisie par Matco. Il ne faisait donc aucun doute qu\u2019une telle occasion serait accept\u00e9e.\n[137] En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, le refus de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires \u00e9tait lourd de cons\u00e9quences. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, Matco ne serait plus oblig\u00e9e de fournir le montant garanti (al. 5.5(d)). Il faut situer ces cons\u00e9quences dans leur contexte : quand l\u2019appelante a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir une occasion ext\u00e9rieure, sa situation financi\u00e8re \u00e9tait pr\u00e9caire. L\u2019argent que devait Matco aux termes de la convention d\u2019investissement, en contrepartie de lui permettre de mon\u00e9tiser indirectement les attributs fiscaux, \u00e9tait la seule planche de salut pour l\u2019appelante. Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 4.1 doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces circonstances, dont les parties avaient connaissance au moment o\u00f9 elles ont conclu le contrat. En effet, elles expliquent pourquoi les n\u00e9gociations ont eu lieu, soit parce que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de tirer profit elle\u2011m\u00eame des attributs financiers en raison de sa situation financi\u00e8re.\n[138] En ce qui concerne la possibilit\u00e9 pour Newco de vendre ses actions \u00e0 une autre partie si elle recevait une offre sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de Matco (art. 5.1 et 5.2), l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de trouver un autre acheteur \u00e9tait illusoire. Puisque l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait incapable de mener quelque activit\u00e9 que ce soit sans le consentement de Matco en raison de la convention d\u2019investissement, on ne pouvait pas raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un tiers attribue aux actions une valeur plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que le prix convenu dans la convention avant que Matco ait trouv\u00e9 une occasion d\u2019affaires.\n[139] Bien entendu, Newco avait le droit de ne vendre aucune de ses actions restantes (art. 5.3 et 5.8), comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (par. 159 et 164). Or, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la formulation appropri\u00e9e de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition en cause, le fait que Newco pouvait choisir de conserver ses actions votantes cadre avec le parcours sinueux emprunt\u00e9 par les op\u00e9rations pour contourner le par. 111(5). Il importe peu que Newco vende ses actions \u00e0 Matco ou non, les agissements de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 neutralis\u00e9s par la convention d\u2019investissement, et les principaux avantages de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019actions (comme le droit aux dividendes) \u00e9taient annul\u00e9s par leur assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de Matco. En outre, la capacit\u00e9 de recevoir le montant garanti directement plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en vendant les actions \u00e0 Matco (art. 5.3 et 5.8) ne fait que renforcer l\u2019id\u00e9e que les op\u00e9rations visaient \u00e0 contourner le par. 111(5). Cette option \u00e9tait importante, car, dans certaines circonstances, l\u2019achat des actions par Matco pouvait d\u00e9clencher une acquisition de contr\u00f4le de jure. La s\u00e9rie complexe d\u2019op\u00e9rations et la souplesse de la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires uniquement parce que les parties contractantes voulaient commettre le m\u00e9fait m\u00eame que le par. 111(5) visait \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir.\n[140] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances expos\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le r\u00e9sultat atteint par les op\u00e9rations a clairement contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5) et constituait donc un abus. Le paragraphe 111(5) a pour objet et esprit d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires. Les op\u00e9rations ont atteint le r\u00e9sultat m\u00eame que le par. 111(5) tente de pr\u00e9venir. Sans d\u00e9clencher une \u00ab acquisition de contr\u00f4le \u00bb, Matco a obtenu le pouvoir d\u2019un actionnaire majoritaire et transform\u00e9 les actifs, les passifs, l\u2019identit\u00e9 des actionnaires ainsi que l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante. Cela a rompu la continuit\u00e9 du traitement fiscal qui est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5).\nVII. Conclusion\n[141] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n[142] Ce pourvoi est d\u2019une grande importance pour les contribuables canadiens. La question dont la Cour est saisie est celle de savoir si la convention d\u2019investissement (\u00ab convention d\u2019investissement \u00bb) conclue entre Matco Capital Ltd., 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (\u00ab Newco \u00bb) et l\u2019appelante, Deans Knight Income Corporation, constitue un abus du par. 111(5) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu , L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5 e suppl .) (\u00ab Loi \u00bb), aux fins d\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti-\u00e9vitement (\u00ab RGA\u00c9 \u00bb) pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 245 de la Loi .\n[143] Il est essentiel de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que la RGA\u00c9 exige une mise en balance minutieuse [traduction] \u00ab entre deux int\u00e9r\u00eats concurrents : l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du contribuable de minimiser ses imp\u00f4ts gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des moyens techniquement l\u00e9gitimes et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gislatif de garantir l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime fiscal \u00bb (V. Krishna, Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (2e \u00e9d. 2019), vol. 1, p. 96). Comme le juge Binnie, dissident, l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre dans Lipson c. Canada, 2009 CSC 1, [2009] 1 R.C.S. 3, par. 55, \u00ab [s]i son application n\u2019est pas balis\u00e9e par la jurisprudence, la RGA\u00c9 est une arme susceptible d\u2019avoir un effet consid\u00e9rable, s\u00e9rieux et impr\u00e9visible sur la planification fiscale l\u00e9gitime \u00bb. Avec \u00e9gards, je suis d\u2019avis que ni mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Rowe ni la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019ont appliqu\u00e9 la RGA\u00c9 avec la retenue qui s\u2019imposait. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi.\n[144] Je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec plusieurs aspects de l\u2019analyse de mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Rowe. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019adoption non \u00e9quivoque par le Parlement du crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le de jure au par. 111(5) de la Loi , mon coll\u00e8gue souscrit \u00e0 une approche ad hoc qui \u00e9largit la notion de contr\u00f4le en y incluant un vaste \u00e9ventail de facteurs op\u00e9rationnels. Selon moi, cette approche ouvre la voie \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir judiciaire discr\u00e9tionnaire illimit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sultera en l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles sur la restriction des pertes pr\u00e9vues au par. 111(5) sur la base d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments circonstanciels. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 mon coll\u00e8gue, j\u2019adopte les conclusions de fait de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[145] Je proc\u00e8de de la fa\u00e7on suivante. D\u2019abord, je r\u00e9it\u00e8re et j\u2019examine certains principes fondamentaux de la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 . Je m\u2019attarde tout particuli\u00e8rement au principe selon lequel la RGA\u00c9 ne peut servir \u00e0 passer outre les autres dispositions de la Loi . Ensuite, j\u2019examine l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) de la Loi et je d\u00e9cris les failles que je vois dans l\u2019analyse de mon coll\u00e8gue. Apr\u00e8s avoir discern\u00e9 l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition, je me penche sur la question de l\u2019abus. Premi\u00e8rement, j\u2019\u00e9nonce la bonne norme de contr\u00f4le. Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u2019appuyant sur ma caract\u00e9risation correcte de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), je conclus que les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement en cause ne sont pas abusives au sens de la RGA\u00c9 . Troisi\u00e8mement, je d\u00e9montre que, m\u00eame en retenant la compr\u00e9hension qu\u2019a mon coll\u00e8gue de l\u2019objet et de l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), il est impossible de conclure au caract\u00e8re abusif des op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement sans infirmer diverses conclusions factuelles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\nII. Analyse\nA. La RGA\u00c9 ne peut servir \u00e0 passer outre l\u2019intention du Parlement\n[146] L\u2019approche qu\u2019adopte mon coll\u00e8gue afin de cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) ne tient pas compte d\u2019un principe fondamental \u00e9tabli dans Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601 : la RGA\u00c9 ne sert pas et ne peut pas servir \u00e0 passer outre l\u2019intention sp\u00e9cifique du Parlement quant \u00e0 des dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques de la Loi . Ce principe fait partie int\u00e9grante de la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 et il ne saurait \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\n[147] C\u2019est un principe de longue date du droit fiscal que chaque particulier est en droit de r\u00e9gler ses affaires [traduction] \u00ab de mani\u00e8re telle que l\u2019imp\u00f4t qui en d\u00e9coule en vertu des lois en vigueur soit inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il aurait autrement vers\u00e9 \u00bb (Commissioners of Inland Revenue c. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), p. 19). Bien entendu, ce principe n\u2019est pas absolu dans le contexte de la RGA\u00c9 (Lipson, par. 21; Canada c. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 CSC 49, par. 30). La RGA\u00c9 est \u00ab destin\u00e9e \u00e0 invalider, pour le motif qu\u2019ils constituent de l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif, des m\u00e9canismes qui seraient acceptables selon une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu \u00bb (Trustco Canada, par. 13). Cette souplesse est toutefois limit\u00e9e, puisque les tribunaux doivent \u00ab donner effet simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 et aux autres dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu applicables \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration donn\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 13). Il est par cons\u00e9quent inappropri\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la RGA\u00c9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y voir une \u00ab r\u00e9probation morale [des actions] du contribuable qui, afin de r\u00e9duire son obligation fiscale, se montre ing\u00e9nieux pour faire jouer la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en sa faveur \u00bb (Copthorne Holdings Ltd. c. Canada, 2011 CSC 63, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 721, par. 65).\n[148] C\u2019est pourquoi, depuis qu\u2019elle a rendu l\u2019arr\u00eat Trustco Canada, notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que l\u2019analyse de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit est essentiellement une forme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative. Il n\u2019existe \u00ab qu\u2019un seul principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation : il faut d\u00e9gager l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Trustco Canada, par. 40). L\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9 repose sur \u00ab la m\u00e9thode qu\u2019emploie notre Cour pour toute interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, \u00e0 savoir une m\u00e9thode \u201ctextuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique unifi\u00e9e\u201d \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70). Elle \u00ab ne r\u00e9crit pas les dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ; [elle] exige seulement que l\u2019avantage fiscal soit conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet et \u00e0 l\u2019esprit des dispositions invoqu\u00e9es \u00bb (Trustco Canada, par. 54; Alta Energy, par. 96). L\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 vise simplement \u00e0 \u00ab d\u00e9gager un aspect diff\u00e9rent de la loi \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 70).\n[149] L\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 n\u2019\u00e9tant gu\u00e8re plus qu\u2019une forme sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, son objectif central doit \u00eatre de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention du Parlement (Trustco Canada, par. 40). Il ne faut pas tenir pour acquis que la RGA\u00c9 , en tant que mesure de dernier recours (Trustco Canada, par. 21; Copthorne, par. 66), joue un r\u00f4le dans toutes les op\u00e9rations et dans tous les contextes. Parfois, la RGA\u00c9 est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00ab tenir compte de la complexit\u00e9 d\u2019op\u00e9rations qui \u00e9chappent \u00e0 l\u2019application de dispositions anti\u2011\u00e9vitement particuli\u00e8res \u00bb (Lipson, par. 47). \u00c0 d\u2019autres occasions, le Parlement adopte une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique avec des objectifs clairs \u00e0 l\u2019esprit. L\u2019application de la RGA\u00c9 dans cette seconde hypoth\u00e8se aurait pour effet de nier les choix politiques du Parlement. En cons\u00e9quence, lorsqu\u2019il est dit que la RGA\u00c9 est une mesure de dernier recours, cela signifie simplement qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue par le Parlement pour \u00eatre la premi\u00e8re et principale mesure anti\u2011\u00e9vitement \u2014 rien de plus.\n[150] Je conviens avec mon coll\u00e8gue que \u00ab rien n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019appliquer la RGA\u00c9 lorsque la Loi pr\u00e9voit des conditions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il faut satisfaire pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat en particulier, comme dans le cas d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti-\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique \u00bb (par. 71). La RGA\u00c9 peut en effet compl\u00e9ter une r\u00e8gle anti-\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique; affirmer l\u2019inverse serait \u00ab contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence de la Cour \u00bb (motifs du juge Rowe, par. 72). Celle-ci a toutefois d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que le texte d\u2019une disposition peut parfois s\u2019av\u00e9rer d\u00e9terminant lorsqu\u2019il \u00ab correspond \u00e0 [l]a raison d\u2019\u00eatre [de la disposition] et l\u2019explique enti\u00e8rement \u00bb (Copthorne, par. 110). Ainsi, bien que je souscrive \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de mon coll\u00e8gue selon laquelle l\u2019analyse est \u00ab sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 chaque cas \u00bb (par. 71), j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est incorrect et peu \u00e9clairant de d\u00e9clarer de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive et universelle que des dispositions techniques et soigneusement r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ne sont pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019\u00eatre abusives (par. 72). En effet, l\u2019arr\u00eat Copthorne, que cite mon coll\u00e8gue, reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment la possibilit\u00e9 que la raison d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019une disposition n\u2019ait pas une plus grande port\u00e9e que son libell\u00e9. Cela dit, il m\u2019appara\u00eet plus utile de se demander plut\u00f4t quand le texte est d\u00e9terminant ou non.\n[151] La question cl\u00e9 est celle de savoir si le Parlement avait sp\u00e9cifiquement l\u2019intention d\u2019emp\u00eacher ou de permettre un certain type d\u2019op\u00e9rations. Lorsque le Parlement consacre dans une disposition les conditions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il faut satisfaire pour atteindre un r\u00e9sultat particulier, \u00ab on peut raisonnablement supposer qu\u2019il a voulu que le contribuable s\u2019appuie sur ces dispositions pour obtenir le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019elles prescrivent \u00bb (Trustco Canada, par. 11). Bien que cela ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant, \u00ab lorsqu\u2019il est possible de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une disposition anti\u2011\u00e9vitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement con\u00e7ue de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inclure certaines situations et \u00e0 en exclure d\u2019autres, il est raisonnable d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi de limiter sa port\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence \u00bb (Canada c. Landrus, 2009 CAF 113, par. 47 (CanLII)). La pr\u00e9cision avec laquelle une disposition est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e est donc un facteur cl\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer si la RGA\u00c9 peut ou non compl\u00e9ter une r\u00e8gle anti-\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique. Cela d\u00e9coule du principe fondamental selon lequel l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 est une forme d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative : elle ne peut servir de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 r\u00e9crire une disposition.\n[152] Avec \u00e9gards, mon coll\u00e8gue applique la RGA\u00c9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui non seulement ne tient pas compte de ce principe fondamental, mais aussi le m\u00e9conna\u00eet. Il affirme qu\u2019il faut distinguer la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition des moyens utilis\u00e9s pour y donner effet (par. 59). Selon lui, il faut se pencher sur le processus de r\u00e9daction puisqu\u2019il \u00ab consiste \u00e0 traduire les objectifs du gouvernement sous forme l\u00e9gislative afin de cr\u00e9er des r\u00e8gles intelligibles et juridiquement efficaces \u00bb (par. 59). L\u2019implication n\u00e9cessaire qui d\u00e9coule du raisonnement de mon coll\u00e8gue est que le Parlement est incapable de traduire ses objectifs en moyens efficaces; le mieux qu\u2019il peut faire est de choisir le texte qui est le \u00ab plus fid\u00e8le \u00e0 ses objectifs \u00bb (par. 59 (je souligne)). Selon moi, le Parlement a souvent l\u2019intention de faire pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu\u2019il fait dans les faits. S\u2019il \u00e9labore une disposition soigneusement, les tribunaux devraient porter une attention particuli\u00e8re aux moyens choisis et non supposer que le Parlement a mal r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la disposition.\n[153] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alta Energy, la Cour a confirm\u00e9 que la notion de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 est un autre outil important pour discerner l\u2019intention sp\u00e9cifique du Parlement (par. 82). Parfois, l\u2019absence ou la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une disposition anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique peut constituer \u00ab un \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur \u00bb qui fournit un \u00e9clairage sur l\u2019intention du Parlement (par. 82). Si \u00ab le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu la strat\u00e9gie fiscale employ\u00e9e par le contribuable, ou [ne pouv]ait pas [. . .] la pr\u00e9voir \u00bb, il est plus probable qu\u2019un vide dans la loi soit involontaire, et la RGA\u00c9 peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement qui exploite ce vide (par. 82). La RGA\u00c9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue dans le but d\u2019identifier des strat\u00e9gies fiscales qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues (par. 80) et de permettre au Parlement de garder une longueur d\u2019avance sur les stratag\u00e8mes ing\u00e9nieux et innovants d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal.\n[154] Cela dit, si le Parlement r\u00e9dige une disposition anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique qui laisse ouvert un vide hautement pr\u00e9visible, il est plus probable que ce vide soit intentionnel et que le fait de se fonder sur lui ne soit pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant abusif de la RGA\u00c9 . Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alta Energy, la Cour a refus\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser la RGA\u00c9 pour introduire un crit\u00e8re de \u00ab lien \u00e9conomique substantiel suffisant \u00bb en plus de l\u2019exigence de r\u00e9sidence pr\u00e9vue dans un trait\u00e9 fiscal conclu entre le Canada et le Luxembourg. La RGA\u00c9 ne s\u2019appliquait pas parce que \u00ab le Canada et le Luxembourg ont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment choisi de laisser l\u2019exon\u00e9ration relative aux biens d\u2019entreprise \u00e0 la disposition des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s relais \u00bb (par. 82). Autrement dit, la RGA\u00c9 ne peut servir \u00e0 sanctionner le contribuable qui a franchi une porte que le Parlement a intentionnellement laiss\u00e9e ouverte.\n[155] Mon coll\u00e8gue applique essentiellement le raisonnement que la Cour a express\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alta Energy. Dans cette affaire, mon coll\u00e8gue et la juge Martin, dissidents, ont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 les articles pertinents du trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, affirmant que toute autre interpr\u00e9tation \u00ab rendrait la RGA\u00c9 \u201cinutile\u201d \u00bb (par. 133). Selon mes coll\u00e8gues, \u00ab on ne [pouvait] rien d\u00e9duire de l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement con\u00e7ue pour contrer le sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9cis utilis\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (par. 150). En cons\u00e9quence, \u00ab l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e8gle anti\u2011\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique [. . .] ne donne que peu d\u2019indications quant \u00e0 [la] raison d\u2019\u00eatre [des dispositions] \u00bb (par. 150). Selon l\u2019opinion dissidente dans Alta Energy, tirer pareille inf\u00e9rence \u00ab irait [. . .] manifestement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la conclusion tir\u00e9e \u00e0 maintes reprises par la Cour selon laquelle la RGA\u00c9 est une mesure de dernier recours, et qu\u2019elle ne peut s\u2019appliquer que lorsqu\u2019aucune autre disposition de la Loi ne le fait \u00bb (par. 150, citant Trustco Canada, par. 21; Copthorne, par. 66). Autrement dit, selon le point de vue des juges dissidents dans Alta Energy, parce que la RGA\u00c9 est une \u00ab mesure de dernier recours \u00bb, elle a un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans toutes les causes.\n[156] Mon coll\u00e8gue suit le m\u00eame raisonnement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il discerne un objet et un esprit qui entrent en conflit avec l\u2019adoption par le Parlement d\u2019un crit\u00e8re juridique bien \u00e9tabli : le contr\u00f4le de jure. \u00c0 son avis, le crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le choisi par le Parlement au par. 111(5) de la Loi a peu d\u2019importance. La \u00ab raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous\u2011jacente \u00bb de la disposition permet plut\u00f4t au ministre du Revenu national d\u2019appliquer ce paragraphe d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui passe outre l\u2019intention sp\u00e9cifique du Parlement. En termes simples, cette approche est contraire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour dans Trustco Canada. Elle accro\u00eet de mani\u00e8re inadmissible le r\u00f4le de la RGA\u00c9 et permet au ministre de passer outre les choix du Parlement quand bon lui semble. Ce n\u2019est pas le r\u00f4le qu\u2019\u00e9tait cens\u00e9e jouer la RGA\u00c9 .\nB. Le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet du par. 111(5)\n[157] J\u2019adh\u00e8re en bonne partie \u00e0 l\u2019analyse que fait mon coll\u00e8gue du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet du par. 111(5). Cependant, je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec sa conclusion selon laquelle la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition est \u00ab [d\u2019]emp\u00eacher les tiers qui prennent les r\u00eanes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et en modifient l\u2019entreprise de se pr\u00e9valoir des pertes inutilis\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 118). L\u2019analyse qui suit traite de cette question, et se concentre sur la notion de contr\u00f4le puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la principale source de d\u00e9saccord entre mon coll\u00e8gue et moi.\n[158] Je d\u00e9bute mon analyse en observant que l\u2019al. 111(1) a) de la Loi permet aux contribuables de d\u00e9duire les pertes autres qu\u2019en capital pour les fins du calcul du revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est restreinte par le par. 111(5). Lors d\u2019une acquisition de contr\u00f4le, le par. 111(5) emp\u00eache une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de reporter ses pertes \u00e0 moins que l\u2019entreprise exploit\u00e9e par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a subi le changement de contr\u00f4le continue d\u2019\u00eatre exploit\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9rant des profits ou avec une attente raisonnable de profits. Par cons\u00e9quent, la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des pertes \u2014 l\u2019al. 111(1)a) \u2014 est la r\u00e8gle par d\u00e9faut sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au par. 111(5), et avec des exceptions dans des circonstances pr\u00e9cises. Le paragraphe 111(5) est une r\u00e8gle anti-\u00e9vitement sp\u00e9cifique qui limite ce qui constituerait autrement des d\u00e9ductions permises aux termes de l\u2019al. 111(1)a) (D. G. Duff et autres, Canadian Income Tax Law (7e \u00e9d. 2023), p. 205-206; T. E. McDonnell, \u00ab Legislative Anti\u2011Avoidance : The Interaction of the New General Rule and Representative Specific Rules \u00bb, dans Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 6:1, p. 6:18). Il emp\u00eache les acquisitions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s faites dans le seul but d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des attributs fiscaux en restreignant l\u2019utilisation de ces derniers s\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus lors d\u2019une prise de contr\u00f4le. Le crit\u00e8re du changement de contr\u00f4le et l\u2019exigence quant \u00e0 la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise constituent, lorsqu\u2019ils sont correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, des exceptions limit\u00e9es \u00e0 la disposition anti-\u00e9vitement.\n[159] Il s\u2019ensuit que les restrictions au transfert de pertes pr\u00e9vues au par. 111(5) entrent en jeu au moment de l\u2019\u00ab acquisition [. . .] du contr\u00f4le d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00bb. La notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb est essentielle au fonctionnement du par. 111(5). Les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la question de savoir si un changement de contr\u00f4le pour les fins du par. 111(5) est signal\u00e9 par l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un contr\u00f4le de jure ou d\u2019un contr\u00f4le de facto.\n(1) La notion de contr\u00f4le de jure\n[160] Le mot \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi . Les tribunaux ont toutefois examin\u00e9 cette notion \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb pour les fins de la Loi renvoie au contr\u00f4le de jure. Dans la d\u00e9cision Buckerfield\u2019s Ltd. c. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 R.C. de l\u2019\u00c9. 299, la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada a jug\u00e9 que le contr\u00f4le de jure correspond \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un nombre suffisant d\u2019actions pour d\u00e9tenir la majorit\u00e9 des voix lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection du conseil d\u2019administration.\n[161] Le principe \u00e9tabli dans Buckerfield\u2019s a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. c. Canada, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 795. Dans cette affaire, le juge Iacobucci a affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il est question d\u2019\u00e9valuer le contr\u00f4le de jure, il faut tenir compte de la loi r\u00e9gissant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, du registre des actionnaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi que de toute restriction, particuli\u00e8re ou exceptionnelle, impos\u00e9e au pouvoir de l\u2019actionnaire majoritaire de contr\u00f4ler l\u2019\u00e9lection du conseil d\u2019administration, qui ressort des actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou d\u2019une convention unanime d\u2019actionnaires. Le juge Iacobucci a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun autre document n\u2019est pertinent dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du contr\u00f4le de jure (par. 85). Ainsi, le droit de vote d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9tention d\u2019actions \u2014 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et du registre de ses actionnaires \u2014 est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le facteur d\u00e9terminant du contr\u00f4le de jure.\n[162] Il est utile de rappeler la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette approche. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers, le juge Iacobucci a \u00e9tabli une distinction entre les conventions externes et les actes constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, au motif que ces derniers conf\u00e8rent le contr\u00f4le de jure puisqu\u2019ils restreignent la capacit\u00e9 des actionnaires d\u2019exercer leur droit de vote librement (par. 65 et 71). Il a longuement comment\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re particulier des conventions unanimes des actionnaires, affirmant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00ab cr\u00e9ation hybride du droit des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, qui est en partie contractuelle et qui tient en partie d\u2019un acte constitutif \u00bb (par. 66). De mani\u00e8re significative, le juge Iacobucci a not\u00e9 que le droit des affaires offre des recours, telle une ordonnance enjoignant de s\u2019y conformer, qui permettent d\u2019appliquer efficacement les droits et obligations d\u00e9coulant des actes constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris une convention unanime des actionnaires. Il importe de souligner qu\u2019une ordonnance enjoignant de s\u2019y conformer est analogue \u00e0 un jugement ordonnant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution en nature d\u2019un contrat (Loi sur les corporations, L.R.M. 1987, c. C225, cit\u00e9e dans Duha Printers, par. 13; K. P. McGuinness, Canadian Business Corporations Law (3e \u00e9d. 2017), \u00a722.301).\n[163] On retrouve la seule exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dont je viens de traiter dans des arr\u00eats tels que Ministre du Revenu national c. Consolidated Holding Co., [1974] R.C.S. 419, quand la question de la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019agir des actionnaires \u00e9tait restreinte par un acte de fiducie. Dans Duha Printers, le juge Iacobucci a comment\u00e9 sur la distinction entre un acte de fiducie et d\u2019autres documents externes pour les fins de l\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le de jure. Il a not\u00e9 qu\u2019une \u00ab fiducie impose au fiduciaire l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019acte de fiducie et au profit du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb (par. 49). Compte tenu de ces obligations fiduciaires, le juge Iacobucci a conclu que les actes de fiducie limitent la capacit\u00e9 des fiduciaires \u00ab d\u2019agir librement \u00bb (par. 49).\n[164] Contrairement aux actes constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les documents externes \u00ab cr\u00e9ent des obligations contractuelles et non des obligations juridiques ou tenant d\u2019un acte constitutif \u00bb (Duha Printers, par. 59). En cons\u00e9quence, toute restriction qu\u2019imposent de telles conventions \u00ab est une restriction \u00e0 laquelle les actionnaires ont consenti librement et n\u2019est pas du tout incompatible avec leur pouvoir de jure de contr\u00f4ler la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 49). Bien que de telles conventions n\u2019aient pas d\u2019incidence sur le contr\u00f4le de jure, elles demeurent pertinentes pour l\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le de facto. Il en est ainsi parce que le contr\u00f4le de fait repose sur la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une influence directe ou indirecte sur les actionnaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenant des droits de vote (Silicon Graphics Ltd. c. Canada, 2002 CAF 260, [2003] 1 C.F. 447, par. 67). Ainsi, il existe un \u00e9ventail plus large de facteurs \u2014 outre le droit de vote d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et du registre des actionnaires \u2014 qui peuvent \u00e9tablir le contr\u00f4le de facto. En ce sens, le contr\u00f4le de facto englobe tout ce que le contr\u00f4le de jure n\u2019englobe pas.\n(2) Le caract\u00e8re binaire du contr\u00f4le : le contr\u00f4le de jure et de facto\n[165] La distinction juridique entre les actes constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les conventions externes r\u00e9v\u00e8le le caract\u00e8re binaire du contr\u00f4le, lequel peut \u00eatre soit de jure, soit de facto. Tandis que les premiers conf\u00e8rent des pouvoirs l\u00e9gaux relativement \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les seconds ne le font pas, de sorte que la distinction entre eux renvoie \u00e0 la dichotomie entre le pouvoir et l\u2019influence. L\u2019inobservation des actes constitutifs d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e8re \u00e0 tout plaignant le droit de demander une ordonnance enjoignant de s\u2019y conformer (p. ex., Loi sur les corporations, cit\u00e9e dans Duha Printers, par. 13). En revanche, les conventions externes ne lient pas la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, les actionnaires demeurent libres d\u2019exercer le contr\u00f4le de jure, \u00ab m\u00eame si une convention externe vient restreindre le contr\u00f4le r\u00e9el ou de facto \u00bb (Duha Printers, par. 49). Par cons\u00e9quent, la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et de facto r\u00e9side dans l\u2019\u00e9tendue des facteurs qui peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer qui a le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[166] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence, le Parlement a clarifi\u00e9 la notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb afin d\u2019atteindre certains objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs sp\u00e9cifiques. Depuis le 13 septembre 1988, date \u00e0 laquelle le par. 256(5.1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit, la Loi expose clairement quelles dispositions renvoient \u00e0 la notion de contr\u00f4le de jure par opposition \u00e0 celles qui impliquent l\u2019application du contr\u00f4le de facto. L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u00ab contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, directement ou indirectement, de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit \u00bb, r\u00e9f\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifiquement au contr\u00f4le de facto, qui existe lorsqu\u2019une partie dispose d\u2019une influence directe ou indirecte sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvant conduire \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de fait. Cette modification illustre l\u2019intentionnalit\u00e9 avec laquelle le Parlement choisit les tests de contr\u00f4le, en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et de facto.\n[167] La r\u00e8gle de pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue au par. 256(8) de la Loi est une indication suppl\u00e9mentaire du maintien, et non de l\u2019abandon, par le Parlement du test relatif \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure au par. 111(5). Plut\u00f4t que de remplacer le test du contr\u00f4le de jure, le Parlement en a \u00e9tendu la d\u00e9finition pour y inclure les droits \u00e9ventuels et futurs sur les actions au titre du par. 256(8) \u2014 ils restent n\u00e9anmoins des droits de jure. Pour les fins du paragraphe 256(8), la personne qui acquiert certains droits (\u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019al. 251(5)b)) aff\u00e9rents aux actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est r\u00e9put\u00e9e se trouver dans la m\u00eame position sur le plan du contr\u00f4le que si le droit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9. Une fois qu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9tient un droit \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 251(5)b), le test du contr\u00f4le de jure est appliqu\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 ces actions. En cons\u00e9quence, le par. 256(8) mesure le pouvoir de voter sur la base de l\u2019actionnariat et englobe les conventions d\u2019option qui, si elles \u00e9taient exerc\u00e9es, entra\u00eeneraient un contr\u00f4le de jure. Il ne tient pas compte des facteurs op\u00e9rationnels reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la gestion d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[168] Outre ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les avantages du recours \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9marcation clair sont r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs de la raison pour laquelle le Parlement a choisi un test tel que le contr\u00f4le de jure. Des r\u00e8gles clairement d\u00e9finies sont essentielles aux op\u00e9rations bancaires et commerciales, car elles r\u00e9duisent les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux litiges et favorisent la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 en permettant \u00e0 toutes les parties de conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019avance leurs droits et leurs obligations. Comme la Cour l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers, \u00ab [i]l est donc tout \u00e0 fait souhaitable d\u2019utiliser un crit\u00e8re simple comme celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 depuis Buckerfield\u2019s. Si la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et le contr\u00f4le de facto doit \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment\u2011ci, il devrait appartenir au Parlement, et non aux tribunaux, de le faire \u00bb (par. 52). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un test qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par le Parlement (par. 52).\n[169] L\u2019importance de promouvoir la certitude sur le plan transactionnel et de minimiser les co\u00fbts est accrue lorsqu\u2019il est question d\u2019une disposition qui s\u2019applique exclusivement aux pertes autres qu\u2019en capital. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019un test hybride plus ambigu cr\u00e9erait des risques commerciaux pour les parties qui cherchent \u00e0 investir dans des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ayant accumul\u00e9 des pertes (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., le risque de recevoir un nouvel avis de cotisation ou celui d\u2019\u00eatre poursuivi). Par ailleurs, le fait de d\u00e9courager les investissements de ce type entraverait la r\u00e9habilitation des entreprises canadiennes et nuirait \u00e0 la croissance \u00e9conomique dans son ensemble.\n[170] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers, le juge Iacobucci a employ\u00e9 une approche t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique pour interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb. Pris litt\u00e9ralement, le terme \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb pourrait viser tout type d\u2019influence sur une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (par. 35). Le juge Iacobucci a n\u00e9anmoins conclu que l\u2019\u00ab objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb du par. 111(5) \u2014 soit emp\u00eacher le transfert de pertes autres qu\u2019en capital d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre \u2014 ne conf\u00e8re pas un sens plus large au contr\u00f4le de jure (par. 88). Ainsi, m\u00eame avant l\u2019adoption de la RGA\u00c9 , une chose \u00e9tait claire : le Parlement voulait que ce soit l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure \u2014 et uniquement l\u2019acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure \u2014 qui d\u00e9clenche l\u2019application du par. 111(5). Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour, le Parlement continue de se fonder sur la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et le contr\u00f4le de facto. Malgr\u00e9 la suggestion \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire de mon coll\u00e8gue, la RGA\u00c9 ne peut pas \u00e9carter cette distinction.\n(3) Conclusion quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5)\n[171] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) est de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux attributs fiscaux lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 acc\u00e8de \u00e0 ceux-ci au moyen d\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le de jure. Une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique des dispositions pertinentes r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le Parlement n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019intention que les tribunaux examinent des facteurs autres que ceux relatifs \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019actions.\n[172] S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Alta Energy, mon coll\u00e8gue accepte qu\u2019on ne puisse se servir de la RGA\u00c9 pour restreindre certains types de strat\u00e9gies d\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal si le Parlement d\u00e9montre une raison claire \u00ab d\u2019autoriser les strat\u00e9gies fond\u00e9es sur le commerce des pertes \u00bb ou de \u00ab consid\u00e9r[er] [un r\u00e9gime choisi comme] un compromis acceptable \u00bb (par. 119). Selon lui, le par. 111(5) ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re parce que le Parlement \u00ab n\u2019a [pas] fait le choix d\u2019autoriser les strat\u00e9gies fond\u00e9es sur le commerce des pertes \u00bb (par. 119). Je suis loin d\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019accord. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, Duha Printers ne reposait pas sur une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale du par. 111(5). En interpr\u00e9tant le terme \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb de mani\u00e8re t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, notre Cour a estim\u00e9 que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention expresse d\u2019autoriser certains types de rapports juridiques qui cr\u00e9ent un contr\u00f4le de facto sans entra\u00eener un changement de contr\u00f4le de jure (par. 52 et 58). Mon coll\u00e8gue ne tient pas compte du fait que le Parlement s\u2019est inspir\u00e9 du sens donn\u00e9 au mot \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb par la jurisprudence.\n[173] Ma conclusion fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par notre Cour dans Trustco Canada, que mon coll\u00e8gue ne peut distinguer de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La principale question en litige dans cette affaire portait sur la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab co\u00fbt \u00bb pour les fins de l\u2019application du par. 20(1) de la Loi . La juge en chef McLachlin et le juge Major, au nom de la Cour, ont not\u00e9 que ce mot renvoie \u00e0 une \u00ab notion juridique bien comprise \u00bb, soigneusement d\u00e9finie par la Loi et la jurisprudence (par. 75). Dans ce contexte, ils ont statu\u00e9 que \u00ab rien dans la RGA\u00c9 ou dans l\u2019objet des dispositions relatives aux [d\u00e9ductions pour amortissement ne permet \u00e0 la Cour] de les r\u00e9crire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u201cco\u00fbt\u201d comme signifiant \u201csomme expos\u00e9e \u00e0 un risque \u00e9conomique\u201d \u00bb (par. 75).\n[174] Il en va de m\u00eame pour la notion de contr\u00f4le. En effet, l\u2019intention du Parlement n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Duha Printers. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, le Parlement s\u2019est toujours fond\u00e9 sur les crit\u00e8res du contr\u00f4le de jure et du contr\u00f4le de facto. En 1988, il a introduit la notion du contr\u00f4le de facto dans le par. 256(5.1) de la Loi (Lyrtech RD Inc. c. La Reine, 2014 CAF 267, 2015 D.T.C. 5005, par. 36). La pr\u00e9somption \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 256(8) s\u2019appuie sur la notion de contr\u00f4le de jure et la d\u00e9veloppe. Ces dispositions illustrent que le Parlement a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de maintenir la distinction entre le contr\u00f4le de jure et le contr\u00f4le de facto et qu\u2019il continue de s\u2019y fier. Je ne vois pas en quoi les amendements apport\u00e9s aux tests de contr\u00f4le ont entach\u00e9 la logique qui sous-tend la d\u00e9cision de notre Cour dans Duha Printers. Ceci \u00e9tant, la RGA\u00c9 ne saurait passer outre l\u2019intention du Parlement; elle doit plut\u00f4t y donner effet.\n[175] En somme, un changement de contr\u00f4le est l\u2019unique \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9clencheur des restrictions sur l\u2019utilisation des pertes au par. 111(5). La notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb est donc essentielle \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du par. 111(5), et toute formulation de son objet et son esprit qui n\u2019en tient pas compte manque de coh\u00e9rence. \u00c0 mon avis, le par. 111(5) a pour objet et esprit d\u2019interdire le report des pertes d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019une personne ou un groupe de personnes en a acquis le contr\u00f4le de jure.\n[176] Mon coll\u00e8gue conc\u00e8de que le Parlement a opt\u00e9 pour le contr\u00f4le de jure. Il soutient n\u00e9anmoins \u00ab [qu\u2019]il faut plus que le simple fait que le Parlement ait opt\u00e9 pour ce crit\u00e8re pour mettre en \u0153uvre son intention \u00bb (par. 94 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). \u00c0 son avis, \u00ab le crit\u00e8re du contr\u00f4le de jure pr\u00e9vu au par. 111(5) ne vise pas, \u00e0 lui seul, l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des situations que le Parlement souhaitait viser; il doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un indicateur visant \u00e0 donner effet aux objectifs plus larges du Parlement \u00bb (par. 96 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Cette position ne pose qu\u2019une difficult\u00e9, mais elle est de taille : elle ne tient pas du tout compte de la fa\u00e7on dont le Parlement a v\u00e9ritablement d\u00e9fini ce qui constitue une acquisition de contr\u00f4le. Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que cela est totalement incompatible avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition au regard de la RGA\u00c9 .\n[177] Mon coll\u00e8gue tente en outre de minimiser l\u2019importance des soi-disant \u00ab moyens \u00bb vis\u00e9s au par. 111(5) en omettant le test du contr\u00f4le de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition. Selon lui, d\u00e9crire \u00ab l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) en fonction du crit\u00e8re choisi par le Parlement \u00bb reviendrait \u00ab \u00e0 accorder la priorit\u00e9 aux moyens (le comment) plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre (le pourquoi) \u00bb (par. 115 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Ironiquement, sa propre analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif illustre comment le test choisi par le Parlement est au c\u0153ur de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5). Bien qu\u2019il refuse de formuler l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) sous la forme d\u2019un test, mon coll\u00e8gue est incapable d\u2019articuler la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la disposition sans faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la notion d\u2019\u00ab acquisition \u00bb. Qu\u2019est\u2011ce qu\u2019une \u00ab acquisition \u00bb? Simplement une prise de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par un synonyme.\n[178] Bien qu\u2019il souligne \u00e0 bon droit que le contr\u00f4le de jure \u00ab demeure la norme pour l\u2019application du par. 111(5) \u00bb, mon coll\u00e8gue introduit la notion d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9quivalence fonctionnelle \u00bb (par. 117 et 128). Ce nouveau concept assimile la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e0 un acte constitutif de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les fins de l\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le (par. 122). La nuance qui \u00e9chappe \u00e0 mon coll\u00e8gue est la suivante : les actes constitutifs et les accords externes sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s de mani\u00e8res radicalement diff\u00e9rentes. Ceci \u00e9tant, un contrat ordinaire ne peut jamais \u00eatre l\u2019\u00e9quivalent fonctionnel d\u2019un acte constitutif. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je ne vois aucune diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019approche de mon coll\u00e8gue et celle de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re au test du \u00ab contr\u00f4le effectif \u00bb. Les deux d\u00e9marches ne tiennent aucunement compte de la raison d\u2019\u00eatre des tests de contr\u00f4le de jure et de contr\u00f4le de facto et \u00e9rodent la distinction entre les deux.\n[179] La jurisprudence indique clairement que la RGA\u00c9 ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour passer outre l\u2019intention claire du Parlement. Or, selon moi, c\u2019est ce que fait mon coll\u00e8gue dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. En effet, son approche s\u2019\u00e9carte de ce qui est par ailleurs l\u2019expression claire par le Parlement d\u2019un test fond\u00e9 sur le contr\u00f4le de jure pour restreindre l\u2019utilisation des pertes au par. 111(5). En outre, mon coll\u00e8gue introduit la notion d\u2019\u00e9quivalence fonctionnelle, qui est sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et sans balises. Avec \u00e9gards, cette approche illustre la port\u00e9e potentiellement illimit\u00e9e de la RGA\u00c9 , un risque contre lequel cette Cour a mis en garde dans Trustco Canada.\nC. Analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif\n(1) Norme de contr\u00f4le\n[180] Mon coll\u00e8gue et moi sommes d\u2019accord pour dire que la question de savoir si une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement entra\u00eene un abus dans l\u2019application des dispositions de la Loi est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui exige l\u2019application de la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Je ne peux toutefois souscrire \u00e0 son observation suivant laquelle les \u00ab conclusions de fait du juge de premi\u00e8re instance quant aux op\u00e9rations \u00bb sont \u00ab plus ou moins pertinentes lorsque les op\u00e9rations sont envisag\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit de la disposition en cause \u00bb (par. 121 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Avec \u00e9gards, cette affirmation laisse sous\u2011entendre que les cours d\u2019appel sont libres de ne pas tenir compte des conclusions factuelles cl\u00e9s dans les dossiers mettant en cause la RGA\u00c9 .\n[181] Les conclusions et les inf\u00e9rences factuelles ne peuvent \u00eatre infirm\u00e9es que s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante en y arrivant (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 23). En l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, une cour d\u2019appel ne peut soupeser \u00e0 nouveau les faits ou la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. Cela vaut pour tous les appels, y compris ceux mettant en cause la RGA\u00c9 . J\u2019ai peine \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi la pr\u00e9sente affaire en particulier commande l\u2019application d\u2019une norme moins stricte que celle de l\u2019\u00ab erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00bb.\n[182] D\u00e9terminer si une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement est abusive requiert un examen approfondi des faits et soul\u00e8ve une question mixte de fait et de droit (Trustco Canada, par. 44). En l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de principe isolable, l\u2019application du droit aux faits est assujettie \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Je souligne en passant que les questions d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contractuelle commandent l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de contr\u00f4le empreinte de retenue (Sattva Capital Corp. c. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 CSC 53, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 633, par. 50). Comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, j\u2019estime qu\u2019aucune erreur du genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(2) Les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement ne constituent pas un abus de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5)\n[183] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) est de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux attributs fiscaux lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 acc\u00e8de \u00e0 ceux-ci au moyen d\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le de jure. Puisque la notion de contr\u00f4le est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5), la question cl\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si Matco a acquis le contr\u00f4le de jure de Deans Knight.\n[184] Avant que je traite de cette question, il convient de noter que la relation entre Matco et Deans Knight est le point central de l\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus. Mon coll\u00e8gue semble laisser entendre que la d\u00e9claration dans le prospectus portant sur les risques fiscaux pr\u00e9visibles associ\u00e9s au transfert de pertes a une quelconque pertinence (par. 21 et 49). Or, le ministre n\u2019a pas soutenu qu\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le est survenu \u00e0 la suite du premier appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne (\u00ab PAPE \u00bb) : il a fait valoir qu\u2019un changement de contr\u00f4le s\u2019est produit \u00e0 la suite des op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement conclues entre Matco et Deans Knight. Comme le prospectus se rapportait au PAPE, la d\u00e9claration dans le prospectus \u00e0 laquelle mon coll\u00e8gue fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ce type de d\u00e9claration figure r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans les documents d\u2019appel d\u2019offres et dans les documents de communication continue, et n\u2019indique aucunement qu\u2019une op\u00e9ration est motiv\u00e9e par un \u00e9vitement fiscal abusif.\n[185] Me penchant maintenant sur la question de l\u2019abus, je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait raisonnablement appuy\u00e9e par ses conclusions factuelles et son interpr\u00e9tation de la convention d\u2019investissement. Selon les conclusions factuelles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, Matco n\u2019a pas acquis le \u00ab contr\u00f4le effectif \u00bb de Deans Knight et je ne vois aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans cette conclusion.\n[186] La conclusion de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait largement fond\u00e9e sur son interpr\u00e9tation de la convention d\u2019investissement et sur son appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins. Premi\u00e8rement, la d\u00e9benture acquise par Matco aux termes de la convention d\u2019investissement \u00e9tait convertible \u00e0 raison de 35 p. 100 des actions avec droit de vote de Deans Knight (2019 CCI 76, par. 21 (CanLII)). Jamais Matco n\u2019a\u2011t\u2011elle d\u00e9tenu ou eu le droit de d\u00e9tenir suffisamment d\u2019actions pour devenir une actionnaire majoritaire. La seule question cl\u00e9 est donc celle de savoir si la preuve appuie la pr\u00e9tention que Matco d\u00e9tenait le contr\u00f4le de jure des actions restantes de Deans Knight (par. 157).\n[187] Mon coll\u00e8gue affirme que Matco a acquis l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9quivalent fonctionnel \u00bb du contr\u00f4le de jure par le truchement de la convention d\u2019investissement (par. 128). Il insiste pour souligner que \u00ab [l]es restrictions en faveur de Matco ressemblent \u00e0 l\u2019entrave \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui surviendrait normalement par la voie d\u2019une convention unanime des actionnaires et qui d\u00e9boucherait une acquisition du contr\u00f4le de jure \u00bb (par. 132). \u00c0 son avis, ces restrictions \u00e9taient si s\u00e9v\u00e8res qu\u2019elles \u00ab ont [. . .] neutralis[\u00e9] \u00bb le conseil d\u2019administration de Deans Knight (par. 132). Il conclut donc que la capacit\u00e9 de Deans Knight d\u2019agir \u00ab toujours librement \u00bb \u00e9tait \u00ab illusoire \u00bb (par. 134); que son acceptation de l\u2019occasion d\u2019affaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Matco \u00e9tait un fait accompli (par. 135); que la possibilit\u00e9 que Newco re\u00e7oive d\u2019un tiers un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ses actions \u00e9tait \u00ab illusoire \u00bb (par. 138); et que le fait que Newco recevrait le montant garanti m\u00eame si les actions restantes dans Deans Knight n\u2019\u00e9taient pas vendues, d\u00e9montre que les op\u00e9rations \u00ab visaient \u00bb \u00e0 contourner le par. 111(5) (par. 139).\n[188] Selon mon coll\u00e8gue, la convention d\u2019investissement n\u2019a aucune pertinence en ce qui a trait au contr\u00f4le de jure. Dans Duha Printers, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 que, contrairement aux conventions unanimes des actionnaires, les conventions relatives aux droits de vote cr\u00e9ent des obligations contractuelles qui ne sont ni des obligations juridiques ni des obligations d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un acte constitutif (par. 59). Mon coll\u00e8gue consid\u00e8re malgr\u00e9 tout que la convention d\u2019investissement suffit pour \u00e9tablir le contr\u00f4le de jure. Au risque de me r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, le probl\u00e8me avec cette conclusion est qu\u2019une convention externe ne peut \u00eatre fonctionnellement \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 un acte constitutif.\n[189] Outre ce premier obstacle, l\u2019approche de mon coll\u00e8gue ne fait pas suffisamment preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions factuelles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Celle\u2011ci s\u2019est concentr\u00e9e sur la clause 5.8 de la convention d\u2019investissement qui stipule que [traduction] \u00ab [Newco] ne sera pas tenue de vendre les actions restantes avant ou pendant la p\u00e9riode de garantie, ou \u00e0 aucun autre moment \u00bb (motifs de la C.C.I., par. 59). La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu que cette condition ne constituait pas un trompe\u2011l\u2019\u0153il et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas incompatible avec un autre droit d\u00e9coulant de la convention (par. 60). Cette conclusion \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e par les autres stipulations de la convention d\u2019investissement, lesquelles n\u2019accordaient pas \u00e0 Matco le contr\u00f4le sur la vente des actions restantes (par. 61) et n\u2019exigeaient pas que Matco pr\u00e9sente l\u2019occasion de vente de ces actions \u00e0 des tiers (par. 62).\n[190] Ces conclusions \u00e9taient appuy\u00e9es par des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix. David Goold (le directeur financier de Deans Knight) a affirm\u00e9 que Newco estimait avoir le choix d\u2019accepter ou non l\u2019offre de Matco d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des actions restantes (motifs de la C.C.I., par. 64 et 162\u2011164). La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments restrictifs de la convention d\u2019investissement (par. 156 et 161), mais elle a accord\u00e9 plus de poids aux t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins de Deans Knight. Dit simplement, la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a tir\u00e9 des conclusions en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Or, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante qu\u2019il est possible de modifier des conclusions sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 (Housen, par. 10\u201115 et 19\u201125). Puisque l\u2019examen factuel qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a aucunement \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9 par sa caract\u00e9risation du par. 111(5), je ne vois aucune raison d\u2019infirmer sa conclusion.\n[191] Je vois plusieurs probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux avec la conclusion de mon coll\u00e8gue selon laquelle la perspective que Newco vende ses actions \u00e0 une autre partie \u00e9tait \u00ab illusoire \u00bb (par. 138). Tout d\u2019abord, mon coll\u00e8gue laisse entendre que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des actions est en quelque sorte moins pertinente pour l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif au regard du par. 111(5). En effet, il d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il \u00ab importe peu que Newco vende ses actions \u00e0 Matco ou non, les agissements de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 neutralis\u00e9s par la convention d\u2019investissement, et les principaux avantages de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019actions (comme le droit aux dividendes) \u00e9taient annul\u00e9s par leur assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de Matco \u00bb (par. 139). Cela sugg\u00e8re que le droit d\u2019un actionnaire aux dividendes a une certaine incidence dans l\u2019analyse, mais ce raisonnement ne tient pas compte du fait que le crit\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le \u00e9tabli par le Parlement est nettement ax\u00e9 sur les droits de vote d\u00e9coulant de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le \u00ab droit aux dividendes \u00bb est donc sans aucune pertinence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En fait, il n\u2019est pas rare qu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mette des actions sans d\u00e9clarer de dividendes. Le seul droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui importe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le droit de vote \u2014 ce que la convention d\u2019investissement n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9.\n[192] Mais si l\u2019on met cette question de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour l\u2019instant, l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence dans l\u2019argument de mon coll\u00e8gue r\u00e9v\u00e8le jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point le pouvoir de voter est pertinent pour l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Mon coll\u00e8gue conclut que la perspective que Newco trouve un autre acheteur \u00e9tait \u00ab illusoire \u00bb, tout en affirmant que sa conclusion \u00ab cadre avec le parcours sinueux emprunt\u00e9 par les op\u00e9rations pour contourner le par. 111(5) \u00bb (par. 139). Si la question de savoir si Newco avait le droit de conserver ses actions n\u2019est pas pertinente, en quoi le fait que ce droit \u00e9tait \u00ab illusoire \u00bb est-il important? De toute \u00e9vidence, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des actions est un facteur \u00ab d\u00e9cisi[f] \u00bb dans l\u2019analyse de mon coll\u00e8gue (par. 121).\n[193] En derni\u00e8re analyse et avec \u00e9gards, l\u2019argument de mon coll\u00e8gue constitue une tentative d\u2019\u00e9valuer \u00e0 nouveau la preuve examin\u00e9e par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. La question de savoir si Newco a conserv\u00e9 le droit de ne pas vendre les actions restantes est une question mixte de fait et de droit. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a jug\u00e9 que le droit de Newco de conserver ses actions \u00e9tait bona fide, et ne constituait pas un trompe\u2011l\u2019\u0153il. Donner une nouvelle caract\u00e9risation \u00e0 ce droit pour appuyer l\u2019id\u00e9e que Newco et Deans Knight entendaient abuser du par. 111(5) va manifestement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la conclusion de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Vu que mon coll\u00e8gue n\u2019a soulign\u00e9 aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a faite de la preuve, sa conclusion suppose d\u2019infirmer une conclusion factuelle fondamentale tir\u00e9e par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[194] Mon coll\u00e8gue d\u00e9fend son approche en affirmant que la conclusion de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est vici\u00e9e par sa caract\u00e9risation erron\u00e9e de l\u2019objet et de l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5). Il semble sugg\u00e9rer que l\u2019on peut \u00e9carter la conclusion factuelle tir\u00e9e par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle est uniquement pertinente pour la question pr\u00e9cise de savoir si Matco avait acquis le contr\u00f4le de la majorit\u00e9 des actions votantes de l\u2019appelante. Or, ce n\u2019est tout simplement pas le cas : la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a \u00ab reten[u] le t\u00e9moignage de M. Goold selon lequel Newco estimait avoir le choix d\u2019accepter ou non l\u2019offre de Matco \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des actions restantes \u00bb (par. 164). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une conclusion pr\u00e9cise en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019appelante est demeur\u00e9e libre de ses agissements tout au long des op\u00e9rations. Contrairement \u00e0 mon coll\u00e8gue, je ne vois donc pas en quoi l\u2019erreur qu\u2019aurait commise la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans sa caract\u00e9risation du par. 111(5) a vici\u00e9 cette importante conclusion en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[195] M\u00eame si ma caract\u00e9risation de l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit du par. 111(5) \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e et que celui\u2011ci consistait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 \u00ab emp\u00eacher que des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soient acquises par des parties non li\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9duire les pertes inutilis\u00e9es de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du revenu d\u2019une autre entreprise au profit de nouveaux actionnaires \u00bb (motifs du juge Rowe, par. 113), le pourvoi devrait tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre accueilli.\n[196] Selon moi, Matco n\u2019a pas vraiment \u00ab acquis \u00bb Deans Knight au sens pratique du terme. Les observations du ministre \u00e9taient surtout ax\u00e9es sur Matco, et la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une facilitatrice des op\u00e9rations (par. 152). De l\u2019avis de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, il n\u2019y a eu ni \u00e9change ni transfert de pertes autres qu\u2019en capital. Matco ne s\u2019est pas servi des pertes autres qu\u2019en capital de Deans Knight \u00e0 son propre avantage (par. 152). Les actionnaires apr\u00e8s le PAPE sont les seuls \u00e0 avoir directement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des avantages de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Au mieux, on pourrait pr\u00e9tendre que la convention d\u2019investissement a \u00ab neutralis\u00e9 \u00bb Deans Knight afin que Matco puisse la commercialiser en vue d\u2019une acquisition ult\u00e9rieure. On doit cependant faire toute une gymnastique mentale pour inf\u00e9rer que Matco \u00ab a acquis \u00bb Deans Knight. Pareille gymnastique cr\u00e9erait de l\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 ce qui constitue v\u00e9ritablement une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement abusive : \u00e0 quel moment le fait de \u00ab pren[dre] les r\u00eanes \u00bb d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 donne\u2011t\u2011il lieu \u00e0 son acquisition (motifs du juge Rowe, par. 118)? M\u00eame en adh\u00e9rant au raisonnement de mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00e9vitement fiscal abusif est au mieux incertaine. Dans de telles circonstances, \u00ab il faut laisser le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute au contribuable \u00bb (Trustco Canada, par. 66).\n[197] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis que les op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement n\u2019ont pas contrecarr\u00e9 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre du par. 111(5). Il n\u2019y a donc pas eu d\u2019abus et, par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour canadienne de

Essentiellement, le trait\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit que les demandeurs d\u2019asile doivent, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, demander protection dans celui des deux pays o\u00f9 ils sont entr\u00e9s en premier apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 leur pays d\u2019origine. L\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs est mise en \u0153uvre en droit interne canadien au moyen de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (\u00ab LIPR \u00bb) et son r\u00e8glement (\u00ab RIPR \u00bb). Aux termes de l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR , une demande d\u2019asile est irrecevable au Canada si le demandeur provient d\u2019un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le RIPR. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 102(1) a) de la LIPR pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un pays peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 uniquement s\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il se conforme \u00e0 ses obligations de non\u2011refoulement en droit international, qui interdisent le renvoi direct ou indirect d\u2019une personne vers un endroit o\u00f9 elle subirait certains types de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, notamment des menaces \u00e0 sa vie ou \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9, des actes de torture et des traitements cruels ou d\u00e9gradants. Le paragraphe 102(2) \u00e9num\u00e8re les facteurs dont le gouverneur en conseil doit tenir compte en vue de la d\u00e9signation des pays, et le par. 102(3) cr\u00e9e l\u2019obligation pour celui\u2011ci d\u2019assurer le suivi de l\u2019examen de ces facteurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacun des pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR.\nPlusieurs personnes sont arriv\u00e9es des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour demander l\u2019asile au Canada. Leurs demandes \u00e9taient irrecevables par application de l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR. Toutefois, la plupart de ces personnes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, puisqu\u2019elles avaient obtenu un sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du renvoi ou un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire. L\u2019une d\u2019entre elles a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Cette derni\u00e8re affirme que les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines l\u2019ont plac\u00e9e en isolement cellulaire pendant une semaine en attendant les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test de tuberculose, puis d\u00e9tenue pendant trois autres semaines dans un \u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 il faisait anormalement froid, o\u00f9 des individus reconnus coupables d\u2019infractions criminelles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et o\u00f9 ses restrictions alimentaires religieuses n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es.\nLes personnes dont les demandes \u00e9taient irrecevables, ainsi que des plaideurs agissant dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (collectivement, les \u00ab demandeurs \u00bb), ont contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR au motif que la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u00e9bordait le cadre des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la LIPR en raison des contraintes post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la prise de ce r\u00e8glement qui restreignent le pouvoir que la loi conf\u00e8re au gouverneur en conseil de maintenir une d\u00e9signation. Elles soutenaient \u00e9galement que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR et l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR violaient les droits garantis par les art. 7 et 15 de la Charte , affirmant que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif fait en sorte que les agents d\u2019immigration canadiens renvoient sommairement des demandeurs d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sans examiner si les droits qui sont reconnus \u00e0 ces demandeurs en droit international y seront respect\u00e9s, notamment ceux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention et au non\u2011refoulement.\nLa juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires du r\u00e8glement puisqu\u2019il faut d\u00e9terminer si un r\u00e8glement rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la loi sur la foi des faits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 celui\u2011ci est pris. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , elle a conclu que les violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en grande partie d\u00e9montr\u00e9es et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s graves, et que les atteintes \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne des demandeurs d\u2019asile d\u00e9coulaient du fait que ceux renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis faisaient face \u00e0 un risque de refoulement ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres pr\u00e9judices li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention d\u2019immigrants. Elle a conclu que l\u2019art. 7 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 et que cette violation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier, et a donc refus\u00e9 de se prononcer sur l\u2019argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019art. 15. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR inop\u00e9rants en application de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . La Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par les ministres, rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel incident du recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 et l\u2019argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires, et infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ces conclusions \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur le fait que les exigences de causalit\u00e9 relatives \u00e0 une demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas respect\u00e9es parce que les demandeurs visaient \u00e0 tort le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif plut\u00f4t que la conduite administrative.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli en partie.\nL\u2019article 159.3 du RIPR n\u2019est pas ultra vires, et il ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte . Toutefois, la contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte , sur laquelle n\u2019a statu\u00e9 aucune des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nL\u2019argument des demandeurs selon lequel l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR est ultra vires de la LIPR doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Les r\u00e8glements tirent leur validit\u00e9 de la loi qui conf\u00e8re le pouvoir de prendre des r\u00e8glements, et non de l\u2019organe ex\u00e9cutif qui les prend. Les limites impos\u00e9es par la loi habilitante sont donc fondamentales pour d\u00e9terminer si un r\u00e8glement est intra vires. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019al. 102(1) a) et le par. 102(2) de la LIPR mettent en place les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 la d\u00e9signation pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 101(1)e); ces conditions doivent \u00eatre remplies avant, et non apr\u00e8s, la d\u00e9signation du pays. Bien que le par. 102(3) cr\u00e9e l\u2019obligation pour le gouverneur en conseil d\u2019assurer le suivi de l\u2019examen des facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 102(2), ces examens ne visent pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le r\u00e8glement exc\u00e8de les limites impos\u00e9es par la loi. Les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3) d\u00e9bordent donc le cadre d\u2019une contestation all\u00e9guant que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR exc\u00e8de les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la LIPR , m\u00eame s\u2019ils peuvent bel et bien faire l\u2019objet d\u2019autres types de contestations sur la base des principes de droit administratif. La question de savoir si la disposition r\u00e9glementaire contest\u00e9e est intra vires de sa loi habilitante doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction du moment o\u00f9 le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris. Les r\u00e8glements jouissent d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption de validit\u00e9. Les demandeurs n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la date de prise du r\u00e8glement, la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 102(1) a) ou le par. 102(2) de la LIPR .\nLa contestation des demandeurs fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e. La d\u00e9signation de l\u2019art. 159.3 constitue le fondement l\u00e9gislatif des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 en cause et est donc susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le constitutionnel. Pour obtenir gain de cause, l\u2019auteur d\u2019un recours fond\u00e9 sur la Charte doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat et une violation du droit ou de la libert\u00e9 en cause; il faut d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 suffisant, ce qui n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat soit l\u2019unique ou la principale cause du pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur. Par cons\u00e9quent, le simple fait que d\u2019autres types d\u2019actes de l\u2019\u00c9tat puissent aussi avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec les pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ne signifie pas qu\u2019une contestation visant une disposition l\u00e9gislative a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e. De plus, les contestations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement viser des dispositions qui auraient pu servir \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ou \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier lorsque la disposition d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle ces autres dispositions se rapportent est une cause du pr\u00e9judice. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte vise une disposition d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif aux composantes interreli\u00e9es, il faut tenir compte des \u00e9ventuelles r\u00e9percussions des dispositions connexes, y compris les mesures pr\u00e9ventives ou curatives. Les tribunaux doivent examiner les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en fonction de leur contexte l\u00e9gislatif global, ind\u00e9pendamment de la fa\u00e7on dont les parties formulent leur contestation d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les dispositions pr\u00e9ventives et les dispositions curatives sont toutes deux pertinentes de fa\u00e7ons diff\u00e9rentes en ce qui concerne le recours des demandeurs fond\u00e9 sur la Charte ; toutefois, ces derniers n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 viser ces dispositions en plus de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR pour former leur contestation.\nLes demandeurs pouvaient \u00e9galement contester l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR plut\u00f4t que la conduite administrative, comme les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3), et solliciter un jugement d\u00e9clarant cette disposition inop\u00e9rante pour cause d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 avec la Charte . Les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3) n\u2019ont pas de fonction curative, car ils ne donnent pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration individuelle apr\u00e8s le fait. Ils se distinguent \u00e9galement des mesures pr\u00e9ventives cibl\u00e9es, qui emp\u00eachent l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, souvent au moyen d\u2019exceptions l\u00e9gislatives. Bien que la conduite administrative ayant men\u00e9 au maintien de la d\u00e9signation puisse \u00e9galement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation constitutionnelle en soi, l\u2019existence de cet autre recours ne saurait mettre l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . Par ailleurs, m\u00eame si les demandeurs auraient pu contester les d\u00e9cisions administratives portant sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des exceptions ou sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer des exemptions, cela ne les emp\u00eache pas de contester l\u2019art. 159.3.\nIl ressort clairement de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 que l\u2019art. 159.3 met en cause la libert\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. L\u2019examen des incidences constitutionnelles des effets qui se concr\u00e9tisent dans d\u2019autres pays ne revient pas \u00e0 appliquer la Charte \u00e0 des gouvernements \u00e9trangers. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la contestation porte sur le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, lequel constitue indubitablement un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat qui peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . L\u2019existence d\u2019un effet all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime est une question de fait, pour laquelle la norme de contr\u00f4le est celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, tandis que la port\u00e9e d\u2019un droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 est une question de droit, pour laquelle la norme de contr\u00f4le est celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Bien que la preuve n\u2019appuie pas la conclusion de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle les personnes qui rentrent aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis y sont automatiquement d\u00e9tenues, le risque de d\u00e9tention lors du retour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ainsi que trois aspects des conditions de d\u00e9tention constat\u00e9s par la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u2014 le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical, les temp\u00e9ratures anormalement froides et les lacunes dans les soins m\u00e9dicaux \u2014, rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application du droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. De plus, consid\u00e9rant la th\u00e8se des demandeurs sur la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7 sous son jour le plus favorable, il y a lieu de tenir pour acquis que les effets suivants se produisent et entrent dans le champ d\u2019application des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 : le non\u2011respect d\u2019un r\u00e9gime alimentaire religieux, la d\u00e9tention dans un \u00e9tablissement h\u00e9bergeant des personnes condamn\u00e9es pour des infractions criminelles et les risques de refoulement d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an et de l\u2019approche des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis quant aux demandes fond\u00e9es sur le genre.\nPour d\u00e9montrer que les droits garantis \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 sont en jeu, l\u2019auteur de la contestation doit non seulement d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019effets relevant du champ d\u2019application des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7, mais il doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que ces effets sont caus\u00e9s par un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien. Comme le Canada n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de dicter aux autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res comment agir, pour qu\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019atteinte a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019auteur de la contestation r\u00e9ussira \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien \u00e0 tout le moins dans les cas o\u00f9 la participation du Canada est un pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte. En outre, puisque le Canada ne peut pr\u00e9voir toutes les mesures que prendront les autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res, il faut \u00e9tablir que les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes savaient, ou auraient d\u00fb savoir, que des pr\u00e9judices pouvaient d\u00e9couler des actes du Canada. Ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par d\u00e9duction raisonnable, suivant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Il doit y avoir un lien suffisant eu \u00e9gard au contexte consid\u00e9r\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est clair que l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien en cause \u2014 l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR ainsi que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2014 constitue une condition pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 chacun des effets prouv\u00e9s ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention et au refoulement. Sans le r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs, les individus pourraient pr\u00e9senter leur demande d\u2019asile au Canada; au lieu de cela, ils sont renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis par des fonctionnaires canadiens agissant en vertu des pouvoirs qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi, o\u00f9 ils font face (ou sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faire face) \u00e0 de tels effets. Toutefois, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur lors de son application de la norme de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Suresh c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2002 CSC 1, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 3, et expliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bedford, 2013 CSC 72, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 1101. En ce qui concerne les temp\u00e9ratures froides dans les \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention, les lacunes dans les soins m\u00e9dicaux, la d\u00e9tention en compagnie d\u2019individus reconnus coupables d\u2019infractions criminelles et le non\u2011respect de restrictions alimentaires religieuses, le dossier ne permet pas de conclure que ces effets \u00e9taient une cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9visible des actes du Canada. En revanche, le dossier confirme que les autres effets n\u00e9gatifs \u00e9taient parfaitement pr\u00e9visibles, tels que le risque de d\u00e9tention, l\u2019\u00ab interdiction d\u2019un an \u00bb, le traitement des demandes d\u2019asile fond\u00e9es sur le genre et la pratique r\u00e9pandue du recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical. Ces violations du droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne ont un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien, et doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es en fonction des principes de justice fondamentale.\nLes principes de justice fondamentale applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont ceux se rapportant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e excessive et au caract\u00e8re totalement disproportionn\u00e9, tels qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford. Le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb peut fort bien \u00eatre utile pour l\u2019examen de d\u00e9cisions individualis\u00e9es, mais il n\u2019est pas utile pour les contestations de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives fond\u00e9es sur la Charte ; il ne convient donc pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Pour d\u00e9terminer si une disposition l\u00e9gislative viole les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford, les tribunaux doivent \u00e9tablir l\u2019objet de la disposition et ensuite se demander si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cet objet, la disposition l\u00e9gislative enfreint un des principes pertinents. Lorsqu\u2019un objectif l\u00e9gislatif est en cause dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7, l\u2019accent est mis sur l\u2019objet des dispositions contest\u00e9es, bien que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral puisse donner des indices au sujet de l\u2019objet des dispositions particuli\u00e8res en question. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des objectifs de la LIPR , le texte, le contexte et l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, de m\u00eame que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques, tendent \u00e0 indiquer que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR a pour objet le partage avec les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner \u00e9quitablement les demandes d\u2019asile, conform\u00e9ment au principe du non\u2011refoulement. C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cet objectif que les atteintes aux droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 dont il est question \u2014 le risque de d\u00e9tention discr\u00e9tionnaire et d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical, ainsi que les risques pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de refoulement \u2014 doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a port\u00e9e excessive et disproportion totale.\nLe r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif contest\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive et n\u2019est pas totalement disproportionn\u00e9. En ce qui concerne la port\u00e9e excessive, la question est de savoir si le r\u00e9gime s\u2019applique si largement qu\u2019il vise certains actes qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec son objet. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de savoir si le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi le moyen le moins restrictif, mais de savoir si le moyen choisi porte atteinte \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019a aucun lien avec le mal qu\u2019avait \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le l\u00e9gislateur. Le risque de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, laquelle est assortie de possibilit\u00e9s de mise en libert\u00e9 et de contr\u00f4le, est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif. Le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile avec un autre \u00c9tat exposera n\u00e9cessairement les personnes renvoy\u00e9es \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime juridique \u00e9tranger qui encadre la pr\u00e9sence des demandeurs d\u2019asile dans ce pays. Un certain degr\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rence entre les r\u00e9gimes juridiques applicables dans les deux pays peut \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 condition que le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain ne soit pas fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable. Bien que le dossier indique que les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis risquent d\u2019y \u00eatre d\u00e9tenues, il r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi l\u2019existence de m\u00e9canismes qui leur offrent la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre remises en libert\u00e9 et de faire contr\u00f4ler les motifs de leur d\u00e9tention par des d\u00e9cideurs administratifs et des tribunaux. Rien ne permet d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que ces mesures sont fondamentalement in\u00e9quitables, et par cons\u00e9quent, le risque de d\u00e9tention auquel sont expos\u00e9es les personnes \u00e0 leur retour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive. De m\u00eame, le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical en vue de limiter les risques pour la sant\u00e9 publique n\u2019est pas fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable. Les demandeurs ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettraient d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 tort dans le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain de d\u00e9tention en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration. En ce qui concerne la disproportion totale, la question est de savoir si les effets des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es sur les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7 sont si totalement disproportionn\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs objectifs qu\u2019ils ne peuvent avoir d\u2019assise rationnelle. Ni un risque de d\u00e9tention assortie de possibilit\u00e9s de mise en libert\u00e9 et de contr\u00f4le ni un risque d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical ne satisfont \u00e0 ce seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9. Au Canada, comme aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ces risques font partie des normes mutuellement accept\u00e9es par nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s libres et d\u00e9mocratiques.\nUne disposition exigeant le renvoi de personnes vers un pays o\u00f9 elles seront expos\u00e9es \u00e0 un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement aurait toutefois une port\u00e9e excessive, car elle n\u2019aurait aucun lien avec l\u2019objet des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es, qui reposent essentiellement sur le respect du principe du non\u2011refoulement. De m\u00eame, une telle disposition serait totalement disproportionn\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle exposerait, par d\u00e9finition, les personnes \u00e0 des menaces \u00e0 leur vie ou \u00e0 leur libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la torture ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres violations des droits fondamentaux de la personne. Toutefois, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne prescrivent pas simplement le renvoi : il existe aussi des dispositions curatives connexes qui doivent \u00eatre prises en compte dans l\u2019analyse, notamment le report administratif des mesures de renvoi (LIPR , par. 48(2) ), les permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire (art. 24), les exemptions pour motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire (par. 25.1(1)) et les exceptions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (par. 25.2(1)). Lorsque le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif contest\u00e9 comprend des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la question est de savoir si ces m\u00e9canismes \u2014 d\u00fbment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s et appliqu\u00e9s \u2014 suffisent pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019absence de toute atteinte contraire aux principes de justice fondamentale. Lorsque les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la LIPR s\u2019appliquent, les demandeurs d\u2019asile peuvent \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un renvoi. S\u2019ils ne sont pas renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ils ne sont pas expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un risque de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 peuvent donc servir \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce qui pourrait par ailleurs constituer des effets inconstitutionnels. En outre, ces m\u00e9canismes sont \u00e0 juste titre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie de l\u2019\u00e9tape portant sur les principes de justice fondamentale de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, parce qu\u2019ils peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s en vue de corriger l\u2019atteinte pr\u00e9cise en cause, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le risque de refoulement. Correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, ces m\u00e9canismes dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont suffisants pour faire en sorte que les personnes ne soient pas expos\u00e9es \u00e0 des risques r\u00e9els et non sp\u00e9culatifs de refoulement, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels risques existent. Ces m\u00e9canismes doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s en fonction du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que garantit l\u2019article 6 de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs au Canada pour examiner des demandes d\u2019asile s\u2019il juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire. Le simple fait que les m\u00e9canismes soient ant\u00e9rieurs au trait\u00e9 ne fait pas \u00e9chec \u00e0 leur pertinence; lorsque l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e, le droit interne canadien comprenait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des dispositions pouvant faciliter l\u2019examen individualis\u00e9 de la situation des demandeurs d\u2019asile. Donc, m\u00eame en tenant pour acquis que les demandeurs d\u2019asile font face \u00e0 des risques r\u00e9els et non sp\u00e9culatifs de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien pr\u00e9voit des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui les prot\u00e8gent contre de tels risques. Pour cette raison, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif mettant en \u0153uvre l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive et n\u2019est pas totalement disproportionn\u00e9, et est donc conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entreprendre une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier.\nLa contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour qu\u2019elle statue sur celle\u2011ci. Ce recours repose sur l\u2019argument que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif porte pr\u00e9judice aux femmes qui craignent d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es en raison de leur genre. Compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire, de la taille et de la complexit\u00e9 du dossier et des affidavits contradictoires, il serait imprudent de la part de la Cour de statuer sur une revendication de droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 comme le ferait un tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, ce qui laisserait sans voie d\u2019appel la partie qui n\u2019a pas gain de cause. Bien que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne peut se voir reprocher d\u2019avoir fait preuve de retenue judiciaire et de ne pas avoir statu\u00e9 sur le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de renvoyer ces questions a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 de fausses \u00e9conomies. Le principe de politique judiciaire qui dicte la retenue dans le cadre d\u2019affaires constitutionnelles est avis\u00e9, mais doit \u00eatre mis en balance avec d\u2019autres facteurs, comme la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019interjeter appel et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties. Les demandes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 15 ne sont pas des questions secondaires devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es une fois toutes les autres questions examin\u00e9es. La Charte ne devrait pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme si elle \u00e9tablissait une hi\u00e9rarchie des droits dans laquelle l\u2019art. 15 occupe un rang inf\u00e9rieur.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eats appliqu\u00e9s : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Le Canada et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont parties \u00e0 un trait\u00e9 bilat\u00e9ral qui vise \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le partage entre eux de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9. Essentiellement, le trait\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit que les demandeurs d\u2019asile doivent, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, demander cette protection dans celui des deux pays o\u00f9 ils sont entr\u00e9s en premier apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 leur pays d\u2019origine. L\u2019Accord entre le gouvernement du Canada et le gouvernement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique pour la coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen des demandes de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des ressortissants de pays tiers, R.T. Can. 2004 no 2, est connu sous le nom d\u2019\u00ab Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs \u00bb. Le pr\u00e9ambule du trait\u00e9 mentionne la reconnaissance mutuelle que les deux pays offrent des syst\u00e8mes g\u00e9n\u00e9reux de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, de sorte que les demandeurs peuvent obtenir une protection efficace dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre pays. Le partage de responsabilit\u00e9 est donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme justifi\u00e9, m\u00eame si les lois de chaque pays diff\u00e8rent.\n[2] L\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs est mise en \u0153uvre en droit interne canadien au moyen de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s , L.C. 2001, c. 27 (\u00ab LIPR \u00bb), et ses r\u00e8glements. Aux termes de l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR , une demande d\u2019asile est irrecevable au Canada si le demandeur provient d\u2019un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par r\u00e8glement. Un pays peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 uniquement s\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il se conforme \u00e0 ses obligations de \u00ab non\u2011refoulement \u00bb en droit international. Ces obligations \u2014 qui interdisent le renvoi direct ou indirect d\u2019une personne vers un endroit o\u00f9 elle subirait certains types de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, notamment des menaces \u00e0 sa vie ou \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9, des actes de torture et des traitements cruels ou d\u00e9gradants \u2014 sont la pierre angulaire du r\u00e9gime international de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (voir, pour un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 en langage simple, Nations Unies, Haut\u2011Commissariat aux droits de l\u2019homme, The principle of non\u2011refoulement under international human rights law, 5 juillet 2018 (en ligne)). Un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 est donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un tiers pays s\u00fbr en ce qu\u2019il est per\u00e7u comme un partenaire convenable avec lequel le Canada peut partager la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9. Les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 159.3 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, DORS\/2002\u2011227 (\u00ab RIPR \u00bb). Il s\u2019agit du seul pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en droit canadien.\n[3] Les appelants contestent ce r\u00e9gime principalement au motif qu\u2019il viole les droits garantis par les art. 7 et 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Ils affirment que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives font en sorte que les agents d\u2019immigration canadiens renvoient sommairement des demandeurs d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sans examiner si les droits qui sont reconnus \u00e0 ces demandeurs en droit international y seront respect\u00e9s, notamment ceux li\u00e9s au non\u2011refoulement et \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention.\n[4] Certaines questions ne sont pas en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Premi\u00e8rement, personne ne conteste que les accords sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs peuvent, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00eatre compatibles avec le droit international (voir, p. ex., I. Atak et F. Cr\u00e9peau, \u00ab Asylum in the twenty\u2011first century : Trends and challenges \u00bb, dans A. Triandafyllidou, dir., Routledge Handbook of Immigration and Refugee Studies (2e \u00e9d. 2023), 358, p. 363). Deuxi\u00e8mement, les appelants ne contestent pas la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs elle\u2011m\u00eame. Troisi\u00e8mement, notre Cour n\u2019est pas charg\u00e9e d\u2019appr\u00e9cier le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des politiques canadiennes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration, une question que les tribunaux ne sont pas institutionnellement con\u00e7us pour \u00e9valuer, encore moins pour r\u00e9former. Quatri\u00e8mement, notre Cour n\u2019est pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre l\u2019\u00e9pineuse question des entr\u00e9es irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res au Canada via des passages frontaliers autres que les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre officiels (voir, p. ex., A. Macklin, \u00ab Citizenship, Non\u2011Citizenship and The Rule of Law \u00bb (2018), 69 R.D. U.N.\u2011B. 19, p. 35\u201137). Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi porte plut\u00f4t sur la question de savoir si le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien mettant en \u0153uvre l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, les dispositions pertinentes de la LIPR et du RIPR \u2014 sont conformes aux exigences du droit constitutionnel et administratif.\n[5] La facture des jugements rendus par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures sur les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte ne pourrait \u00eatre plus diff\u00e9rente. La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui a examin\u00e9 la preuve directement, a conclu que les violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de l\u2019art. 7 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en grande partie d\u00e9montr\u00e9es et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s graves. Les atteintes \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne des demandeurs d\u2019asile d\u00e9coulaient du fait que ceux renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis faisaient face \u00e0 un risque de refoulement ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres pr\u00e9judices li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention d\u2019immigrants. Au terme de son analyse, la juge \u00e9tait de l\u2019avis que l\u2019art. 7 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 et que cette violation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR inop\u00e9rants en vertu de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 .\n[6] En revanche, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e et a donc accueilli l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par le ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration et le ministre de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de la Protection civile. Malgr\u00e9 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants et les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les exigences de causalit\u00e9 relatives \u00e0 une demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas respect\u00e9es parce que les appelants visaient \u00e0 tort le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif plut\u00f4t que la conduite administrative. Avec \u00e9gards, je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec la Cour d\u2019appel et je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le point de vue \u2014 partag\u00e9 par les deux parties dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi \u2014 selon lequel le r\u00e8glement d\u00e9signant les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis faisait \u00e0 juste titre l\u2019objet de la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte . En particulier, comme la d\u00e9signation \u00e0 l\u2019art. 159.3 constitue le fondement l\u00e9gislatif des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 en cause, elle est donc susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le constitutionnel.\n[7] Par ailleurs, je partage l\u2019avis de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019elle conclut que les droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne des demandeurs d\u2019asile sont mis en jeu par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien qui rend leurs demandes irrecevables. En particulier, je rejette l\u2019id\u00e9e que les droits des demandeurs garantis par l\u2019art. 7 ne sont pas en jeu simplement parce que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pr\u00e9voient des mesures qui auraient pu en fin de compte offrir une protection. Cette id\u00e9e repose, \u00e0 mon avis, sur une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019arr\u00eat Febles c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2014 CSC 68, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 431, et elle est incompatible avec la d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e par notre Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019art. 7 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bedford, 2013 CSC 72, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 1101.\n[8] Les d\u00e9terminations factuelles qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9es la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet du traitement des demandeurs d\u2019asile sont pr\u00e9occupantes. Outre les d\u00e9terminations portant qu\u2019il y a \u00ab automatiquement \u00bb d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis et que les conditions de d\u00e9tention cr\u00e9ent un risque de refoulement, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les d\u00e9terminations de la juge \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es d\u2019erreurs r\u00e9visables. Bien que la juge n\u2019ait pas conclu que les politiques am\u00e9ricaines en mati\u00e8re d\u2019asile donnent lieu \u00e0 un risque de refoulement, je suis n\u00e9anmoins persuad\u00e9 que le dossier \u00e9tayait son opinion selon laquelle la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis met en jeu les droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte .\n[9] Une fois \u00e9tabli que ces droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Constitution sont en jeu, l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7 porte alors sur ce que l\u2019auteur Gerald Heckman, dans un article r\u00e9dig\u00e9 avant qu\u2019il soit nomm\u00e9 juge, appelle la [traduction] \u00ab question cl\u00e9 \u00bb dans la prise de d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s : celle de savoir si l\u2019atteinte port\u00e9e aux droits \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne est conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale (\u00ab Revisiting the Application of Section 7 of the Charter in Immigration and Refugee Protection \u00bb (2017), 68 R.D. U.N.\u2011B. 312, p. 356). Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il faut d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien [traduction] \u00ab a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ces droits fondamentaux dans le cadre d\u2019un processus \u00e9quitable et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re rationnellement li\u00e9e et proportionn\u00e9e aux objectifs des lois canadiennes sur l\u2019immigration \u00bb (ibid.). L\u2019objet de cet examen n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir si le droit d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis est le reflet de l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit canadien. L\u2019accent est plut\u00f4t mis sur l\u2019objet et les effets du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est particuli\u00e8rement important de savoir si la r\u00e8gle d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la loi est temp\u00e9r\u00e9e par des dispositions connexes qui pr\u00e9voient une r\u00e9paration en cas de violation de l\u2019art. 7. Comme l\u2019a jug\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 CSC 44, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 134, au sujet de ce qui est d\u00e9crit utilement comme des exemptions r\u00e9paratrices, les \u00ab soupape[s] \u00bb de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues dans la loi permettent de faire en sorte que les atteintes port\u00e9es aux droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7 ne sont pas arbitraires, que leurs effets ne sont pas totalement disproportionn\u00e9s ou que leur port\u00e9e n\u2019est pas excessive (par. 113).\n[10] De ce point de vue, et malgr\u00e9 les d\u00e9terminations factuelles de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale suivant lesquelles les droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 sont en jeu, la contestation de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR se solde en d\u00e9finitive par un \u00e9chec. La LIPR et le RIPR contiennent des exceptions, des exemptions et des obligations d\u2019examen qui r\u00e9pondent aux probl\u00e8mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 et au renvoi du Canada. Ces dispositions traduisent en droit canadien l\u2019id\u00e9e, exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 du trait\u00e9, selon laquelle chaque gouvernement devrait \u00eatre libre d\u2019examiner toute demande de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire. En particulier, m\u00eame lorsque l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 en vertu du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif causerait des atteintes \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne \u2014 comme l\u2019a conclu la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u2014, les exemptions discr\u00e9tionnaires pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif assurent le respect des principes de justice fondamentale. En somme, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif est con\u00e7u pour emp\u00eacher certaines violations des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 et, ce qui est important pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, elle r\u00e9siste au contr\u00f4le de sa constitutionnalit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce que des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative pr\u00e9voient des mesures curatives.\n[11] Bien que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait affirm\u00e9 que les garanties pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime \u00e9taient \u00ab illusoires \u00bb, son analyse ne tenait pas compte de toutes les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pertinentes. Cette omission \u00e9tait une erreur de droit qui l\u2019a men\u00e9e \u00e0 faire ind\u00fbment abstraction de la mani\u00e8re dont le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif permet au Canada d\u2019examiner les demandes de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 lorsque les principes de justice fondamentale l\u2019exigent, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de celles\u2011ci. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime en tout respect que la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale suivant laquelle la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour l\u2019application de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs violait l\u2019art. 7 ne saurait \u00eatre maintenue.\n[12] Il se peut fort bien qu\u2019en pratique, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs n\u2019interpr\u00e8tent ou n\u2019utilisent pas toujours les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatives de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. En pareil cas, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives elles\u2011m\u00eames restent valides, mais il demeure possible d\u2019obtenir une r\u00e9paration administrative ou une r\u00e9paration fond\u00e9e sur la Charte sur une base individuelle. Par exemple, la Charte peut interdire aux agents de l\u2019\u00c9tat de renvoyer des demandeurs d\u2019asile vers des endroits o\u00f9 ils seraient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 des situations qui choqueraient la conscience des Canadiens et des Canadiennes. Pourtant, bien que certains des appelants aient expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 l\u2019asile \u00e0 des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre canadiens, ils n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour de leur accorder une r\u00e9paration individualis\u00e9e. Ils concentrent plut\u00f4t leur contestation constitutionnelle uniquement sur les lacunes all\u00e9gu\u00e9es du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif lui\u2011m\u00eame en vue de faire d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rant l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR en vertu de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 .\n[13] Bien que je rejette \u00e0 la fois la contestation du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7 ainsi que les autres moyens des appelants, je suis n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi en partie. Je renvoie pour d\u00e9cision la contestation des appelants suivant laquelle certaines dispositions l\u00e9gislatives violent les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par la Charte , sur laquelle n\u2019a statu\u00e9 aucune des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures. Le recours des appelants fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 repose sur de graves all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les femmes victimes de pers\u00e9cution fond\u00e9e sur le genre et de violence sexuelle se voient souvent refuser le droit d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention relative au Statut des R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, R.T. Can. 1969 no 6 (\u00ab Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb). Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayant le recours des appelants fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 sont contest\u00e9s et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion factuelle sur laquelle nous pouvons nous appuyer dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Il serait imprudent de la part de notre Cour de statuer sur une revendication de droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 comme le ferait un tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, ce qui laisserait sans voie d\u2019appel la partie qui n\u2019a pas gain de cause.\nII. Les parties\n[14] Les appelants sont des demandeurs d\u2019asile individuels et des plaideurs agissant dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Les intim\u00e9s sont le ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration et le ministre de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de la Protection civile.\n[15] Chaque appelant individuel est arriv\u00e9 des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour demander l\u2019asile au Canada. Comme ils sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre, leurs demandes \u00e9taient irrecevables par application de l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR.\n[16] ABC et ses filles sont citoyennes du Salvador, o\u00f9 elles affirment qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient victimes de pers\u00e9cution en raison de leur genre et de violence sexuelle perp\u00e9tr\u00e9es par des gangs. En 2016, elles ont fui vers les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, o\u00f9 elles ont d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenues. Les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines les ont inform\u00e9es qu\u2019elles faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure de renvoi. ABC et ses filles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9es pour la dur\u00e9e de cette proc\u00e9dure. En 2017, ABC et ses filles sont arriv\u00e9es au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre de Fort Erie, en Ontario, pour pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile au Canada. Elles affirment qu\u2019un agent de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (\u00ab ASFC \u00bb) leur a conseill\u00e9 de retirer leurs demandes, car elles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es irrecevables au titre de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Elles ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retourner aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Environ six mois plus tard, ABC et ses filles ont de nouveau tent\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile. Le mari d\u2019ABC, dont la demande d\u2019asile au Canada \u00e9tait en instance, a engag\u00e9 un avocat en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC quant aux demandes d\u2019asile de sa femme et de ses filles. Lorsqu\u2019elle a effectivement tir\u00e9 cette conclusion, l\u2019ASFC a accept\u00e9 de reporter bri\u00e8vement le renvoi. L\u2019avocat a demand\u00e9 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire et a \u00e9galement obtenu un sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du renvoi, lequel demeure en vigueur pendant que le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est en instance.\n[17] Madame Mustefa est citoyenne de l\u2019\u00c9thiopie et membre du groupe ethnique des Oromos. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 11 ans, munie d\u2019un visa de visiteur, elle s\u2019est rendue seule aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis pour recevoir un traitement m\u00e9dical. Elle y est rest\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de ses \u00e9tudes secondaires. Madame Mustefa affirme que les actes d\u2019oppression contre les Oromos en \u00c9thiopie se sont intensifi\u00e9s vers la m\u00eame \u00e9poque. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas retourner en \u00c9thiopie, mais croyait qu\u2019une politique commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9e l\u2019\u00ab interdiction d\u2019un an \u00bb (en anglais, \u00ab one\u2011year bar \u00bb) l\u2019emp\u00eachait de demander l\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. En 2017, Mme Mustefa s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre de Saint\u2011Bernard\u2011de\u2011Lacolle, au Qu\u00e9bec, pour demander l\u2019asile au Canada. L\u2019ASFC a jug\u00e9 que sa demande \u00e9tait irrecevable. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, o\u00f9 elle affirme que les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines l\u2019ont plac\u00e9e en isolement cellulaire pendant une semaine en attendant les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test de tuberculose, puis d\u00e9tenue pendant trois autres semaines dans un \u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 il faisait anormalement froid, o\u00f9 des individus reconnus coupables d\u2019infractions criminelles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et o\u00f9 ses restrictions alimentaires religieuses n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es. Pendant sa d\u00e9tention, Mme Mustefa a pu communiquer avec sa famille et son avocat, et elle a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9e sous caution. Madame Mustefa a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9sidence permanente aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en 2021.\n[18] Madame Al Nahass et ses trois enfants sont citoyens de la Syrie. Elle et sa famille vivaient en Arabie saoudite, o\u00f9 son mari travaillait. En 2015, Mme Al Nahass s\u2019est rendue en Syrie pour recevoir un traitement m\u00e9dical. Elle affirme qu\u2019au cours de ce voyage, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e et attaqu\u00e9e et a re\u00e7u des menaces de violences sexuelles. La famille s\u2019est par la suite rendue aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Pendant ce s\u00e9jour, son mari a, dit-elle, perdu son emploi, ce qui compromettait la r\u00e9sidence de la famille en Arabie saoudite. Madame Al Nahass craignait de retourner en Syrie et a entam\u00e9 le processus d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Madame Al Nahass a expliqu\u00e9 que, pendant ces d\u00e9marches, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par ce qu\u2019elle percevait comme des manifestations publiques de haine \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des personnes de confession musulmane et d\u2019origine arabe ainsi que par les mesures prises par le pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Avec les membres de sa famille, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander l\u2019asile au Canada. Lorsqu\u2019ils l\u2019ont fait au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestre \u00e0 Saint\u2011Bernard\u2011de\u2011Lacolle, l\u2019ASFC a jug\u00e9 leurs demandes irrecevables. Madame Al Nahass a communiqu\u00e9 avec un avocat, qui a saisi la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019une requ\u00eate urgente en sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du renvoi. Un sursis provisoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. Avant la fin de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate en sursis, le ministre a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 des permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire aux membres de la famille. Ils ont depuis obtenu la r\u00e9sidence permanente pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire.\n[19] Les appelants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les affidavits de dix d\u00e9posants anonymes qui ne sont pas parties au diff\u00e9rend. Chacun d\u2019eux affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis apr\u00e8s que sa demande d\u2019asile eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e irrecevable au titre de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Les neuf d\u00e9posants qui ont r\u00e9pondu aux contre\u2011interrogatoires \u00e9crits ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 leur retour, ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus par les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. \u00c0 une exception pr\u00e8s, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative ou d\u2019une audience sur le cautionnement. Ils ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 l\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis avec l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat. L\u2019un des d\u00e9posants ne pouvait pas verser la caution fix\u00e9e pour sa lib\u00e9ration. Cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis apr\u00e8s avoir fait appel sans succ\u00e8s de la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable du juge de l\u2019immigration devant la Commission am\u00e9ricaine des appels en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration et, par la suite, devant la Cour d\u2019appel du deuxi\u00e8me circuit.\nIII. Juridictions inf\u00e9rieures\nA. Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 2020 CF 770, [2021] 1 R.C.F. 209 (la juge McDonald)\n[20] Les appelants ont contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR au motif que la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u00e9bordait le cadre des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la LIPR . Ils affirmaient \u00e9galement que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR et l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR violaient de fa\u00e7on injustifi\u00e9e les art. 7 et 15 de la Charte . La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires du r\u00e8glement, mais a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu violation injustifi\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 7. En raison de sa conclusion sur l\u2019art. 7, elle a refus\u00e9 de se prononcer sur le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15.\n[21] L\u2019argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 au motif que l\u2019arr\u00eat Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s c. Canada, 2008 CAF 229, [2009] 3 R.C.F. 136 (\u00ab CCR (2008) \u00bb), par. 57, statue qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9terminer si un r\u00e8glement rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la loi sur la foi des faits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 celui\u2011ci est pris.\n[22] La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la Charte s\u2019applique. Les atteintes qui sont le fait d\u2019acteurs \u00e9trangers sont toujours \u00ab assujetties \u00e0 la garantie relative au principe de justice fondamentale, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019il existe un lien causal suffisant entre la participation de notre gouvernement et l\u2019atteinte \u00bb (par. 100, citant Suresh c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2002 CSC 1, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 3; voir aussi les motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 93, citant Bedford, par. 58 et 75\u201176).\n[23] Selon la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le r\u00e9gime contest\u00e9 met en jeu la \u00ab libert\u00e9 \u00bb parce que \u00ab les demandeurs dont la demande d\u2019asile a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e irrecevable au titre de l\u2019[Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs] sont [. . .] imm\u00e9diatement et automatiquement emprisonn\u00e9s par les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00bb (par. 103). Il porte atteinte \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne en raison du risque de refoulement et des conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Elle a conclu qu\u2019il existait un risque \u00ab r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif \u00bb qu\u2019ABC e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 refoul\u00e9e des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sur la base \u00ab [d]es difficult\u00e9s v\u00e9cues par les personnes d\u00e9tenues pour pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile \u00bb, comme les obstacles emp\u00eachant celles\u2011ci d\u2019obtenir des conseils juridiques (par. 106). Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que certaines conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis mettent en jeu la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne car l\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 de telles conditions d\u00e9coule directement du renvoi par les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes des demandeurs aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis.\n[24] La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ces atteintes ne respectent pas les principes de justice fondamentale. Elle a conclu que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019argument selon lequel il existe des \u00ab garanties \u00bb de protection contre la port\u00e9e excessive et la disproportion totale, ces mesures \u00ab sont [. . .] largement hors de port\u00e9e et sont donc \u201cillusoires\u201d \u00bb (par. 129\u2011130, \u00e9tablissant une distinction d\u2019avec l\u2019affaire Tapambwa c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2019 CAF 34, [2020] 1 R.C.F. 700).\n[25] La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les violations de l\u2019art. 7 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas justifi\u00e9es au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte et a \u00ab d\u00e9clin[\u00e9] \u00bb d\u2019aborder les arguments fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019art. 15 (voir le par. 154, citant Carter c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 5, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 331, par. 93). Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR inop\u00e9rants en application de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et a suspendu la d\u00e9claration pour une p\u00e9riode de six mois.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 2021 CAF 72, [2021] 3 R.C.F. 294 (le juge en chef No\u00ebl et les juges Stratas et Laskin)\n[26] Le juge Stratas, r\u00e9digeant les motifs unanimes de la Cour d\u2019appel, a accueilli l\u2019appel des ministres, rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel incident du recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 et l\u2019argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires, infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et rejet\u00e9 les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[27] La cour a jug\u00e9 que le recours fond\u00e9 sur la Charte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il ne tenait pas compte de deux r\u00e8gles pratiques d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019exigence selon laquelle l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat doit \u00eatre la cause d\u2019une violation de la Charte (par. 57). La premi\u00e8re r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]es dispositions qui appartiennent \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal aux composantes interreli\u00e9es ne sauraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9es et contest\u00e9es isol\u00e9ment \u00bb, car \u00ab [d]\u2019autres dispositions connexes peuvent [. . .] \u00eatre la cause [de la violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la Charte ] ou servir \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir toute lacune ou \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier \u00bb (par. 58a), citant PHS). La seconde r\u00e8gle dispose que dans les cas o\u00f9 une violation des droits r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un acte \u2014 ou d\u2019une omission \u2014 administratif, c\u2019est sur ce dernier, et non sur la loi, que la contestation doit porter (par. 58b), citant Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2000 CSC 69, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 1120). La cour a conclu que les effets n\u00e9fastes, s\u2019il en est, des violations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es seraient imputables aux examens effectu\u00e9s par le gouvernement du Canada de la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, qui sont requis par le par. 102(3) de la LIPR , et \u00e0 la conduite administrative qui y est connexe. Ainsi, comme elle visait l\u2019al. 101(1)e) de la LIPR et l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR, la contestation n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e.\n[28] Bien qu\u2019elle ait accueilli l\u2019appel pour ce motif, la Cour d\u2019appel a abord\u00e9 certaines questions de fond li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. En premier lieu, elle a signal\u00e9 que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs renvoy\u00e9s sont \u00ab automatiquement emprisonn\u00e9s \u00bb (par. 138, voir aussi les par. 139\u2011140). En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, la cour a rejet\u00e9 la conclusion que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime \u00e9taient \u00ab illusoires \u00bb (par. 144). En troisi\u00e8me lieu, la cour a jug\u00e9 erron\u00e9e l\u2019analyse que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait faite concernant les conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis (par. 146). En quatri\u00e8me lieu, elle a aussi d\u00e9cel\u00e9 des erreurs dans son analyse des principes de justice fondamentale. Pour la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00ab rien ne d\u00e9montr[ait] que le traitement des personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis depuis la fronti\u00e8re canado\u2011am\u00e9ricaine \u201cchoque la conscience\u201d \u00bb (par. 161). Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la cour a estim\u00e9 que le r\u00e9gime n\u2019avait pas une port\u00e9e excessive ni d\u2019effets totalement disproportionn\u00e9s.\n[29] La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur le fond du recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15. Si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, la cour a \u00e9crit que \u00ab [d]ans les cas o\u00f9, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucune conclusion de fait n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces questions, il vaut mieux, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, renvoyer la question \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en raison de son expertise en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination des faits \u00bb (par. 173).\nIV. Questions en litige\n[30] Les appelants soul\u00e8vent trois questions : l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR est\u2011il ultra vires? L\u2019article 159.3 viole\u2011t\u2011il de fa\u00e7on injustifiable l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte ? Le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte devrait\u2011il \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou tranch\u00e9 par la Cour sur la base du dossier d\u2019appel?\nV. R\u00e9gime et contexte l\u00e9gislatifs et r\u00e9glementaires\n[31] Le r\u00e8glement en cause fait partie du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif qui met en \u0153uvre un trait\u00e9 bilat\u00e9ral entre le Canada et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, soit l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas lui\u2011m\u00eame contest\u00e9, ce trait\u00e9 guide l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de son r\u00e9gime de mise en \u0153uvre (voir National Corn Growers Assn. c. Canada (Tribunal des importations), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1324, p. 1371). Il est utile d\u2019examiner le trait\u00e9 et le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif successivement, car ils demeurent essentiellement distincts compte tenu du \u00ab syst\u00e8me dualiste \u00bb du Canada pour l\u2019application des instruments juridiques internationaux (Kazemi (Succession) c. R\u00e9publique islamique d\u2019Iran, 2014 CSC 62, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 176, par. 150 ; voir G. van Ert, Using International Law in Canadian Courts (2e \u00e9d. 2008), ch. 7). Un protocole additionnel au trait\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives le mettant en \u0153uvre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es depuis l\u2019audience (R\u00e8glement modifiant le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (examen de la recevabilit\u00e9 par l\u2019agent), DORS\/2023\u201158; Protocole additionnel \u00e0 l\u2019accord entre le Gouvernement du Canada et le Gouvernement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique pour la coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen des demandes de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des ressortissants de pays tiers, 24 mars 2023 (en ligne)). Je m\u2019abstiendrai de formuler des commentaires sur ces instruments car ils n\u2019ont pas d\u2019incidence directe sur le fond des questions en appel devant la Cour.\nA. Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs\n[32] Il y a environ 30 ans, le Canada et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ont entrepris la n\u00e9gociation d\u2019un accord visant le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 relative aux demandes d\u2019asile. Le Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, Amnistie internationale et le Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (\u00ab HCNUR \u00bb) sont au nombre des organisations dont les commentaires ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des modifications substantielles au projet d\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Les deux \u00c9tats ont sign\u00e9 cet accord en 2002.\n[33] Le pr\u00e9ambule de l\u2019accord reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment les obligations internationales des gouvernements envers les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (par. 1, 2 et 8). Il mentionne \u00e9galement la d\u00e9termination commune des parties \u00e0 garantir \u00e0 chaque demandeur admissible \u00ab l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00e9quitable et pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb (par. 8) et souligne que les deux pays offrent un r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9reux de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (par. 4). Le trait\u00e9 est accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une D\u00e9claration de principes relative \u00e0 sa mise en \u0153uvre, selon laquelle les parties s\u2019engagent \u00e0 respecter des principes qui comprennent les mesures de protection pour les demandeurs d\u2019asile, comme la possibilit\u00e9 pour ceux\u2011ci d\u2019\u00eatre accompagn\u00e9s d\u2019une tierce partie pendant les proc\u00e9dures (Questions de proc\u00e9dure relatives \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019Entente pour la coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des ressortissants de tiers pays : D\u00e9claration de principes, 30 ao\u00fbt 2002 (en ligne)).\n[34] L\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs est fond\u00e9e sur le principe selon lequel le \u00ab dernier pays de s\u00e9jour examine, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de son r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9, la demande de ce statut de toute personne arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 un point d\u2019entr\u00e9e d\u2019une fronti\u00e8re terrestre \u00bb (article 4(1)). Il s\u2019agit du [traduction] \u00ab c\u0153ur \u00bb du trait\u00e9 (A. Macklin, \u00ab Disappearing Refugees : Reflections on the Canada\u2011U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement \u00bb (2005), 36 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 365, p. 371) ou de son [traduction] \u00ab principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb (S. Baglay et M. Jones, Refugee Law (2e \u00e9d. 2017), p. 279). Le dernier pays de s\u00e9jour est \u00ab le pays, soit le Canada, soit les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, dans lequel le demandeur du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00e9tait physiquement pr\u00e9sent imm\u00e9diatement avant de faire sa demande du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00e0 un point d\u2019entr\u00e9e situ\u00e9 \u00e0 une fronti\u00e8re terrestre \u00bb (article 1(1)c)). Les parties ont convenu de revoir l\u2019accord et d\u2019inviter le HCNUR \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9vision (article 8(3)).\n[35] Bien que l\u2019article 4(1) \u00e9nonce un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le trait\u00e9 est d\u2019application restreinte. Pour commencer, les gouvernements ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de refoulement \u00ab indirect \u00bb ou \u00ab en cha\u00eene \u00bb. Ils ont convenu que les personnes retourn\u00e9es au Canada ou aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ne seraient pas renvoy\u00e9es de ce pays tant que celui\u2011ci n\u2019aurait pas statu\u00e9 sur leur demande de statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 (article 3). Ils n\u2019ont pas non plus cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019accord aux citoyens ou aux personnes ayant leur r\u00e9sidence habituelle dans l\u2019un des deux pays (article 2) et ils ont pr\u00e9vu des exceptions pour les mineurs non accompagn\u00e9s et le regroupement familial (article 4(2)).\n[36] Les parties ont convenu que, m\u00eame lorsque le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 4(1) serait applicable, il devrait \u00eatre possible d\u2019accorder une exemption aux demandeurs. L\u2019article 6 pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab l\u2019une des parties, ou l\u2019autre, peut, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, d\u00e9cider d\u2019examiner toute demande du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite si elle juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire \u00bb.\nB. Mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs en droit interne\n[37] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 101(1) e) de la LIPR met en \u0153uvre le principe fondamental de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs en d\u00e9clarant \u00ab irrecevable \u00bb la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne \u00ab arriv\u00e9e, directement ou indirectement, d\u2019un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par r\u00e8glement autre que celui dont [elle] a la nationalit\u00e9 ou dans lequel [elle] avait sa r\u00e9sidence habituelle \u00bb. Cette disposition met ainsi en \u0153uvre au pays le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 4(1) selon lequel le pays de derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une personne examinera sa demande d\u2019asile. Diverses autres r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9vues dans la LIPR et ses r\u00e8glements ont une incidence sur l\u2019application de cette \u00ab r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb, y compris (1) les m\u00e9canismes de d\u00e9signation et d\u2019examen; (2) les limites \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; et (3) les exemptions.\n(1) M\u00e9canismes de d\u00e9signation et d\u2019examen\n[38] La LIPR \u00e9nonce les crit\u00e8res pertinents servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un pays peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le gouverneur en conseil en vertu de l\u2019al. 101(1)e). Seuls les pays qui respectent les obligations de non\u2011refoulement que leur imposent les conventions internationales pertinentes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9s :\n102 (1) Les r\u00e8glements r\u00e9gissent l\u2019application des articles 100 et 101, [. . .] et, en vue du partage avec d\u2019autres pays de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile, pr\u00e9voient notamment :\na) la d\u00e9signation des pays qui se conforment \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Convention contre la torture;\n[39] Le paragraphe 102(2) \u00e9num\u00e8re les facteurs \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer si un pays se conforme aux normes de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par les Conventions :\n(2) Il est tenu compte des facteurs suivants en vue de la d\u00e9signation des pays :\na) le fait que ces pays sont parties \u00e0 la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e0 la Convention contre la torture;\nb) leurs politique et usages en ce qui touche la revendication du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et les obligations d\u00e9coulant de la Convention contre la torture;\nc) leurs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne;\nd) le fait qu\u2019ils sont ou non parties \u00e0 un accord avec le Canada concernant le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile.\n[40] Le gouverneur en conseil doit \u00ab assure[r] le suivi de l\u2019examen \u00bb des facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 102(2) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacun des pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9s (par. 102(3)). Les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont le seul pays qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 (R\u00e8glement modifiant le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, DORS\/2004\u2011217). L\u2019article 159.3 du RIPR, que les appelants contestent, dispose :\n159.3 Les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 102(1)a) de la Loi \u00e0 titre de pays qui se conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Convention contre la torture et sont un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 101(1)e) de la Loi.\n(2) Limites \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9\n[41] Diverses dispositions du RIPR restreignent l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 en faisant en sorte que les demandeurs d\u2019asile arrivant des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019y soient pas tous renvoy\u00e9s. Le r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit deux fa\u00e7ons pour ce faire. D\u2019abord, il renferme des restrictions qui reprennent essentiellement le libell\u00e9 des articles 2, 3 et 4 de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Par exemple, sous le r\u00e9gime dont il est question dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 101(1)e) ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux demandes des personnes qui arrivent \u00e0 des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e terrestres \u2014 et non ailleurs le long de la fronti\u00e8re terrestre, par bateau ou par avion (RIPR, art. 159.4). Il existe des exceptions sp\u00e9cifiques pour les personnes qui ont de la famille au Canada, afin de faciliter la r\u00e9unification des familles (al. 159.5a) \u00e0 d)). Comme le pr\u00e9voit le trait\u00e9, ces exceptions sont appliqu\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la conception de la famille en droit interne canadien (article 1(2); RIPR, art. 159.1). Il y a \u00e9galement des exceptions pour les mineurs non accompagn\u00e9s (al. 159.5e)) et pour les personnes ayant certains statuts d\u2019immigration au Canada (al. 159.5f) et g)). Enfin, le r\u00e8glement fait en sorte que certaines personnes dont la demande n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis puissent avoir acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me canadien (al. 159.5h)).\n[42] Ensuite, le r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit une exception qui illustre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Canada, pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019article 6 du trait\u00e9, selon lequel il peut examiner toute demande s\u2019il juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire (Baglay et Jones, p. 279). L\u2019article 159.6 du RIPR fait en sorte que les demandeurs d\u2019asile qui d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en accusation aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ou dans un autre pays pour une infraction qui pourrait leur valoir la peine de mort dans ce pays, ou qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables d\u2019une telle infraction, n\u2019y sont pas renvoy\u00e9s.\n(3) Exemptions de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9\n[43] Les personnes assujetties aux dispositions mettant en \u0153uvre l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs ne peuvent se pr\u00e9valoir de certains des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative dont disposent les demandeurs d\u2019asile dans diverses circonstances. Par exemple, les personnes renvoy\u00e9es ne sont pas admissibles \u00e0 un examen des risques avant renvoi (LIPR , al. 112(2) b)). En outre, la LIPR ne pr\u00e9voit pas de tribunal d\u2019appel administratif pour ces personnes; elles peuvent toutefois saisir la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (art. 72). Les juges peuvent accorder un sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la mesure de renvoi pendant que de telles proc\u00e9dures sont en cours (R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98\u2011106, r\u00e8gle 373; voir aussi Baglay et Jones, p. 354\u2011357).\n[44] La LIPR pr\u00e9voit toutefois des m\u00e9canismes permettant d\u2019exempter de fa\u00e7on temporaire ou permanente une personne d\u2019un renvoi vers les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis (voir, p. ex., H. Mayrand et A. Smith\u2011Gr\u00e9goire, \u00ab \u00c0 la crois\u00e9e du chemin Roxham et de la rh\u00e9torique politique : d\u00e9mystifier l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs \u00bb (2018), 48 R.D.U.S. 321, p. 342). Premi\u00e8rement, les agents peuvent accorder un report administratif de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la mesure de renvoi. Ce pouvoir d\u00e9coule du par. 48(2) de la LIPR , qui exige que les mesures de renvoi soient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es \u00ab d\u00e8s que possible \u00bb. Les tribunaux ont jug\u00e9 que cette disposition conf\u00e8re aux agents le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de reporter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une mesure de renvoi (voir, p. ex., Atawnah c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2016 CAF 144, [2017] 1 R.C.F. 153, par. 13\u201118; Revell c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2019 CAF 262, [2020] 2 R.C.F. 355, par. 50; Tapambwa, par. 87). Dans le cas qui nous occupe, ABC et ses filles ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un report administratif de leur renvoi, pendant lequel leur avocat a demand\u00e9 un sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la mesure de renvoi.\n[45] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les agents peuvent d\u00e9livrer un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire. Ce pouvoir d\u00e9coule de l\u2019art. 24 de la LIPR , qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019agent de d\u00e9livrer un permis \u00ab s\u2019il estime que les circonstances le justifient \u00bb. Le ministre ou son d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 peut \u00e9galement donner des instructions aux agents quant aux circonstances justifiant la d\u00e9livrance de tels permis (par. 24(3)). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les membres de la famille de Mme Al Nahass ont obtenu des permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire pendant que le ministre examinait l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de leur accorder des exemptions permanentes.\n[46] Troisi\u00e8mement, le ministre peut accorder une exemption fond\u00e9e sur des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire, comme ce fut le cas pour la famille de Mme Al Nahass. Le ministre peut exempter certains \u00e9trangers interdits de territoire de la totalit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une partie des exigences de la LIPR . Il peut accorder cette exemption s\u2019il estime que \u00ab des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre humanitaire relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger le justifient, compte tenu de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant directement touch\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 25.1(1)). Dans le cadre de cette analyse, l\u2019agent doit \u00ab dans un cas pr\u00e9cis, [. . .] examiner et [. . .] soupeser toutes les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre humanitaire pertinentes \u00bb (Kanthasamy c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CSC 61, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 909, par. 33 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[47] Quatri\u00e8mement, le ministre a \u00e9galement le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019exempter les \u00e9trangers qui sont interdits de territoire de la totalit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une partie des exigences de la LIPR . Il peut le faire s\u2019il \u00ab estime que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public le justifie \u00bb (par. 25.2(1)). Les intim\u00e9s font observer que cette disposition permet au ministre d\u2019adopter une politique publique temporaire exemptant les personnes qui font partie de certains groupes mentionn\u00e9s de l\u2019application de la disposition d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9.\n[48] Il peut \u00eatre sursis \u00e0 la mesure de renvoi visant un \u00e9tranger jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le ministre prenne sa d\u00e9cision sur les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux par. 25.1(1) ou 25.2(1) (RIPR, art. 233).\nVI. Questions de droit administratif\n[49] J\u2019en viens maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019argument des appelants selon lequel l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR est ultra vires en raison des contraintes post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la prise de ce r\u00e8glement qui restreignent le pouvoir que la loi conf\u00e8re au gouverneur en conseil de maintenir une d\u00e9signation. Les appelants affirment tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, compte tenu des facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 102 de la LIPR , de maintenir la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis alors qu\u2019il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve selon lesquels de nombreux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s ne peuvent y b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une protection efficace. Ils ajoutent que le gouverneur en conseil a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation que lui impose le par. 102(3) d\u2019assurer le suivi de l\u2019examen de la conformit\u00e9 des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis.\n[50] Je rejetterais ces arguments. Je suis d\u2019accord avec les intim\u00e9s pour dire que la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction du moment o\u00f9 le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris.\n[51] Les r\u00e8glements [traduction] \u00ab tirent leur validit\u00e9 de la loi qui conf\u00e8re le pouvoir, et non de l\u2019organe ex\u00e9cutif qui les prend \u00bb (Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals, [1943] R.C.S. 1, p. 13, le juge en chef Duff, citant The Zamora, [1916] 2 A.C. 77 (C.P.), p. 90). Les limites impos\u00e9es par la loi habilitante sont donc fondamentales pour d\u00e9terminer si un r\u00e8glement est intra vires (voir J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3e \u00e9d. 2021), p. 165).\n[52] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les appelants errent dans leur interpr\u00e9tation des limites qu\u2019impose l\u2019art. 102 de la LIPR . Le gouverneur en conseil peut prendre des r\u00e8glements concernant \u00ab la d\u00e9signation des pays qui se conforment \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Convention contre la torture \u00bb (al. 102(1)a)). La Loi prescrit \u00e9galement les facteurs dont le gouverneur en conseil doit tenir compte \u00ab en vue de la d\u00e9signation des pays \u00bb (par. 102(2)). Ces facteurs concernent les cas o\u00f9 un pays peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Ainsi, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 102(1)a) et le par. 102(2) mettent en place les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 la d\u00e9signation pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 101(1)e), comme l\u2019a jug\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CCR (2008) (par. 75). La Loi exige que ces conditions soient remplies avant, et non apr\u00e8s, la d\u00e9signation du pays (voir E. A. Driedger, \u00ab Subordinate Legislation \u00bb (1960), 38 R. du B. can. 1, p. 8).\n[53] Le gouverneur en conseil a toutefois certaines obligations d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative au cours de la p\u00e9riode suivant la d\u00e9signation d\u2019un pays conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 102(1)a). Le paragraphe 102(3) cr\u00e9e l\u2019obligation pour le gouverneur en conseil d\u2019\u00ab assure[r] le suivi de l\u2019examen des facteurs \u00bb \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 102(2). Ces examens ne visent pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le r\u00e8glement exc\u00e8de les limites impos\u00e9es par la Loi, une question qui devrait plut\u00f4t faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation de la validit\u00e9. En ce sens, les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3) d\u00e9bordent le cadre d\u2019une contestation all\u00e9guant que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR exc\u00e8de les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la LIPR . Le suivi de l\u2019examen constitue plut\u00f4t une obligation distincte que la loi impose au gouverneur en conseil. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est possible de contester les examens effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au par. 102(3) sur la base des principes de droit administratif (voir les motifs de la C.A., par. 96). Toutefois, les appelants n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019examens particuliers effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au par. 102(3) apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 159.3.\n[54] En consid\u00e9rant la date appropri\u00e9e et en reconnaissant que les examens effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au par. 102(3) sont exclus de la port\u00e9e d\u2019un argument relatif au caract\u00e8re ultra vires, je suis persuad\u00e9 que les appelants \u00e9chouent sur ce point. Comme l\u2019a statu\u00e9 notre Cour, \u00ab [l]es r\u00e8glements jouissent d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption de validit\u00e9 \u00bb (Katz Group Canada Inc. c. Ontario (Sant\u00e9 et Soins de longue dur\u00e9e), 2013 CSC 64, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 810, par. 25; voir aussi P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5e \u00e9d. 2021), par. 1314). Ainsi, pour que soit retenu leur argument selon lequel l\u2019art. 159.3 est incompatible avec les dispositions qu\u2019ils invoquent, les appelants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019\u00e0 la date de prise du r\u00e8glement, la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 102(1) a) ou le par. 102(2) de la LIPR . Comme ils font porter leur argumentation sur des faits survenus apr\u00e8s la prise du r\u00e8glement, les appelants n\u2019ont pas fait cette d\u00e9monstration. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument des appelants selon lequel l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR est ultra vires doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\n[55] Compte tenu de cette conclusion, il est inutile d\u2019aborder les autres aspects des moyens fond\u00e9s sur le droit administratif qu\u2019ont fait valoir les appelants, notamment en ce qui concerne la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable et la fa\u00e7on dont cette norme serait appliqu\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVII. Le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 7\n[56] Pour faire la preuve d\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , ceux qui contestent des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives doivent d\u2019abord d\u00e9montrer que celles\u2011ci portent atteinte \u00e0 leur droit \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Dans le cadre de cette analyse, il faut se demander si les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives mettent \u00ab en jeu \u00bb les droits en question, en ce sens qu\u2019elles entra\u00eenent une restriction, un effet pr\u00e9judiciable ou une atteinte \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci (Carter, par. 55; voir aussi Bedford, par. 57\u201158, 90 et 111). Le risque d\u2019une telle atteinte suffit (voir, p. ex., Carter, par. 62; R. c. Malmo\u2011Levine, 2003 CSC 74, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 571, par. 89; Suresh, par. 27). Ensuite, ceux qui font valoir une contestation doivent d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019atteinte n\u2019est pas conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale.\n[57] Les appelants affirment que les conclusions de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale reposaient sur la preuve, laquelle d\u00e9montre que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR cause des atteintes \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Selon eux, ces atteintes ne sont pas compatibles avec les principes de justice fondamentale applicables : la port\u00e9e excessive et la disproportion totale. Les appelants soutiennent que les r\u00e9parations discr\u00e9tionnaires ne peuvent garantir que les atteintes sont conformes aux principes de justice fondamentale et que, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ces mesures de protection sont illusoires.\n[58] Soit dit en tout respect, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs aux deux \u00e9tapes de son analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. Le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif met en jeu l\u2019art. 7 \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards qu\u2019elle a relev\u00e9s, mais pas tous. De plus, il est conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale.\nA. La constitution r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7\n[59] Les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR pouvait \u00e0 juste titre faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte . La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de cet avis : elle a conclu que le recours n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb viser d\u2019autres types d\u2019actes de l\u2019\u00c9tat qui sont la \u00ab v\u00e9ritable cause \u00bb des violations possibles. La cour a notamment conclu que les appelants auraient d\u00fb faire porter leur recours sur les examens administratifs exig\u00e9s par le par. 102(3) de la LIPR concernant la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ainsi que sur des actes administratifs connexes. \u00c0 mon humble avis, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur dans son application de la jurisprudence pertinente en mati\u00e8re de causalit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur la Charte .\n[60] Notre Cour reconna\u00eet depuis longtemps que, pour obtenir gain de cause, l\u2019auteur d\u2019un recours fond\u00e9 sur la Charte doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat et une violation du droit ou de la libert\u00e9 en cause (voir, p. ex., Operation Dismantle Inc. c. La Reine, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 441, p. 447, le juge Dickson, plus tard juge en chef). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford, notre Cour a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab lien de causalit\u00e9 suffisant \u00bb, ce qui n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00ab soit l\u2019unique ou la principale cause du pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur \u00bb (par. 76). Par cons\u00e9quent, le simple fait que d\u2019autres types d\u2019actes de l\u2019\u00c9tat puissent aussi avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec les pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ne signifie pas qu\u2019une contestation visant une disposition l\u00e9gislative \u2014 comme l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e.\n[61] La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 les contestations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte au motif qu\u2019elles ne respectaient pas deux principes qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de la jurisprudence de notre Cour en mati\u00e8re de causalit\u00e9. Premi\u00e8rement, la contestation de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ne peut \u00eatre faite en les isolant de mani\u00e8re artificielle. Deuxi\u00e8mement, lorsque les actes administratifs accomplis sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019une loi sont la cause d\u2019effets inconstitutionnels, la contestation doit viser cette action ou omission, et non pas la loi. Bien que ces deux affirmations traitent de consid\u00e9rations importantes, elles ne justifient pas, \u00e0 mon avis, la conclusion selon laquelle la contestation des appelants n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e.\n(1) La pertinence des mesures pr\u00e9ventives et curatives dans le cas d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7\n[62] Les dispositions d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif complexe dont les composantes sont interreli\u00e9es ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es isol\u00e9ment. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de ces dispositions ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e qu\u2019en tenant compte de l\u2019ensemble du r\u00e9gime, ce qui n\u2019a toutefois pas emp\u00each\u00e9 les appelants de cibler l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR.\n[63] Lorsqu\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte vise une disposition d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif aux composantes interreli\u00e9es, il faut tenir compte des \u00e9ventuelles r\u00e9percussions des dispositions connexes, y compris celles qui peuvent servir \u00e0 \u00ab pr\u00e9venir toute lacune ou \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 58a) (je souligne)). Le succ\u00e8s ou l\u2019\u00e9chec d\u2019un recours fond\u00e9 sur la Charte peut d\u00e9pendre d\u2019arguments ou d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 des dispositions pr\u00e9ventives ou curatives, mais cela devrait rarement emp\u00eacher le tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si le droit \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne garanti par l\u2019art. 7 est \u00ab en jeu \u00bb.\n[64] Il arrive fr\u00e9quemment que des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives fassent intervenir les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7. Cela d\u00e9coule parfois de dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui \u2014 prises isol\u00e9ment \u2014 auraient des r\u00e9percussions pertinentes sur le plan constitutionnel en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Toutefois, le l\u00e9gislateur peut inclure dans un r\u00e9gime des dispositions connexes qui att\u00e9nuent ces effets. Lorsque ces mesures font partie d\u2019un ensemble l\u00e9gislatif int\u00e9gr\u00e9, elles doivent \u00eatre prises en compte lors de la d\u00e9termination de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[65] Dans l\u2019affaire PHS, par exemple, notre Cour a examin\u00e9 les liens entre une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et les dispositions s\u2019y rattachant. L\u2019affaire portait notamment sur une interdiction l\u00e9gale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale visant la possession de substances d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, sauf dans les cas autoris\u00e9s par les r\u00e8glements. La loi habilitait le ministre \u00ab \u00e0 accorder des exemptions pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou scientifiques ou pour toute raison qu\u2019il juge d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de toute disposition de la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances , L.C. 1996, c. 19 (\u00ab LRCDAS \u00bb) (PHS, par. 39).\n[66] La Cour a conclu que les exemptions servaient \u00ab de soupape emp\u00eachant l\u2019application de [la loi] dans les cas o\u00f9 son application serait arbitraire, ses effets exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s ou sa port\u00e9e excessive \u00bb (PHS, par. 113). En d\u2019autres termes, lorsque le ministre exer\u00e7ait son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, ces dispositions rem\u00e9diaient \u00e0 l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 qu\u2019aurait entra\u00een\u00e9e l\u2019application de l\u2019interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 des personnes qui n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par celle\u2011ci : le personnel et les clients d\u2019un centre d\u2019injection supervis\u00e9e (par. 94 et 114).\n[67] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS pour affirmer que les dispositions connexes d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif peuvent \u00ab pr\u00e9venir \u00bb une inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 ou \u00ab y rem\u00e9dier \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 58a)). Les exemptions examin\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS \u00e9taient des mesures \u00ab curatives \u00bb en ce sens qu\u2019elles permettaient \u00e0 des personnes qui auraient autrement \u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00fbment assujetties \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un redressement discr\u00e9tionnaire. Autrement dit, l\u2019exemption rem\u00e9diait au pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9cis qui aurait d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[68] Les mesures curatives sont donc r\u00e9paratrices : elles rem\u00e9dient \u00e0 la violation que causerait l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en accordant une exemption s\u00e9lective apr\u00e8s le fait (voir PHS, par. 41). Ces mesures sont souvent associ\u00e9es \u00e0 des mesures pr\u00e9ventives afin de limiter la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Les mesures pr\u00e9ventives restreignent une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en emp\u00eachant son application en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019une violation, souvent au moyen d\u2019exceptions l\u00e9gislatives. Ces cat\u00e9gories ne sont ni \u00e9tanches ni exhaustives. De plus, si une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie habituellement d\u2019exemptions individualis\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le fait, la l\u00e9gislature pourrait adopter une exception qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019avance \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la cat\u00e9gorie.\n[69] Les contestations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement viser des dispositions pr\u00e9ventives et curatives lorsque la disposition d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle elles se rapportent est une cause du pr\u00e9judice all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS, les tribunaux doivent examiner les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en fonction de leur contexte l\u00e9gislatif global, ind\u00e9pendamment de la fa\u00e7on dont les parties formulent leur contestation du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019omission de tenir compte d\u2019une disposition connexe pertinente peut [traduction] \u00ab miner la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u00bb de l\u2019analyse constitutionnelle (R. c. Parker (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), par. 171, le juge Rosenberg).\n[70] Dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les mesures pr\u00e9ventives incluent par exemple l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 la peine de mort, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 159.6 du RIPR, et les diverses exceptions relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9unification des familles, pr\u00e9vues aux al. 159.5a) \u00e0 d). Parmi les mesures curatives, mentionnons la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 24, les exemptions accord\u00e9es pour motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire pr\u00e9vues au par. 25.1(1) et les exceptions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au par. 25.2(1).\n[71] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7, les dispositions pr\u00e9ventives peuvent moduler la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale si soigneusement qu\u2019elle ne menacera jamais les droits garantis \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. Par exemple, l\u2019art. 159.6 du RIPR \u00e9carte la menace \u00e0 la vie pouvant survenir pour les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis qui sont passibles de la peine de mort. Ce faisant, les dispositions pr\u00e9ventives comme l\u2019art. 159.6 excluent certaines situations o\u00f9 l\u2019art. 7 pourrait \u00eatre en jeu. En revanche, les dispositions curatives emp\u00eachent rarement, voire jamais, la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7. L\u2019arr\u00eat PHS appuie directement cette affirmation, puisque notre Cour y a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de possession de drogues faisait intervenir l\u2019art. 7, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Les dispositions curatives cr\u00e9ent des d\u00e9rogations exceptionnelles \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; on ne peut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement y avoir recours qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale s\u2019applique. La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une exemption est donc un moyen permettant dans certains cas d\u2019\u00e9viter les risques que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale fait peser sur la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. En pareil cas, la menace aux droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 persiste, mais elle ne se concr\u00e9tise pas toujours.\n[72] Certains ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de la disponibilit\u00e9 de mesures curatives, les droits que l\u2019art. 7 garantit aux demandeurs d\u2019asile ne sont pas en jeu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019exclusion ou de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9. Cette affirmation repose sur une d\u00e9claration faite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat B010 c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CSC 58, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 704, suivant laquelle c\u2019est \u00e0 cette \u00ab \u00e9tape subs\u00e9quente, l\u2019examen des risques avant renvoi, du processus d\u2019asile \u00e9tabli par la LIPR que l\u2019art. 7 entre habituellement en jeu \u00bb et non aux \u00e9tapes ant\u00e9rieures (par. 75). Cette observation formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat B010 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un passage de l\u2019arr\u00eat Febles, qui portait sur la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Charte d\u2019une disposition d\u2019exclusion dans la LIPR . Certains auteurs ont critiqu\u00e9 cette vision du r\u00f4le des m\u00e9canismes curatifs dans la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7, affirmant que les remarques incidentes formul\u00e9es dans ces arr\u00eats ne devraient pas faire d\u00e9vier l\u2019analyse de l\u2019approche suivie par notre Cour en ce qui concerne la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7 \u00e9tablie dans d\u2019autres contextes (voir Heckman, p. 313; C. Grey, \u00ab Thinkable : The Charter and Refugee Law after Appulonappa and B010 \u00bb (2016), 76 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111, p. 131\u2011135 et 139; voir aussi H. Stewart, Fundamental Justice : Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2e \u00e9d. 2019), p. 77\u201181 et 342).\n[73] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Febles, notre Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une disposition d\u2019exclusion \u00e9tait \u00ab compatible \u00bb avec l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte (par. 67). \u00c0 l\u2019instar des arr\u00eats Bedford et PHS, l\u2019arr\u00eat Febles ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme regroupant en une seule les \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 qui portent sur la mise en jeu de cet article et sur les principes de justice fondamentale. En ce qui concerne l\u2019arr\u00eat B010, je constate que notre Cour a ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une nouvelle audience dans cet appel selon les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative et a jug\u00e9 inutile d\u2019examiner la contestation des appelants fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7 (par. 74). Le bref commentaire suivant lequel ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019examen des risques avant renvoi que \u00ab l\u2019art. 7 entre habituellement en jeu \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait ni un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 formel du droit ni une remarque n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher l\u2019affaire (par. 75). Ces propos ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant modifi\u00e9 le droit \u00e9tabli en ce qui concerne la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7. Il est utile de rappeler que dans d\u2019autres contextes, comme celui de l\u2019extradition, l\u2019art. 7 \u00ab influe \u00bb sur l\u2019ensemble du processus et il \u00ab entre en jeu, bien que pour des fins distinctes \u00bb, \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape des proc\u00e9dures (\u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique c. Cobb, 2001 CSC 19, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 587, par. 34, la juge Arbour). Dans le contexte de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR , o\u00f9 les mesures curatives sont indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, il est donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de consid\u00e9rer que ces mesures se rapportent aux principes de justice fondamentale plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la question pr\u00e9liminaire de la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche suivie par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford (voir, p. ex., Heckman, p. 347\u2011356).\n[74] En ce qui concerne l\u2019analyse relative aux principes de justice fondamentale, le r\u00f4le des dispositions pr\u00e9ventives variera selon les principes en cause. Par exemple, la fa\u00e7on dont la loi est formul\u00e9e d\u00e9termine l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019application du r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et joue sans aucun doute un r\u00f4le lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e9gime a une port\u00e9e excessive.\n[75] Les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur l\u2019incidence des mesures curatives en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Conform\u00e9ment au raisonnement suivi par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS, les intim\u00e9s semblent consid\u00e9rer les mesures curatives \u2014 comme les exemptions pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire \u2014 comme \u00e9tant pertinentes pour d\u00e9terminer si les principes de justice fondamentale sont respect\u00e9s. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, les appelants soutiennent que l\u2019accent tr\u00e8s individualiste que l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford met sur la question de savoir si la disposition contest\u00e9e \u00ab prive qui que ce soit du droit \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne \u00bb a supplant\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS sur ce point (par. 123 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Ils affirment que les exemptions discr\u00e9tionnaires ne sont d\u00e9sormais prises en compte qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019article premier.\n[76] Je ne partage pas l\u2019avis des appelants. On peut d\u00fbment tenir compte des m\u00e9canismes curatifs pour d\u00e9terminer si une atteinte est conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu autrement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford. D\u2019ailleurs, les m\u00e9canismes curatifs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en cause dans l\u2019affaire Bedford, de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que notre Cour explique comment son approche interagissait avec son raisonnement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS. \u00c0 mon avis, les arr\u00eats Bedford et PHS sont compatibles. Les dispositions curatives ont pris une plus grande importance depuis que notre Cour a reconnu, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford, qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime qui est rationnel et non arbitraire dans presque toutes les situations peut n\u00e9anmoins violer l\u2019art. 7 s\u2019il est arbitraire, excessif ou totalement disproportionn\u00e9 pour une personne (par. 123). Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019\u00e9laboration par le l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019un r\u00e9gime qui rem\u00e9die \u00e0 d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles violations en pr\u00e9voyant des exemptions qui peuvent cibler les atteintes pr\u00e9cises est susceptible de rendre le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif conforme \u00e0 la Charte (voir D. Moore, \u00ab Engagement with Human Rights by Administrative Decision\u2011Makers : A Transformative Opportunity to Build a More Grassroots Human Rights Culture \u00bb (2017), 49 R.D. Ottawa 131, p. 150\u2011151; voir aussi PHS, par. 114). En ce sens, l\u2019objet de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 n\u2019est tout au plus [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s individualiste \u00bb que lorsque la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu de m\u00e9canismes permettant d\u2019individualiser les effets de la loi (Stewart (2019), p. 150; voir aussi C. Fehr, \u00ab Rethinking the Instrumental Rationality Principles of Fundamental Justice \u00bb (2020), 58 Alta. L. Rev. 133). Toutefois, comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS, le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019exemption doit tenir compte de l\u2019atteinte particuli\u00e8re qui fait l\u2019objet de la contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte .\n[77] Je souligne que la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de saisir les tribunaux f\u00e9d\u00e9raux d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire comme une soupape de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pertinente. Il est vrai que, selon le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, et la jurisprudence plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de notre Cour en mati\u00e8re de droit administratif, le contr\u00f4le judiciaire contribue \u00e0 faire en sorte que les autorit\u00e9s publiques respectent les param\u00e8tres \u00ab l\u00e9galement circonscrit[s] par la loi habilitante, la common law, le droit civil ou la Constitution \u00bb (Dunsmuir c. Nouveau\u2011Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 190, par. 28). Le contr\u00f4le judiciaire offre toutefois une r\u00e9paration diff\u00e9rente de celle que pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme l\u00e9gislatif qui pr\u00e9vient les lacunes pouvant d\u00e9couler de l\u2019application isol\u00e9e d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou y rem\u00e9die. Il en est ainsi parce que le l\u00e9gislateur ne peut jamais \u00ab soustraire le processus d\u00e9cisionnel administratif \u00e0 tout examen judiciaire \u00bb (Vavilov, par. 24). La possibilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de recourir au contr\u00f4le judiciaire ne peut donc sauvegarder des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives par ailleurs inconstitutionnelles. Pour cette raison, j\u2019estime inutile de consid\u00e9rer le contr\u00f4le judiciaire comme une sorte de \u00ab soupape de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb ou de mesure de protection d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative.\n[78] En somme, les dispositions pr\u00e9ventives et les dispositions curatives sont toutes deux pertinentes de fa\u00e7ons diff\u00e9rentes en ce qui concerne le recours des appelants fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a une violation de l\u2019art. 7, il faut tenir compte de l\u2019existence de tels m\u00e9canismes. Toutefois, les appelants n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 viser ces dispositions pour former leur contestation.\n(2) La pertinence des actes administratifs connexes dans le cadre d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7\n[79] Je passe maintenant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les appelants \u00e9taient tenus de cibler des actes administratifs plut\u00f4t que des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives. La Cour d\u2019appel a affirm\u00e9 que la contestation aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre ax\u00e9e sur \u00ab [l]es examens effectu\u00e9s en application du paragraphe 102(3) et [l]es actes administratifs connexes \u00bb, lesquels auraient pu mener \u00e0 la r\u00e9vocation de la d\u00e9signation des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sous le r\u00e9gime du RIPR (par. 61). Les appelants contestent cette conclusion en faisant valoir que peu importe l\u2019issue des examens effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au par. 102(3), [traduction] \u00ab il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que les r\u00e8gles de droit en vigueur (l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR) sont la cause des violations de la Charte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019elles peuvent donc r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte et d\u2019une r\u00e9paration au titre de l\u2019art. 52 [de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 ] \u00bb (m.a., par. 34).\n[80] Je conviens avec les appelants qu\u2019ils pouvaient contester l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR, plut\u00f4t que la conduite administrative, et solliciter un jugement d\u00e9clarant cette disposition inop\u00e9rante pour cause d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 avec la Charte . M\u00eame si d\u2019autres recours leur \u00e9taient peut\u2011\u00eatre ouverts \u2014 comme la contestation de la fa\u00e7on dont les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s, ou la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande de r\u00e9paration individuelle relativement \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions administratives d\u00e9favorables li\u00e9es aux m\u00e9canismes curatifs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 24 et aux par. 25.1(1), 25.2(1) ou 48(2) \u2014, les appelants n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenus d\u2019exercer ceux\u2011ci pour former r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement leur recours fond\u00e9 sur la Charte .\n[81] Afin de comprendre pourquoi les appelants n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenus de cibler les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3), il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner le r\u00f4le de ces derniers au sein du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif global. Les examens pr\u00e9vus au par. 102(3) ne sont pas des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dont il est question dans la jurisprudence relative aux art. 7 et 12 de la Charte , d\u00e9signent habituellement des exemptions discr\u00e9tionnaires ou d\u2019autres m\u00e9canismes curatifs, plut\u00f4t que des dispositions pr\u00e9ventives (voir, p. ex., PHS, par. 113; Chaoulli c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CSC 35, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 791, par. 224, les juges Binnie et LeBel, dissidents; R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130, par. 36, la juge en chef McLachlin). Les examens n\u2019ont pas de fonction curative, car ils ne donnent pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration individuelle apr\u00e8s le fait. Ils se distinguent \u00e9galement des mesures pr\u00e9ventives cibl\u00e9es, qui emp\u00eachent l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, souvent au moyen d\u2019exceptions l\u00e9gislatives.\n[82] Le paragraphe 102(3) de la LIPR exige que le gouverneur en conseil assure le suivi de l\u2019examen des facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 102(2), comme le bilan en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne d\u2019un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, les examens effectu\u00e9s se sont sold\u00e9s par le maintien de la d\u00e9signation, qui demeure le fondement l\u00e9gislatif \u00e0 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 des demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les appelants individuels. Bien que la conduite administrative ayant men\u00e9 au maintien de la d\u00e9signation puisse \u00e9galement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation constitutionnelle en soi, l\u2019existence de cet autre recours ne saurait mettre l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . Par ailleurs, m\u00eame si les appelants auraient aussi pu contester les d\u00e9cisions administratives portant sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des exceptions ou sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer des exemptions, cela ne les emp\u00eache pas de contester l\u2019art. 159.3.\nB. Mise en jeu des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7\n[83] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la contestation des appelants a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e. Je passe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de fond relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte . Bien que les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR met en jeu l\u2019art. 7, elles ne s\u2019entendent pas sur les d\u00e9tails de chacune des atteintes all\u00e9gu\u00e9es et leurs liens de causalit\u00e9 avec les actes de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien. Il ressort clairement de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu raison de dire que l\u2019art. 159.3 met en cause la libert\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, elle a commis une erreur dans son analyse de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\n[84] Les intim\u00e9s reconnaissent \u00e0 juste titre que l\u2019examen des incidences constitutionnelles des effets qui se concr\u00e9tisent dans d\u2019autres pays ne revient pas \u00e0 appliquer la Charte \u00e0 des gouvernements \u00e9trangers. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la contestation porte sur le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, lequel constitue indubitablement un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat qui peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . Il n\u2019y a pas lieu, dans le cadre de cette analyse, de d\u00e9terminer si les lois, les politiques ou les actes des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont eux\u2011m\u00eames conformes \u00e0 la Charte . Les tribunaux canadiens ne tiennent compte des atteintes \u00ab qui sont le fait d\u2019acteurs autres que le gouvernement canadien [que s\u2019il] existe un lien causal suffisant entre la participation de notre gouvernement et l\u2019atteinte qui survient en bout de ligne \u00bb (Suresh, par. 54). Le Canada ne peut \u00ab \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de son obligation de respecter les principes de justice fondamentale uniquement parce que l\u2019atteinte en cause serait le fait d\u2019autrui \u00bb (ibid.; voir aussi Canada c. Schmidt, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 500, p. 522; \u00c9tats\u2011Unis c. Burns, 2001 CSC 7, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 283, par. 59\u201160; Inde c. Badesha, 2017 CSC 44, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 127, par. 38). Toutefois, l\u2019analyse demeure ax\u00e9e sur le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien et ses effets.\n(1) Effets mettant en jeu des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7\n[85] Les arguments invoqu\u00e9s par les appelants au sujet de la libert\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne portent essentiellement sur la d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis et sur les risques que les demandeurs d\u2019asile soient refoul\u00e9s vers leur pays d\u2019origine apr\u00e8s leur retour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Ces arguments comportent \u00e0 la fois des aspects factuels et juridiques. L\u2019existence d\u2019un effet all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est une question de fait, tandis que la port\u00e9e d\u2019un droit garanti par l\u2019art. 7 est une question de droit. La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux questions de fait en appel est celle de \u00ab l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00bb (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 10; Bedford, par. 56; Carter, par. 109). La norme de contr\u00f4le pour les questions juridiques est celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Housen, par. 8).\na) D\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis\n[86] Les appelants soutiennent que toutes les personnes renvoy\u00e9es courent le risque d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9tenues aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Ils font valoir que ce risque est particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans le cas des personnes sans statut et que celles qui font l\u2019objet d\u2019une mesure de renvoi seront certainement d\u00e9tenues. Selon eux, les conclusions de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne d\u00e9pendaient pas du fait qu\u2019elle a fait mention de la d\u00e9tention \u00ab automatique \u00bb. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, le terme \u00ab automatique \u00bb d\u00e9signe une d\u00e9tention qui est impos\u00e9e sans consid\u00e9ration, de mani\u00e8re m\u00e9canique ou par r\u00e9flexe, et l\u2019emploi de ce terme n\u2019est donc pas une erreur.\n[87] Soit dit en tout respect, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en parlant de d\u00e9tention \u00ab automatique \u00bb. La preuve montre que la d\u00e9tention n\u2019est pas automatique et que les risques de d\u00e9tention des personnes renvoy\u00e9es varient selon chaque cas. \u00c0 mon avis, cette erreur manifeste a entach\u00e9 les conclusions de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la d\u00e9tention. Je suis d\u2019accord avec les intim\u00e9s et la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire que la d\u00e9tention n\u2019est pas automatique, en ce sens qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on universelle : s\u2019agissant de la cat\u00e9gorie \u00e9tendue comprenant toutes les personnes qui rentrent aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, \u00ab [c]e dossier, tout au plus, nous permet de dire que les personnes qui rentrent aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis risquent la d\u00e9tention discr\u00e9tionnaire [. . .] [et que] les personnes d\u00e9tenues dans ces circonstances peuvent demander la mise en libert\u00e9, qui leur est souvent accord\u00e9e, avec ou sans cautionnement \u00bb (motifs de la C.A., par. 140\u2011141).\n[88] Il est vrai que l\u2019expert des intim\u00e9s a reconnu qu\u2019il existe certaines cat\u00e9gories de personnes pour lesquelles la d\u00e9tention est automatique ou obligatoire : les personnes que les lois am\u00e9ricaines d\u00e9finissent comme des \u00e9trangers arrivants ou criminels; les personnes faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une mesure de renvoi d\u00e9finitive; et les personnes soup\u00e7onn\u00e9es de terrorisme (affidavit de Stephen Yale\u2011Loehr, par. 135\u2011141, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XLVII, p. 20144\u201120145). Toutefois, le dossier ne d\u00e9montre pas que ces cat\u00e9gories s\u2019appliquent aux personnes qui sont renvoy\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Pour ce qui est des autres cat\u00e9gories de non\u2011citoyens, les appelants n\u2019ont pas s\u00e9rieusement contest\u00e9 le fait que la d\u00e9tention est discr\u00e9tionnaire et qu\u2019elle est assortie de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une remise en libert\u00e9 (ibid., par. 131\u2011134; contre\u2011interrogatoire d\u2019Anwen Hughes, questions 143\u2011149, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXVII, p. 11291\u201111292). D\u2019ailleurs, Mme Mustefa et tous les d\u00e9posants anonymes qui ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 des contre-interrogatoires \u00e9crits se sont vu offrir une remise en libert\u00e9 sous caution, et tous sauf un ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Le dossier indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres solutions que la d\u00e9tention (affidavit de Yale\u2011Loehr, par. 159\u2011162). La preuve n\u2019appuie donc pas la conclusion de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle la d\u00e9tention est \u00ab automatique \u00bb au sens ordinaire du terme.\n[89] Bien que les personnes qui rentrent aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019y soient pas automatiquement d\u00e9tenues, le risque de d\u00e9tention demeure un effet qui met en jeu la libert\u00e9. Notre Cour a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que la \u00ab libert\u00e9 \u00bb englobe le fait de ne pas \u00eatre d\u00e9tenu, emprisonn\u00e9 ou menac\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00eatre (R. c. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 636, p. 652; R. c. Swain, [1991] 1 R.C.S. 933, p. 969; Winko c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 625, par. 64; R. c. Demers, 2004 CSC 46, [2004] 2 R.C.S. 489, par. 30). Ainsi, puisque la question qui se pose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7 est simplement celle de savoir si les appelants ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un effet qui rel\u00e8ve de cet article, un risque de d\u00e9tention suffit.\nb) Conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis\n[90] Les appelants soutiennent \u00e9galement que les conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis mettent en jeu le droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne, comme l\u2019a conclu la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il est vrai que ce droit englobe la protection contre les ch\u00e2timents corporels et les souffrances physiques et contre la menace de tels s\u00e9vices (Singh c. Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 177, p. 207; Suresh, par. 53\u201155). Il englobe \u00e9galement la protection contre les tensions psychologiques graves et profondes caus\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00c9tat (Nouveau\u2011Brunswick (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services communautaires) c. G. (J.), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 46, par. 60). Les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y avait des erreurs justifiant infirmation dans la conclusion de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle les conditions de d\u00e9tention rel\u00e8vent, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, du champ d\u2019application du droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne.\n[91] Premi\u00e8rement, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le \u00ab recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement cellulaire \u00bb soulevait le droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne (par. 110). Madame Mustefa et l\u2019un des d\u00e9posants anonymes ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s en isolement en attendant les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test de d\u00e9pistage de la tuberculose. L\u2019importance consid\u00e9rable que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accord\u00e9e \u00e0 ces t\u00e9moignages donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019elle a tir\u00e9 sa conclusion sur l\u2019isolement cellulaire en raison de son utilisation en vue de cet objectif de sant\u00e9 publique. Ainsi, si je comprends bien, elle a conclu que l\u2019isolement est utilis\u00e9 dans le cas de personnes rentrant aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis qui attendent de subir un test de d\u00e9pistage de la tuberculose. Cette conclusion n\u2019est entach\u00e9e d\u2019aucune erreur r\u00e9visable. Je n\u2019ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 conclure que le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical comporte un risque de graves souffrances physiques et psychologiques, tout comme les autres formes d\u2019\u00ab isolement cellulaire \u00bb. La question qui se pose \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci n\u2019est pas de savoir si ces risques sont conformes aux principes de justice fondamentale ou s\u2019ils sont par ailleurs justifi\u00e9s.\n[92] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages suivant lesquels certains centres de d\u00e9tention \u00e9taient \u00ab anormalement froids \u00bb (par. 111). Pour tirer cette conclusion, elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur les affirmations de quatre d\u00e9posants qui avaient eux-m\u00eames \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus dans de telles conditions. Madame Mustefa a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenue \u00e9tait d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab froid glacial \u00bb et que, pendant la journ\u00e9e, elle devait se recouvrir les mains et les bras de chaussettes pour rester au chaud, tout en \u00e9tant recroquevill\u00e9e sous une serviette. Je ne vois aucune erreur justifiant infirmation dans la conclusion suivant laquelle un froid aussi intense pouvait causer des souffrances physiques, mettant ainsi en jeu la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne.\n[93] Troisi\u00e8mement, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les soins m\u00e9dicaux administr\u00e9s dans les \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention \u00e9taient inad\u00e9quats \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards (par. 112). Par exemple, elle a relev\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage suivant lequel le personnel m\u00e9dical ignorait les d\u00e9tenus noirs alors qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux des d\u00e9tenus blancs (ibid.). Aucune erreur justifiant une intervention en appel n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e dans ses conclusions factuelles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019insuffisance des soins m\u00e9dicaux ou dans sa conclusion selon laquelle ces effets rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application du droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne (par. 114).\n[94] Quatri\u00e8mement, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a relev\u00e9 deux autres passages de l\u2019affidavit de Mme Mustefa. En particulier, Mme Mustefa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pendant sa d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ses restrictions alimentaires religieuses n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenue avec des personnes condamn\u00e9es pour des infractions criminelles (par. 96). Les appelants ont fait mention de ces formes de traitements, bien que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne se soit pas appuy\u00e9e sur ceux\u2011ci dans son analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne \u00e9tait en jeu. J\u2019h\u00e9site \u00e0 conclure, en l\u2019absence de conclusions claires des instances inf\u00e9rieures, que ce traitement rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Cependant, comme il sera expliqu\u00e9 ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, m\u00eame en envisageant les arguments des appelants \u00e0 ce sujet sous le jour le plus favorable, je ne conclurais pas \u00e0 une violation de l\u2019art. 7 pour ce motif.\nc) Risques de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis\n[95] Les appelants soutiennent \u00e9galement que les personnes renvoy\u00e9es courent un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif d\u2019\u00eatre refoul\u00e9es des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis vers leur pays d\u2019origine, comme l\u2019a conclu la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le fait de renvoyer des personnes aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ne constitue pas en soi un refoulement, pas plus que le fait pour les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis de renvoyer des personnes vers leur pays d\u2019origine, d\u00e8s lors que les obligations internationales applicables sont respect\u00e9es. Ce que l\u2019on craint plut\u00f4t, c\u2019est que les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis renvoient des personnes contrairement \u00e0 ces obligations, ce qui ferait du Canada un participant \u00e0 un refoulement indirect lorsqu\u2019il renvoie des demandeurs d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Les appelants affirment que ce risque met en jeu la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Il ne fait aucun doute que le risque de refoulement \u2014 que ce soit directement du Canada ou indirectement apr\u00e8s le retour de la personne dans un pays tiers \u2014 rel\u00e8ve du champ d\u2019application du droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. Notre Cour a fait observer que le principe du non\u2011refoulement est \u00ab la pierre angulaire du r\u00e9gime international de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb (N\u00e9meth c. Canada (Justice), 2010 CSC 56, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 281, par. 18). Par d\u00e9finition, le refoulement expose des personnes \u00e0 des menaces pour leur vie ou leur libert\u00e9 (Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, article 33), \u00e0 la torture (Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d\u00e9gradants, R.T. Can. 1987 no 36, article 3) ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres violations graves des droits de la personne. C\u2019est en raison de la gravit\u00e9 de ces cons\u00e9quences possibles que notre Cour a jug\u00e9 \u00ab inconcevable \u00bb dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh que le refoulement \u00e9chappe aux protections pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 (p. 210).\n[96] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question la plus difficile \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7 est d\u2019ordre factuel : la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a\u2011t\u2011elle commis une erreur en concluant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis? Comme je vais l\u2019expliquer, avec \u00e9gards, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs r\u00e9visables sur ce point.\n(i) Refoulement en raison des obstacles caus\u00e9s par les conditions de d\u00e9tention\n[97] Les appelants font valoir que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu raison de conclure que les obstacles auxquels sont confront\u00e9es les personnes d\u00e9tenues qui veulent pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile cr\u00e9ent un risque de refoulement (motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 106). Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que le dossier ne peut appuyer cette conclusion et que les tribunaux canadiens devraient pr\u00e9sumer que les processus des \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers servant \u00e0 trancher les demandes d\u2019asile sont \u00e9quitables. Les intim\u00e9s invoquent \u00e9galement une pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9 aux obligations internationales et affirment que, pour r\u00e9futer cette pr\u00e9somption dans le cas des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, [traduction] \u00ab la preuve doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe des circonstances extraordinaires et attaquer l\u2019ensemble du syst\u00e8me, voire mettre en doute l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance du pouvoir judiciaire \u00bb (m.i., par. 89; voir aussi la transcription, p. 89 et 92).\n[98] Les arguments des intim\u00e9s sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9s. Il est vrai qu\u2019il existe une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers disposent de processus judiciaires \u00e9quitables et ind\u00e9pendants (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Ward, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 689, p. 725, citant Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration c. Satiacum (1989), 99 N.R. 171 (C.A.F.), par. 19). Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu que les tribunaux devraient s\u2019appuyer sur une pr\u00e9somption portant que les \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers se conforment \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards au droit international. Il convient plut\u00f4t de suivre les principes ordinaires applicables aux recours fond\u00e9s sur la Charte : l\u2019auteur d\u2019une contestation doit prouver les faits qui \u00e9tayent les violations de droits invoqu\u00e9es se rattachant \u00e0 l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat imput\u00e9 au Canada. Lorsque ces conclusions de fait sont contest\u00e9es, la norme usuelle de l\u2019\u00ab erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00bb trouve application en appel.\n[99] Suivant la norme appropri\u00e9e, je suis convaincu que les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019une erreur r\u00e9visable. Le dossier ne peut appuyer la conclusion de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle les obstacles auxquels sont confront\u00e9es les personnes d\u00e9tenues qui cherchent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile donnent lieu \u00e0 un risque \u00ab r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif \u00bb de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis.\n[100] Tout d\u2019abord, comme l\u2019a fait observer la Cour d\u2019appel, les motifs de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019abordaient pas directement les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants concernant la fa\u00e7on dont les demandes d\u2019asile sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lorsque les personnes sont d\u00e9tenues (par. 142). Par exemple, Mme Mustefa et la presque totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9posants anonymes ont eu acc\u00e8s aux services d\u2019un avocat pour pr\u00e9senter leurs demandes pendant qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9tenus aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. De plus, plusieurs des experts qui ont souscrit un affidavit ont reconnu qu\u2019il existe des programmes d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale con\u00e7us pour assurer une repr\u00e9sentation juridique gratuite aux personnes d\u00e9tenues par les autorit\u00e9s de l\u2019immigration. Le dossier indique d\u2019ailleurs que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives am\u00e9ricaines applicables garantissent le droit de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures de demandes d\u2019asile et pr\u00e9voient que les demandeurs doivent recevoir une liste d\u2019avocats agissant b\u00e9n\u00e9volement (voir l\u2019affidavit de Yale\u2011Loehr, par. 21\u201124 et 68\u201174, abordant, notamment, la Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4)(B) (2018); voir aussi le contre\u2011interrogatoire de Hughes, questions 298\u2011310). La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas express\u00e9ment tenu compte de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants pour tirer sa conclusion. \u00c0 mon avis, cette omission \u00ab donne lieu \u00e0 la conviction rationnelle que [la] juge de premi\u00e8re instance doit avoir oubli\u00e9, n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d\u2019examiner ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve de telle mani\u00e8re que sa conclusion en a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00bb (Housen, par. 39, citant Van de Perre c. Edwards, 2001 CSC 60, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 1014, par. 15).\n[101] De plus, le dossier n\u2019appuie pas la conclusion de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle le refoulement r\u00e9sulte des obstacles auxquels seraient confront\u00e9es les personnes d\u00e9tenues lorsqu\u2019elles veulent pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile. \u00c0 ce propos, deux questions cruciales n\u2019ont pratiquement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es. En premier lieu, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le les m\u00e9canismes internes de r\u00e9vision et d\u2019appel du syst\u00e8me d\u2019asile des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis (affidavit de Yale\u2011Loehr, par. 67\u201174). Les appelants n\u2019ont fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tablissant l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 de ces m\u00e9canismes. En second lieu, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que certains demandeurs dont la demande d\u2019asile a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e disposent d\u2019autres recours pour demeurer aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, comme la possibilit\u00e9 de demander un statut de protection temporaire, qui permet aux personnes provenant de pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9s de demeurer aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis (voir, p. ex., le contre\u2011interrogatoire d\u2019Abed Ayoub, questions 236\u2011260, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXXI, p. 13012\u201113017). Un autre moyen consiste \u00e0 demander une \u00ab suspension du renvoi \u00bb, qui permet aux personnes qui risquent d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es pour un des motifs reconnus par la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s de demeurer aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis (voir, p. ex., l\u2019affidavit de Deborah Anker, par. 65\u201167, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XVII, p. 7340\u20117341). Il est \u00e9galement possible de revendiquer la protection au titre de la Convention contre la torture (voir, p. ex., ibid.). En outre, de nombreux programmes de visas sont con\u00e7us express\u00e9ment pour les personnes s\u2019inscrivant dans certaines cat\u00e9gories, comme les victimes d\u2019actes criminels ou de trafic de personnes (voir, p. ex., le contre\u2011interrogatoire de Lenni B. Benson, questions 278\u2011282, 344\u2011347, 350\u2011355 et 513\u2011521, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXVIII, p. 11604\u201111605, 11621, 11623 et 11659\u201111661). Ces m\u00e9canismes sont utiles pour d\u00e9terminer si les personnes dont la d\u00e9tention peut faire obstacle \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de leur demande d\u2019asile sont, en fin de compte, refoul\u00e9es. La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a toutefois pas examin\u00e9 ces m\u00e9canismes.\n[102] Soit dit en tout respect, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en n\u2019examinant pas explicitement ces aspects du dossier, qui affaiblissent sa conclusion. Le dossier n\u2019\u00e9taye pas sa conclusion portant que les conditions de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis cr\u00e9ent des obstacles \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de demandes d\u2019asile qui soul\u00e8vent un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement. Bien qu\u2019il soit possible que les obstacles \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande dans un pays tiers soient si importants qu\u2019ils cr\u00e9ent un tel risque, les appelants n\u2019en ont pas fait la d\u00e9monstration en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(ii) Refoulement en raison des politiques am\u00e9ricaines en mati\u00e8re d\u2019asile\n[103] Devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les appelants ont \u00e9galement soutenu que l\u2019imposition d\u2019une \u00ab interdiction d\u2019un an \u00bb (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle un demandeur d\u2019asile doit pr\u00e9senter sa demande dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant son arriv\u00e9e), et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de la pers\u00e9cution fond\u00e9e sur le genre en tant que fondement de la demande d\u2019asile, donnent toutes les deux lieu \u00e0 un risque de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives canadiennes qui facilitent le retour des demandeurs d\u2019asile aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, o\u00f9 ces risques peuvent se concr\u00e9tiser, mettent en jeu le droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions sur ces arguments; elle a fait reposer sa conclusion sur le risque de refoulement uniquement sur les obstacles auxquels sont confront\u00e9es les personnes d\u00e9tenues lorsqu\u2019elles veulent pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019asile (par. 106 et 113). Elle n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs formul\u00e9 aucun commentaire sur la nature ou la port\u00e9e des politiques am\u00e9ricaines pertinentes.\n[104] En appel devant notre Cour, les appelants invoquent les risques de refoulement qui d\u00e9couleraient de ces aspects du droit am\u00e9ricain en mati\u00e8re d\u2019asile. Ils n\u2019expliquent toutefois pas de quelle fa\u00e7on ces politiques fonctionnent et devraient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es. Ils citent plut\u00f4t les conclusions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le jugement Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s c. Canada, 2007 CF 1262, [2008] 3 R.C.F. 606, ainsi que certains aspects de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les intim\u00e9s, en revanche, s\u2019appuyant sur d\u2019autres parties du dossier de preuve, font valoir que les politiques am\u00e9ricaines pertinentes respectent le principe du non\u2011refoulement.\n[105] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CCR (2008), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en partie parce qu\u2019en raison du caract\u00e8re hypoth\u00e9tique de la contestation, il n\u2019y avait \u00ab aucun fait justifiant un examen des pr\u00e9tendues atteintes port\u00e9es \u00e0 la Charte \u00bb (par. 103). Mais surtout, les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans ces instances ne sont pas correctement soumises \u00e0 notre Cour dans le cas qui nous occupe. Les conclusions que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tir\u00e9es en 2007 ne sont donc d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[106] De surcro\u00eet, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux politiques am\u00e9ricaines applicables sont d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de conclusions de fait pertinentes. Le dossier sur cette question comporte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires. Par exemple, l\u2019expert des intim\u00e9s a sembl\u00e9 reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an fait en sorte que certaines personnes se voient refuser l\u2019asile m\u00eame si leurs demandes sous\u2011jacentes sont fond\u00e9es (contre\u2011interrogatoire de Stephen Yale\u2011Loehr, question 664, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XLVIII, p. 20508). Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, les risques de refoulement seraient \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Toutefois, l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an comporte des exceptions en cas de changement de situation ou de circonstances extraordinaires (voir, p. ex., ibid., questions 655 et 660\u2011664; affidavit d\u2019Anker, par. 60; affidavit de Jaya Ramji\u2011Nogales, par. 9, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXX, p. 12752\u201112753). En l\u2019absence de conclusions de fait sur la fa\u00e7on dont ces exceptions s\u2019appliquent, notre Cour n\u2019est pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an donne effectivement lieu au refoulement. De plus, les divers autres moyens qui permettent aux personnes de demeurer aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, dont nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9, peuvent \u00eatre pertinents. Ces exceptions et ces autres moyens pourraient \u00eatre la fa\u00e7on dont les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis mettent en \u0153uvre leurs obligations de non\u2011refoulement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an.\n[107] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions concernant les politiques am\u00e9ricaines en mati\u00e8re de pers\u00e9cution fond\u00e9e sur le genre, il serait \u00e9galement imprudent de la part de notre Cour de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement dans le cas de personnes qui demandent l\u2019asile afin de fuir un pays o\u00f9 elles sont victimes d\u2019une telle pers\u00e9cution. Dans ces circonstances, il ne serait pas opportun que notre Cour tente de tirer ses propres conclusions factuelles. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, comme il sera expliqu\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s, m\u00eame en supposant que les politiques en question pr\u00e9sentent effectivement un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement pour les personnes renvoy\u00e9es, je ne conclurais pas en d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 une violation de l\u2019art. 7 pour ce motif.\nd) Conclusion sur les effets mettant en jeu les droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7\n[108] Le risque de d\u00e9tention lors du retour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ainsi que trois aspects des conditions de d\u00e9tention constat\u00e9s par la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u2014 le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical, les temp\u00e9ratures anormalement froides et les lacunes dans les soins m\u00e9dicaux \u2014, rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application du droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne. De surcro\u00eet, afin de consid\u00e9rer la th\u00e8se des appelants sur la mise en jeu de l\u2019art. 7 sous son jour le plus favorable, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir pour acquis que les effets suivants se produisent et entrent dans le champ d\u2019application des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 : le non\u2011respect d\u2019un r\u00e9gime alimentaire religieux, la d\u00e9tention dans un \u00e9tablissement h\u00e9bergeant des personnes condamn\u00e9es pour des infractions criminelles et les risques de refoulement d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019interdiction d\u2019un an et de l\u2019approche des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis quant aux demandes fond\u00e9es sur le genre. En gardant ces effets \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je passe \u00e0 l\u2019analyse du lien de causalit\u00e9.\n(2) Lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien\n[109] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, pour d\u00e9montrer que les droits garantis \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 sont en jeu, l\u2019auteur de la contestation doit non seulement d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019effets relevant du champ d\u2019application des droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7, mais il doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que ces effets sont caus\u00e9s par un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien. Dans les affaires internes, le lien de causalit\u00e9 requis sera souvent \u00e9vident. Toutefois, tel est rarement le cas lorsque l\u2019atteinte en question est le fait d\u2019acteurs \u00e9trangers. Lorsqu\u2019il conclut \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien causal entre un pr\u00e9judice et un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien, le tribunal doit \u00ab [tenir] compte du contexte \u00bb (Bedford, par. 76). Lorsque l\u2019auteur de la contestation cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien et un pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par un acteur \u00e9tranger, le contexte est nettement diff\u00e9rent des cas o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9judice est attribuable \u00e0 des processus purement internes.\n[110] Le Canada n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de dicter aux autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res comment agir. Ainsi, pour qu\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes doivent avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019atteinte a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019auteur de la contestation r\u00e9ussira \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien \u00ab [\u00e0] tout le moins, dans les cas o\u00f9 la participation du Canada est un pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte \u00bb (Suresh, par. 54).\n[111] En outre, le Canada ne peut pr\u00e9voir toutes les mesures que prendront les autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Dans les cas o\u00f9 le Canada n\u2019avait aucun moyen de savoir qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice serait caus\u00e9, il serait inopportun de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il existe un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre ce pr\u00e9judice et un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien. Ainsi, pour \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien, il faut \u00e9tablir que les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes savaient, ou auraient d\u00fb savoir, que des pr\u00e9judices pouvaient d\u00e9couler des actes du Canada. La Cour a formul\u00e9 ce principe en reconnaissant que l\u2019auteur de la contestation sera en mesure de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien \u00ab [\u00e0] tout le moins, dans les cas o\u00f9 [. . .] [l\u2019]atteinte est une cons\u00e9quence parfaitement pr\u00e9visible de la participation canadienne \u00bb (Suresh, par. 54 (je souligne)).\na) Condition pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire\n[112] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est clair que la participation du Canada est une condition pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 chacun des effets li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention et au refoulement. Sans la mise en \u0153uvre l\u00e9gislative du r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs, les individus pourraient pr\u00e9senter leur demande d\u2019asile au Canada. Au lieu de cela, ils sont renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis par des fonctionnaires canadiens agissant en vertu des pouvoirs qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi, o\u00f9 ils font face (ou sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faire face) \u00e0 de tels effets. Je n\u2019ai donc aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 conclure que l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien en cause \u2014 en l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR ainsi que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2014 constitue une condition pr\u00e9alable n\u00e9cessaire.\nb) Cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9visible\n[113] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford, notre Cour s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Suresh et a expliqu\u00e9 son r\u00f4le (par. 77). La pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9, d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Suresh, peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie \u00ab par d\u00e9duction raisonnable, suivant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s \u00bb (Bedford, par. 76). Il doit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement y avoir un \u00ab lien [. . .] suffisant eu \u00e9gard au contexte consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 78). N\u00e9anmoins, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 demeure utile dans un contexte international o\u00f9 le Canada n\u2019a pas forc\u00e9ment pleinement connaissance de la fa\u00e7on dont les autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res agiront (voir, p. ex., J. C. Hathaway, The Rights of Refugees Under International Law (2e \u00e9d. 2021), p. 367\u2011368). En clair, notre Cour est li\u00e9e par la norme de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Suresh et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford.\n[114] Il y a au moins deux fa\u00e7ons de d\u00e9montrer la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un effet (voir, p. ex., Hathaway, p. 373). Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019auteur de la contestation peut d\u00e9montrer que le Canada \u00e9tait effectivement au courant du risque que des effets aient lieu. Les d\u00e9bats parlementaires lors desquels les risques sont analys\u00e9s peuvent notamment \u00e9tablir cette connaissance. Ensuite, l\u2019auteur de la contestation peut \u00e9galement d\u00e9montrer que le Canada aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant des risques, de sorte que cette connaissance peut lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e. Les d\u00e9clarations publiques, les analyses de doctrine et d\u2019autres sources provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du gouvernement peuvent contribuer \u00e0 \u00e9tablir cette connaissance. Bien que les hypoth\u00e8ses ne suffisent pas, le seuil d\u2019application de la connaissance par interpr\u00e9tation doit rester atteignable puisque la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 \u00ab ouvre la voie \u00e0 l\u2019application du droit garanti \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 \u00bb (Bedford, par. 78). Par exemple, le seuil d\u2019application devrait \u00eatre beaucoup moins exigeant que l\u2019approche stricte adopt\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de connaissances d\u2019office (voir R. c. Find, 2001 CSC 32, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 863, par. 48).\n[115] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pris acte du cadre d\u2019analyse du lien de causalit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Suresh, mais elle ne s\u2019est pas explicitement demand\u00e9 si chacun des effets pertinents \u00e9tait pr\u00e9visible (par. 100). Elle n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve auraient pu lui permettre de conclure que le Canada savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir, que ces effets se produiraient. Soit dit en tout respect, cette approche a men\u00e9 la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 commettre une erreur r\u00e9visable lors de son application de la norme de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Cour dans les arr\u00eats Suresh et Bedford.\n[116] En ce qui concerne les temp\u00e9ratures froides dans les \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention, les lacunes dans les soins m\u00e9dicaux, la d\u00e9tention en compagnie d\u2019individus reconnus coupables d\u2019infractions criminelles et le non\u2011respect de restrictions alimentaires religieuses, le dossier ne permet pas de conclure que ces effets \u00e9taient une cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9visible des actes du Canada selon la norme \u00e9tablie dans les arr\u00eats Suresh et Bedford. Bien que ces effets soient pr\u00e9occupants, la question qui se pose \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci est celle de savoir si le Canada savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019ils pouvaient se produire. Les appelants n\u2019ont pas relev\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettraient \u00e0 notre Cour de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question par l\u2019affirmative, compte tenu de l\u2019absence de conclusions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de la part des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures. Ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli que le Canada \u00e9tait ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant de ce type de pr\u00e9judice se produisant dans les \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention am\u00e9ricains. Par cons\u00e9quent, rien ne permettait, \u00e0 mon avis, de conclure que ces effets \u00e9taient une cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9visible.\n[117] En revanche, le dossier confirme que les autres effets n\u00e9gatifs \u00e9taient parfaitement pr\u00e9visibles. En ce qui concerne le risque de d\u00e9tention, il est \u00e9vident que le Canada savait que les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis seraient expos\u00e9es \u00e0 un tel risque. D\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res consultations sur la port\u00e9e d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel accord sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs, le recours \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis a fait l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats et d\u2019\u00e9tudes (voir, p. ex., HCNUR, UNHCR Comments on the Draft Agreement between Canada and the United States of America for \u00ab Cooperation in the Examination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries \u00bb, 26 juillet 2002 (en ligne), p. 3). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019\u00ab interdiction d\u2019un an \u00bb et le traitement des demandes d\u2019asile fond\u00e9es sur le genre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des points centraux lors de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019accord (voir, p. ex., la p. 2; R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact de la r\u00e9glementation, DORS\/2004\u2011217, Gazette du Canada, partie II, vol. 138, no 22, 3 novembre 2004, p. 1627). De plus, le Canada aurait d\u00fb savoir que les personnes renvoy\u00e9es risquaient d\u2019\u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la pratique r\u00e9pandue du recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical. Ces violations du droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne ont un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien, et doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es en fonction des principes de justice fondamentale.\nC. Analyse des principes de justice fondamentale\n(1) Les principes applicables\n[118] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les principes de justice fondamentale applicables sont ceux se rapportant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e excessive et au caract\u00e8re totalement disproportionn\u00e9. Ces principes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s en premi\u00e8re instance et les appelants les invoquent devant notre Cour. En revanche, les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb s\u2019applique [traduction] \u00ab au contr\u00f4le constitutionnel des effets du renvoi d\u2019une personne vers des administrations et des r\u00e9gimes juridiques \u00e9trangers \u00bb (m.i., par. 64). Ils affirment que ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire exigeant n\u2019est respect\u00e9 que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, comme il convient compte tenu de l\u2019importance de la courtoisie internationale et du respect de la souverainet\u00e9 des \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers. \u00c0 mon avis, les arguments des intim\u00e9s sont mal fond\u00e9s. Le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb peut fort bien \u00eatre utile pour l\u2019examen de d\u00e9cisions individualis\u00e9es, mais il n\u2019est pas utile pour les contestations de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives fond\u00e9es sur la Charte .\n[119] Certes, comme l\u2019ont fait observer les intim\u00e9s dans leur plaidoirie, certains membres de notre Cour ont estim\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kindler c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), [1991] 2 R.C.S. 779, p. 849\u2011850, que le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb \u00e9tait applicable aux contestations de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives. Cependant, l\u2019arr\u00eat Kindler doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019examen plus complet de ce crit\u00e8re que notre Cour a effectu\u00e9 plus tard dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Burns. Il doit aussi \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019\u00e9valuation plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des principes de justice fondamentale qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9e notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Malmo\u2011Levine.\n[120] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Burns, notre Cour a indiqu\u00e9 clairement que le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019examen des d\u00e9cisions individuelles du ministre et ne doit pas \u00ab obscurcir la question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en bout de ligne \u00bb, soit celle de savoir si ces d\u00e9cisions sont \u00ab compatible[s] avec les principes de justice fondamentale \u00bb (par. 68). \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Burns, notre Cour a utilis\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb pour examiner des demandes de r\u00e9paration individualis\u00e9e fond\u00e9es sur la Charte , pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des personnes ayant fait l\u2019objet de d\u00e9cisions du ministre concernant leur extradition ou leur expulsion, plut\u00f4t que, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour \u00e9valuer la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif (voir, p. ex., Lake c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2008 CSC 23, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 761, par. 38\u201139; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Barnaby, 2015 CSC 31, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 563, par. 11). Des auteurs de doctrine ont \u00e9galement conclu que le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb indique la mani\u00e8re dont [traduction] \u00ab une d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire prise par un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019\u00c9tat peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9e sur le fondement de la Charte , m\u00eame si la loi en vertu de laquelle la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise n\u2019est pas elle\u2011m\u00eame contest\u00e9e \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Stewart (2019), p. 130\u2011131). D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Malmo\u2011Levine, notre Cour a explicitement conclu qu\u2019une pond\u00e9ration aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2014 que celle que suppose l\u2019application du crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb \u2014 ne constitue pas un principe de justice fondamentale pouvant \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour contester une disposition l\u00e9gislative (par. 94\u201199). Il est vrai que dans certains contextes, cette formulation a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour servir de base \u00e0 la norme de la disproportion totale (voir, p. ex., relativement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, par. 109\u2011110, 145 et 163, la juge Martin, et par. 182\u2011183, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, dissidente, mais pas sur ce point). En pratique, une disposition consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant totalement disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 son objectif pourrait bien choquer la conscience si elle est invoqu\u00e9e. Toutefois, cette convergence n\u2019\u00e9carte pas les principes de justice fondamentale qui s\u2019appliquent aux contestations de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives.\n[121] Comme les appelants ciblent des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives, le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab choc de la conscience \u00bb ne convient pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cela ne veut toutefois pas dire que la question de savoir si l\u2019acte du gouvernement choque la conscience n\u2019est pas pertinente pour contester la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs. Les d\u00e9cisions administratives prises conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs doivent, comme les r\u00e9gimes eux\u2011m\u00eames, respecter les droits garantis par la Charte . Par cons\u00e9quent, les demandeurs d\u2019asile qui arrivent des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis peuvent toujours faire valoir des contestations constitutionnelles concernant des d\u00e9cisions selon lesquelles leur demande d\u2019asile est irrecevable ou celles selon lesquelles des mesures sp\u00e9ciales ne peuvent pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9es. Comme l\u2019a reconnu notre Cour, il est possible d\u2019examiner dans le cadre de la m\u00eame instance des contestations visant \u00e0 la fois des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et des actes administratifs (voir, p. ex., PHS, par. 74\u201177; Kindler, p. 840, la juge McLachlin).\n[122] Si des demandeurs d\u2019asile lors d\u2019affaires futures contestent des actes administratifs, les tribunaux pourront conclure que le renvoi de ces personnes choquerait la conscience des Canadiens et des Canadiennes (voir Burns, par. 69). De cette fa\u00e7on, les demandeurs d\u2019asile vuln\u00e9rables que le Canada cherche ind\u00fbment \u00e0 renvoyer peuvent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Toutefois, dans leur plaidoirie, les appelants ont express\u00e9ment \u00e9cart\u00e9 toute intention de contester la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions administratives par lesquelles ils se sont vu refuser des exemptions.\n[123] Rien de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne sugg\u00e8re que les pr\u00e9occupations des intim\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la courtoisie internationale et \u00e0 la souverainet\u00e9 des \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers ne sont pas justifi\u00e9es. J\u2019estime toutefois qu\u2019elles peuvent s\u2019int\u00e9grer aux principes de la port\u00e9e excessive et de la disproportion totale. Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019analyse du lien de causalit\u00e9 que l\u2019on trouve dans les arr\u00eats Suresh et Bedford fait en sorte que les tribunaux canadiens ne peuvent \u00e9valuer les effets caus\u00e9s par des acteurs \u00e9trangers que si ces effets ont un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec un acte de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien.\n[124] De plus, les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford permettent aux tribunaux de tenir compte de la courtoisie internationale et de la souverainet\u00e9 des \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers. En effet, le caract\u00e8re arbitraire, la port\u00e9e excessive et la disproportion totale sont des principes de \u00ab logique fonctionnelle \u00bb ou d\u2019\u00e9valuation des moyens et des objectifs, lesquels ne peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objet de la disposition l\u00e9gislative contest\u00e9e (par. 107\u2011109; Stewart (2019), p. 150\u2011151; P. W. Hogg, \u00ab The Brilliant Career of Section 7 of the Charter \u00bb (2012), 58 S.C.L.R. (2d) 195, p. 209). L\u2019expression ad\u00e9quate de l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e9gime comportant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9trangers doit tenir compte du contexte international, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y aura que rarement, voire jamais, de correspondance exacte entre le r\u00e9gime \u00e9tranger et le r\u00e9gime canadien. Les tribunaux devraient donc h\u00e9siter \u00e0 conclure que ce type de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives repose sur les lois de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger correspondant en tous points \u00e0 celles du Canada. Dans ces circonstances, j\u2019insiste sur le fait que les tribunaux doivent prendre les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9finissent l\u2019objet de lois canadiennes.\n[125] Enfin, notre Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 puisse, dans certaines circonstances, \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier (Malmo\u2011Levine, par. 96\u201198; Bedford, par. 129). Notre Cour a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier doit \u00eatre abord\u00e9e en tenant compte du contexte factuel et social de chaque cas (voir, p. ex., RJR\u2011MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1995] 3 R.C.S. 199, par. 63, le juge La Forest, dissident, mais pas sur ce point, et par. 132\u2011134, la juge McLachlin). \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019article premier, une approche contextuelle prendrait probablement en consid\u00e9ration la courtoisie internationale et de la souverainet\u00e9 des \u00c9tats \u00e9trangers.\n(2) Le r\u00e9gime n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive et n\u2019est pas totalement disproportionn\u00e9\n[126] Les intim\u00e9s ne mentionnent pas l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford dans leur m\u00e9moire. Bien qu\u2019ils soutiennent que les principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford ne s\u2019appliquent pas au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, leur omission d\u2019examiner cet arr\u00eat ne nous est d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9. La th\u00e8se des appelants \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e sur la port\u00e9e excessive et la disproportion totale \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 ces principes et la Cour d\u2019appel les a comment\u00e9s. Il aurait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 utile \u00e0 la Cour que les intim\u00e9s offrent des explications, ou des arguments subsidiaires, sur ces principes.\n[127] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford s\u2019appliquent. Pour d\u00e9terminer si une disposition l\u00e9gislative viole ces principes, les tribunaux se demandent \u00ab si, de prime abord, l\u2019objet de la disposition pr\u00e9sente un lien avec ses effets et si l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable est proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet objet \u00bb (par. 125). Pour ce faire, ils doivent \u00e9tablir l\u2019objet de la disposition et ensuite se demander si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cet objet, la disposition l\u00e9gislative enfreint un des principes de justice fondamentale applicables.\na) Objectif l\u00e9gislatif\n[128] Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures se sont fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CCR (2008), par. 75 : \u00ab . . . le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile avec des pays signataires qui se conforment aux articles pertinents [de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et de la Convention contre la torture] et qui ont des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents acceptables en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne \u00bb (motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 119\u2011122; motifs de la C.A., par. 164). Les appelants proposent une conception plus large de la place qu\u2019occupe le droit international quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime, affirmant que celui\u2011ci vise [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 partager la responsabilit\u00e9 de la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux obligations internationales du Canada \u00bb (m.a., par. 56 (italique omis)). Inversement, les intim\u00e9s voudraient que notre Cour retienne un objet qui ne mentionne pas explicitement les obligations internationales : [traduction] \u00ab . . . partager la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019assurer la protection des personnes dans le besoin et am\u00e9liorer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00bb (m.i., par. 26). Je n\u2019adopterais aucune de ces propositions. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR a pour objet le partage avec les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner \u00e9quitablement les demandes d\u2019asile, conform\u00e9ment au principe du non\u2011refoulement.\n[129] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Ndhlovu, 2022 CSC 38, notre Cour a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 plusieurs principes guidant la caract\u00e9risation de l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7. Elle a soulign\u00e9, par exemple, que l\u2019accent est mis sur l\u2019objet des dispositions contest\u00e9es, bien que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral puisse donner des indices au sujet de l\u2019objet des dispositions particuli\u00e8res en question (par. 61, les juges Karakatsanis et Martin, et par. 153, le juge Brown, dissident en partie, mais pas sur ce point). Le tribunal peut tenir compte \u00ab de [l\u2019]\u00e9nonc\u00e9 [de l\u2019objet] dans le texte de loi, s\u2019il en est, du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi et d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques \u00bb (par. 64; voir aussi R. c. Appulonappa, 2015 CSC 59, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 754, par. 33).\n[130] Les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s d\u2019objet constituent \u00ab [l]a [traduction] \u201cpreuve la plus directe et la plus digne de foi\u201d de l\u2019objet d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative \u00bb (Appulonappa, par. 49, citant R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6e \u00e9d. 2014), p. 274\u2011276). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien que les articles pr\u00e9cis dans lesquels se trouvent les dispositions contest\u00e9es ne contiennent pas d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s d\u2019objets proprement dits, le par. 3(2) de la LIPR \u00e9nonce les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la Loi en ce qui concerne les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s :\n(2) S\u2019agissant des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, la pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet :\na) de reconna\u00eetre que le programme pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s vise avant tout \u00e0 sauver des vies et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les personnes de la pers\u00e9cution;\nb) de remplir les obligations en droit international du Canada relatives aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et aux personnes d\u00e9plac\u00e9es et d\u2019affirmer la volont\u00e9 du Canada de participer aux efforts de la communaut\u00e9 internationale pour venir en aide aux personnes qui doivent se r\u00e9installer;\nc) de faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier ceux qui fuient la pers\u00e9cution d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable refl\u00e9tant les id\u00e9aux humanitaires du Canada;\nd) d\u2019offrir l\u2019asile \u00e0 ceux qui craignent avec raison d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9s du fait de leur race, leur religion, leur nationalit\u00e9, leurs opinions politiques, leur appartenance \u00e0 un groupe social en particulier, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qui risquent la torture ou des traitements ou peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s;\ne) de mettre en place une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable et efficace qui soit respectueuse, d\u2019une part, de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus canadien d\u2019asile et, d\u2019autre part, des droits et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales reconnus \u00e0 tout \u00eatre humain;\n[131] Ces objectifs fournissent trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s permettant de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet des dispositions vis\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : le respect des obligations internationales du Canada (al. 3(2)b) et d)), la garantie d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable pour les demandeurs d\u2019asile (al. 3(2)b), c) et e)) et la mise en place d\u2019un processus canadien d\u2019asile efficace et viable (al. 3(2)e)). De plus, le par. 102(1) de la LIPR se rapporte aussi \u00e0 l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans la mesure o\u00f9 il permet la d\u00e9signation de pays \u00ab en vue du partage avec d\u2019autres pays de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile \u00bb.\n[132] En ce qui concerne le texte et le contexte du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, la disposition directement contest\u00e9e est l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR. Cette disposition d\u00e9signe les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 102(1) a) de la LIPR . \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019objet d\u2019une disposition d\u00e9signant un pays pr\u00e9cis ne peut \u00eatre compris qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du par. 102(2), comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CCR (2008). La prise en compte des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au par. 102(2) est une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la d\u00e9signation d\u2019un pays. Ces facteurs, \u00e9tablis par le Parlement, s\u2019inscrivent n\u00e9cessairement dans l\u2019objectif poursuivi par la d\u00e9signation. Parmi ceux\u2011ci, mentionnons \u00ab [les] politique et usages [du pays concern\u00e9] en ce qui touche la revendication du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et les obligations d\u00e9coulant de la Convention contre la torture \u00bb (al. 102(2)b)). Les \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne \u00bb d\u2019un pays en sont un autre (al. 102(2)c)).\n[133] Le pouvoir de d\u00e9signer un pays d\u00e9coule de l\u2019al. 102(1)a), qui s\u2019attache au respect par le pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 du principe du non\u2011refoulement, consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Convention contre la torture. Le principe du non\u2011refoulement, que les auteurs ont aussi d\u00e9crit comme la \u00ab pierre angulaire du droit des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb (voir, p. ex., F. Cr\u00e9peau, Droit d\u2019asile : De l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9 aux contr\u00f4les migratoires (1995), p. 166), rev\u00eat donc une importance capitale pour l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime. De fait, m\u00eame les auteurs de doctrine qui critiquent l\u2019accord ont reconnu qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un engagement commun \u00e0 assurer l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un processus d\u2019asile au Canada ou aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis \u00bb en vue du respect du principe du non\u2011refoulement (Macklin (2005), p. 381; Mayrand et Smith\u2011Gr\u00e9goire, p. 337).\n[134] Les divers facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au par. 102(2) de la LIPR se rapportent clairement au principe du non-refoulement, mais ne s\u2019y limitent pas. En mentionnant les pratiques et usages concernant la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et la Convention contre la torture dans leur ensemble (al. 102(2)b)), la loi prescrit au gouverneur en conseil de tenir compte d\u2019un large \u00e9ventail de garanties qui visent \u00e0 faire en sorte que les demandeurs d\u2019asile b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un traitement \u00e9quitable dans les pays d\u2019accueil. L\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 102(2)c) selon laquelle il faut tenir compte des \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents [d\u2019un pays] en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne \u00bb va dans le m\u00eame sens, car elle contribue \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront d\u2019un traitement \u00e9quitable encore plus avantageux que le minimum \u00e9tabli par le principe du non-refoulement. Il ne ressort pas de ces exigences que les pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9s doivent avoir des politiques ou des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de la personne qui sont identiques \u00e0 ceux du Canada, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9s respectent certaines exigences minimales. En ce sens, les facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au par. 102(2) laissent de la place aux diff\u00e9rences acceptables entre les r\u00e9gimes internes des \u00c9tats, ce qui refl\u00e8te le respect du Parlement envers la courtoisie internationale, dans les limites de la Constitution.\n[135] Le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui structure les effets juridiques d\u00e9coulant de la d\u00e9signation d\u2019un pays est \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur, en ce sens qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre que le partage de responsabilit\u00e9s avec un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 est un objectif primordial. En particulier, l\u2019al. 101(1) e) de la LIPR rend irrecevable la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9. L\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d\u2019autres proc\u00e9dures au Canada est \u00e9galement restreint (voir, p. ex., LIPR , al. 112(2) b)). Le message est clair : la d\u00e9signation fait en sorte que les demandes d\u2019asile seront examin\u00e9es dans le pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au Canada.\n[136] Enfin, trois sources d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques aident \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR. Premi\u00e8rement, le pr\u00e9ambule de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs fournit des indications utiles sur les objectifs du Parlement et du gouverneur en conseil lors de l\u2019adoption des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives mettant en \u0153uvre le trait\u00e9 au Canada. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, le pr\u00e9ambule reconna\u00eet les obligations de non\u2011refoulement auxquelles sont assujettis les deux pays (par. 2). Il indique que les gouvernements \u00e9taient conscients de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9viter \u00ab d\u2019enfreindre indirectement le principe fondamental de non-refoulement [. . .] [en garantissant] l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00e9quitable et pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb (par. 8). Par cons\u00e9quent, le pr\u00e9ambule de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs confirme que le principe de non\u2011refoulement est au c\u0153ur du r\u00e9gime, tout en insistant plus largement sur le traitement \u00e9quitable des demandes d\u2019asile. C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces engagements r\u00e9ciproques que le partage des responsabilit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9.\n[137] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019\u00c9nonc\u00e9 de principes connexe auquel ont souscrit le Canada et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un engagement partag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire en sorte que les demandeurs d\u2019asile assujettis au r\u00e9gime soient trait\u00e9s \u00e9quitablement. Par exemple, il permet aux demandeurs d\u2019\u00eatre accompagn\u00e9s d\u2019une personne de leur choix pendant les proc\u00e9dures.\n[138] Troisi\u00e8mement, le R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact de la r\u00e9glementation de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab [c]es dispositions visent \u00e0 d\u00e9signer les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis par r\u00e8glement pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 101(1)e) de la [LIPR ] \u00bb \u00ab en vue du partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb, tout en respectant \u00ab [l]\u2019engagement du Canada \u00e0 remplir ses obligations internationales envers les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb, ce qui \u00ab refl\u00e8te notre tradition humanitaire et nos valeurs fondamentales de compassion et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 1622\u20111623).\n[139] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des objectifs de la LIPR , le texte, le contexte et l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, de m\u00eame que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve extrins\u00e8ques, tendent \u00e0 indiquer que l\u2019objet des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives comporte trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels : (1) le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile; (2) le respect du principe du non\u2011refoulement; et (3) le renvoi des demandeurs d\u2019asile uniquement dans des pays o\u00f9 leurs demandes seront \u00e9quitablement examin\u00e9es. Compte tenu de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR est le partage avec les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen \u00e9quitable des demandes d\u2019asile, conform\u00e9ment au principe du non\u2011refoulement. Cet objet refl\u00e8te un objectif principal (le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9), lequel est assujetti \u00e0 deux limites (le principe du non\u2011refoulement et l\u2019exigence d\u2019un examen \u00e9quitable). Fait \u00e0 noter, ces deux limites ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent pas une attente selon laquelle le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain de demandes d\u2019asile devrait correspondre en tous points au syst\u00e8me canadien. C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cet objectif que les atteintes aux droits garantis par l\u2019art. 7 dont il est question \u2014 le risque de d\u00e9tention discr\u00e9tionnaire et d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical, ainsi que les risques pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de refoulement \u2014 doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a port\u00e9e excessive et disproportion totale.\nb) Risques de d\u00e9tention et d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical\n[140] Les appelants soutiennent que les risques de d\u00e9tention et d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical ont une port\u00e9e excessive et sont totalement disproportionn\u00e9s. Je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il y ait atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces principes de justice fondamentale eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[141] En ce qui concerne la port\u00e9e excessive, la question est de savoir si la disposition contest\u00e9e \u00ab s\u2019applique si largement qu\u2019elle vise certains actes qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec son objet \u00bb (Bedford, par. 112 (italique omis)). Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 notre Cour, une disposition l\u00e9gislative a une port\u00e9e excessive si elle a cet effet ne serait\u2011ce que dans un seul cas (par. 113 et 123; Ndhlovu, par. 78). Il ne s\u2019agit pas de savoir \u00ab si le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi le moyen le moins restrictif, mais de savoir si le moyen choisi porte atteinte \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019a aucun lien avec le mal qu\u2019avait \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Carter, par. 85).\n[142] \u00c0 mon avis, le risque de d\u00e9tention aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, laquelle est assortie de possibilit\u00e9s de mise en libert\u00e9 et de contr\u00f4le, est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif. Le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile avec un autre \u00c9tat exposera n\u00e9cessairement les personnes renvoy\u00e9es \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime juridique \u00e9tranger qui encadre la pr\u00e9sence des demandeurs d\u2019asile dans ce pays. L\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 des syst\u00e8mes juridiques \u00e9trangers \u2014 y compris \u00e0 leurs pratiques en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention \u2014 est une cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable de la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime. Bien entendu, l\u2019objectif de partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la loi est nuanc\u00e9 par l\u2019exigence selon laquelle les demandeurs d\u2019asile doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un examen \u00e9quitable de leur demande dans le pays d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Toutefois, le respect de cette exigence ne d\u00e9pend pas de la mesure dans laquelle le r\u00e9gime am\u00e9ricain d\u2019octroi de l\u2019asile correspond au r\u00e9gime canadien. Un certain degr\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rence entre les r\u00e9gimes juridiques applicables dans les deux pays peut \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 condition que le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain ne soit pas fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour pouvoir d\u00e9montrer que le r\u00e9gime va au\u2011del\u00e0 de cette limite \u2014 de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a absolument \u00ab aucun lien \u00bb entre les effets du r\u00e9gime et l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif, qui vise notamment \u00e0 renvoyer les demandeurs d\u2019asile uniquement dans des pays o\u00f9 leurs demandes seront examin\u00e9es \u00e9quitablement (voir Carter, par. 85) \u2014, les appelants doivent \u00e9tablir que le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain est fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable. \u00c0 mon avis, le dossier ne permet pas de conclure que le r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9tention am\u00e9ricain est fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable.\n[143] Les instruments juridiques internationaux donnent des indications sur ce que repr\u00e9sente un traitement \u00e9quitable des demandeurs d\u2019asile. Par exemple, les Principes directeurs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention du HCNUR reconnaissent que la d\u00e9tention des demandeurs d\u2019asile \u00ab en soi n\u2019est pas prohib\u00e9e par le droit international, pas plus que le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de la personne n\u2019est absolu \u00bb (Principes directeurs relatifs aux crit\u00e8res et aux normes applicables \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention des demandeurs d\u2019asile et alternatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention (2012), principe directeur 4, par. 18). Les Principes directeurs \u00e9tablissent des garanties en ce qui concerne le recours \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention. Il revient aux \u00c9tats de d\u00e9terminer quelle forme pr\u00e9cise prendront ces garanties en pratique. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les appelants ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9s de leur fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que le syst\u00e8me d\u2019asile des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ne comporte aucune garantie. Bien que le dossier indique que les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis risquent d\u2019y \u00eatre d\u00e9tenues, il r\u00e9v\u00e8le aussi l\u2019existence de m\u00e9canismes qui leur offrent la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre remises en libert\u00e9 et de faire contr\u00f4ler les motifs de leur d\u00e9tention par des d\u00e9cideurs administratifs et des tribunaux. Rien ne permet d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que ces mesures sont fondamentalement in\u00e9quitables. Par cons\u00e9quent, le risque de d\u00e9tention auquel sont expos\u00e9es les personnes \u00e0 leur retour aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive.\n[144] De m\u00eame, le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical n\u2019est pas fondamentalement in\u00e9quitable. Rien dans le dossier ne donne \u00e0 penser que l\u2019isolement des personnes en attente de r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test de d\u00e9pistage de la tuberculose n\u2019est pas utile en vue de limiter les risques pour la sant\u00e9 publique dans les \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019Ensemble de r\u00e8gles minima des Nations Unies pour le traitement des d\u00e9tenus (les R\u00e8gles Nelson Mandela), Doc. N.U. A\/RES\/70\/175, 17 d\u00e9cembre 2015, exige que, lorsque des personnes dans des \u00e9tablissements de d\u00e9tention sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre atteintes de maladies contagieuses, des mesures soient prises pour \u00ab pr\u00e9voir leur isolement clinique et leur offrir un traitement adapt\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode de contagion \u00bb (r\u00e8gle 30d)). Bien entendu, les R\u00e8gles Nelson Mandela limitent \u00e9galement le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement cellulaire et \u00e0 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation (voir, p. ex., les r\u00e8gles 37d), 43(1), 44 et 45). Toutefois, les appelants ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettraient d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que l\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 tort dans le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain de d\u00e9tention en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration.\n[145] Il est vrai que le dossier comprend les affidavits de deux avocats d\u2019organisations am\u00e9ricaines de d\u00e9fense des droits qui estiment qu\u2019il est possible que l\u2019isolement soit utilis\u00e9 plus largement. Par exemple, ils affirment que l\u2019isolement cellulaire pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans le cas des demandeurs d\u2019asile aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale (affidavit de Ruby Robinson, par. 18, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXXIII, p. 13884\u201113885) ou comme mesure punitive (affidavit de Timothy Warden\u2011Hertz, par. 8, reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXXIII, p. 13807\u201113808). Les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures n\u2019ont toutefois tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion sur ces questions pr\u00e9cises. La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas conclu que le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain de d\u00e9tention en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration impose l\u2019isolement aux personnes ayant des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale ou que l\u2019isolement est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 titre punitif.\n[146] Notre Cour h\u00e9site \u00e0 juste titre \u00e0 endosser le r\u00f4le de juge des faits (Hollis c. Dow Corning Corp., [1995] 4 R.C.S. 634, par. 33, le juge La Forest, et par. 89, le juge Sopinka, dissident, mais pas sur ce point). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu des limites du dossier de preuve, il serait imprudent de la part de notre Cour de tirer des conclusions factuelles sur la fa\u00e7on dont les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis utilisent l\u2019isolement cellulaire dans le cadre de la d\u00e9tention en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration. Rien ne permet donc de conclure que les pratiques am\u00e9ricaines sont fondamentalement in\u00e9quitables. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu que le risque d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical auquel sont expos\u00e9es les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis constitue un effet excessif des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives canadiennes.\n[147] En ce qui concerne la disproportion totale, la question est de savoir si les effets des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es sur les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7 sont \u00ab si totalement disproportionn\u00e9s \u00e0 [leurs] objectifs qu\u2019ils ne peuvent avoir d\u2019assise rationnelle \u00bb (Bedford, par. 120). Ce crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire n\u2019est satisfait que \u00ab dans les cas extr\u00eames o\u00f9 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019atteinte est sans rapport aucun avec l\u2019objectif \u00bb et \u00ab d\u00e9bord[e] compl\u00e8tement le cadre des normes reconnues dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique \u00bb (ibid.). Ni un risque de d\u00e9tention assortie de possibilit\u00e9s de mise en libert\u00e9 et de contr\u00f4le ni un risque d\u2019isolement m\u00e9dical ne satisfont \u00e0 ce seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9. Au Canada, comme aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ces risques font partie des normes mutuellement accept\u00e9es par nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s libres et d\u00e9mocratiques. Les appelants n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le contraire.\nc) Risques de refoulement en raison des politiques am\u00e9ricaines en mati\u00e8re d\u2019asile\n[148] Soumettre les personnes renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis \u00e0 des risques de refoulement r\u00e9els et non sp\u00e9culatifs n\u2019aurait aucun lien avec l\u2019objet des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es, qui reposent essentiellement sur le respect du principe du non\u2011refoulement. Une disposition exigeant le renvoi de personnes vers un pays o\u00f9 elles seront expos\u00e9es \u00e0 un risque de refoulement aurait donc une port\u00e9e excessive. De m\u00eame, une disposition imposant un tel renvoi serait totalement disproportionn\u00e9e parce qu\u2019une telle action exposerait, par d\u00e9finition, les personnes \u00e0 des menaces \u00e0 leur vie ou \u00e0 leur libert\u00e9 (Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, article 33), \u00e0 la torture (Convention contre la torture, article 3) ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres violations des droits fondamentaux de la personne. Les auteurs ont critiqu\u00e9 ces types de r\u00e9gimes obligatoires, qui exigent que les pays tiennent pour acquis [traduction] \u00ab la capacit\u00e9 et la volont\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat partenaire de prot\u00e9ger les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb (voir, p. ex., Hathaway, p. 330). Toutefois, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne prescrivent pas simplement le renvoi : il existe aussi des dispositions curatives connexes qui doivent \u00eatre prises en compte dans l\u2019analyse. Ces dispositions comprennent le report administratif des mesures de renvoi (LIPR , par. 48(2) ), les permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire (art. 24), les exemptions pour motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire (par. 25.1(1)) et les exceptions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (par. 25.2(1)). Je constate que m\u00eame si la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des mesures curatives applicables, elle a d\u00fbment reconnu \u2014 dans son analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 sous les titres \u00ab La port\u00e9e excessive \u00bb et \u00ab Le caract\u00e8re totalement disproportionn\u00e9 \u00bb dans ses motifs \u2014 que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont pertinentes pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation des principes de justice fondamentale \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bedford.\n[149] Comme l\u2019a conclu la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS, lorsque le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif contest\u00e9 comprend des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la question est de savoir si les m\u00e9canismes \u2014 d\u00fbment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s et appliqu\u00e9s \u2014 suffisent pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019absence de toute atteinte contraire aux principes de justice fondamentale (par. 113; voir aussi Moore, p. 150\u2011151). En clair, si de telles atteintes n\u2019ont pas lieu, il n\u2019y a donc pas de violation de l\u2019art. 7. Cette observation explique \u00e0 mon avis l\u2019affirmation de la juge en chef McLachlin dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS selon laquelle \u00ab si on d\u00e9cidait de r\u00e9diger une loi qui combat la toxicomanie tout en respectant les droits garantis par la Charte , on pourrait fort bien adopter [. . .] une interdiction conjugu\u00e9e au pouvoir d\u2019accorder des exemptions \u00bb (par. 114).\n[150] Les dispositions r\u00e9paratrices de la LIPR sont, sur de nombreux points essentiels, semblables \u00e0 la soupape de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue dans la LRCDAS , sur laquelle la Cour s\u2019est fond\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat PHS. Par exemple, l\u2019art. 25.1 de la LIPR est semblable sur le plan de la structure \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque l\u2019art. 56 de la LRCDAS . Les deux m\u00e9canismes pr\u00e9voient l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au ministre afin qu\u2019il l\u00e8ve les r\u00e8gles qui autrement s\u2019appliqueraient. De plus, ils accordent tous les deux un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en ce qu\u2019ils autorisent des exemptions de toute disposition de la Loi (dans le cas de la LRCDAS ), ou de tout crit\u00e8re ou de toute obligation applicable que pr\u00e9voit la Loi (dans le cas de la LIPR ). Les exemptions pour des motifs d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (LIPR , art. 25.2 ) jouent un r\u00f4le comparable. De plus, les reports administratifs de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une mesure de renvoi (par. 48(2)) et les permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire (art. 24) cr\u00e9ent aussi des possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9paration discr\u00e9tionnaire, accord\u00e9es par des d\u00e9cideurs de premi\u00e8re ligne plut\u00f4t que par le ministre.\n[151] Lorsque les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la LIPR s\u2019appliquent, les demandeurs d\u2019asile peuvent \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un renvoi. S\u2019ils ne sont pas renvoy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, ils ne sont pas expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un risque de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 peuvent donc servir \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce qui pourrait par ailleurs constituer des effets inconstitutionnels, comme ce fut le cas dans l\u2019affaire PHS. En outre, comme dans cette affaire, elles sont \u00e0 juste titre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie de l\u2019\u00e9tape portant sur les principes de justice fondamentale de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, parce que les m\u00e9canismes peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s en vue de corriger l\u2019atteinte pr\u00e9cise en cause, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le risque de refoulement.\n[152] Les appelants soutiennent que [traduction] \u00ab les effets excessifs et totalement disproportionn\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre corrig\u00e9s \u00bb par ces m\u00e9canismes dans la LIPR (m.a., par. 67). Selon eux, les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne sont pas pertinentes parce qu\u2019elles ne font [traduction] \u00ab pas partie des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires mettant en \u0153uvre l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019[Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs] \u00bb (par. 69). Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime sont sans rapport avec l\u2019atteinte au point o\u00f9 elles ne sont pas utiles pour \u00e9tablir si la disposition contest\u00e9e viole l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte . Correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, les m\u00e9canismes curatifs dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont suffisants pour faire en sorte que les personnes ne soient pas expos\u00e9es \u00e0 des risques r\u00e9els et non sp\u00e9culatifs de refoulement, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels risques existent. Ces m\u00e9canismes doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s en fonction du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que garantit l\u2019article 6 de l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs au Canada pour examiner des demandes d\u2019asile s\u2019il juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire.\n[153] \u00c0 l\u2019article 6, les parties ont convenu que chacune d\u2019entre elles peut examiner \u00ab toute demande du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00bb si elle juge qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de le faire. Les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ont mis en \u0153uvre cette disposition d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui leur permet d\u2019exercer leur discr\u00e9tion et de tenir compte de divers facteurs d\u2019ordre humanitaire (voir, p. ex., HCNUR, Monitoring Report : Canada\u2011United States \u00ab Safe Third Country \u00bb Agreement (2006), p. 63\u201165). Rien dans l\u2019entente n\u2019emp\u00eachait le Canada de conserver des m\u00e9canismes permettant une approche similaire.\n[154] Le simple fait que ces m\u00e9canismes soient ant\u00e9rieurs au trait\u00e9 ne fait pas \u00e9chec \u00e0 leur pertinence. Des auteurs ont d\u2019ailleurs fait observer que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a grande majorit\u00e9 des trait\u00e9s conclus par le Canada sont des accords d\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 \u00c9tat qui n\u2019exigent pas de modification aux lois internes de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties \u00bb (van Ert, p. 233). Lorsque l\u2019entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e, le droit interne canadien comprenait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des dispositions pouvant faciliter l\u2019examen individualis\u00e9 de la situation des demandeurs d\u2019asile lorsqu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public du Canada de le faire. De nouvelles dispositions l\u00e9gislatives mettant en \u0153uvre d\u2019autres m\u00e9canismes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires. De m\u00eame, il importe peu que ces dispositions se retrouvent dans d\u2019autres parties d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la LIPR . Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, les analyses fond\u00e9es sur la Charte doivent tenir compte de toutes les dispositions pertinentes dans un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif dont les composantes sont interreli\u00e9es.\n[155] Les dispositions connexes de la LIPR et du RIPR pr\u00e9voient divers moyens permettant aux demandeurs d\u2019asile d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un retour temporaire ou permanent. Par exemple, l\u2019agent qui, lors de l\u2019entrevue initiale, est persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement pourrait renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada en vue d\u2019un examen plus approfondi. Ce minist\u00e8re pourrait alors se pencher sur l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de recommander que le ministre accorde une exemption pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire en vertu de l\u2019art. 25.1 de la LIPR , ce qui comprend la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 101(1)e). Par ailleurs, le ministre pourrait d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il existe des raisons d\u2019octroyer un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire, ce qui lui donnerait du temps pour d\u00e9terminer si le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire. Cette liste de moyens n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas exhaustive. Toutefois, ceux\u2011ci semblent indiquer que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif peut limiter le risque de pr\u00e9judice que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait autrement occasionner.\n[156] Il est vrai que le Canada n\u2019a express\u00e9ment invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article 6 que pour cr\u00e9er des exceptions par cat\u00e9gories (Canada, Partenariat pour la protection : Examen de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e (2006), p. 37). N\u00e9anmoins, le Canada est depuis longtemps au fait que l\u2019article 6 lui permet d\u2019examiner les demandes d\u2019asile de [traduction] \u00ab personnes [. . .] qui, en temps normal, ne seraient vis\u00e9es par aucune des exceptions, mais dont le cas particulier justifierait n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019\u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration en raison de leur vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (HCNUR, Monitoring Report, p. 36; voir aussi Partenariat pour la protection, p. 35\u201137). Je souscris \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 6, qui doit guider l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019exemption existants.\n[157] Les appelants font valoir dans leur m\u00e9moire que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ces m\u00e9canismes \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab illusoires \u00bb et \u00ab largement hors de port\u00e9e \u00bb (m.a., par. 68). En revanche, les intim\u00e9s affirment que ces m\u00e9canismes [traduction] \u00ab existent en droit \u00bb et que la Cour d\u2019appel a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s en pratique, comme en fait foi le dossier (m.i., par. 91). \u00c0 mon avis, aucune de ces positions ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9e dans sa totalit\u00e9.\n[158] Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019une exemption serait simplement \u00ab illusoire \u00bb \u2014 et ne pourrait donc pas rem\u00e9dier aux vices constitutionnels \u2014 s\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune possibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019invoquer en droit. Par exemple, s\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune d\u00e9marche juridique permettant d\u2019obtenir une exemption d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative, alors elle est illusoire (voir Parker, par. 174). Il ne suffit pas non plus que des m\u00e9canismes curatifs puissent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s en droit, mais ne puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s en pratique. Les promesses creuses ne prot\u00e8gent pas contre les violations de droits garantis par la Constitution. Par exemple, notre Cour a reconnu qu\u2019une loi qui autorise des exemptions peut n\u00e9anmoins cr\u00e9er des obstacles \u00e0 leur acc\u00e8s (voir, p. ex., R. c. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 R.C.S. 30, p. 60\u201162, le juge en chef Dickson, et p. 91\u2011100, le juge Beetz). Celui qui conteste une loi peut soutenir que celle\u2011ci viole de fa\u00e7on injustifiable l\u2019art. 7 parce que le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019exemption lui\u2011m\u00eame cause des difficult\u00e9s aux personnes qui cherchent \u00e0 s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir (Morgentaler, p. 73\u201176, le juge en chef Dickson, et p. 122\u2011128, le juge Beetz). Notre Cour a toutefois soulign\u00e9 que la loi doit \u00eatre la cause des difficult\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9es pour pouvoir faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte (voir Little Sisters, par. 128).\n[159] Il n\u2019est pas toujours \u00e9vident de savoir si la source d\u2019une violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est la disposition l\u00e9gislative ou la conduite administrative qui la met en \u0153uvre (voir, p. ex., A. M. Latimer et B. L. Berger, \u00ab A Plumber with Words: Seeking Constitutional Responsibility and an End to the Little Sisters Problem \u00bb (2022), 104 S.C.L.R. (2d) 143, p. 145\u2011146). Pour appliquer les arr\u00eats Morgentaler et Little Sisters, il convient de consulter la jurisprudence plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur l\u2019analyse du lien de causalit\u00e9 dans le cadre de contestations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 7. Comme c\u2019est le cas \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape de la d\u00e9monstration d\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7, l\u2019auteur de la contestation doit d\u00e9montrer que la loi cause des difficult\u00e9s aux personnes qui cherchent \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de mesures curatives (Bedford, par. 78). Il doit donc d\u00e9montrer que la loi rend l\u2019exemption illusoire dans sa propre situation. L\u2019auteur de la contestation n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la loi rend les exemptions illusoires en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, car l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 n\u2019est pas ax\u00e9e sur \u00ab [le] pourcentage de la population qui est touch\u00e9e par un effet pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb (par. 123). Lorsque le tribunal conclut que la loi est \u00e0 l\u2019origine des difficult\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, il devrait expliquer comment les parties peuvent s\u2019acquitter de ce fardeau pour chacun des m\u00e9canismes curatifs en question.\n[160] Il est vrai que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9crit que les \u00ab garanties [. . .] sont [. . .] largement hors de port\u00e9e et sont donc \u201cillusoires\u201d \u00bb (par. 130). N\u00e9anmoins, comme les appelants l\u2019ont eux\u2011m\u00eames reconnu au cours de leur plaidoirie devant notre Cour, lorsque cette affirmation est lue dans son contexte, il appert que la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019attachait dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 concr\u00e8te de demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Comme discut\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019existence d\u2019un recours en contr\u00f4le judiciaire est une chose et l\u2019existence ou non de garanties l\u00e9gislatives pouvant servir de m\u00e9canismes curatifs ou de \u00ab soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb en est une autre. Les motifs de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne laissent pas entrevoir de conclusion r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie portant que tous les m\u00e9canismes curatifs pertinents sont illusoires pour une personne donn\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse en profondeur des m\u00e9canismes curatifs pertinents. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur de droit qui t\u00e9moigne du d\u00e9faut d\u2019examiner la mani\u00e8re dont les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes pourraient s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la question qui nous occupe \u2014 bien que l\u2019on puisse difficilement le reprocher \u00e0 la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, puisque les arguments soumis par les parties qui ont comparu devant elle ne semblent pas avoir trait\u00e9 directement de la mani\u00e8re dont ces m\u00e9canismes, correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s, pouvaient \u00eatre pertinents.\n[161] Si elle avait tenu compte de l\u2019\u00e9ventail complet des m\u00e9canismes curatifs applicables, la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait reconnu que la preuve dans le dossier est insuffisante concernant la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont appliqu\u00e9s en pratique. Par exemple, les appelants n\u2019ont fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve permettant de conclure qu\u2019un demandeur d\u2019asile renvoy\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces m\u00e9canismes. Le dossier montre plut\u00f4t que les demandeurs d\u2019asile particuliers renvoy\u00e9s peuvent demander un report administratif de leur renvoi, un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire ou une exemption pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire. Je souligne en particulier la situation des membres de la famille de Mme Al Nahass, qui se sont vu octroyer des permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire et le statut de r\u00e9sidents permanents pour des motifs d\u2019ordre humanitaire. Ainsi, le dossier dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne permet pas de conclure que les m\u00e9canismes curatifs applicables sont \u00ab illusoires \u00bb. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019erreur de droit commise par la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale fait en sorte que son commentaire ne lie pas notre Cour.\n[162] Le pouvoir d\u2019agir dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on individualis\u00e9e au moyen des m\u00e9canismes curatifs pr\u00e9vus par la LIPR . \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de conclusion suivant laquelle ces m\u00e9canismes sont illusoires ou autrement inad\u00e9quats pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 d\u2019\u00e9ventuels pr\u00e9judices, le fait d\u2019exercer de cette mani\u00e8re le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 ne constitue pas un vice constitutionnel. \u00c9videmment, le gouverneur en conseil peut \u00e9galement prendre des r\u00e8glements concernant les crit\u00e8res d\u2019application de l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 101(1)e) afin de pr\u00e9ciser dans quels cas le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du renvoi ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer (LIPR , al. 102(1) c)). C\u2019est ce que le gouverneur en conseil a fait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 159.6 du RIPR, lequel soustrait \u00e0 un renvoi aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis les personnes qui y seraient passibles de la peine de mort. Cette exception t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence marqu\u00e9e entre le droit am\u00e9ricain et le droit canadien. C\u2019est donc un exemple qui illustre que le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019exige pas n\u00e9cessairement que les deux pays s\u2019entendent sur tous les points. En effet, il ressort de l\u2019article 6 que les parties au trait\u00e9 acceptent que chacune d\u2019elles s\u2019en tiendra \u00e0 son propre point de vue lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9terminera si une demande d\u2019asile est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. De plus, les r\u00e8glements pris en application de l\u2019al. 102(1)c) ne sont pas le seul moyen servant \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser les situations qui justifient l\u2019application de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 6. Le ministre peut \u00e9galement \u00e9noncer des cat\u00e9gories de personnes pour lesquelles l\u2019ordre public exige qu\u2019une exception soit \u00e9tablie (LIPR , art. 25.2 ). L\u2019exercice du pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019al. 102(1)c) ou l\u2019art. 25.2 afin de pr\u00e9ciser les circonstances exceptionnelles appropri\u00e9es peut rendre le processus plus efficace et pr\u00e9visible.\n[163] En somme, m\u00eame en tenant pour acquis que les demandeurs d\u2019asile font face \u00e0 des risques r\u00e9els et non sp\u00e9culatifs de refoulement des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif canadien pr\u00e9voit des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui les prot\u00e8gent contre de tels risques. Pour cette raison, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif mettant en \u0153uvre l\u2019Entente sur les tiers pays s\u00fbrs n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive et n\u2019est pas totalement disproportionn\u00e9, et est donc conforme aux principes de justice fondamentale. Compte tenu de cette conclusion, ainsi que de mes conclusions sur les atteintes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention, aucune violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[164] Je rappelle que la contestation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce visait une disposition l\u00e9gislative, et non la conduite administrative. Il se peut que des acteurs administratifs, comme les agents de l\u2019ASFC, aient agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9raisonnable ou inconstitutionnelle dans le traitement de certains demandeurs d\u2019asile renvoy\u00e9s ou dans leur interpr\u00e9tation du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, y compris des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu\u2019il comporte. Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9, lorsque les pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s sont attribuables \u00e0 une action ou une inaction administrative, c\u2019est celle\u2011ci, et non la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame, qui peut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte . Toutefois, ces questions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 notre Cour dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Si, en raison d\u2019une faute administrative, des personnes sont renvoy\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis o\u00f9 elles se retrouveront dans une situation qui choquerait la conscience des Canadiens et des Canadiennes, par exemple si elles seront expos\u00e9es \u00e0 un risque r\u00e9el et non sp\u00e9culatif de refoulement, des recours constitutionnels et administratifs sont \u00e0 leur disposition. Sans me prononcer davantage sur le sujet, je constate que les d\u00e9cisions administratives dans ce domaine exigent [traduction] \u00ab un examen des plus soucieux \u00bb (R. (Yogathas) c. Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2002] UKHL 36, [2003] 1 A.C. 920, par. 9, 58 et 74, citant R. c. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p. Bugdaycay, [1987] A.C. 514 (H.L.), p. 531).\nD. Article premier\n[165] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif ne viole pas l\u2019art. 7, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entreprendre une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier. Toutefois, par souci d\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9, je formule quelques brefs commentaires sur la justification au titre de l\u2019article premier pour les situations o\u00f9 elle serait n\u00e9cessaire. Ce faisant, je souligne la pertinence distincte des soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier lorsque le fardeau de justification incombe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat.\n[166] Les appelants soutiennent que m\u00eame si les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par la loi ne faisaient pas en sorte que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives soient conformes aux principes de justice fondamentale au titre de l\u2019art. 7, de tels moyens d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9parations discr\u00e9tionnaires peuvent \u00eatre utiles lors de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019article premier. Toutefois, ils affirment que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une justification fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier, et ils s\u2019appuient sur l\u2019affirmation de la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant que les garanties sont \u00ab illusoires \u00bb.\n[167] Les intim\u00e9s font valoir que si une violation de l\u2019art. 7 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier, en partie en raison des dispositions connexes dans le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. Selon eux, l\u2019ensemble de la loi contribue \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif urgent et r\u00e9el du partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019asile avec les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. En outre, ils soutiennent que le r\u00e9gime ne porte qu\u2019une atteinte minimale aux droits des demandeurs garantis par l\u2019art. 7 et attirent l\u2019attention sur le suivi de l\u2019examen des facteurs dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime conform\u00e9ment au par. 102(3) de la LIPR et sur les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la LIPR .\n[168] Les deux parties reconnaissent \u00e0 juste titre, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Carter (par. 114\u2011121), que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont utiles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier. Toutefois, le r\u00f4le que ces m\u00e9canismes jouent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019article premier diff\u00e8re de celui qu\u2019ils jouent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019art. 7, tout comme \u00e9videmment le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat. Il en est ainsi parce que l\u2019art. 7 et l\u2019article premier \u00ab appellent des questions diff\u00e9rentes \u00bb dans la mesure o\u00f9 \u00ab [l]a justification fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objectif public pr\u00e9dominant constitue l\u2019axe central de l\u2019application de l\u2019article premier, mais elle ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7, qui se soucie seulement de savoir si la disposition contest\u00e9e porte atteinte \u00e0 un droit individuel \u00bb (Bedford, par. 125). Compte tenu de cette distinction, [traduction] \u00ab un ensemble de facteurs diff\u00e9rents entrent en jeu au titre de l\u2019article premier : non seulement l\u2019effet de la disposition sur les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7 d\u2019au moins une personne, mais aussi l\u2019effet de la violation de l\u2019art. 7 sur la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la disposition \u00bb (H. Stewart, \u00ab Bedford and the Structure of Section 7 \u00bb (2015), 60 R.D. McGill 575, p. 589). Lorsque les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont en cause, les facteurs en jeu au titre de l\u2019art. 7 et de l\u2019article premier sont distincts.\n[169] Bien que les m\u00e9canismes d\u2019exemption discr\u00e9tionnaire soient utiles pour d\u00e9terminer si les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives contest\u00e9es portent atteinte aux droits individuels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 7, ils ne sont peut\u2011\u00eatre pas ad\u00e9quats pour faire en sorte qu\u2019aucune atteinte contraire aux principes de justice fondamentale n\u2019ait lieu. Autrement dit, ils ne peuvent pas rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 toutes les atteintes aux droits que l\u2019art. 7 garantit aux individus. Par exemple, il est possible que la port\u00e9e d\u2019une soupape de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne soit simplement pas assez large pour exempter toutes les personnes vis\u00e9es \u00e0 tort par la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[170] Tout comme dans le cas d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 7, il incombe aux demandeurs de d\u00e9montrer que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par la loi ne rem\u00e9dient pas aux atteintes individuelles. Pour ce faire, ils peuvent, par exemple, pr\u00e9senter des arguments et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif lui-m\u00eame fait en sorte que les m\u00e9canismes curatifs d\u2019une loi sont pratiquement hors de port\u00e9e. Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019article premier, il incombe au gouvernement de prouver que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u2014 dans leur ensemble \u2014 suffisent pour justifier toute violation de l\u2019art. 7 \u00e9tablie au regard du test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103. Notre Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00c9tat soit en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 un droit garanti \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 est justifi\u00e9e \u00bb (Bedford, par. 129).\n[171] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019article premier, le gouvernement peut faire valoir \u2014 comme l\u2019a fait le Canada en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 que les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019un r\u00e9gime, si elles s\u2019av\u00e8rent imparfaites au regard de l\u2019art. 7, font n\u00e9anmoins en sorte que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ne portent qu\u2019une atteinte minimale. En outre, le gouvernement peut chercher \u00e0 invoquer les soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lors de l\u2019\u00e9tape finale de la mise en balance \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 7 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il est inutile de formuler des commentaires sur l\u2019issue qu\u2019aurait pu avoir en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce toute partie de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier.\nVIII. Le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15\nA. Les positions des parties relativement \u00e0 la contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15\n[172] Dans leur m\u00e9moire, les appelants ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ils reconnaissent qu\u2019en refusant de statuer sur leur recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte , la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion de fait sur laquelle pourrait reposer un argument relatif \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le genre. Dans sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocat des appelants a fait valoir subsidiairement que notre Cour pouvait tirer les conclusions factuelles n\u00e9cessaires pour trancher la question relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 15 et a fait remarquer que la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures.\n[173] Devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le recours des appelants fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 reposait sur l\u2019argument que l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR porte pr\u00e9judice aux femmes qui craignent d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es en raison de leur genre. Les appelants ont fait valoir, par exemple, que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation am\u00e9ricaine de l\u2019expression \u00ab certain groupe social \u00bb \u2014 l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de personnes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es contre le refoulement pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 33(1) de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u2014 \u00e9tait trop restrictive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes.\n[174] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de renvoyer l\u2019affaire parce que les pr\u00e9occupations des appelants concernant la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le genre sont d\u00fbment examin\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7. Selon l\u2019argument des intim\u00e9s, le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 \u00e9tait principalement motiv\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision Matter of A\u2011B\u2011, 27 I. & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9e en 2021. Ils affirment que le syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain reconna\u00eet les pr\u00e9judices li\u00e9s au genre comme fondement des demandes d\u2019asile et qu\u2019il ressort d\u2019une lecture objective du dossier que rien ne permet de conclure \u00e0 une violation de l\u2019art. 15.\nB. La contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[175] La Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame , L.R.C. 1985, c. S\u201126 , habilite notre Cour \u00e0 renvoyer une affaire en tout ou en partie \u00e0 la juridiction inf\u00e9rieure ou \u00e0 celle de premi\u00e8re instance (art. 46.1). Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 \u00ab [dans] l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb (Wells c. Terre\u2011Neuve, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 199, par. 68; Saadati c. Moorhead, 2017 CSC 28, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 543, par. 45; R. c. Esseghaier, 2021 CSC 9, par. 63). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le renvoi de la contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 est indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[176] Une juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance aurait, dans le cadre de son mandat de constatation des faits, un avantage sur le plan institutionnel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prendre les d\u00e9cisions n\u00e9cessaires en vue du traitement \u00e9quitable du recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15. Le dossier de preuve est volumineux et, bien que notre Cour ait le droit de tirer des conclusions factuelles \u00e0 partir de celui\u2011ci, de nombreux affidavits des experts concernant les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 15 se contredisent. Par exemple, la Cour devrait \u00e9valuer des avis d\u2019experts contradictoires sur une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions traitant de l\u2019approche am\u00e9ricaine quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab certain groupe social \u00bb (voir, p. ex., l\u2019affidavit de Yale\u2011Loehr, par. 118\u2011130; affidavit de Karen Musalo, par. 10 et suiv., reproduit dans le d.a., vol. XXI, p. 8965 et suiv.). Pour pouvoir trancher sur le fond la demande fond\u00e9e sur le genre, notre Cour devrait assumer le r\u00f4le de juge des faits et envisager d\u2019\u00eatre possiblement en contradiction avec les courants jurisprudentiels am\u00e9ricains en tant que juridiction d\u2019appel de dernier ressort.\n[177] Les juridictions d\u2019appel peuvent \u2014 et \u00e0 l\u2019occasion doivent \u2014 assumer le r\u00f4le de juge des faits lorsqu\u2019elles estiment qu\u2019il est \u00ab dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb de le faire et que cela \u00ab ne soul\u00e8ve pas d\u2019obstacle en pratique \u00bb (Hollis, par. 33, le juge La Forest). Toutefois, elles sont \u00ab en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et de fa\u00e7on compr\u00e9hensible, r\u00e9ticentes \u00bb \u00e0 le faire (ibid.), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les nombreux avantages qu\u2019ont les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de tirer des conclusions factuelles. Parmi ces avantages, mentionnons leur \u00ab expertise relative en mati\u00e8re d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation et d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la preuve, de m\u00eame que la connaissance unique qu\u2019il[s] poss\u00e8d[ent] de la preuve souvent abondante produite par les parties \u00bb (Housen, par. 25). Les juridictions d\u2019appel devraient \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement prudentes, par exemple, lorsqu\u2019un juge de premi\u00e8re instance a omis de tirer des conclusions factuelles essentielles et lorsque des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont contradictoires ou contest\u00e9s (Hollis, par. 89 et 93, le juge Sopinka, dissident, mais pas sur ce point).\n[178] \u00c0 mon avis, notre Cour n\u2019est pas bien plac\u00e9e pour tirer les conclusions factuelles n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 du recours bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15. Compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire, de la taille et de la complexit\u00e9 du dossier et des affidavits contradictoires, il ne serait pas \u00ab dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb que notre Cour assume le r\u00f4le de juge des faits, et cela \u00ab soul\u00e8ve[rait des] obstacle[s] en pratique \u00bb (Hollis, par. 33). En particulier, il n\u2019y aurait aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions de fait que notre Cour pourrait tirer sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contest\u00e9s et contradictoires.\n[179] De plus, il ne serait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de rejeter le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 en raison de l\u2019absence d\u2019arguments. Il est vrai que les appelants n\u2019ont pas plaid\u00e9 le fond de leur recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15 devant notre Cour, si ce n\u2019est d\u2019une br\u00e8ve mention dans leur m\u00e9moire et d\u2019un renvoi, dans leur plaidoirie, \u00e0 leurs actes de proc\u00e9dure devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures. Notre Cour a parfois jug\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir renonc\u00e9 aux aspects de sa demande qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas plaid\u00e9s et que ceux\u2011ci peuvent donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s (voir, p. ex., Meyer c. General Exchange Insurance Corp., [1962] R.C.S. 193, p. 201, le juge Locke). Ces d\u00e9cisions reconnaissent \u00e0 juste titre que l\u2019on s\u2019attend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 ce que les appelants pr\u00e9sentent des arguments complets \u00e0 l\u2019appui des pr\u00e9tentions qu\u2019ils formulent devant notre Cour. Pourtant, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il ne conviendrait pas d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019absence d\u2019arguments de la part des appelants comme un abandon des arguments importants que les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures n\u2019ont comment\u00e9s que bri\u00e8vement et qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas tranch\u00e9s. Eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable que les appelants se limitent \u00e0 demander \u00e0 notre Cour de renvoyer pour d\u00e9cision la question relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 15. L\u2019argument subsidiaire selon lequel nous devrions trancher cette question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une position m\u00fbrement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9aliste de la part des appelants de tenter de combler le vide factuel laiss\u00e9 par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures tout en faisant valoir de nouveaux arguments juridiques, tels que ceux relatifs au lien de causalit\u00e9 et aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans le contexte international.\n[180] Enfin, je constate que certains intervenants sont pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par ce qu\u2019ils per\u00e7oivent comme une [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e9gligence syst\u00e9matique [des tribunaux] face \u00e0 l\u2019art. 15 \u00bb dans les contestations reposant sur de multiples droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte (m.interv., David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights, West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association et Fonds d\u2019action et d\u2019\u00e9ducation juridique pour les femmes, par. 13). On peut tr\u00e8s bien comprendre leur pr\u00e9occupation : les demandes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 15 ne sont pas des questions secondaires devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es une fois toutes les autres questions examin\u00e9es. La Charte ne devrait pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme si elle \u00e9tablissait une hi\u00e9rarchie des droits dans laquelle l\u2019art. 15 occupe un rang inf\u00e9rieur.\n[181] Je ne reprocherais pas \u00e0 la juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir fait preuve de retenue judiciaire et de ne pas avoir statu\u00e9 sur le recours fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 15. Je reconnais que le principe de politique judiciaire qui dicte la retenue est avis\u00e9, car \u00ab [il] repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que toute d\u00e9claration inutile sur un point de droit constitutionnel risque de causer \u00e0 des affaires \u00e0 venir un pr\u00e9judice dont les cons\u00e9quences n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00bb. (Phillips c. Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la trag\u00e9die de la mine Westray), [1995] 2 R.C.S. 97, par. 9, le juge Sopinka). Malgr\u00e9 cela, ces consid\u00e9rations de politique judiciaire ne sont pas toujours d\u00e9terminantes. Elles doivent \u00eatre mises en balance avec d\u2019autres facteurs, comme la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019interjeter appel et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties. Bien que les proc\u00e9dures en premi\u00e8re instance demeurent \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9preuve principale \u00bb (Housen, par. 13, citant Anderson c. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985), p. 574\u2011575), il faudrait envisager la possibilit\u00e9 que des proc\u00e9dures suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessitent un examen d\u2019autres motifs constitutionnels. Comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le refus des juges de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019examiner d\u2019autres questions constitutionnelles peut donner lieu \u00e0 de fausses \u00e9conomies si les juridictions d\u2019appel doivent leur renvoyer des demandes.\n[182] En somme, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour qu\u2019elle statue sur celle\u2011ci, comme l\u2019a reconnu \u00e0 bon droit la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (par. 173). Rien dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tranchant les questions de fait ou de droit qui sont pertinentes en ce qui concerne la contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15.\nIX. Conclusion\n[183] Je suis d\u2019avis de r\u00e9pondre comme suit aux questions pos\u00e9es dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR n\u2019est pas ultra vires. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019art. 159.3 ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte . Troisi\u00e8mement, la contestation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[184] Puisque la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli l\u2019appel et rejet\u00e9 les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, certains aspects de son jugement devraient \u00eatre infirm\u00e9s. En particulier, la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en statuant que la contestation de l\u2019art. 159.3 du RIPR fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Je suis donc d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi en partie.

C\u201146, art. 259(1) a), 719(1) .\nAccus\u00e9e de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies par voie d\u2019infraction punissable par proc\u00e9dure sommaire, la contrevenante a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en libert\u00e9 sous promesse de ne pas conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur dans l\u2019attente de son proc\u00e8s. Elle est demeur\u00e9e sous le coup de cette interdiction jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de sa peine, 21 mois plus tard. Au moment des faits reproch\u00e9s, l\u2019al. 259(1) a) du Code criminel (\u00ab C. cr. \u00bb) exigeait du tribunal qu\u2019il rende \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contrevenant accus\u00e9 d\u2019une premi\u00e8re infraction de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur durant une p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019un an. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine impose \u00e0 la contrevenante une p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction de conduire d\u2019un an, et choisit d\u2019antidater l\u2019ordonnance au premier jour de l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle, de telle sorte que la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9vue par la loi est enti\u00e8rement compl\u00e9t\u00e9e en date de sa d\u00e9cision.\nLe juge d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires rejette l\u2019appel du minist\u00e8re public. Tout en soulignant que le premier juge a eu tort d\u2019antidater l\u2019interdiction, il conclut que le premier juge pouvait n\u00e9anmoins accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire, dans la mesure o\u00f9 une telle interdiction constitue une condition de remise en libert\u00e9 et fait \u00e9galement partie de la peine ult\u00e9rieurement inflig\u00e9e. Toutefois, la Cour d\u2019appel accueille \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 l\u2019appel subs\u00e9quent du minist\u00e8re public, d\u00e9terminant qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune autorit\u00e9 permettant d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9carter la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue par la loi.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli.\nIl \u00e9tait loisible au juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine de tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode de 21 mois d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9e par la contrevenante puisque cela ne contrecarrerait pas la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur en adoptant la peine minimale obligatoire. Aucun conflit ne r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019application concomitante de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. et de la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit. Au moment du prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, le tribunal est tenu d\u2019infliger la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an, mais rien dans la loi ne l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019octroyer ensuite un cr\u00e9dit. De m\u00eame, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit ne contrevient pas \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9vue au par. 719(1) C. cr. exigeant que la peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e. Seule la sentence doit commencer au moment o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e, et non la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an purg\u00e9e en application de l\u2019al. 259(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, ces dispositions l\u00e9gislatives n\u2019\u00e9cartent pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire fond\u00e9 sur la common law, reconnu aux juges des peines dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089, permettant au tribunal d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire.\nLe droit criminel canadien se compose \u00e0 la fois du droit \u00e9tabli par le l\u00e9gislateur et de principes de common law. Cette coexistence de la l\u00e9gislation et de la common law anime le droit relatif \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Alors que le Code criminel codifie les principes fondamentaux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, les tribunaux peuvent aussi tenir compte d\u2019autres principes et facteurs d\u00e9coulant de la common law. Bien que la l\u00e9gislation puisse \u00eatre pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante sur la common law, cette derni\u00e8re demeure applicable dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle n\u2019est pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire, principe justifi\u00e9 par l\u2019importance de la stabilit\u00e9 du droit. Le cadre d\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes relatif \u00e0 l\u2019interaction entre la l\u00e9gislation et la common law est bien \u00e9tabli. Dans un premier temps, il s\u2019agit d\u2019analyser, identifier et \u00e9noncer la common law applicable puis, dans un second temps, de pr\u00e9ciser l\u2019effet du droit statutaire sur la common law.\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, la common law permet aux tribunaux d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire subie par un contrevenant. Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de common law est l\u2019extension naturelle d\u2019un principe analogue en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle. Les tribunaux ont depuis longtemps reconnu qu\u2019il est possible de tenir compte, dans l\u2019infliction de la peine, de toute p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration que le contrevenant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9e entre la date de son arrestation et celle du prononc\u00e9 de sa sentence. L\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle purg\u00e9e par le contrevenant fait partie des principes centraux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas exprim\u00e9 l\u00e9gislativement. Le principe autorisant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle permet de pallier certaines injustices d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application du principe interdisant d\u2019antidater une sentence, aujourd\u2019hui codifi\u00e9 au par. 719(1). Bien que le droit canadien ne permette pas aux tribunaux d\u2019antidater une sentence afin de la r\u00e9duire, ceux\u2011ci peuvent n\u00e9anmoins consid\u00e9rer le temps pass\u00e9 en d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode devant \u00eatre purg\u00e9e par le contrevenant de fa\u00e7on prospective. L\u2019application de cette r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit n\u2019\u00e9quivaut donc pas \u00e0 antidater la sentence.\nDe plus, l\u2019absence, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interdictions pr\u00e9sentencielles de conduire, d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3) C. cr., qui codifie l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle, n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter ou de limiter la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention contraire exprim\u00e9e clairement par le l\u00e9gislateur, une loi ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 modifier substantiellement le droit, y compris la common law. Le paragraphe 719(3) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique de la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle, et les d\u00e9bats parlementaires tendent \u00e0 indiquer que l\u2019intention du Parlement \u00e9tait de s\u2019assurer que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit demeurait possible dans le cas d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de d\u00e9tention. Rien n\u2019indique que le Parlement se soit pench\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour les interdictions pr\u00e9sentencielles de conduire. De m\u00eame, les d\u00e9bats parlementaires n\u2019offrent aucune indication \u00e9tayant la th\u00e8se suivant laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur aurait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9carter, que ce soit explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire, la r\u00e8gle de common law applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces interdictions. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas de figure o\u00f9 le Parlement aurait fait clairement \u00e9tat de son intention d\u2019\u00e9carter ou de limiter la common law applicable.\nRelativement \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) ne limite pas la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. L\u2019octroi discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit fond\u00e9 sur la common law peut coexister harmonieusement avec le respect par les juges de la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la loi. Cette coexistence repose sur la distinction connue entre les concepts de \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de punition ou de privation (en anglais \u00ab punishment \u00bb), et de \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de d\u00e9cision de justice ou de sentence (en anglais \u00ab sentence \u00bb). Alors que le terme \u00ab peine \u00bb, employ\u00e9 au sens de punition, renvoie \u00e0 la punition totale subie par le contrevenant, le m\u00eame mot, employ\u00e9 au sens de sentence, r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de justice rendue par le tribunal, laquelle est toujours prospective, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher la pratique judiciaire d\u2019antidater les sentences.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. doit \u00eatre cern\u00e9e en examinant son texte, son contexte et son objet. Correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) pr\u00e9voit une punition minimale, et non une sentence minimale. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. pr\u00e9voit l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine d\u2019un an au sens d\u2019une punition globale satisfait parfaitement aux objectifs de dissuasion et de punition qui sous\u2011tendent la disposition. L\u2019intention du Parlement est respect\u00e9e, que la punition soit purg\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, puisque dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre l\u2019effet sur le contrevenant est identique. Bien que silencieuse quant au cr\u00e9dit, la disposition ne souffre d\u2019aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 : elle n\u2019admet qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation, soit l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire au sens de punition. Si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. exigeait le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence minimale, l\u2019\u00e9cart appropri\u00e9 entre les peines inflig\u00e9es aux contrevenants les plus dangereux et les moins dangereux risquerait ind\u00fbment de s\u2019effriter, et la gradation m\u00e9ticuleuse des interdictions minimales \u00e9tablie par le Parlement au par. 259(1) serait min\u00e9e. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention claire \u00e0 cet effet, il faut pr\u00e9sumer que le Parlement n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de produire de tels r\u00e9sultats absurdes. Cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr., en plus de laisser place \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit, est compatible avec les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019imposition d\u2019une punition additionnelle d\u2019un an \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une sorte de double punition, contrairement aux exigences les plus fondamentales de justice et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Au moment o\u00f9 le jugement de d\u00e9termination de la peine a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, la contrevenante avait essentiellement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 purger sa peine depuis 21 mois. Conscient de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a ordonn\u00e9 une interdiction de conduire d\u2019un an, mais a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la contrevenante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 satisfait \u00e0 cette condition. Cependant, il a antidat\u00e9 la sentence de la contrevenante pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat, ce qui \u00e9tait une erreur. Il aurait pu, \u00e0 bon droit, infliger la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an prescrite par l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr., pr\u00e9ciser que la sentence commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e aux termes du par. 719(1) C. cr. et, ensuite, octroyer un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle d\u2019interdiction de conduire en application du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui reconna\u00eet la common law, pouvoir qui n\u2019est nullement \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le Code criminel .\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : R. c.

Survol\n[1] Accus\u00e9e de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies en 2017 par voie d\u2019infraction punissable par proc\u00e9dure sommaire, l\u2019appelante, Jennifer Basque, a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en libert\u00e9 sous promesse de ne pas conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur dans l\u2019attente de son proc\u00e8s. Elle est demeur\u00e9e sous le coup de cette interdiction jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de sa peine, 21 mois plus tard. Au moment des faits reproch\u00e9s, l\u2019al. 259(1) a) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 (\u00ab C. cr. \u00bb), exigeait du tribunal qu\u2019il rende \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contrevenant une \u00ab ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur [. . .] durant une p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019un an \u00bb[1].\n[2] Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine pouvait-il octroyer \u00e0 Mme Basque un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction de conduire d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de cette interdiction minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an et de la directive \u2014 codifi\u00e9e au par. 719(1) C. cr. \u2014 portant que, sauf exception, la peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e?\n[3] N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019exigence de l\u2019al. 259(1)a), il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit serait possible. En effet, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089 \u2014 une affaire qui ne concernait pas une interdiction minimale obligatoire \u2014 notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, fond\u00e9 sur la common law, permettant au tribunal d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. Ce pouvoir est l\u2019extension naturelle d\u2019une pratique de longue date autorisant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour des p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle.\n[4] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il respecte les balises constitutionnelles pertinentes, le Parlement peut certes adopter une loi qui \u00e9carterait la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. Madame Basque n\u2019attaque pas la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 259(1)a), mais soutient que sa demande de cr\u00e9dit n\u2019est nullement limit\u00e9e par l\u2019imposition de l\u2019interdiction minimale obligatoire. Or, prenant appui sur les motifs majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, l\u2019intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re public, affirme que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce entrerait en conflit avec l\u2019application de l\u2019interdiction minimale d\u2019un an, m\u00eame si la disposition l\u00e9gislative en jeu est silencieuse \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[5] Soit dit en tout respect, j\u2019estime que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tort. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit fond\u00e9 sur le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de common law reconnu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse s\u2019accorde parfaitement avec l\u2019application de l\u2019interdiction minimale \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. et avec la r\u00e8gle exigeant que la peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e au par. 719(1) C. cr. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait loisible au juge de premi\u00e8re instance de tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode de 21 mois d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9e par Mme Basque, puisque cela ne contrecarrerait pas la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[6] L\u2019octroi discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit fond\u00e9 sur la common law peut coexister harmonieusement avec le respect par les juges de la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la loi. Cette coexistence repose sur la distinction connue entre les concepts de \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de punition ou de privation (en anglais, \u00ab punishment \u00bb), et de \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de d\u00e9cision de justice ou de sentence (en anglais, \u00ab sentence \u00bb). Cette distinction, discut\u00e9e par le juge d\u2019appel Rosenberg dans le contexte du cr\u00e9dit pour d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), a \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise par la juge Arbour de notre Cour, avec une attention particuli\u00e8re aux sens multiples du terme fran\u00e7ais \u00ab peine \u00bb, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Wust, 2000 CSC 18, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 455, par. 35\u201137. Dans cette optique, explique la juge Arbour, alors que le terme peine, employ\u00e9 au sens de punition, renvoie \u00e0 la punition totale subie par le contrevenant, le m\u00eame mot, employ\u00e9 au sens de sentence, r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de justice rendue par le tribunal. On notera que la sentence, elle, est toujours prospective, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher la pratique judiciaire d\u2019antidater les sentences (voir par. 719(1) C. cr.).\n[7] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le but d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire est d\u2019infliger au contrevenant une punition effective d\u2019une dur\u00e9e minimale pr\u00e9cise. Il en est ainsi puisque les objectifs qui sous-tendent une peine minimale sont aussi bien servis que celle\u2011ci soit purg\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence. En l\u2019occurrence, la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) ne fait pas exception \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle.\n[8] Correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) prescrit l\u2019infliction d\u2019une punition totale d\u2019un an \u00e0 purger, et non le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence condamnant ce dernier \u00e0 une interdiction d\u2019un an devant n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre purg\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on prospective. Comme le souligne le juge d\u2019appel Rosenberg dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McDonald, l\u2019intention du Parlement est respect\u00e9e, que la punition soit purg\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, puisque dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre l\u2019effet sur le contrevenant est identique. Ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) n\u2019interdisait pas au juge de premi\u00e8re instance de \u00ab r\u00e9duire \u00bb la sentence par l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit tenant compte de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle d\u2019interdiction de conduire, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la punition totale respectait toujours le minimum prescrit par le Parlement.\n[9] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, au moment o\u00f9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, Mme Basque avait essentiellement \u00ab commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 purger sa peine \u00bb depuis 21 mois (voir R. c. Sharma, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 814, p. 818, cit\u00e9 avec approbation par le juge Wagner, maintenant juge en chef, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, par. 113). Selon cette perspective, les objectifs vis\u00e9s par la peine minimale pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u2014 et m\u00eame d\u00e9pass\u00e9s. En pareil contexte, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour \u00ab r\u00e9duire \u00bb la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019interdiction impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Basque n\u2019entre pas en conflit avec l\u2019al. 259(1)a), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode de prohibition de conduire exc\u00e9dant la dur\u00e9e minimale d\u2019un an prescrite par cette disposition. En outre, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit r\u00e9pond aux consid\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de justice \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, dont celle que le juge Paciocco a utilement appel\u00e9e, dans un article de doctrine, [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019aversion pour la double punition \u00bb (D. M. Paciocco, \u00ab The Law of Minimum Sentences : Judicial Responses and Responsibility \u00bb (2015), 19 Rev. can. D.P. 173, p. 211).\n[10] En somme, aucun conflit ne r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019application concomitante de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) et de la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit. Au moment du prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, le tribunal est tenu d\u2019infliger la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an, mais rien dans la loi ne l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019octroyer ensuite un cr\u00e9dit. De m\u00eame, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue au par. 719(1) C. cr. En effet, seule la sentence doit commencer au moment o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e, et non la punition minimale d\u2019un an purg\u00e9e en application de l\u2019al. 259(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, ces dispositions l\u00e9gislatives n\u2019\u00e9cartent pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire reconnu aux juges des peines dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse. Bien entendu, le Parlement demeure libre, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des balises impos\u00e9es par la Constitution, de limiter ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, mais il doit alors le faire au moyen d\u2019une \u00ab disposition claire \u00e0 cet effet \u00bb (Lizotte c. Aviva, Compagnie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2016 CSC 52, [2016] 2 R.C.S. 521, par. 56). Il n\u2019y a rien de tel en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) \u00e9tant silencieux sur la question de l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit.\n[11] Par ailleurs, la codification au par. 719(3) C. cr. du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle n\u2019a aucune incidence sur le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Tout comme l\u2019al. 259(1)a), le par. 719(3) ne souffre d\u2019aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 et est tout aussi silencieux sur l\u2019interdiction de conduire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition analogue en mati\u00e8re de prohibition de conduire ne d\u00e9note pas une intention positive du Parlement d\u2019\u00e9liminer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire reconnu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, d\u2019ailleurs rendu post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019adoption du par. 719(3).\n[12] Au vu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, et puisque Mme Basque a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 une interdiction de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 21 mois, l\u2019imposition d\u2019une p\u00e9riode additionnelle d\u2019un an \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une sorte de double punition, contrairement aux exigences les plus fondamentales de justice et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Conscient de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ordonn\u00e9 une interdiction de conduire d\u2019un an, mais a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mme Basque avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 satisfait \u00e0 cette condition. Cependant, il a antidat\u00e9 la sentence de Mme Basque pour arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat. Avec \u00e9gards, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une erreur. En effet, il aurait pu, \u00e0 bon droit, infliger la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an prescrite par l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr., pr\u00e9ciser que la sentence commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e aux termes du par. 719(1) C. cr. et, ensuite, octroyer un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle d\u2019interdiction de conduire en application du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui reconna\u00eet la common law, pouvoir qui n\u2019est nullement \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le Code criminel .\n[13] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je propose d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel du Nouveau\u2011Brunswick. Je r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires et je r\u00e9tablirais en partie, pour des motifs distincts, les conclusions du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, en pr\u00e9cisant que l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9 l\u2019interdiction minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr.\nII. Faits\n[14] Dans la nuit du 7 octobre 2017, l\u2019appelante conduit son v\u00e9hicule dans le centre\u2011ville de Moncton, au Nouveau\u2011Brunswick. Le constable Richard, qui patrouille dans cette zone, remarque la conduite erratique du v\u00e9hicule et proc\u00e8de \u00e0 son interception. L\u2019interaction entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019agent se d\u00e9roule en fran\u00e7ais, suivant la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence exprim\u00e9e par Mme Basque. Le constable lui fait subir un alcootest, qui r\u00e9v\u00e8le une alcool\u00e9mie sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la limite l\u00e9gale. Madame Basque est alors arr\u00eat\u00e9e pour avoir conduit un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur alors que son alcool\u00e9mie exc\u00e9dait 80 mg d\u2019alcool pour 100 ml de sang.\n[15] Le 30 novembre, Mme Basque est remise en libert\u00e9 sous promesse de ne pas conduire de v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur. Elle sera accus\u00e9e de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies en violation de l\u2019ancien al. 253(1)b) C. cr.\n[16] Madame Basque inscrit d\u2019abord un plaidoyer de non\u2011culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e contre elle. Le proc\u00e8s est alors fix\u00e9 \u00e0 juin 2018, mais ensuite ajourn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande. En octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, Mme Basque plaide coupable et exprime son intention de demander une absolution conditionnelle en vertu du par. 255(5) C. cr. (maintenant abrog\u00e9).\n[17] Lors de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la peine en Cour provinciale \u2014 retard\u00e9e par des ajournements \u2014, Mme Basque renonce \u00e0 son droit de proc\u00e9der en fran\u00e7ais et abandonne sa demande d\u2019absolution conditionnelle. Apr\u00e8s discussion de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires, il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Mme Basque doit se voir imposer, aux termes de l\u2019al. 259(1)a), une interdiction applicable en cas de premi\u00e8re infraction. Le minist\u00e8re public ne demande pas de peine d\u2019emprisonnement, et les parties arrivent \u00e0 un accord quant au montant de l\u2019amende \u00e0 fixer dans son cas.\n[18] Entre sa comparution initiale et le prononc\u00e9 de sa peine, Mme Basque a \u00e9t\u00e9 assujettie \u00e0 une interdiction de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 21 mois.\nIII. Historique des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires\nA. Cour provinciale du Nouveau-Brunswick (le juge McCarroll)\n[19] Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine prend acte du pass\u00e9 difficile de Mme Basque, lequel inclut une enfance marqu\u00e9e par de nombreux abus. Il note \u00e9galement l\u2019importance que rev\u00eat pour elle la conduite de son v\u00e9hicule. En effet, elle a besoin de se rendre \u00e0 Fredericton afin de participer aux audiences relatives \u00e0 la garde de ses enfants, et l\u2019utilisation du transport en commun \u00e0 cette fin la place dans une situation de pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Sensible \u00e0 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et tenant compte du fait que Mme Basque a \u00e9t\u00e9 assujettie \u00e0 une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire de 21 mois, le juge acc\u00e8de \u00e0 sa demande non contest\u00e9e de ne pas imposer une interdiction additionnelle.\n[20] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le juge commente ainsi les possibles modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il doit rendre : [traduction] \u00ab . . . je ne suis pas certain si je devrais \u00e9crire, p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction de conduire pendant un an qui est termin\u00e9e en raison des deux ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles \u2013 il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit de conduire [par suite de l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle], ou simplement, aucune interdiction de conduire. Je suis enclin \u00e0 retenir la premi\u00e8re approche parce que la loi m\u2019oblige \u00e0 \u2013 \u00e0 ordonner [l\u2019interdiction] \u2013 mais j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est plus prudent de \u2013 de l\u2019ordonner puis de l\u2019antidater et de dire, vous savez, elle est d\u00e9j\u00e0 priv\u00e9e de son permis par ordonnance du tribunal depuis \u2013 depuis plus de deux ans \u00bb (d.a., vol. I, p. 16). Finalement, le juge choisit d\u2019antidater l\u2019ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 Mme Basque de conduire un v\u00e9hicule au 30 novembre 2017 \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le premier jour de l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle \u2014 de telle sorte que cette prohibition est enti\u00e8rement compl\u00e9t\u00e9e en date de la d\u00e9cision. Il impose \u00e9galement l\u2019amende minimale de 1 000 $.\nB. Cour du Banc de la Reine du Nouveau-Brunswick, 2020 NBBR 130 (le juge Dysart)\n[21] Le juge d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires est saisi d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re public, qui soutient que le premier juge a err\u00e9 en droit en antidatant la sentence. Or, s\u2019appuyant sur les enseignements de notre Cour dans les arr\u00eats Lacasse et Wust, il rejette l\u2019appel, concluant que le premier juge pouvait accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une prohibition pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire, dans la mesure o\u00f9 une telle prohibition constitue une condition de remise en libert\u00e9 et fait \u00e9galement partie de la peine ult\u00e9rieurement inflig\u00e9e (par. 28 (CanLII)).\n[22] Illustrant son propos \u00e0 l\u2019aide de deux d\u00e9cisions prenant appui sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse \u2014 R. c. Bland, 2016 YKSC 61, 3 M.V.R. (7th) 112, et R. c. Edwards (2016), 382 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 225 (C. prov. T.\u2011N.\u2011L.) \u2014, le juge d\u2019appel souligne que le premier juge n\u2019a pas impos\u00e9 une interdiction d\u2019une dur\u00e9e inf\u00e9rieure au minimum pr\u00e9vu par le Code criminel . La d\u00e9cision du premier juge a eu pour effet d\u2019imposer \u00e0 Mme Basque une prohibition de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e totale d\u2019un an, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr., puis de lui accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour la prohibition pr\u00e9sentencielle \u00e0 laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise (par. 29). En cela, il n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en droit. Enfin, le juge d\u2019appel souligne que l\u2019erreur ayant consist\u00e9 \u00e0 antidater la sentence n\u2019a eu aucun impact sur la d\u00e9cision rendue, puisqu\u2019aucune interdiction additionnelle de conduire n\u2019\u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (par. 30).\nC. Cour d\u2019appel du Nouveau-Brunswick, 2021 NBCA 50, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 54 (le juge en chef Richard, avec l\u2019accord de la juge Baird; le juge French, dissident)\n[23] Devant la Cour d\u2019appel, la question en litige est formul\u00e9e ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Le juge de la cour d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires a\u2011t\u2011il confirm\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment que le juge de la Cour provinciale avait comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9duire la p\u00e9riode de l\u2019interdiction de conduire obligatoire prescrite [\u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a)] (maintenant l\u2019al. 320.24(2)a)) sous le seuil minimal d\u2019un an, en cr\u00e9ditant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Mme Basque) la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle elle avait subi l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle comme condition de sa mise en libert\u00e9 sur remise d\u2019une promesse? \u00bb (par. 10). Le juge en chef Richard pr\u00e9cise que la question n\u2019est pas celle de savoir si la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle \u00e9coul\u00e9e peut r\u00e9duire la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction post\u00e9rieure au proc\u00e8s, \u00ab mais bien si elle peut r\u00e9duire cette p\u00e9riode sous le seuil minimal d\u2019un an \u00bb (par. 12 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[24] La Cour d\u2019appel se divise sur cette question. La majorit\u00e9, sous la plume du juge en chef, fait droit \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re public et accueille l\u2019appel. Bien qu\u2019il soit effectivement possible d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire dans certaines circonstances, \u00e9crit la majorit\u00e9, il n\u2019existe aucune autorit\u00e9 permettant d\u2019octroyer un tel cr\u00e9dit de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9carter une peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue par la loi. La majorit\u00e9 mentionne que l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse ne peut servir de guide en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, puisque cet arr\u00eat porte sur une interdiction \u00ab discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00bb de conduire n\u2019impliquant pas une peine minimale obligatoire (par. 18-19). Les peines minimales obligatoires ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour objet de limiter le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont jouissent les tribunaux. De plus, le pourvoi dont la Cour d\u2019appel est saisie diff\u00e8re fondamentalement de l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, lequel portait sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle en vertu du par. 719(3). Or, il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019\u00e9quivalent au par. 719(3) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interdiction de conduire.\n[25] Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 selon la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) n\u2019est pas ambigu, disent les juges majoritaires, et aucun cr\u00e9dit ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 afin de permettre que soit impos\u00e9e une interdiction qui serait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e inf\u00e9rieure au minimum prescrit par cette disposition. Par ailleurs, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation propos\u00e9e par Mme Basque viderait de son sens le par. 719(3), car l\u2019exception qu\u2019il \u00e9tablit s\u2019appliquerait alors \u00e0 toutes les peines minimales obligatoires et non plus seulement, comme le pr\u00e9voit ce texte, aux peines d\u2019emprisonnement (par. 27). La majorit\u00e9 rejette l\u2019argument suivant lequel la non\u2011disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats absurdes, notant que \u00ab [s]i les peines minimales obligatoires sont parfois in\u00e9quitables, il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la Cour de les qualifier d\u2019absurdes \u00bb (par. 31). Puisqu\u2019une peine commence \u00e0 courir \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e, un tel cr\u00e9dit ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00ab en l\u2019absence d\u2019une contestation constitutionnelle couronn\u00e9e de succ\u00e8s ou d\u2019indications claires de la Cour supr\u00eame \u00bb (par. 39). Dans les circonstances, le juge d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires a eu tort de cr\u00e9diter \u00e0 Mme Basque la dur\u00e9e de son interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire, faisant ainsi d\u00e9faut d\u2019imposer la peine minimale obligatoire.\n[26] Le juge French, dissident, \u00e9crit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun doute que la loi exige l\u2019infliction d\u2019une interdiction de conduire pendant une p\u00e9riode correspondant au moins \u00e0 la peine minimale applicable. Toutefois, il est d\u2019avis que l\u2019interdiction peut \u00eatre r\u00e9duite \u00ab sous le seuil de la peine minimale applicable \u00bb par l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la p\u00e9riode totale de l\u2019interdiction demeure sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire (par. 58).\n[27] Bien que le texte de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) soit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement clair, le juge dissident consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il est ambigu quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit. Citant l\u2019arr\u00eat McDonald, et proc\u00e9dant par analogie avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, il souligne que des r\u00e9sultats absurdes s\u2019ensuivraient si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) \u00e9tait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 emp\u00eacher l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit. En outre, l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3) C. cr. en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interdiction de conduire ne signifie pas que le Parlement a eu l\u2019intention de prohiber l\u2019octroi d\u2019un tel cr\u00e9dit. De fait, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, la Cour a explicitement reconnu la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel cr\u00e9dit soit accord\u00e9 dans le contexte d\u2019une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire et que ce principe \u00ab est d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb (par. 121).\n[28] Enfin, tant les juges majoritaires que le juge dissident s\u2019accordent sur l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Basque. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019ait pas initialement contest\u00e9 ses conditions de remise en libert\u00e9, celles\u2011ci \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables. Cette interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle a fait en sorte que Mme Basque a dans les faits \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement avant le prononc\u00e9 de sa sentence qu\u2019apr\u00e8s celui\u2011ci. Compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de cette affaire, et afin d\u2019\u00e9viter la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une injustice et l\u2019infliction d\u2019une \u00ab peine disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb, la Cour d\u2019appel conclut qu\u2019il y a lieu de suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de toute interdiction additionnelle (motifs de la majorit\u00e9, par. 54; voir aussi les motifs du juge dissident, par. 132).\nIV. Question en litige\n[29] Madame Basque soul\u00e8ve plusieurs questions devant la Cour. Celles\u2011ci se r\u00e9sument dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant : La p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle d\u2019interdiction de conduire purg\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante peut-elle lui \u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9e malgr\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. c.r.?\nV. Analyse\nA. Principales dispositions l\u00e9gislatives\n[30] L\u2019ancien par. 259(1) C. cr. pr\u00e9voyait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des faits des ordonnances d\u2019interdiction de conduire obligatoires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certaines infractions de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies, dont l\u2019infraction punissable sur d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9 pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (de mani\u00e8re similaire, voir l\u2019actuel par. 320.24(2) C. cr., adopt\u00e9 par L.C. 2018, c. 21). Les alin\u00e9as 259(1)a), b) et c) \u00e9tablissaient une gradation d\u2019interdictions minimales obligatoires tenant compte des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents du contrevenant en la mati\u00e8re :\nMandatory order of prohibition 259 (1) When an offender is convicted of an offence committed under section 253 or 254 [. . .], the court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, or from operating a vessel or an aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be,\nOrdonnance d\u2019interdiction obligatoire 259 (1) Lorsqu\u2019un contrevenant est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019une infraction pr\u00e9vue aux articles 253 ou 254 [. . .], le tribunal qui lui inflige une peine doit, en plus de toute autre peine applicable \u00e0 cette infraction, rendre une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur dans une rue, sur un chemin ou une grande route ou dans tout autre lieu public, un bateau, un a\u00e9ronef ou du mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire :\n(a) for a first offence, during a period of not more than three years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than one year;\na) pour une premi\u00e8re infraction, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019un an et maximale de trois ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9;\n(b) for a second offence, during a period of not more than five years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than two years; and\nb) pour une deuxi\u00e8me infraction, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale de deux ans et maximale de cinq ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9;\n(c) for each subsequent offence, during a period of not less than three years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment.\nc) pour chaque infraction subs\u00e9quente, durant une p\u00e9riode minimale de trois ans, en plus de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 laquelle il est condamn\u00e9.\n[31] Faisant partie de la section du Code criminel ayant trait aux \u00ab Peines en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb, le par. 718.3(2) C. cr. pr\u00e9voit que la peine \u00e0 infliger (en anglais \u00ab punishment to be imposed \u00bb) est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions contenues dans la disposition prescrivant la peine en question :\nDiscretion respecting punishment [718.3](2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.\nAppr\u00e9ciation du tribunal [718.3](2) Lorsqu\u2019une disposition prescrit une peine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une infraction, la peine \u00e0 infliger est, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions contenues dans la disposition, laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal qui condamne l\u2019auteur de l\u2019infraction, mais nulle peine n\u2019est une peine minimale \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e telle.\n[32] L\u2019article 719 a \u00e9galement retenu l\u2019attention des parties. Son premier paragraphe est intitul\u00e9 \u00ab D\u00e9but de la peine \u00bb (en anglais, le mot \u00ab sentence \u00bb est utilis\u00e9 dans ce contexte comme \u00e9quivalent de \u00ab peine \u00bb). Le paragraphe 719(3) porte le titre \u00ab Infliction de la peine \u00bb (en anglais \u00ab Determination of sentence \u00bb). Ces dispositions sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ainsi :\nCommencement of sentence 719 (1) A sentence commences when it is imposed, except where a relevant enactment otherwise provides. . . . Determination of sentence (3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.\nD\u00e9but de la peine 719 (1) La peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e, sauf lorsque le texte l\u00e9gislatif applicable y pourvoit de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. . . . Infliction de la peine (3) Pour fixer la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019une infraction, le tribunal peut prendre en compte toute p\u00e9riode que la personne a pass\u00e9e sous garde par suite de l\u2019infraction; il doit, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, restreindre le temps allou\u00e9 pour cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un maximum d\u2019un jour pour chaque jour pass\u00e9 sous garde.\n[33] Avant toute chose, il est utile de souligner que l\u2019usage linguistique dans ce domaine de la p\u00e9nologie manque souvent d\u2019uniformit\u00e9, tant dans la l\u00e9gislation que dans la jurisprudence et la doctrine. Dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 du par. 259(1) C. cr., le Parlement faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab ordonnance d\u2019interdiction obligatoire \u00bb \/ \u00ab mandatory order of prohibition \u00bb. Dans les motifs r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais de la Cour d\u2019appel dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, on emploie tant\u00f4t \u00ab mandatory minimum \u00bb, tant\u00f4t \u00ab mandatory minimum sentence \u00bb ou \u00ab mandatory driving prohibition \u00bb. Dans la version fran\u00e7aise des m\u00eames motifs, les expressions \u00ab peine minimale obligatoire \u00bb et \u00ab p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019interdiction \u00bb pr\u00e9dominent. Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, dans le Code criminel , les termes \u00ab peine minimale \u00bb \/ \u00ab minimum punishment \u00bb sont souvent employ\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9quivalents (voir, p. ex., R. c. Hilbach, 2023 CSC 3, par. 2 et 12, interpr\u00e9tant l\u2019art. 344(1) C. cr. et employant tant \u00ab peine minimale obligatoire \u00bb \/ \u00ab mandatory minimum sentence \u00bb que \u00ab peine minimale obligatoire \u00bb \/ \u00ab mandatory minimum punishment \u00bb). Cela dit, pour reprendre le propos de la juge Arbour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, \u00ab [c]e n\u2019est pas tant les mots utilis\u00e9s dans les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise qui importent, mais plut\u00f4t les concepts qu\u2019ils d\u00e9signent \u00bb (par. 36).\nB. Moyens d\u2019appel\n[34] Devant notre Cour, l\u2019appelante conc\u00e8de que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en antidatant sa sentence; il aurait d\u00fb, reconna\u00eet\u2011elle, faire commencer la peine au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e aux termes du par. 719(1) C. cr. Elle reconna\u00eet aussi que l\u2019al. 259(1)a) pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019interdiction de conduire doit \u00eatre impos\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019au moins un an. Or, en adoptant pour l\u2019essentiel la position du juge d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019interdiction impos\u00e9e par le premier juge n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire. Suivant les enseignements de notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, elle est d\u2019avis qu\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[35] Le principal moyen de l\u2019appelante en est un d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative. Elle soutient que l\u2019al. 259(1)a) est silencieux quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction de conduire pr\u00e9sentencielle. En outre, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal d\u2019appliquer un tel cr\u00e9dit, pouvoir fond\u00e9 sur la common law, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 par les textes de loi pertinents. Par ailleurs, dit\u2011elle, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel entra\u00eene des r\u00e9sultats absurdes, dont l\u2019imposition de p\u00e9riodes d\u2019interdiction ne tenant pas compte de la gradation \u00e9tablie au par. 259(1), ce que ne peut avoir voulu le l\u00e9gislateur.\n[36] Le minist\u00e8re public intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie notamment sur l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. McIntosh, [1995] 1 R.C.S. 686, pour soutenir que les tribunaux doivent mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019intention claire du Parlement, m\u00eame si cela donne lieu \u00e0 des [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9sultat[s] absurde[s] ou embarrassant[s] \u00bb (recueil condens\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9, p. 1). \u00c0 son avis, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) et le par. 719(1) ne sont nullement ambigus : le Parlement dicte aux juges qu\u2019ils doivent infliger au contrevenant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction minimale d\u2019un an devant commencer au moment du prononc\u00e9 de la sentence. En l\u2019absence de contestation constitutionnelle des dispositions applicables, les tribunaux doivent donner effet \u00e0 cette intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[37] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 rappelle que le l\u00e9gislateur est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de sa loi. En l\u2019occurrence, il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer que le Parlement n\u2019ignorait pas que certains accus\u00e9s sont assujettis \u00e0 une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, tout porte \u00e0 croire qu\u2019en adoptant l\u2019al. 259(1)a), le Parlement a choisi de ne pas \u00e9dicter, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interdictions de conduire, de disposition \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3). Dans ce contexte, poursuit l\u2019intim\u00e9, il faudrait rejeter l\u2019argument voulant que le silence du l\u00e9gislateur implique que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de common law demeure intact. La lecture de l\u2019al. 259(1)a), ainsi que des par. 718.3(2), 719(1) et 719(3), r\u00e9v\u00e8le que ce pouvoir de common law a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 par l\u2019effet conjugu\u00e9 de la peine minimale obligatoire et de la r\u00e8gle prescrivant que la peine commence le jour o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e.\n[38] Sans se prononcer sur le sort de l\u2019appel, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta intervient au soutien de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation propos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019intervenant avance que le silence du Parlement quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit ne saurait contrecarrer l\u2019intention claire du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019imposer la peine minimale obligatoire commen\u00e7ant le jour du prononc\u00e9 de la sentence. L\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse ne serait d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, puisque cette affaire ne concernait pas une peine minimale obligatoire.\nC. Cadre d\u2019analyse : la coexistence de la common law et de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine\n[39] Les deux parties s\u2019entendent sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire permettant au juge de la peine d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction de conduire pr\u00e9sentencielle. Or, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, le minist\u00e8re public soutient que ce pouvoir fond\u00e9 sur la common law a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9 ou \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le Parlement par l\u2019adoption de la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. Ce pourvoi soul\u00e8ve donc la question de savoir si la r\u00e8gle de common law peut, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelante, coexister harmonieusement avec la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue par le Code criminel .\n[40] Cette question am\u00e8ne la Cour \u00e0 se pencher sur les interactions parfois complexes qui caract\u00e9risent la relation entre la common law et la l\u00e9gislation. Bien que la l\u00e9gislation puisse \u00eatre pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante sur la common law, cette derni\u00e8re demeure applicable dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle n\u2019est pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire, principe souvent justifi\u00e9 par l\u2019importance de la \u00ab stabilit\u00e9 du droit \u00bb (R. c. D.L.W., 2016 CSC 22, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 402, par. 21, le juge Cromwell). Au nom d\u2019une Cour unanime dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lizotte, le juge Gascon rappelle le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral relatif \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart par voie l\u00e9gislative de r\u00e8gles de common law : \u00ab La jurisprudence veut que l\u2019on doive pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019un l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de modifier les r\u00e8gles de common law existantes \u00e0 moins d\u2019une disposition claire \u00e0 cet effet . . . \u00bb (par. 56). La professeure Ruth Sullivan a \u00e9crit que cette pr\u00e9somption [traduction] \u00ab permet aux tribunaux d\u2019insister sur la pr\u00e9sence de directives pr\u00e9cises et explicites du l\u00e9gislateur avant d\u2019accepter tout changement. De cette fa\u00e7on, la common law est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre les empi\u00e9tements d\u00e9coulant d\u2019impr\u00e9cisions ou d\u2019inadvertances l\u00e9gislatives \u00bb (The Construction of Statutes (7e \u00e9d. 2022), \u00a7 17.01.Pt1[2]; voir aussi P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et M. Devinat, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (5e \u00e9d. 2021), nos 180\u2011192).\n[41] Le droit criminel canadien se compose \u00e0 la fois du droit \u00e9tabli par le l\u00e9gislateur et de principes de common law (M. Vauclair et T. Desjardins, avec la collaboration de P. Lachance, Trait\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de preuve et de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nales 2022 (29e \u00e9d. 2022), nos 1.17\u20111.24, citant notamment D.L.W., par. 3, 15 et 57\u201159). L\u2019adoption au pays d\u2019un code criminel en 1892 n\u2019a pas eu pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter syst\u00e9matiquement la common law en tant que source du droit (D. H. Brown, The Genesis of the Canadian Criminal Code of 1892 (1989), p. 126; G. H. Crouse, \u00ab A Critique of Canadian Criminal Legislation : Part One \u00bb (1934), 12 R. du B. can. 545, p. 565 : [traduction] \u00ab Un principe fondamental de la codification canadienne est que la common law n\u2019est pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e. \u00bb). Aujourd\u2019hui, le Code criminel dispose qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la common law n\u2019est plus une source d\u2019infractions au Canada (al. 9a)). Il pr\u00e9voit par contre que les moyens de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vus par la common law demeurent en vigueur, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont modifi\u00e9s par la loi (par. 8(3); R. c. Tim, 2022 CSC 12, par. 27; voir aussi J. Fortin et L. Viau, Trait\u00e9 de droit p\u00e9nal g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (1982), p. 18). Comme l\u2019enseignent les auteurs Vauclair et Desjardins, on peut se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la common law pour interpr\u00e9ter le texte d\u2019incrimination qui codifie une infraction de common law (no 3.20, citant R. c. Jobidon, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 714).\n[42] Cette coexistence de la l\u00e9gislation et de la common law anime le droit relatif \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la peine (voir Commission canadienne sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine, Structure de la d\u00e9termination de la peine au Canada : perspectives historiques (1988), p. 42). Alors que la partie XXIII du Code criminel codifie \u00ab les principes fondamentaux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00bb (R. c. Gladue, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 688, par. 1), les tribunaux peuvent aussi tenir compte [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019autres principes et facteurs d\u00e9coulant de la common law \u00bb (D. Rose, Quigley\u2019s Criminal Procedure in Canada (feuilles mobiles), \u00a7 23:6). La l\u00e9gislation a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur la common law en cette mati\u00e8re dans la mesure o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur l\u2019\u00e9carte explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire (voir, p. ex., R. c. Skolnick, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 47, p. 58).\n[43] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, la Cour a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que les tribunaux doivent tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle de l\u2019interdiction de conduire dans l\u2019exercice de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit (par. 111\u2011114, le juge Wagner; voir aussi par. 176\u2011178, le juge Gascon, dissident, mais pas sur ce point). Il est vrai que l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse ne concernait pas une peine minimale obligatoire et que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(2)a.1) C. cr., la sentence avait commenc\u00e9 au terme de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du contrevenant. Toutefois, cet arr\u00eat peut nous guider en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, avec les adaptations n\u00e9cessaires.\n[44] L\u2019octroi d\u2019un tel cr\u00e9dit est ancr\u00e9 dans la common law; il s\u2019agit d\u2019une manifestation, dans le contexte de l\u2019interdiction de conduire, de ce que la juge Arbour a qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab pratique bien \u00e9tablie qu\u2019appliquaient les juges d\u00e9terminant la peine et qui consistait \u00e0 prendre en compte la p\u00e9riode pass\u00e9e sous garde par le d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (Wust, par. 31). Pour reprendre la description du juge Paciocco, maintenant juge de la Cour d\u2019appel, cette r\u00e8gle fait partie des [traduction] \u00ab principes centraux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine non exprim\u00e9s l\u00e9gislativement mais toujours bien vivants au titre de \u201cprincipes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine\u201d \u00bb (R. c. Pham, 2013 ONCJ 635, 296 C.R.R. (2d) 178, par. 18). Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment le juge Wagner dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse, ce principe n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une codification. Alors que le principe permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit a \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9 au par. 719(3) C. cr. en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle, cette disposition n\u2019a aucun \u00e9quivalent l\u00e9gislatif en mati\u00e8re de prohibition pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient ici que le principe auquel la Cour fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lacasse a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 par l\u2019adoption par le Parlement de la peine minimale obligatoire, une consid\u00e9ration \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux faits de cette derni\u00e8re affaire.\n[45] L\u2019interaction entre la l\u00e9gislation et la common law en mati\u00e8re de peine est donc au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Le cadre d\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes relatif \u00e0 cette interaction est bien \u00e9tabli. Dans un premier temps, il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00ab analyser, identifier et \u00e9noncer la common law applicable \u00bb puis, dans un second temps, de \u00ab pr\u00e9ciser l\u2019effet du droit statutaire sur la common law \u00bb (2747-3174 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. c. Qu\u00e9bec (R\u00e9gie des permis d\u2019alcool), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 919, par. 97, la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9, citant Zaidan Group Ltd. c. London (Ville), [1991] 3 R.C.S. 593, et Frame c. Smith, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 99; voir aussi Urban Mechanical Contracting Ltd. c. Zurich Insurance Co., 2022 ONCA 589, 163 O.R. (3d) 652, par. 45). Ainsi, il s\u2019agit d\u2019abord de d\u00e9terminer le contenu de la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit dans le cas d\u2019une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. Ensuite, il y a lieu d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr., tout en tenant compte du par. 719(3), afin de d\u00e9terminer si celui\u2011ci a pour effet de limiter, voire d\u2019\u00e9carter la r\u00e8gle de common law, que ce soit explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire.\n(1) La common law permet d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire\n[46] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la common law permet aux tribunaux d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire subie par un contrevenant (voir, p. ex., R. c. Goulding (1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 158 (C.S. (Div. app.)); R. c. Pellicore, [1997] O.J. No. 226 (QL), 1997 CarswellOnt 246 (WL) (C.A.); R. c. Williams, 2009 NBCP 16, 346 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 164; Bilodeau c. R., 2013 QCCA 980; Lacasse). Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire fond\u00e9 sur la common law est l\u2019extension naturelle d\u2019un principe analogue en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle. Les tribunaux ont reconnu de longue date qu\u2019il est possible de [traduction] \u00ab tenir compte, dans l\u2019infliction de la peine, de toute p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration que l\u2019accus\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9e entre la date de son arrestation et celle du prononc\u00e9 de sa sentence \u00bb (R. c. Sloan (1947), 87 C.C.C. 198 (C.A. Ont.), p. 198\u2011199, citant R. c. Patterson (1946), 87 C.C.C. 86 (C.A. Ont.)).\n[47] Le principe autorisant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle permet de pallier certaines injustices d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application du principe interdisant d\u2019antidater une sentence, aujourd\u2019hui codifi\u00e9 au par. 719(1). En effet, bien que le droit canadien ne permette pas aux tribunaux d\u2019antidater une sentence afin de la r\u00e9duire, ceux-ci peuvent n\u00e9anmoins consid\u00e9rer le temps pass\u00e9 en d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode devant \u00eatre purg\u00e9e par le contrevenant de fa\u00e7on prospective (Sloan, p. 198\u2011199; voir aussi Patterson; R. c. Wells (1969), 4 C.C.C. 25 (C.A. C.-B.), p. 36\u201137, le juge Bull, dissident; A. Manson, \u00ab Pre-Sentence Custody and the Determination of a Sentence (Or How to Make a Mole Hill out of a Mountain) \u00bb (2004), 49 C.L.Q. 292). L\u2019application de cette r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit n\u2019\u00e9quivaut donc pas \u00e0 antidater la sentence.\n[48] S\u2019il est vrai que la r\u00e8gle permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle est maintenant codifi\u00e9e, il n\u2019existe pas de disposition l\u00e9gislative \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3) en ce qui concerne les interdictions pr\u00e9sentencielles de conduire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019omission du Parlement d\u2019adopter une disposition \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3) en mati\u00e8re de prohibition pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et traduit son intention d\u2019\u00e9carter la r\u00e8gle de common law autorisant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit dans ce contexte. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, selon lui, le Parlement aurait [traduction] \u00ab envisag\u00e9 \u00bb la possibilit\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre une exception analogue pour la conduite, et l\u2019aurait implicitement rejet\u00e9e (transcription, p. 28). Avec \u00e9gards, je ne partage pas son avis. L\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative \u00e9quivalente au par. 719(3) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interdictions pr\u00e9sentencielles n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter ou de limiter la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit en pareil contexte.\n[49] L\u2019opinion voulant que le Parlement puisse codifier une r\u00e8gle de common law en vue d\u2019en exclure implicitement une autre rappelle la maxime d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation expressio unius est exclusio alterius, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00ab la mention de l\u2019un est (ou implique) l\u2019exclusion de l\u2019autre \u00bb (A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilis\u00e9es en droit (4e \u00e9d. 2007), p. 170; voir aussi Sullivan (2022), \u00a7 8.09; McClurg c. Canada, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 1020). Or, les tribunaux font preuve de prudence avant d\u2019accepter de tels arguments fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019intention du Parlement d\u2019exclure implicitement une r\u00e8gle de common law, le contexte ne permettant pas toujours de pr\u00e9sumer la pens\u00e9e non exprim\u00e9e d\u2019un l\u00e9gislateur (Sullivan (2022), \u00a7 17.01.Pt1[2]). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Turgeon c. Dominion Bank, [1930] R.C.S. 67, le juge Newcombe a formul\u00e9 la mise en garde selon laquelle cette r\u00e8gle, si elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un principe d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, peut \u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab un dangereux ma\u00eetre \u00e0 suivre \u00bb puisque son utilit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend du contexte et que \u00ab le r\u00e9dacteur ne l\u2019a pas toujours \u00e0 l\u2019esprit \u00bb (p. 71). Ainsi, le juge Cromwell a \u00e9crit qu\u2019\u00ab [e]n l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention contraire exprim\u00e9e clairement par le l\u00e9gislateur, une loi ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 modifier substantiellement le droit, y compris la common law \u00bb (D.L.W., par. 21). Cela \u00e9voque les enseignements du professeur C. K. Allen : [traduction] \u00ab . . . les tribunaux, si cela leur est possible, ne permettront pas qu\u2019un texte de loi \u00e9carte une r\u00e8gle de common law existante simplement par voie d\u2019inf\u00e9rence \u00bb et, de poursuivre l\u2019auteur, \u00ab [l]a situation est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente lorsque la disposition l\u00e9gislative est explicite, ou qu\u2019il se d\u00e9gage une intention g\u00e9n\u00e9rale claire de modifier le droit \u00bb (Law in the Making (1992), p. 258\u2011259 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[50] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le par. 719(3) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique de la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle. Les d\u00e9bats parlementaires tendent \u00e0 indiquer que l\u2019intention du Parlement, en adoptant cette disposition, \u00e9tait de s\u2019assurer que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit demeurait possible dans le cas d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de d\u00e9tention (Wust, par. 31, citant D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 3, 3e sess., 28e l\u00e9g., 5 f\u00e9vrier 1971, p. 3118). Rien n\u2019indique que le Parlement se soit pench\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit pour les interdictions pr\u00e9sentencielles de conduire. De m\u00eame, les d\u00e9bats parlementaires n\u2019offrent aucune indication \u00e9tayant la th\u00e8se suivant laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur aurait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9carter, que ce soit explicitement ou par implication n\u00e9cessaire, la r\u00e8gle de common law applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces interdictions. En somme, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas de figure o\u00f9 le Parlement aurait fait clairement \u00e9tat de son intention d\u2019\u00e9carter ou de limiter la common law applicable.\n[51] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019estime que l\u2019adoption du par. 719(3) C. cr. n\u2019a pas pour effet de limiter la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire. Cette r\u00e8gle fait donc toujours partie du droit positif en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Cela \u00e9tant, il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e ou limit\u00e9e par le par. 259(1) C. cr., lequel \u00e9tablit, comme nous le rappelle l\u2019intim\u00e9, des p\u00e9riodes d\u2019interdictions maximales et minimales obligatoires.\n(2) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 259(1)a) C. cr. ne limite pas la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire\n[52] Une fois la r\u00e8gle de common law identifi\u00e9e, la seconde \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse consiste \u00e0 examiner l\u2019effet de la disposition l\u00e9gislative pertinente sur celle-ci (2747\u20113174 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., par. 97). Ce faisant, il convient de cerner la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. suivant la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership c. Rex, 2002 CSC 42, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 559), puis de d\u00e9terminer si cette disposition a pour effet de limiter, voire d\u2019\u00e9carter la r\u00e8gle de common law.\n[53] Avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette analyse, il importe de bien comprendre la distinction entre les notions de punition et de sentence, ent\u00e9rin\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust. Cette distinction, qui touche au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, est essentielle \u00e0 une juste interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 259(1)a).\na) La distinction entre les notions de punition et de sentence\n[54] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, la Cour devait trancher la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019accorder au contrevenant un cr\u00e9dit pour d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle, dans la mesure o\u00f9, du fait de ce cr\u00e9dit, la sentence prononc\u00e9e serait inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019ancien al. 344a) (aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019al. 344(1)a)). La juge Arbour, \u00e9crivant pour une Cour unanime, a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question par l\u2019affirmative. D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, elle a soulign\u00e9 que le par. 719(3) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans le but d\u2019autoriser un tel cr\u00e9dit en cas de peine minimale obligatoire. De surcro\u00eet, et de fa\u00e7on significative, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun conflit ne r\u00e9sultait de l\u2019application concomitante du par. 719(3) et de l\u2019al. 344a). La juge Arbour a expliqu\u00e9 que cette absence de conflit d\u00e9coule de la distinction conceptuelle entre une peine au sens de punition et une peine au sens de sentence.\n[55] Cette distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e sous l\u2019angle des termes anglais \u00ab punishment \u00bb et \u00ab sentence \u00bb par le juge Rosenberg dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McDonald, en s\u2019appuyant sur les travaux de la Commission canadienne sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine. La Commission a clarifi\u00e9 que le terme \u00ab punishment \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019imposition d\u2019une privation s\u00e9v\u00e8re \u00e0 une personne jug\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible \u00bb (R\u00e9former la sentence : une approche canadienne (1987), p. 119). Elle a ensuite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le terme \u00ab sentence \u00bb \u2014 qui vient du mot latin sententia signifiant \u00ab opinion ou expression d\u2019une opinion \u00bb \u2014 s\u2019entend de la d\u00e9claration du tribunal ordonnant l\u2019infliction d\u2019une sanction et d\u00e9terminant ce qu\u2019elle sera (p. 121).\n[56] On peut donc dire que la notion de punition diff\u00e8re fondamentalement de celle de sentence, en ce que la premi\u00e8re refl\u00e8te la punition globale inflig\u00e9e au contrevenant, alors que la seconde n\u2019a trait qu\u2019\u00e0 la partie de cette punition que celui\u2011ci doit purger apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 du jugement. Rien dans la jurisprudence ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019application de cette distinction en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je prends note du fait que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mathieu, 2008 CSC 21, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 723, une affaire portant sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle suivant une p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle de d\u00e9tention provisoire, la Cour a conclu que la \u00ab peine \u00bb \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette fin se limite \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode qui suit le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, tout en reconnaissant qu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 la question diff\u00e9remment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust (par. 7). Par ailleurs, aux fins de l\u2019emprisonnement avec sursis, la \u00ab peine \u00bb \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer s\u2019entend plut\u00f4t de la punition globale subie par le contrevenant, incluant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle (R. c. Fice, 2005 CSC 32, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 742). De m\u00eame, lorsque les tribunaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 trancher l\u2019effet d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une peine maximale pr\u00e9vue par la loi, certaines cours d\u2019appel provinciales ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de notre Cour dans les arr\u00eats Wust et Fice, que la notion de \u00ab peine \u00bb d\u00e9signe la punition globale et non la sentence (R. c. Walker, 2017 ONCA 39, 345 C.C.C. (3d) 497, par. 20\u201126; R. c. Severight, 2014 ABCA 25, 566 A.R. 344, par. 32; R. c. LeBlanc, 2005 NBCA 6, 279 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 121, par. 63).\n[57] La distinction entre \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de punition et \u00ab peine \u00bb au sens de sentence est consacr\u00e9e dans le lexique fran\u00e7ais du droit canadien, en tenant compte de la polys\u00e9mie du terme \u00ab peine \u00bb (Commission canadienne sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine (1987), p. 118 et 121). On notera que, selon le contexte, le terme \u00ab peine \u00bb peut renvoyer soit \u00e0 la punition globale subie par le contrevenant (en anglais \u00ab punishment \u00bb), soit \u00e0 la sentence prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui-ci (en anglais \u00ab sentence \u00bb) (voir le Lexique en droit p\u00e9nal de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec (en ligne)). C\u2019est ce qui a conduit la Commission \u00e0 \u00e9crire que la peine au sens de \u00ab punition \u00bb diff\u00e8re fondamentalement de la sentence. Le Juridictionnaire, ouvrage canadien de jurilinguistique publi\u00e9 par le Centre de traduction et de terminologie juridiques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, reprend cette distinction, soulignant que \u00ab [l]a peine [au sens de \u00ab punition \u00bb] est la sanction encourue, alors que la sentence est la d\u00e9cision de justice qui condamne \u00e0 une peine \u00bb (J. Picotte, Juridictionnaire : Recueil des difficult\u00e9s et des ressources du fran\u00e7ais juridique, 15 octobre 2018 (en ligne), p. 2035, par. 24 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Autrement dit, alors que la sentence commence le jour o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e par le tribunal, la punition englobe \u00ab [t]oute sanction inflig\u00e9e par une autorit\u00e9 judiciaire dans l\u2019application d\u2019une loi p\u00e9nale \u00bb (H. Dumont, P\u00e9nologie : Le droit canadien relatif aux peines et aux sentences (1993), p. 47).\n[58] Le double sens du terme \u00ab peine \u00bb est illustr\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs endroits dans le Code criminel . Par exemple, le par. 718.3(2), qui limite le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire, utilise le terme \u00ab peine \u00bb comme \u00e9quivalent du terme anglais \u00ab punishment \u00bb. Par contraste, le par. 719(1), qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]a peine commence au moment o\u00f9 elle est inflig\u00e9e \u00bb, emploie \u00e9galement le terme \u00ab peine \u00bb, mais cette fois \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9quivalent du terme anglais \u00ab sentence \u00bb. L\u2019identification de l\u2019\u00e9quivalent exact en anglais du terme \u00ab peine \u00bb (soit \u00ab punishment \u00bb, soit \u00ab sentence \u00bb) varie selon le contexte; ce doublet peut donc soulever des difficult\u00e9s interpr\u00e9tatives en droit criminel canadien, o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du lexique l\u00e9gislatif bilingue donnent \u00e0 chaque texte linguistique une vocation \u00e9gale \u00e0 dire le droit. Bien entendu, cela ne signifie pas que le terme anglais \u00ab sentence \u00bb est exclusivement employ\u00e9 pour r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de justice imposant une punition. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, l\u2019expression \u00ab fit sentence \u00bb (souvent rendue par \u00ab peine juste \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais) renvoie g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de la punition globale appropri\u00e9e (voir, p. ex., R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, par. 45).\n[59] Devant cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, et au\u2011del\u00e0 de la terminologie utilis\u00e9e, il y a lieu de porter une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019objet et au contexte des dispositions pertinentes (Wust, par. 36). Certes, on peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le l\u00e9gislateur s\u2019astreigne dans le discours l\u00e9gislatif \u00e0 une \u00ab discipline \u00bb consistant \u00e0 ne pas employer le m\u00eame mot dans des sens diff\u00e9rents au sein d\u2019une m\u00eame loi (G. Cornu, Linguistique juridique (3e \u00e9d. 2005), p. 105). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, les professeurs C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Devinat font \u00e9tat du \u00ab principe de l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 d\u2019expression \u00bb que le l\u00e9gislateur s\u2019efforce de respecter et qui justifie l\u2019existence, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, d\u2019une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle, dans une m\u00eame loi, \u00ab le m\u00eame terme a partout le m\u00eame sens \u00bb (nos 1142\u20111143). Or, constatent-ils, cette pr\u00e9somption \u00ab doit c\u00e9der le pas lorsqu\u2019il ressort des circonstances que telle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (no 1146, citant Schwartz c. Canada, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 254, par. 61). J\u2019estime que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un tel cas ici. Le mot \u00ab peine \u00bb est utilis\u00e9 dans des sens diff\u00e9rents dans le Code criminel , tant\u00f4t pour d\u00e9signer la sentence, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9cision de justice, tant\u00f4t la punition. Je pr\u00e9cise que la plupart des affaires n\u2019impliquant pas de p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction ou de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle ne reposent pas sur la distinction conceptuelle entre les notions de sentence et de punition.\n[60] Ayant ici cette distinction \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je souligne que l\u2019approche pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante dans son m\u00e9moire risque de pr\u00eater \u00e0 confusion. En effet, l\u2019appelante sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit entra\u00eene l\u2019imposition d\u2019une interdiction inf\u00e9rieure au minimum pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Cette approche fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 un courant jurisprudentiel exemplifi\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Sohal, 2019 ABCA 293, 91 Alta. L.R. (6th) 48, lequel ne semble pas distinguer les notions de punition et de sentence. Cette approche sugg\u00e8re, \u00e0 tort \u00e0 mon humble avis, que l\u2019adoption par le Parlement d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire oblige le tribunal \u00e0 prononcer une sentence minimale (voir aussi R. c. Fox, 2022 ABQB 132, 89 M.V.R. (7th) 23; R. c. Froese, 2020 MBQB 11, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 1; R. c. Osnach, 2019 MBPC 1, 38 M.V.R. (7th) 257; R. c. Bryden, 2007 NBBR 316, 323 R.N.\u2011B. (2e) 119). Selon cette approche, aucune assise juridique ne permet de r\u00e9duire la sentence minimale obligatoire, puisque [traduction] \u00ab [l]e pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire inh\u00e9rent du tribunal doit c\u00e9der devant le libell\u00e9 de la loi \u00bb (Sohal, par. 15).\n[61] Or, lorsque l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 sa pens\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle a reconnu \u2014 \u00e0 bon droit et \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge dissident en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 que le tribunal est contraint d\u2019imposer l\u2019interdiction minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue express\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a). Toutefois, l\u2019infliction de la peine minimale n\u2019exclut pas la prise en compte, en application de la r\u00e8gle de common law, de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle, laquelle peut, selon les circonstances et \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du premier juge, faire partie int\u00e9grante de la punition, si l\u2019effet de l\u2019interdiction est \u00ab identique \u00bb avant et apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence (Lacasse, par. 113). Autrement, si l\u2019effet n\u2019est pas identique, le tribunal ne peut en tenir compte qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de facteur att\u00e9nuant, et non \u00e0 titre de p\u00e9riode pouvant \u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9e en vertu du pouvoir de common law \u00e0 cet effet (voir les explications du juge MacPherson sur ce point dans R. c. Panday, 2007 ONCA 598, 87 O.R. (3d) 1, par. 32\u201135).\n[62] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la distinction r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e par la juge Arbour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, il importe d\u00e8s lors de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) exige l\u2019infliction d\u2019une punition minimale ou le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence minimale. Cet exercice interpr\u00e9tatif est d\u00e9cisif quant au sort du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. En effet, si l\u2019interdiction de conduire minimale pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a) constitue une peine minimale, au sens de punition, cet alin\u00e9a n\u2019aura aucune incidence sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle de common law. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire \u00e0 laquelle Mme Basque a \u00e9t\u00e9 assujettie pourra \u00ab r\u00e9duire \u00bb la dur\u00e9e ultime de sa sentence, tout en respectant la directive du l\u00e9gislateur portant que la punition minimale doit \u00eatre d\u2019une dur\u00e9e minimale d\u2019un an. Au contraire, si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) pr\u00e9voit une sentence minimale d\u2019un an, Mme Basque devra purger une p\u00e9riode de prohibition de conduire additionnelle d\u2019un an, cette sentence obligatoire ayant n\u00e9cessairement un caract\u00e8re prospectif (par. 719(1) C. cr.).\nb) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 259(1)a) pr\u00e9voit l\u2019infliction d\u2019une punition minimale et non le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence minimale\n[63] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, le sens de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. doit \u00eatre cern\u00e9 en examinant son texte, son contexte et son objet (Rizzo, par. 21; Bell ExpressVu, par. 26; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Devinat, nos 165\u2011170; E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2e \u00e9d. 1983), p. 87). Je propose de proc\u00e9der comme l\u2019a fait la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell ExpressVu, soit en d\u00e9butant par l\u2019analyse du sens ordinaire et grammatical des termes de l\u2019al. 259(1)a), avant de me pencher sur son contexte et son objet.\n[64] Tout d\u2019abord, le texte de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) est silencieux quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle de prohibition de conduire (Bland, par. 22). De surcro\u00eet, il n\u2019indique pas clairement si l\u2019interdiction de conduire minimale qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voit constitue une punition ou une sentence. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, soulignons que le terme \u00ab ordonnance \u00bb employ\u00e9 au par. 259(1) est d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant une \u00ab [d]\u00e9cision \u00e9manant d\u2019un juge \u00bb (Le Petit Robert (nouv. \u00e9d. 2022), p. 1755), ou comme \u00e9tant une \u00ab [d]\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal \u00bb (Multidictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise (7e \u00e9d. 2021), p. 1245). A priori, cette distinction peut sembler op\u00e9rer un rapprochement entre le terme \u00ab ordonnance \u00bb et le concept de \u00ab sentence \u00bb (Pham, par. 9).\n[65] Toutefois, il convient de signaler que le terme \u00ab peine \u00bb figure au par. 259(1), qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab le tribunal qui [. . .] inflige une peine [au contrevenant] doit, en plus de toute autre peine applicable \u00e0 cette infraction, rendre une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur \u00bb. Rappelons que la version anglaise utilise le terme \u00ab punishment \u00bb comme \u00e9quivalent du terme \u00ab peine \u00bb dans ce contexte. Le libell\u00e9 des deux textes linguistiques sugg\u00e8re donc que l\u2019ordonnance devant \u00eatre impos\u00e9e suivant les termes de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) est une punition et non une sentence.\n[66] \u00c0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la d\u00e9marche interpr\u00e9tative moderne ne saurait s\u2019attacher uniquement au libell\u00e9 de la disposition (Rizzo, par. 21; Bell ExpressVu, par. 26). Pour reprendre les propos des professeurs C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Devinat, le texte \u00ab doit \u00eatre confront\u00e9 aux indications fournies par les autres facteurs pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00bb (no 167). Je me tourne maintenant vers l\u2019analyse du contexte et de l\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 259(1)a).\n[67] Au regard du contexte de cet alin\u00e9a, je note le langage diff\u00e9rent utilis\u00e9 par le Parlement \u00e0 l\u2019al. 109(2)a) C. cr., lequel concerne une interdiction de possession d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab l\u2019ordonnance interdit au contrevenant d\u2019avoir en sa possession [. . .] des armes \u00e0 feu [. . .] pour une p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 la date de l\u2019ordonnance et se terminant au plus t\u00f4t dix ans apr\u00e8s sa lib\u00e9ration ou, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas emprisonn\u00e9 ni passible d\u2019emprisonnement, apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou son absolution \u00bb (je souligne). Or, en \u00e9dictant l\u2019al. 109(2)a), le Parlement a choisi de pr\u00e9ciser en toutes lettres la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019ordonnance prendra fin, limitant ainsi le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal de \u00ab r\u00e9duire \u00bb la p\u00e9riode prospective d\u2019interdiction en de\u00e7\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode minimale pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 109(2)a). En outre, le passage soulign\u00e9 d\u00e9montre que, lorsque le Parlement d\u00e9sire imposer une interdiction prospective d\u2019une dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise, il exprime cette volont\u00e9 en termes clairs. On ne trouve toutefois rien de tel \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a), qui ne pr\u00e9voit ni date de d\u00e9but, ni date de fin de l\u2019interdiction de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e minimale d\u2019un an.\n[68] L\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. renforce \u00e9galement l\u2019id\u00e9e que cette disposition pr\u00e9voit une punition minimale, et non une sentence minimale. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, en adoptant des peines minimales obligatoires, le Parlement poursuit des buts essentiellement dissuasifs et punitifs (voir H. Parent et J. Desrosiers, Trait\u00e9 de droit criminel, t. III, La peine (3e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 507\u2011508; voir aussi Paciocco, p. 177). Apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 une typologie d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des peines en droit criminel canadien, la professeure Dumont affirme que \u00ab toute mesure coercitive portant atteinte \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation d\u2019une personne ou constituant une atteinte \u00e0 ses biens et \u00e0 ses droits [. . .] est apte \u00e0 [\u00eatre une peine au sens de punition] dans l\u2019ordre juridique p\u00e9nal \u00bb (p. 489). Suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. K.R.J., 2016 CSC 31, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 906, pour qu\u2019une mesure coercitive s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve au rang de punition, elle doit notamment avoir \u00ab une grande incidence sur le droit du contrevenant \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00eatre \u00ab une cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 41). Cette typologie inclut des mesures telles que \u00ab le d\u00e9dommagement de la victime pour certains crimes, l\u2019interdiction de conduire ou de poss\u00e9der une arme \u00e0 feu [et] l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper une fonction ou de contracter avec l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (Dumont, p. 489 (je souligne)). Je partage l\u2019opinion formul\u00e9e par le juge Paciocco dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Pham \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard : l\u2019interdiction de conduire est une forme de punition puisqu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab fait partie des sanctions dont est passible un accus\u00e9 pour une infraction donn\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 22, renvoyant \u00e0 R. c. Rodgers, 2006 CSC 15, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 554, par. 62\u201163).\n[69] Bien qu\u2019une d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle ou une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire puisse avoir repos\u00e9 initialement sur une volont\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger le public, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, cette sanction peut n\u00e9anmoins avoir ultimement un effet punitif et dissuasif sur le contrevenant et ainsi faire partie de sa peine. Sur ce point, la juge Arbour a \u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust que \u00ab [p]r\u00e9tendre que la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle ne peut jamais \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e constituer une peine apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 \u2014 parce que le syst\u00e8me judiciaire ne punit pas des personnes innocentes \u2014 est un exercice de s\u00e9mantique qui ne tient pas compte de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9tention \u00bb (par. 41 (soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)). Elle conclut que \u00ab bien que la d\u00e9tention avant le proc\u00e8s ne se veuille pas une sanction lorsqu\u2019elle est inflig\u00e9e, elle est, de fait, r\u00e9put\u00e9e faire partie de la peine apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (par. 41).\n[70] Ces r\u00e9flexions font \u00e9cho aux propos du juge en chef Lamer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sharma, lorsqu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire \u00e0 laquelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti le contrevenant constituait une atteinte \u00e0 sa libert\u00e9, de telle sorte que celui-ci avait essentiellement d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 purger sa peine (p. 817\u2011818; voir aussi Lacasse, par. 113). En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, dans le cas de Mme Basque, l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire a eu les m\u00eames effets punitifs et dissuasifs que si cette prohibition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement au prononc\u00e9 de la sentence. Par cons\u00e9quent, consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. exige l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine d\u2019un an \u2014 au sens d\u2019une punition globale incluant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9sentencielle \u2014 satisfait parfaitement aux objectifs de dissuasion et de punition qui sous-tendent cette disposition (voir sur ce point l\u2019arr\u00eat Pham, par. 10 et 28). Je souligne par ailleurs qu\u2019en balisant l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal au par. 718.3(2) C. cr., le l\u00e9gislateur emploie le terme \u00ab punishment \u00bb dans la version anglaise de cette disposition.\n[71] Si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. exigeait le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence minimale, cela risquerait d\u2019entra\u00eener des r\u00e9sultats contre\u2011intuitifs, voire absurdes. Par exemple, l\u2019infliction d\u2019une interdiction additionnelle de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e minimale d\u2019un an \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une double punition pour le contrevenant ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9, dans l\u2019attente de son proc\u00e8s, tout ou partie de la dur\u00e9e minimale de la prohibition de conduire. Un tel r\u00e9sultat serait contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats les plus fondamentaux de la justice, faisant poindre le spectre d\u2019une double punition [traduction] \u00ab sans aucune indication claire que c\u2019est ce que le Parlement cherchait \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser \u00bb (Pham, par. 10).\n[72] De surcro\u00eet, par analogie avec les enseignements de la juge Arbour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust, l\u2019\u00e9cart appropri\u00e9 entre les peines inflig\u00e9es aux contrevenants les plus dangereux et les moins dangereux risquerait ind\u00fbment de s\u2019effriter. En effet, les d\u00e9linquants endurcis, \u00ab du fait qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent des peines sup\u00e9rieures au minimum pr\u00e9vu, profiteraient d\u2019une r\u00e9duction de peine fond\u00e9e sur la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9sentencielle, alors que les d\u00e9linquants qui n\u2019en sont qu\u2019\u00e0 leur premi\u00e8re infraction et qui se voient infliger la peine minimale ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient pas de cette r\u00e9duction \u00bb (par. 42). En m\u2019inspirant des propos de la juge Arbour, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il faut, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9carter toute interpr\u00e9tation \u00ab qui aurait pour effet de profiter aux d\u00e9linquants les plus dangereux et de p\u00e9naliser les d\u00e9linquants les moins dangereux \u00bb (par. 42). Enfin, si l\u2019al. 259(1)a) C. cr. exigeait le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une sentence minimale, cela minerait la gradation m\u00e9ticuleuse des interdictions minimales \u00e9tablie par le Parlement aux al. 259(1)a), b) et c) et expos\u00e9e par le juge French, dissident (voir les par. 93-94 et 129 des motifs de la Cour d\u2019appel). En effet, un contrevenant ne m\u00e9ritant que la peine minimale d\u2019un an pour une premi\u00e8re infraction risquerait, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de Mme Basque, d\u2019\u00eatre sujet \u00e0 la m\u00eame privation de libert\u00e9 qu\u2019un r\u00e9cidiviste multiple n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sous le coup d\u2019une prohibition de conduire dans l\u2019attente de son proc\u00e8s.\n[73] Conform\u00e9ment aux enseignements de notre Cour, il faut pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention claire \u00e0 cet effet, le Parlement n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de produire de tels r\u00e9sultats absurdes (Rizzo, par. 27, citant R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3e \u00e9d. 1994), p. 88; Keatley Surveying Ltd. c. Teranet Inc., 2019 CSC 43, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 418, par. 96, les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Brown, motifs concordants).\nc) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 259(1)a) ne limite pas la r\u00e8gle de common law permettant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit pour interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire\n[74] Tout porte \u00e0 croire que l\u2019al. 259(1)a) pr\u00e9voit une punition minimale, et non une sentence minimale. Cette disposition, silencieuse quant au cr\u00e9dit, ne souffre d\u2019aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. En effet, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell ExpressVu, la Cour a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 se doit d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab r\u00e9elle \u00bb, en ce que la disposition doit \u00eatre raisonnablement susceptible de plus d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation (par. 29, citant Marcotte c. Sous\u2011procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, [1976] 1 R.C.S. 108, p. 115). Pour tirer cette conclusion, il est n\u00e9cessaire de tenir compte du contexte global de la disposition afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe \u00ab deux ou plusieurs interpr\u00e9tations plausibles, qui s\u2019harmonisent chacune \u00e9galement avec l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1999] 1 R.C.S. 743, par. 14). Or, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019al. 259(1)a) n\u2019admet qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation : l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire au sens de punition (en anglais \u00ab punishment \u00bb).\n[75] Non seulement cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 259 (1)a) C. cr. laisse\u2011t\u2011elle place \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du tribunal d\u2019octroyer un cr\u00e9dit, mais elle s\u2019aligne sur la recommandation formul\u00e9e par la juge Arbour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wust selon laquelle \u00ab il est important que les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui portent [. . .] sur des peines minimales obligatoires soient interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui soit compatible avec les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et qui ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle \u00bb (par. 22).\n[76] Comme l\u2019al. 259(1)a) exige le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance interdisant au contrevenant de conduire pendant une dur\u00e9e minimale d\u2019un an, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine pouvait satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence en rendant une ordonnance imposant une punition d\u2019une dur\u00e9e totale d\u2019un an. L\u2019octroi d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit ne fait nullement \u00e9chec \u00e0 l\u2019imposition de la punition minimale pr\u00e9vue par cette disposition. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, puisque celle-ci avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e dans son enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 au moment de son prononc\u00e9, aucune interdiction additionnelle n\u2019\u00e9tait requise.\nD. La suspension d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la peine accord\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel\n[77] Quoique cela ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher le pourvoi, je prends acte de la concession du minist\u00e8re public selon laquelle il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas indiqu\u00e9 de demander que la mise en libert\u00e9 de Mme Basque soit assortie d\u2019une interdiction de conduire. C\u2019est \u00e0 juste titre que la Cour d\u2019appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, que les conditions de remise en libert\u00e9 impos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Basque \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables. En effet, cette derni\u00e8re a ultimement \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 une interdiction de conduire d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 21 mois, \u00e9tant ainsi trait\u00e9e plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement que l\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un autre contrevenant non assujetti \u00e0 une interdiction pr\u00e9sentencielle de conduire, dans des circonstances par ailleurs similaires ou plus graves. On comprend donc le souci de justice et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui animait la Cour d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019elle a ordonn\u00e9 la suspension de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la peine inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Basque, pr\u00e9occupation que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e9galement dans les jugements des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, m\u00eame si elles ont tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire autrement. Ce m\u00eame souci rejoint, en substance mais pas en droit, la solution propos\u00e9e ici. Mais, avec \u00e9gards pour l\u2019opinion contraire, il n\u2019y a pas lieu, pour y arriver, de suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la peine de Mme Basque. Juridiquement, elle a purg\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a).\nVI. Dispositif\n[78] Je propose d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel. Je r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de poursuites sommaires et je r\u00e9tablirais en partie les conclusions de la Cour provinciale, en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019antidater la sentence prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Basque. Au moment du prononc\u00e9 de sa sentence, cette derni\u00e8re avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 purg\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9sentencielle l\u2019interdiction de conduire minimale pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 259(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune interdiction additionnelle n\u2019est indiqu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nPourvoi accueilli.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante : Fowler Law P.C.

L\u2019accus\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une contestation sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , soutenant que la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle constituait donc une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e.

Il a condamn\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 trois ans et demi d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. La Couronne a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la fois de la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte et de la peine de l\u2019accus\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel sur la base de ces deux moyens. Elle a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la peine minimale obligatoire et a inflig\u00e9 la peine minimale de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement.\nArr\u00eat (la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 est dissidente) : Le pourvoi est accueilli.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer et Jamal : La peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Elle viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte et ne peut \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier. Elle est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante, avec effet imm\u00e9diat, conform\u00e9ment au par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 , et la d\u00e9claration s\u2019applique r\u00e9troactivement. La peine de trois ans et demi \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine est r\u00e9tablie.\nL\u2019article 12 de la Charte accorde aux personnes le droit \u00e0 la protection contre tous traitements ou peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s inflig\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00c9tat. L\u2019objectif sous\u2011jacent de l\u2019art. 12 est d\u2019interdire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019infliger des douleurs et des souffrances physiques ou psychologiques par des traitements ou peines d\u00e9gradants et d\u00e9shumanisants. Cette disposition vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la dignit\u00e9 humaine et \u00e0 assurer le respect de la valeur inh\u00e9rente de chaque personne. L\u2019article 12 comporte deux volets unis par leur objectif commun de pr\u00e9server la dignit\u00e9 humaine. En premier lieu, l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge contre l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine qui est excessive au point de ne pas \u00eatre compatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Ce volet porte sur la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine et consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les effets d\u2019une peine attaqu\u00e9e sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 la peine appropri\u00e9e dans un cas donn\u00e9. Les peines minimales obligatoires sont analys\u00e9es \u00e0 ce volet de l\u2019art. 12 . En second lieu, l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge contre l\u2019infliction de peines et de traitements cruels et inusit\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils sont, de par leur nature m\u00eame, intrins\u00e8quement incompatibles avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Au terme du deuxi\u00e8me volet, l\u2019accent est mis sur la m\u00e9thode de punition. Le groupe limit\u00e9 de peines qui entrent dans la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie est toujours exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 parce que de telles peines sont, en soi, incompatibles avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine en raison de leur caract\u00e8re d\u00e9gradant et d\u00e9shumanisant.\nPour d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , la Cour a mis au point une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes : le tribunal doit (1) se demander ce qui constituerait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine; et (2) se demander si la disposition attaqu\u00e9e exige l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, et non simplement excessive, par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. Cette \u00e9valuation en deux \u00e9tapes peut se faire en fonction soit a) de la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal, soit b) d\u2019une autre personne d\u00e9linquante dans un cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible ou un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique. Lorsque le tribunal conclut que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement prescrite par la disposition fixant une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre cas, la disposition en cause contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 , et le tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si cette contravention peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte lorsque des arguments ou \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en ce sens sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la Couronne.\nLa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer, de mani\u00e8re individualis\u00e9e, quelle peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e convient \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause (ou repr\u00e9sentante) au moyen des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine fix\u00e9s par le Parlement. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00e9valuation complexe et multifactorielle. Pour aider \u00e0 faire cette \u00e9valuation, le Parlement a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019art. 718 du Code criminel . Il convient de tenir compte ad\u00e9quatement de divers objectifs comme la d\u00e9nonciation, la dissuasion, la r\u00e9insertion sociale, la r\u00e9paration des torts caus\u00e9s aux victimes, la conscientisation des personnes d\u00e9linquantes quant \u00e0 leurs responsabilit\u00e9s et, lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019isolement des personnes d\u00e9linquantes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Aucun objectif de d\u00e9termination de la peine ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres. Les tribunaux devraient \u00e9galement tenir compte de toute circonstance aggravante et att\u00e9nuante se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019infraction ou \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante. Ind\u00e9pendamment du poids que le juge souhaite accorder \u00e0 l\u2019un des objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine prescrits au Code criminel , la peine doit respecter le principe fondamental de proportionnalit\u00e9. La proportionnalit\u00e9 est un pr\u00e9cepte central du r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9termination de la peine canadien, dont les racines en pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent la reconnaissance en tant que principe fondamental de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.1 du Code criminel . Fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la justice, l\u2019objectif de proportionnalit\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine injuste pour le bien commun, et il joue un r\u00f4le restrictif pour assurer la justice de la peine envers la personne d\u00e9linquante. L\u2019ampleur de la peine inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante doit \u00eatre proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction renvoie au caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux de l\u2019infraction, et elle doit \u00eatre mesur\u00e9e en tenant compte des cons\u00e9quences des agissements de la personne d\u00e9linquante sur les victimes et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, ainsi que du pr\u00e9judice corporel et psychologique d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019infraction. La culpabilit\u00e9 morale ou le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante doit \u00eatre mesur\u00e9 en \u00e9valuant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs essentiels de l\u2019infraction, notamment sa mens rea, la conduite de la personne d\u00e9linquante dans la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, le mobile qui a pouss\u00e9 la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 commettre l\u2019infraction et les aspects du v\u00e9cu de cette personne qui renforcent ou diminuent sa responsabilit\u00e9 individuelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du crime, y compris sa situation personnelle et sa capacit\u00e9 mentale. En outre, puisque la d\u00e9termination de la peine est une entreprise \u00e9minemment individualis\u00e9e et discr\u00e9tionnaire, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine ne peut se contenter d\u2019infliger une peine approximative ou de proposer par ailleurs un \u00e9ventail de peines. Le juge doit formuler une peine individuelle, pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9finie.\nLes peines peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es non seulement au motif qu\u2019elles portent atteinte aux droits que garantit l\u2019art. 12 \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier, mais aussi au motif qu\u2019elles portent atteinte aux droits d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Comme c\u2019est la nature de la loi qui est en question, et non le statut du demandeur, ce dernier n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 all\u00e9guer des effets inconstitutionnels dans sa cause ou sur des tiers. En \u00e9laborant des hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables, le tribunal examine la port\u00e9e de la disposition attaqu\u00e9e, et non pas simplement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine particuli\u00e8re prononc\u00e9e par un juge lors du proc\u00e8s. Un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable doit \u00eatre concoct\u00e9 avec soin et il devrait comprendre cinq caract\u00e9ristiques. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se doit \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre une situation invraisemblable ou difficilement imaginable, ni \u00eatre un exemple extr\u00eame ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La m\u00e9thode appropri\u00e9e consiste \u00e0 imaginer une personne d\u00e9linquante dont les caract\u00e9ristiques et la situation sont raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles compte tenu de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire et du bon sens. Il faut se demander quel effet a la disposition sur d\u2019autres personnes raisonnablement susceptibles de tomber sous le coup de celle\u2011ci et quelles sont les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles o\u00f9 la loi pourrait s\u2019appliquer. Deuxi\u00e8mement, lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9finissent la port\u00e9e du sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique et les qualit\u00e9s d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, les tribunaux peuvent s\u2019appuyer sur les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s, car non seulement ils montrent toute l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes susceptibles de tomber concr\u00e8tement sous le coup de l\u2019infraction, mais les situations en cause se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Les tribunaux peuvent toutefois modifier les faits d\u2019un cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 pour illustrer des sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Troisi\u00e8mement, la situation hypoth\u00e9tique doit \u00eatre raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes vis\u00e9s par l\u2019infraction en question. Elle doit mettre en jeu une conduite qui tombe sous le coup de la disposition pertinente. La port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction peut \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9e, et il est permis d\u2019en \u00e9tablir l\u2019ampleur compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont elle peut \u00eatre commise et de son auteur; il n\u2019est cependant pas utile de forcer chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif au moyen de faits fantaisistes. Quatri\u00e8mement, les caract\u00e9ristiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles dans le cas des personnes d\u00e9linquantes, comme l\u2019\u00e2ge, la pauvret\u00e9, la race, l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et la d\u00e9pendance, peuvent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables. La proportionnalit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessite la prise en compte de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de la situation particuli\u00e8re de la personne d\u00e9linquante, y compris ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles. L\u2019int\u00e9gration de ces caract\u00e9ristiques aux sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques renforce le dispositif analytique en aidant les tribunaux \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la port\u00e9e de la sanction obligatoire. Cependant, les sc\u00e9narios ne devraient pas mettre en cause la personne d\u00e9linquante la plus sympathique; ils devraient plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9senter une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. La situation hypoth\u00e9tique ne saurait n\u2019avoir qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre invraisemblable ou tout \u00e0 fait irr\u00e9aliste. Le tribunal devrait se m\u00e9fier des sc\u00e9narios d\u00e9taill\u00e9s regorgeant de facteurs att\u00e9nuants conjugu\u00e9s \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation qui \u00e9largit et force le sens technique de l\u2019infraction. Cinqui\u00e8mement, le processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables. Bien qu\u2019il revienne \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante\/demanderesse de formuler et d\u2019avancer la situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible sur laquelle repose l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la disposition attaqu\u00e9e est inconstitutionnelle, toutes les parties devraient id\u00e9alement se voir accorder une possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de contester ou de commenter le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique avant de pr\u00e9senter des arguments sur ses cons\u00e9quences au plan constitutionnel. Ce faisant, les parties peuvent aider le juge \u00e0 d\u00e9cider quel genre de situation hypoth\u00e9tique est raisonnable dans les circonstances. Toutefois, bien qu\u2019il faille encourager la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable au moyen du processus contradictoire, cela n\u2019est pas obligatoire en ce sens que l\u2019absence de cette mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve ne constitue pas une erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision.\nLes principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine applicables \u00e0 une vraie personne d\u00e9linquante s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de fixer la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Les juges charg\u00e9s de la d\u00e9termination de la peine sont li\u00e9s par le Code criminel , et ils doivent prendre connaissance des propositions relatives \u00e0 la peine \u00e0 imposer faites par les avocats et utiliser la m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse retenue dans leur ressort (qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des fourchettes de peines ou des points de d\u00e9part). Comme pour les affaires impliquant une vraie personne d\u00e9linquante, les tribunaux devraient fixer une peine d\u00e9finie aussi \u00e9troitement que possible pour une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Le tribunal peut cependant trouver plus difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir une peine pr\u00e9cise pour une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, puisque les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques sont \u00e9voqu\u00e9es en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou de faits d\u00e9taill\u00e9s. En cons\u00e9quence, une certaine latitude peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer n\u00e9cessaire dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine juste. Les tribunaux peuvent pr\u00e9ciser, par exemple, qu\u2019une peine serait autour d\u2019un certain nombre de mois. Toute estimation doit \u00eatre circonscrite et rigoureusement d\u00e9finie.\nUne fois que la peine juste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape exige une comparaison contextuelle entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire attaqu\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci se conforme au droit exprim\u00e9 en termes larges \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12. Que la peine minimale obligatoire soit contest\u00e9e en fonction de ses effets sur le contrevenant en cause ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible se trouvant dans une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable, la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est le crit\u00e8re applicable pour invalider cette peine en vertu de l\u2019art. 12 au motif qu\u2019elle est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e. Comme l\u2019art. 12 a pour objet de pr\u00e9server la dignit\u00e9 humaine, il prot\u00e8ge les personnes d\u00e9linquantes contre les peines d\u2019emprisonnement exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es. En outre, lorsqu\u2019on compare une peine minimale obligatoire \u00e0 la peine juste, on doit mettre l\u2019accent sur la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame. Les tribunaux ne doivent pas consid\u00e9rer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle comme un facteur r\u00e9duisant l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de la peine contest\u00e9e, et ce, parce que la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle ne peut rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\nLe premier volet de la comparaison consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser en quoi, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la peine juste d\u00e9finie \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est diff\u00e9rente de la peine minimale obligatoire. En second lieu, la peine doit \u00eatre disproportionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re flagrante ou \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 d\u00e9mesur\u00e9. Il faut, pour ce faire, cerner l\u2019existence d\u2019une disparit\u00e9 entre les peines et \u00e9valuer les effets et la gravit\u00e9 de la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019aune des normes constitutionnelles. Le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019existence et de l\u2019ampleur de toute disparit\u00e9 entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue s\u2019apparente \u00e0 celui qui est suivi lorsqu\u2019une peine est port\u00e9e en appel et contest\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle est manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e. En pareil cas, il y a une comparaison entre la peine qui serait juste et celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e. La disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est toutefois une norme constitutionnelle exigeante. Le crit\u00e8re exigeant de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est cens\u00e9 exprimer une certaine d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9labore des dispositions en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Le mot \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00bb indique que le Parlement n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019imposer des peines parfaitement proportionn\u00e9es, au risque de nuire \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir des normes de ch\u00e2timents, y compris des peines minimales obligatoires. En effet, s\u2019agissant des peines minimales obligatoires, il existe probablement une certaine disproportion entre la peine adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019individu et la peine minimale obligatoire uniforme. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, une peine peut \u00eatre manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e en ce sens qu\u2019une juridiction d\u2019appel interviendrait, tout en ne r\u00e9pondant pas au crit\u00e8re constitutionnel permettant de conclure qu\u2019elle est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\nTrois \u00e9l\u00e9ments cruciaux doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019on d\u00e9termine si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction. La jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire est plus susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre contest\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle vise des comportements disparates dont la gravit\u00e9 et pour lesquels le degr\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante varient consid\u00e9rablement. Plus la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction est vaste, plus il est probable que la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9voie une longue p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement pour des actes qui pr\u00e9sentent peu de risques pour le public et comportent une faible faute morale. Le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la mens rea et l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction englobent une gamme de comportements, ainsi que le degr\u00e9 variable de gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Il peut se demander si l\u2019infraction implique n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019un tort soit caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne ou simplement qu\u2019il y ait un risque de pr\u00e9judice, s\u2019il existe des fa\u00e7ons de commettre l\u2019infraction qui pr\u00e9sentent relativement peu de danger, et dans quelle mesure la mens rea de l\u2019infraction exige une culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e chez la personne d\u00e9linquante.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e concerne les effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante. Les tribunaux doivent s\u2019efforcer de d\u00e9finir le pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9cis caus\u00e9 par le ch\u00e2timent. Ils doivent pour ce faire analyser les cons\u00e9quences que la peine contest\u00e9e peut avoir sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, tant de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques et qualit\u00e9s qui leur sont propres. Le principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 implique que lorsque l\u2019emprisonnement a un effet plus grand sur une personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier, il peut y avoir lieu de lui accorder une r\u00e9duction de peine. Pour cette raison, les tribunaux ont r\u00e9duit des peines afin de tenir compte de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la prison relativement plus dure pour certaines personnes d\u00e9linquantes, comme celles faisant partie des forces de l\u2019ordre, celles qui souffrent d\u2019un handicap, ou celles dont l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la prison est plus dure en raison du racisme syst\u00e9mique. Le tribunal devrait \u00e9galement tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement suppl\u00e9mentaire impos\u00e9e par la peine minimale obligatoire, compte tenu des r\u00e9percussions profondes de l\u2019emprisonnement.\nLe dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019analyse met l\u2019accent sur la sanction et ses objectifs. Lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9valuent la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, les tribunaux examinent la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la sanction impos\u00e9e par le Parlement afin de d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la peine minimale va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine pertinents au regard de l\u2019infraction particuli\u00e8re en tenant compte des objectifs p\u00e9naux l\u00e9gitimes et du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des solutions de rechange possibles. La d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion, tant g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que sp\u00e9cifique, sont des objectifs valables en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Toutefois, la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du Parlement d\u2019imposer des peines exemplaires ne peut \u00eatre sans limites, car cet objectif pourrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour justifier des peines d\u2019une dur\u00e9e illimit\u00e9e. En \u00e9dictant des peines minimales obligatoires, le Parlement peut privil\u00e9gier certains objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres, \u00e0 condition de respecter certaines limites. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 12, le r\u00f4le accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019examiner une peine minimale obligatoire aidera \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la disposition constitue une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e. Bien que la r\u00e9insertion sociale n\u2019ait pas de statut constitutionnel distinct, il existe un lien solide entre l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9insertion sociale et la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Une peine qui fait totalement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion sociale ne respecterait pas la dignit\u00e9 humaine et serait incompatible avec cette derni\u00e8re, et elle constituerait de ce fait une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12. Pour respecter l\u2019art. 12, la peine ou la d\u00e9termination de la peine doit tenir compte de la r\u00e9insertion sociale. De plus, les tribunaux devraient v\u00e9rifier si la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019emprisonnement pr\u00e9vue par la loi est trop excessive \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019autres solutions potentiellement ad\u00e9quates. Il n\u2019existe pas de formule math\u00e9matique permettant de d\u00e9terminer le nombre pr\u00e9cis d\u2019ann\u00e9es qui fait qu\u2019une peine est excessive par rapport \u00e0 un objectif p\u00e9nal l\u00e9gitime. Dans tous les cas, l\u2019analyse doit \u00eatre contextuelle et il n\u2019existe pas de chiffre pr\u00e9cis au\u2011del\u00e0 ou en de\u00e7\u00e0 duquel une peine devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Une peine minimale obligatoire sera toutefois suspecte sur le plan constitutionnel et n\u00e9cessitera un examen minutieux lorsqu\u2019elle ne conf\u00e8re pas au juge le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019infliger d\u2019autres peines que l\u2019emprisonnement dans des situations o\u00f9 la personne d\u00e9linquante ne devrait pas \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emprisonnement, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de la culpabilit\u00e9 de son auteur. En outre, une peine minimale peut \u00eatre exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e comprendrait une longue peine d\u2019emprisonnement. La peine minimale obligatoire qui alourdit la peine d\u2019emprisonnement de la personne d\u00e9linquante peut avoir un effet important, compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences profondes de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sur la vie et la libert\u00e9 de cette personne. Les tribunaux devraient \u00e9valuer la peine \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique \u00e9voqu\u00e9 par l\u2019accus\u00e9 est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Il rel\u00e8ve de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction et ne force ni ne d\u00e9nature ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs. L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction exige que la personne d\u00e9linquante d\u00e9charge une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un lieu, ce qui signifie tout b\u00e2timent ou construction. Une r\u00e9sidence constitue un lieu. Pour ce qui est de savoir si une carabine ou un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 pourrait constituer une arme \u00e0 feu au sens de l\u2019art. 2 du Code criminel , la preuve d\u2019expert a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait un grand nombre de carabines et de pistolets \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 couramment disponibles au Canada qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019arme \u00e0 feu du Code criminel , mais qui ne sont pas capables de perforer un assemblage de mur \u00e0 ossature r\u00e9sidentielle typique. Il est aussi raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible d\u2019imaginer une jeune personne d\u00e9charger un fusil \u00e0 balles BB ou un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison dans le cadre d\u2019un jeu, pour passer le temps ou pour faire un mauvais coup.\n\u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, la peine juste pour la jeune personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique dans le sc\u00e9nario propos\u00e9 par l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019impliquerait pas l\u2019emprisonnement. Puisque la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante sont peu \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans ce sc\u00e9nario et que le jeune \u00e2ge de cette personne constitue une circonstance att\u00e9nuante, la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e est le sursis au prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une peine d\u2019au plus 12 mois de probation. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, celle\u2011ci m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste. Elle s\u2019applique \u00e0 une infraction qui englobe une vaste gamme de comportements, allant d\u2019actes qui ne pr\u00e9sentent gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00e0 d\u2019autres qui posent un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9. La peine obligatoire aurait des effets pr\u00e9judiciables importants sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants, qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant de grandes chances de r\u00e9insertion sociale. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019effet de la peine minimale obligatoire est extr\u00eamement dur, car elle remplace une mesure probatoire par quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement est excessive au point d\u2019\u00eatre en d\u00e9calage marqu\u00e9 par rapport aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine et va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Parlement atteigne ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour cette infraction. La d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion ne peuvent pas justifier la peine minimale, et celle-ci ne t\u00e9moigne pas non plus d\u2019un respect pour les principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9. Les Canadiens et Canadiennes seraient indign\u00e9s d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison. Comme la Couronne n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument ou de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que la peine peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aborder cette question.\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 (dissidente) : Le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. La peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans anciennement prescrite par l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel ne viole pas l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte .\nIl y a accord avec l\u2019affirmation des juges majoritaires de l\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire viole l\u2019art. 12. Les tribunaux doivent : (1) d\u00e9terminer ce qui constituerait une peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019infraction, eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine; et (2) se demander si la peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine qui serait juste et proportionn\u00e9e soit pour le d\u00e9linquant en cause, soit pour un autre d\u00e9linquant plac\u00e9 dans une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable.\nToutefois, il y a d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la tentative des juges majoritaires de clarifier le cadre \u00e9tabli au moyen d\u2019un nouveau test \u00e0 trois volets applicable \u00e0 la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les juges majoritaires \u00e9noncent trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9s \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse : (1) la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction; (2) les effets de la peine sur le d\u00e9linquant; et (3) la sanction et ses objectifs. Chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments reprend les consid\u00e9rations pertinentes pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es pour l\u2019infraction \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, la question de savoir si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la peine juste \u2014 c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. la question de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une peine qui est plus que simplement excessive mais qui est excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u2014 demeure un jugement normatif.\nIl y a aussi d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donnent les juges majoritaires \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) du Code criminel . Le Parlement n\u2019entendait pas que l\u2019art. 244.2 vise la d\u00e9charge insouciante d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu dans des situations qui ne posent gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public. Il entendait plut\u00f4t viser les d\u00e9linquants qui se sont concentr\u00e9s sur le fait que la d\u00e9charge de leur arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction, \u00e0 lui seul, engloberait un vaste \u00e9ventail de conduites. Mais la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction est consid\u00e9rablement restreinte par son \u00e9l\u00e9ment moral. L\u2019exigence de double mens rea de l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) vise uniquement les d\u00e9linquants qui (1) d\u00e9chargent intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, (2) sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants \u2014 et qui ont donc song\u00e9 au fait que tirer \u00e9tait susceptible de mettre la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en danger. Cette interpr\u00e9tation, conforme \u00e0 celle donn\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement par les cours d\u2019appel, respecte l\u2019intention v\u00e9ritable du Parlement.\nInterpr\u00e9t\u00e9e correctement, la simple probation n\u2019est pas une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Le sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique de la carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019accus\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s ne comporte pas, sans plus, d\u2019actes qui pourraient raisonnablement tomber sous le coup de la loi. Il est con\u00e7u principalement en fonction de l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction. Rien ne permet de conclure que la mens rea requise serait \u00e9tablie. La situation hypoth\u00e9tique est silencieuse quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le d\u00e9linquant a song\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019occupants, et au risque correspondant pour leur vie ou leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La position des juges majoritaires, laquelle d\u00e9pend de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un mur r\u00e9sidentiel pour prot\u00e9ger les occupants, ne prend aucunement en consid\u00e9ration la possibilit\u00e9 que des balles puissent p\u00e9n\u00e9trer une fen\u00eatre ou une porte, les effets psychologiques sur les occupants ou les voisins, et le risque d\u2019une escalade de violence. Le fait de tirer intentionnellement avec n\u2019importe quelle arme \u00e0 feu \u2014 qui, par d\u00e9finition, doit \u00eatre susceptible d\u2019infliger des blessures graves ou la mort \u2014 en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, est une conduite hautement dangereuse et coupable. L\u2019absence de blessures graves ou de mort ne sera qu\u2019une question de chance.\nUne peine de deux ans devrait \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme correspondant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es dans les applications raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). La peine minimale de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) aurait pour effet de doubler cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. Il ne faudrait pas en minimiser les cons\u00e9quences, lesquelles peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9vastatrices. Cependant, sur le plan constitutionnel, cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement additionnelle n\u2019atteint pas le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la Cour en ce qui concerne les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. Une peine minimale obligatoire outrepasse les limites constitutionnelles lorsqu\u2019elle est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, au\u2011del\u00e0 de simplement excessive. Ce n\u2019est que rarement que la Cour a conclu qu\u2019une peine minimale violait l\u2019art. 12, par opposition aux peines qui sont cruelles et inusit\u00e9es par nature comme la torture ou la castration. Il est loisible au Parlement de mettre l\u2019accent sur les objectifs de dissuasion et de d\u00e9nonciation dans le contexte d\u2019infractions li\u00e9es aux armes \u00e0 feu. La Cour a maintes fois confirm\u00e9 la fonction de d\u00e9nonciation des peines minimales pour des comportements qui portent atteinte au code des valeurs fondamentales de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Tirer intentionnellement avec une arme \u00e0 feu qui menace la vie en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, est un exemple clair d\u2019un tel comportement.\nLa situation hypoth\u00e9tique sur laquelle se fondent les juges majoritaires n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire et le bon sens. Elle n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une seule d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) \u2014 et ne pourrait non plus y donner lieu, suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte de l\u2019infraction. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 244.2(1)a) ne vise que les tirs intentionnels qui sont hautement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles et contraires \u00e0 la paix de la communaut\u00e9. Une peine minimale de quatre ans n\u2019est ni excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence ni incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine au point de constituer une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Martin\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : R. c.

Introduction\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi ainsi que le pourvoi connexe R. c. Hilbach, 2023 CSC 3, offrent \u00e0 la Cour l\u2019occasion de clarifier les principes de droit qui s\u2019appliquent lorsque la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition fixant une peine minimale obligatoire est contest\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Le litige dans les deux pourvois porte sur trois infractions diff\u00e9rentes au Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , qui impliquent l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu. Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, l\u2019appelant, Jesse Dallas Hills, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019une maison en violation de l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a). Monsieur Hills conteste la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans impos\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement par l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) pour cette infraction. La peine minimale obligatoire prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Malgr\u00e9 cette modification l\u00e9gislative, les motifs portent sur la peine minimale obligatoire attaqu\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait auparavant en vigueur. Dans le pourvoi connexe, Ocean William Storm Hilbach et Curtis Zwozdesky ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s coupables de vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e. Ils contestent, respectivement, la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans pour vol qualifi\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e, pr\u00e9vue au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i), et l\u2019ancienne peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pour vol qualifi\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1). La peine minimale obligatoire fix\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1) a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition du pourvoi Hilbach.\n[2] Dans les deux pourvois, les d\u00e9linquants soutiennent que les peines minimales obligatoires prescrites constituent des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es, en violation de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Ils pr\u00e9tendent que ces peines automatiques, lesquelles imposent une p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement minimale d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es \u00e0 ce qui constituerait une peine juste et appropri\u00e9e, et contreviennent donc \u00e0 la Charte . Messieurs Hills et Zwozdesky admettent que les peines minimales \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es au regard des faits de leurs dossiers. Ils contestent n\u00e9anmoins la loi en raison du fait que les dispositions sur la peine pourraient raisonnablement s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 d\u2019autres pour qui, selon eux, les peines minimales inflig\u00e9es constitueraient des ch\u00e2timents inconstitutionnels.\n[3] Ce n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que notre Cour a \u00e0 statuer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de peines minimales obligatoires. Bien que les pr\u00e9sents pourvois mettent en \u00e9vidence certains des d\u00e9fis que pr\u00e9sente le fait de d\u00e9terminer si une peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de bouleverser des r\u00e8gles de droit solides et \u00e9tablies et d\u2019adopter les nouvelles d\u00e9marches pr\u00e9conis\u00e9es par certaines parties ainsi que certains intervenants et juges de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta. Les principes qui servent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une peine est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e sont bien \u00e9tablis, et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23. Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la Cour vise \u00e0 fournir des rep\u00e8res, des directives et des \u00e9claircissements suppl\u00e9mentaires. Les pr\u00e9sents motifs fournissent un cadre en r\u00e9ponse aux observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et dans l\u2019affaire Hilbach. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne ferai pas de distinction entre les observations des avocats dans les deux affaires qui portent sur les changements propos\u00e9s au cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 12.\n[4] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019expose d\u2019abord le cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement applicable et les principes fondamentaux de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, puis je les applique \u00e0 M. Hills et, dans Hilbach, \u00e0 MM. Hilbach et Zwozdesky. La d\u00e9termination du caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire d\u00e9pend de la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, des effets du ch\u00e2timent sur la personne d\u00e9linquante de m\u00eame que de la sanction et de ses objectifs.\n[5] Pour ce qui est de M. Hills, je conclus que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que de nombreuses carabines \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 constituaient des \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb, notamment des dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 comme des fusils de paintball, m\u00eame s\u2019ils ne peuvent pas percer le mur d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence ordinaire. De plus, il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019une jeune personne d\u00e9charge intentionnellement une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb de ce genre en direction d\u2019un lieu de r\u00e9sidence. Cette disposition s\u2019applique donc \u00e0 une infraction qui englobe une vaste gamme de comportements, allant d\u2019actes qui ne pr\u00e9sentent gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00e0 ceux qui posent un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9. Son effet \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure du spectre est grave. La peine minimale obligatoire ne peut se justifier uniquement par la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation, et le ch\u00e2timent d\u00e9montre un m\u00e9pris total envers les normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine. La p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement obligatoire aurait d\u2019importants effets pr\u00e9judiciables sur une jeune personne d\u00e9linquante, et la conscience des Canadiens et des Canadiennes serait choqu\u00e9e s\u2019ils apprenaient qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante peut se voir infliger quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) pr\u00e9voit une peine minimale de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour un type d\u2019activit\u00e9 beaucoup moins grave, si bien qu\u2019il est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 et \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e. La Couronne n\u2019a pas fait valoir que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) pouvait \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte . En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi. Je traite du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) dans l\u2019affaire connexe Hilbach.\nII. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif\nA. La peine minimale obligatoire contest\u00e9e\n[6] Monsieur Hills \u00e9tait passible de la peine minimale obligatoire en litige apr\u00e8s avoir plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l\u2019infraction \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) :\n244.2 (1) Commet une infraction quiconque :\na) soit d\u00e9charge intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve une personne ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non une personne;\nb) soit d\u00e9charge intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu sans se soucier de la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\n(2) Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a), lieu s\u2019entend de tout b\u00e2timent ou construction \u2014 ou partie de ceux\u2011ci \u2014, v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur, navire, a\u00e9ronef, mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire, contenant ou remorque.\n(3) Quiconque commet l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe (1) est coupable d\u2019un acte criminel passible :\na) s\u2019il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, ou si celle\u2011ci est perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e au profit ou sous la direction d\u2019une organisation criminelle ou en association avec elle, d\u2019un emprisonnement maximal de quatorze ans, la peine minimale \u00e9tant :\n(i) de cinq ans, dans le cas d\u2019une premi\u00e8re infraction,\n(ii) de sept ans, en cas de r\u00e9cidive;\nb) dans tous les autres cas, d\u2019un emprisonnement maximal de quatorze ans, la peine minimale \u00e9tant de quatre ans.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s que l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel eut \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, le Parlement a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 la Loi modifiant le Code criminel et la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances, L.C. 2022, c. 15. La loi a re\u00e7u la sanction royale le 17 novembre 2022. Elle a aboli la peine minimale obligatoire prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b). L\u2019infraction de M. Hills n\u2019est plus punissable d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire. Les parties ne se fondent pas sur le choix du Parlement d\u2019abolir cette mesure dans leurs arguments. De plus, la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans \u00e9tait toujours en vigueur au moment de l\u2019audience. Bien que je prenne acte de cette modification l\u00e9gislative, les pr\u00e9sents motifs portent sur l\u2019ancienne disposition et la peine minimale obligatoire qui s\u2019appliquait, et je ne traiterai donc pas de ce point plus en d\u00e9tail.\n[8] L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) exige que la personne d\u00e9linquante d\u00e9charge une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un \u00ab lieu \u00bb (selon la d\u00e9finition qui en est donn\u00e9e au par. 244.2(2)). Il est significatif, pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, que le mot \u00ab lieu \u00bb a un sens tr\u00e8s large : il s\u2019entend de \u00ab tout b\u00e2timent ou construction \u00bb, ce qui peut aussi bien englober une remise de jardin sans fen\u00eatre qu\u2019une r\u00e9sidence. La mens rea de cette infraction comporte deux volets principaux. Premi\u00e8rement, la personne d\u00e9linquante doit d\u00e9charger intentionnellement l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un lieu. Deuxi\u00e8mement, au moment de d\u00e9charger intentionnellement l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un lieu, la personne d\u00e9linquante doit savoir qu\u2019une personne s\u2019y trouve ou ne pas se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non une personne (V\u00e9zina c. R., 2018 QCCA 739, par. 27 (CanLII)). L\u2019actus reus n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019une personne se trouve au \u00ab lieu \u00bb o\u00f9 l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e; il exige uniquement que l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu soit d\u00e9charg\u00e9e en direction d\u2019un lieu (par. 46). Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019une personne soit m\u00eame pr\u00e9sente lorsque l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e.\n[9] Monsieur Hills a commis son infraction au moyen d\u2019une carabine de chasse, qui est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait passible de la peine minimale de quatre ans \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) pour l\u2019infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Pour saisir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) et de la peine minimale obligatoire en question, il faut examiner le sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb dans le Code criminel et le r\u00e9gime canadien de r\u00e9glementation des armes \u00e0 feu.\nB. Le r\u00e9gime applicable aux armes \u00e0 feu\n[10] Le Parlement r\u00e9glemente les armes \u00e0 feu au moyen de diverses mesures l\u00e9gislatives, y compris le r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9livrance de permis et d\u2019enregistrement pr\u00e9vu par la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , L.C. 1995, c. 39 , et d\u2019interdictions criminelles \u00e9tablies par le Code criminel (R. c. Nur, 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773, par. 6; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu (Can.), 2000 CSC 31, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 783). Ces mesures l\u00e9gislatives constituent la toile de fond du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi et, vu leur complexit\u00e9, il importe d\u2019en saisir l\u2019application avant de passer \u00e0 la contestation de M. Hills.\n[11] Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) int\u00e8gre la d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e par le Code criminel \u00e0 une arme \u00e0 feu. L\u2019article 2 du Code criminel d\u00e9finit en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb comme \u00ab [t]oute arme susceptible, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un canon qui permet de tirer du plomb, des balles ou tout autre projectile, d\u2019infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort \u00e0 une personne, y compris une carcasse ou une bo\u00eete de culasse d\u2019une telle arme ainsi que toute chose pouvant \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e comme telle \u00bb. Bien que les armes \u00e0 feu soient d\u00e9finies comme des \u00ab armes \u00bb, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elles correspondent \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une arme que l\u2019on trouve dans le Code criminel (R. c. Dunn, 2013 ONCA 539, 117 O.R. (3d) 171, par. 66, conf. par 2014 CSC 69, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 490).\n[12] Les tribunaux recourent au \u00ab test de l\u2019\u0153il de cochon \u00bb pour d\u00e9terminer si une arme pourvue d\u2019un canon peut causer des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort et ainsi r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb qui figure dans le Code criminel (Dunn, par. 8 et 40). Le test permet de d\u00e9terminer si un projectile tir\u00e9 du dispositif peut faire \u00e9clater l\u2019\u0153il d\u2019un cochon, qui est physiologiquement semblable \u00e0 un \u0153il humain (par. 8). Puisqu\u2019un \u0153il \u00e9clat\u00e9 constitue une \u00ab l\u00e9sion corporelle grave \u00bb, une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb est tout dispositif pourvu d\u2019un canon et tirant un projectile susceptible de d\u00e9truire l\u2019\u0153il de quelqu\u2019un (par. 8 et 40). Comme l\u2019\u00e9tablit la preuve d\u2019expert d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, tels les fusils \u00e0 balles BB, fusils de type \u00ab airsoft \u00bb et fusils de paintball, peuvent tirer des projectiles avec une v\u00e9locit\u00e9 suffisante pour faire \u00e9clater l\u2019\u0153il d\u2019un cochon. Elles peuvent donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des armes \u00e0 feu au sens du Code criminel .\n[13] Toutefois, certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 qui sont des \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb pour l\u2019application du Code criminel ne sont pas assujettis au r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9livrance de permis et d\u2019enregistrement instaur\u00e9 par la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu . En effet, le Code criminel soustrait certaines \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu . Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019exemption en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019al. 84(3)d) :\n(3) Pour l\u2019application des articles 91 \u00e0 95, 99 \u00e0 101, 103 \u00e0 107 et 117.03 et des dispositions de la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s ne pas \u00eatre des armes \u00e0 feu :\n. . .\nd) toute autre arme pourvue d\u2019un canon dont il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019est ni con\u00e7ue ni adapt\u00e9e pour tirer du plomb, des balles ou tout autre projectile \u00e0 une vitesse initiale de plus de 152,4 m par seconde ou dont l\u2019\u00e9nergie initiale est de plus de 5,7 joules . . .\n[14] Selon l\u2019al. 84(3)d), certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 qui satisfont au test de l\u2019\u0153il de cochon et constituent des armes \u00e0 feu au sens du Code criminel sont n\u00e9anmoins soustraits \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , car la vitesse de sortie de leur projectile est \u00e9gale ou inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 152,4 m\u00e8tres par seconde. En cons\u00e9quence, m\u00eame si elles sont des \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb pour l\u2019application du Code criminel , il est possible d\u2019en poss\u00e9der librement sans d\u00e9tenir de permis d\u2019arme \u00e0 feu.\n[15] Cela signifie, au terme du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, que certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, que l\u2019on peut poss\u00e9der en toute libert\u00e9 au Canada, sont des \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). En clair, une personne d\u00e9linquante pourrait \u00eatre reconnue coupable en vertu de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) pour avoir tir\u00e9 avec un fusil \u00e0 balles BB ou un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une remise. Cette personne serait alors passible de la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans. Bien que l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) puisse habituellement s\u2019appliquer lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire est utilis\u00e9e (comme la carabine de chasse de M. Hills), il se peut qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable pour avoir utilis\u00e9 des dispositifs qui, \u00e0 notre connaissance, n\u2019ont pas une puissance meurtri\u00e8re, tels les fusils de paintball. Comme je l\u2019explique, cette possibilit\u00e9 sous\u2011tend la fragilit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la peine minimale obligatoire en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIII. Faits et historique judiciaire\n[16] Au cours d\u2019un incident survenu le 6 mai 2014, M. Hills a attaqu\u00e9 deux v\u00e9hicules et une r\u00e9sidence. Dans les heures qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019incident, M. Hills a consomm\u00e9 une grande quantit\u00e9 de m\u00e9dicaments sur ordonnance et d\u2019alcool. Vers minuit, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait intoxiqu\u00e9, il est parti de son domicile \u00e0 Lethbridge, en Alberta, avec une carabine \u00e0 verrou Enfield charg\u00e9e de calibre .303 et un b\u00e2ton de baseball. La carabine \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue pour la chasse au gros gibier.\n[17] Monsieur Hills s\u2019est \u00e9lanc\u00e9 avec son b\u00e2ton vers une voiture qui passait avant de tirer un coup de feu en direction de celle\u2011ci. Le chauffeur a appel\u00e9 le 9\u20111\u20111. Avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des policiers, M. Hills a port\u00e9 son attention sur une voiture stationn\u00e9e inoccup\u00e9e, et en a fracass\u00e9 les vitres avec le b\u00e2ton. Il s\u2019est ensuite approch\u00e9 d\u2019une nouvelle cible : une r\u00e9sidence. Il a tir\u00e9 une balle qui a travers\u00e9 la fen\u00eatre du salon et un mur, et a p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans une salle d\u2019ordinateur avant de terminer sa course dans un montant pour cloison s\u00e8che et une biblioth\u00e8que.\n[18] Lorsque M. Hills a fait feu plusieurs fois, la demeure \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e par deux parents et leurs deux enfants. Le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait assis dans la salle d\u2019ordinateur quand M. Hills a tir\u00e9 son premier coup. Le p\u00e8re est sorti de la salle d\u2019ordinateur pour voir ce qui se passait, et il a entendu un autre coup de feu. Il a couru pour alerter la m\u00e8re et a pes\u00e9 sur l\u2019alarme de son syst\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il a ensuite entendu un bruit laissant croire que M. Hills essayait d\u2019entrer par la porte avant. Le p\u00e8re a ouvert la porte et a cri\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hills de partir. Au moment o\u00f9 le p\u00e8re s\u2019emparait d\u2019une hache pour se d\u00e9fendre, M. Hills a fait feu de nouveau.\n[19] Le p\u00e8re est parvenu \u00e0 battre en retraite et \u00e0 appeler le 9\u20111\u20111. Il s\u2019est rendu avec le reste de sa famille au sous\u2011sol, o\u00f9 ils ont attendu l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des policiers. Lorsque ceux\u2011ci sont arriv\u00e9s, ils ont constat\u00e9 que plusieurs balles avaient p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 la demeure. Les balles avaient travers\u00e9 des zones de la r\u00e9sidence o\u00f9 une personne aurait pu se tenir debout et \u00eatre atteinte.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, M. Hills a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 quatre infractions : d\u00e9charger une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence, en violation de l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) du Code criminel , braquer une arme \u00e0 feu sur l\u2019occupant d\u2019une voiture, \u00eatre en possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu sans permis et commettre un m\u00e9fait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un bien de moins de 5 000 $. Monsieur Hills n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de se rappeler des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ou du mobile de ses gestes.\nA. Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta, 2018 ABQB 945, 79 Alta. L.R. (6th) 161\n[21] Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, M. Hills a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , une contestation visant la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) pour avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu non restreinte en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence. Il a soutenu qu\u2019une telle peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans des sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles et qu\u2019elle constituait donc une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e.\n[22] Monsieur Hills s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur un sc\u00e9nario dans lequel le coupable hypoth\u00e9tique avait d\u00e9charg\u00e9 une arme \u00e0 feu incapable de percer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel ordinaire. Un expert en armes \u00e0 feu appel\u00e9 au nom de M. Hills a mis \u00e0 l\u2019essai huit diff\u00e9rents types de pistolets et de carabines \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 et conclu que, m\u00eame si ces armes r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu que l\u2019on trouve dans le Code criminel , bon nombre d\u2019entre elles \u00e9taient incapables de perforer le mur d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence.\n[23] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve d\u2019expert, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a convenu que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) avait un effet exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans le sc\u00e9nario raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible o\u00f9 [traduction] \u00ab une jeune personne d\u00e9charge intentionnellement un pistolet ou une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 comme un pistolet de type \u201cairsoft\u201d, un fusil \u00e0 balles BB, un fusil marqueur de paintball, une carabine \u00e0 plomb de calibre .177, un pistolet \u00e0 plomb de calibre .22 ou une carabine \u00e0 plomb en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence \u00bb (par. 14). Le coupable dans cette situation a clairement commis une infraction moins grave que l\u2019autre conduite vis\u00e9e par la disposition : le comportement \u00e9tait peu r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible sur le plan moral, et le risque de pr\u00e9judice \u00e9tait, lui aussi, faible. Il a conclu que la violation de l\u2019art. 12 ne pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte .\n[24] Ayant conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle, le juge a inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hills, dans une d\u00e9cision orale subs\u00e9quente, une peine de trois ans et demi d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta, 2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226\n[25] La Couronne a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la fois de la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte et de la peine de M. Hills. La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a accueilli l\u2019appel sur la base de ces deux moyens, et chacun des juges a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ses propres motifs.\n[26] La juge Antonio a conclu que la preuve d\u2019expert \u00e9tait insuffisante pour \u00e9tablir la faible gravit\u00e9 du sc\u00e9nario envisag\u00e9 par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. L\u2019expert n\u2019a pas exclu la possibilit\u00e9 que les balles tir\u00e9es d\u2019un pistolet ou d\u2019une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 puissent traverser une porte ou une fen\u00eatre. De plus, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine n\u2019a pas tenu compte du pr\u00e9judice psychologique d\u00e9coulant du sc\u00e9nario. Quel que soit le risque physique, le pr\u00e9judice psychologique et le tort caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation dangereuse d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu. Elle a distingu\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Nur de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, estimant que, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019infliger une peine de 40 mois \u00e0 un homme de 19 ans qui poss\u00e9dait une arme \u00e0 feu charg\u00e9e en public, il n\u2019\u00e9tait assur\u00e9ment pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019infliger une peine de 4 ans \u00e0 un contrevenant qui a effectivement d\u00e9charg\u00e9 une arme \u00e0 feu. Au moment d\u2019infliger une nouvelle peine \u00e0 M. Hills, elle a conclu que le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine avait sous\u2011estim\u00e9 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et qu\u2019un emprisonnement de quatre ans et demi constituait une peine appropri\u00e9e. Elle a toutefois r\u00e9duit la peine au minimum de quatre ans pour tenir compte du temps pass\u00e9 en appel. Elle a sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la portion de sa peine post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019appel.\n[27] Le juge O\u2019Ferrall a convenu avec la juge Antonio que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la Charte , et a souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019infliger la peine minimale. Le juge O\u2019Ferrall a ajout\u00e9 que la jurisprudence de notre Cour relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 devrait \u00eatre revue. Il s\u2019est dit troubl\u00e9 par le [traduction] \u00ab manque de r\u00e9alisme \u00bb associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de \u00ab cas hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables \u00bb et a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 devrait uniquement porter sur la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal (par. 103). En outre, il s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e repr\u00e9sentait une mesure ad\u00e9quate de son caract\u00e8re cruel et inusit\u00e9. La proportionnalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas l\u2019objectif fondamental de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, et il est pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e puisse parfois \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e.\n[28] Le juge Wakeling s\u2019est joint au juge O\u2019Ferrall pour demander \u00e0 la Cour de revoir sa jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12. Le juge Wakeling a conclu que l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge seulement contre les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. Autrement dit, il ne prot\u00e8ge pas contre les peines \u00ab habituelles \u00bb, comme l\u2019emprisonnement. Par cons\u00e9quent, une peine d\u2019emprisonnement \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb ne saurait mettre en jeu l\u2019art. 12. Il a critiqu\u00e9 les cas hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables, estimant que, comme l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge une personne d\u00e9linquante contre toute peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e, ses termes clairs signifient qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante ne peut contester que la peine dont elle est passible. Toujours selon lui, la m\u00e9thode des cas hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables laisserait les Canadiens et les Canadiennes [traduction] \u00ab sid\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00bb de constater que les d\u00e9cideurs recourent \u00e0 des sc\u00e9narios \u00ab fictifs \u00bb pour \u00e9valuer la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (par. 263). Le juge Wakeling a ensuite fait remarquer que la d\u00e9termination de la peine au Canada est irrationnelle et ind\u00e9fendable, ce qui milite en faveur d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite de l\u2019art. 12. Employant sa propre m\u00e9thode de fixation des peines, il aurait condamn\u00e9 M. Hills \u00e0 environ 5,9 ans d\u2019emprisonnement.\nIV. Questions en litige\n[29] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions. Premi\u00e8rement, la peine minimale obligatoire impos\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel constitue\u2011t\u2011elle une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e, de sorte qu\u2019elle viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte ? Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a\u2011t\u2011elle fait erreur en ne prenant pas en consid\u00e9ration le rapport Gladue de M. Hills et son statut de M\u00e9tis au moment de lui infliger une nouvelle peine?\nV. Analyse\n[30] Monsieur Hills conc\u00e8de que la peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au vu des faits propres \u00e0 son dossier. Il soutient toutefois que ce crit\u00e8re exigeant est respect\u00e9 dans des sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles o\u00f9 des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui se trouvent dans des situations diff\u00e9rentes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre impliqu\u00e9s. Il affirme notamment que ce crit\u00e8re est respect\u00e9 dans le cas hypoth\u00e9tique d\u2019une jeune personne d\u00e9linquante qui tire avec un pistolet ou une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence. La Couronne conc\u00e8de que ce sc\u00e9nario est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, mais elle soutient que la peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans ce sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique. Avant de passer aux arguments de M. Hills, je vais clarifier le cadre applicable de contestation d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12 et traiter des propositions de r\u00e9vision de ce cadre avanc\u00e9es par la Couronne, plusieurs intervenants et la Cour d\u2019appel.\nA. La protection offerte par l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte contre les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es\n[31] L\u2019article 12 de la Charte accorde aux personnes le droit \u00e0 la protection contre tous traitements ou peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s inflig\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00c9tat. \u00c0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, une mesure attaqu\u00e9e doit constituer d\u2019embl\u00e9e un \u00ab traitement \u00bb ou une \u00ab peine \u00bb pour relever de l\u2019art. 12 . Une mesure impos\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une peine lorsqu\u2019elle : \u00ab (1) [. . .] est une cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 qui fait partie des sanctions dont est passible un accus\u00e9 pour une infraction donn\u00e9e et (2) soit elle est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objectif et aux principes de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, (3) soit elle a une grande incidence sur le droit du contrevenant \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 57, citant R. c. Boudreault, 2018 CSC 58, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 599, par. 39, citant R. c. K.R.J., 2016 CSC 31, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 906, par. 41). Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019avis des juges d\u2019appel O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling, l\u2019art. 12 entre en jeu dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe. Notre Cour a toujours statu\u00e9 que l\u2019emprisonnement, la \u00ab sanction p\u00e9nale de dernier recours \u00bb, constituait clairement une peine (tant d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 11 que selon celle relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte ) (R. c. Gladue, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 688, par. 36; voir R. c. Smith, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1045, p. 1077; Nur; R. c. Poulin, 2019 CSC 47, [2019] 3 R.C.S. 566, par. 40).\n[32] L\u2019objectif sous\u2011jacent de l\u2019art. 12 est \u00ab d\u2019interdire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019infliger des douleurs et des souffrances physiques ou psychologiques par des traitements ou peines d\u00e9gradants et d\u00e9shumanisants. Cette disposition vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la dignit\u00e9 humaine et \u00e0 assurer le respect de la valeur inh\u00e9rente de chaque personne \u00bb (Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, par. 51). La dignit\u00e9 \u00e9voque l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle chaque personne poss\u00e8de une valeur intrins\u00e8que et a, de ce fait, droit au respect, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 ses agissements (Bissonnette, par. 59).\n[33] La d\u00e9marche analytique fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 s\u2019\u00e9tale sur de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour aborder diff\u00e9rents types de questions de droit. Les peines minimales obligatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es dans Smith, R. c. Luxton, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 711, R. c. Goltz, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 485, R. c. Morrisey, 2000 CSC 39, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 90, R. c. Ferguson, 2008 CSC 6, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 96, Nur et plus r\u00e9cemment dans R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130. Une suramende compensatoire obligatoire qui s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des infractions a \u00e9t\u00e9 invalid\u00e9e dans Boudreault; une ordonnance d\u2019interdiction obligatoire d\u2019avoir en sa possession des armes \u00e0 feu a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e dans R. c. Wiles, 2005 CSC 84, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 895, et une peine d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 assortie d\u2019une inadmissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle de 10 ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e dans R. c. Latimer, 2001 CSC 1, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 3.\n[34] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bissonnette, notre Cour a invalid\u00e9 le cumul de p\u00e9riodes d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle dans les cas de d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 pour meurtres multiples, et elle a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 et consolid\u00e9 la d\u00e9marche analytique bien \u00e9tablie fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12. S\u2019exprimant au nom de la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, le juge en chef Wagner a soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la Charte qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et vise \u00e0 assurer que les citoyens b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pleinement de la protection accord\u00e9e par la Charte (par. 98). Vu l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 12 , il a conclu qu\u2019une peine qui an\u00e9antit l\u2019objectif p\u00e9nologique de r\u00e9insertion sociale viole la dignit\u00e9 humaine et contrevient donc \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui ne pouvait se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier (par. 8).\n[35] L\u2019arr\u00eat Bissonnette a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 12 comporte deux volets unis par leur objectif commun de pr\u00e9server la dignit\u00e9 humaine. En premier lieu, l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge contre l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine qui est \u00ab excessive au point de ne pas \u00eatre compatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb (par. 60). Ce volet du concept de peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e porte sur la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine \u2014 il consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer non pas si une peine attaqu\u00e9e est excessive ou disproportionn\u00e9e, mais si ses effets sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 la peine appropri\u00e9e dans un cas donn\u00e9 (par. 61 et 68; Nur, par. 39; Morrisey, par. 26). Suivant le premier volet, la nature de la peine ou le type de sanction ne sont pas en cause. L\u2019ampleur ou la dur\u00e9e de la peine le sont : l\u2019accent est mis sur la question de savoir si ses effets propres la rendent exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et, par le fait m\u00eame, inconstitutionnelle (Bissonnette, par. 62).\n[36] En second lieu, l\u2019art. 12 prot\u00e8ge contre l\u2019infliction de peines et de traitements cruels et inusit\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils sont, de par leur nature m\u00eame, \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement incompatible[s] avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 60). Au terme du deuxi\u00e8me volet, l\u2019accent est mis sur la m\u00e9thode de punition. Le groupe limit\u00e9 de peines qui entrent dans la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie est \u00ab \u201ctoujours exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn[\u00e9]\u201d parce qu[e] [. . .] [d]e telles peines sont, en soi, incompatibles avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine en raison de leur caract\u00e8re \u201cd\u00e9gradan[t] et d\u00e9shumanisan[t]\u201d \u00bb (par. 64, citant Smith, p. 1073; 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., par. 51).\n[37] Les peines minimales obligatoires sont analys\u00e9es au premier volet de l\u2019art. 12. Comme leur nom l\u2019indique, le Parlement a prescrit une peine minimale qui s\u2019applique chaque fois qu\u2019une infraction donn\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Elles sont \u00ab obligatoires \u00bb, en ce sens que le Parlement n\u2019a pas fourni la soupape du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des tribunaux, des exemptions ou des dispositions d\u2019exon\u00e9ration.\n[38] Malgr\u00e9 cette absence de pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, les dispositions fixant une peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es intrins\u00e8quement inconstitutionnelles ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es telles. Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 notre Cour dans Smith, \u00ab [l]e l\u00e9gislateur peut [. . .] prescrire une peine obligatoire d\u2019emprisonnement dans le cas d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 de certaines infractions sans porter atteinte aux droits garantis par l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte \u00bb (p. 1077; voir aussi p. 1072). N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019absence de tout pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, ainsi que la mani\u00e8re dont les peines minimales obligatoires s\u2019appliquent, exposent leurs points vuln\u00e9rables sur le plan constitutionnel. Les peines minimales obligatoires peuvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00ab [i]mplacable[s] \u00bb et \u00ab emp\u00eacher le tribunal d\u2019arr\u00eater une peine proportionnelle se situant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la fourchette \u00bb (Nur, par. 44). Dans certains \u00ab cas extr\u00eames \u00bb, elles peuvent emporter l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine injuste, \u00ab le d\u00e9linquant n\u2019\u00e9tant plus au centre du processus, et ce, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui contrevient au principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 44). Lorsque la peine attaqu\u00e9e a des effets exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 appropri\u00e9 (Smith, p. 1072), elle est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9montre un \u00ab m\u00e9pris total de l\u2019\u00c9tat envers les circonstances propres \u00e0 l\u2019individu condamn\u00e9 et la proportionnalit\u00e9 du ch\u00e2timent qu\u2019il subit \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 61).\n[39] Je passe maintenant au cadre qu\u2019a \u00e9labor\u00e9 notre Cour pour \u00e9tablir si une peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\nB. Le cadre d\u2019\u00e9valuation des peines exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es\n(1) Aper\u00e7u\n[40] Pour d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , notre Cour a mis au point une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes qui implique une analyse contextuelle et comparative (Bissonnette, par. 62). Le tribunal doit :\n1. Se demander ce qui constituerait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel (Bissonnette, par. 63; Boudreault, par. 46; Nur, par. 46).\n2. Se demander si la disposition attaqu\u00e9e exige l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, et non simplement excessive, par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e (Bissonnette, par. 63; Nur, par. 46; Smith, p. 1072). La norme constitutionnelle est stricte pour respecter le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Parlement de choisir des moyens p\u00e9naux qui n\u2019\u00e9quivalent pas \u00e0 des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es.\n[41] Cette \u00e9valuation en deux \u00e9tapes peut se faire en fonction soit a) de la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal, soit b) d\u2019une autre personne d\u00e9linquante dans un cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible ou un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique (Bissonnette, par. 63; Nur, par. 77).\n[42] Lorsque le tribunal conclut que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement prescrite par la disposition fixant une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre cas, la disposition en cause contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, et le tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si cette contravention peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte lorsque des arguments ou \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en ce sens sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la Couronne (Boudreault, par. 97; Nur, par. 46).\n(2) Application du cadre\n[43] Les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling, ainsi que plusieurs intervenants, invitent notre Cour \u00e0 apporter plusieurs changements \u00e0 ce cadre reconnu, parce qu\u2019\u00e0 leurs dires, il est difficile \u00e0 appliquer et manque de coh\u00e9sion. Un grand nombre de leurs critiques n\u2019acceptent pas les principes de droit \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les jugements majoritaires de notre Cour; elles reposent plut\u00f4t sur des remarques incidentes tir\u00e9es d\u2019opinions dissidentes. D\u2019autres approuvent le cadre existant et soutiennent que ceux qui le critiquent s\u2019opposent plut\u00f4t aux r\u00e9sultats qu\u2019il produit dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ne sont pas d\u2019accord avec eux (voir m. interv., Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles, par. 27\u201132). Ces diff\u00e9rentes critiques et propositions seront examin\u00e9es relativement aux questions pr\u00e9cises soulev\u00e9es. Je reconnais toutefois d\u2019embl\u00e9e qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas pratique d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de d\u00e9marcation nettes pouvant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es uniform\u00e9ment aux peines minimales obligatoires sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12 en raison des d\u00e9fis et des complexit\u00e9s que pr\u00e9sentent ces litiges.\n[44] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer, de mani\u00e8re individualis\u00e9e, quelle peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e convient \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause (ou repr\u00e9sentante) au moyen des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine fix\u00e9s par le Parlement. Bien que cette t\u00e2che fasse partie du quotidien des tribunaux partout au pays, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00e9valuation complexe et multifactorielle. Les juges sont charg\u00e9s de fa\u00e7onner des peines qui concilient divers objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine, tiennent compte des facteurs aggravants et des facteurs att\u00e9nuants, et sont proportionnelles \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de chaque infraction et \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante.\n[45] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape exige une comparaison contextuelle entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire attaqu\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9terminer si celle\u2011ci se conforme au droit exprim\u00e9 en termes larges \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12. Les juges doivent prendre en compte la peine uniforme et obligatoire que le Parlement a choisie pour des crimes donn\u00e9s. La peine minimale obligatoire est une tout autre disposition p\u00e9nale o\u00f9 le Parlement a intentionnellement supprim\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et accord\u00e9 plut\u00f4t la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 la certitude, \u00e0 la dissuasion, \u00e0 la d\u00e9nonciation en plus d\u2019isoler parfois la personne d\u00e9linquante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle ne fait pas que pr\u00e9ciser une sanction minimale, elle pr\u00e9voit que la peine minimale s\u2019appliquera automatiquement peu importe la mani\u00e8re dont le crime a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis et par qui. La m\u00eame peine ou p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration s\u2019applique tant \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du comportement criminalis\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00ab quiconque \u00bb en est l\u2019auteur, quelle que soit la diversit\u00e9 des situations en cause.\n[46] Lorsqu\u2019on compare la peine r\u00e9sultant du processus individualis\u00e9 en fonction des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 la norme uniforme \u00e9tablie par la peine minimale obligatoire, il fort probable d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 un certain \u00e9cart ou \u00e0 une certaine disproportion. Comme l\u2019a fait observer la juge Arbour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Wust, 2000 CSC 18, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 455, par. 18 : \u00ab Les peines minimales obligatoires ne constituent pas la norme au Canada, et elles d\u00e9rogent aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux applicables en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le Code, la jurisprudence et la litt\u00e9rature sur le sujet. En particulier, elles d\u00e9rogent souvent au principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.1 du Code, que le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre le principe fondamental en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine : le principe de la proportionnalit\u00e9. \u00bb\n[47] Ce n\u2019est donc pas l\u2019existence d\u2019une certaine disproportion qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019exigence du caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12. Autrement dit, l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 pose la question suivante : la diff\u00e9rence entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire est\u2011elle exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au point de porter atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine de telle sorte qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e? Suivant une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, la sanction contest\u00e9e peut \u00eatre inappropri\u00e9e, excessive et disproportionn\u00e9e, mais elle ne franchit la ligne constitutionnelle que si elle devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Cette question met en jeu le d\u00e9fi commun de cerner les gradations et d\u00e9marcations entre des normes juridiques connexes et d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une conclusion sur la norme juridique qui est respect\u00e9e. Bien qu\u2019il soit souvent difficile d\u2019\u00e9valuer des questions de degr\u00e9 ou de savoir quand quelque chose qui est par ailleurs autoris\u00e9 est devenu exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9, de nombreuses normes juridiques exigent justement ce type d\u2019analyse. Que ce soit au regard de l\u2019art. 12 ou de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , il y a un continuum entre une correspondance exacte et une disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, et le juge a non seulement le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer une telle d\u00e9termination, mais il est aussi reconnu comme \u00e9tant bien plac\u00e9 pour le faire : \u00ab Telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9marche constante des tribunaux lors d\u2019un contr\u00f4le constitutionnel \u00bb (Nur, par. 60).\n[48] En outre, il peut \u00eatre plus difficile d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019une peine dans certaines circonstances puisque la diff\u00e9rence entre les \u00e9tapes un et deux fait parfois intervenir des sanctions qui sont de nature diff\u00e9rente ou qui entrent dans des cat\u00e9gories distinctes. Par exemple, il arrive qu\u2019une amende constitue une peine juste, mais que la disposition attaqu\u00e9e impose un emprisonnement, ou qu\u2019une absolution ou une peine d\u2019emprisonnement avec sursis soit juste, mais qu\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement soit prescrite par la loi. La disparit\u00e9 dans de tels cas est plus \u00e9vidente car la comparaison porte sur deux types diff\u00e9rents de peine et les effets sont souvent plus extr\u00eames. Dans d\u2019autres cas, il faut comparer la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement contenue dans la peine minimale obligatoire. Dans de tels cas, le type de peine est le m\u00eame : l\u2019emprisonnement. Les d\u00e9cideurs doivent s\u2019engager dans un raisonnement normatif et d\u00e9cider quand une peine est longue \u00e0 un point tel qu\u2019elle devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\n[49] Je n\u2019accepte pas que le cadre \u00e9tabli comporte une faille fondamentale ou soit devenu inapplicable en raison de ces d\u00e9fis et complications. En effet, un grand nombre des arguments retenus par les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling et avanc\u00e9s devant nous par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario et d\u2019autres ont eux aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fendus avec vigueur et rejet\u00e9s fermement par notre Cour en 2015 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la Cour dans cette affaire, j\u2019estime que la jurisprudence fournit toujours une approche fond\u00e9e sur des principes qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir quand les effets d\u2019une sanction portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00e0 un point tel que la sanction constitue une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e. \u00c9laborer les questions et crit\u00e8res normatifs multiples et parfois nuanc\u00e9s qui sont ou peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du cadre devrait aider \u00e0 mettre un terme au \u00ab d\u00e9bat aux proportions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00bb qui concerne \u00e0 l\u2019occasion l\u2019art. 12 (par. 61, la juge en chef McLachlin). Bien qu\u2019aucun virage m\u00e9thodologique de taille ne soit justifi\u00e9, la Cour cherche \u00e0 apporter plus de clart\u00e9 et \u00e0 fournir une meilleure orientation en la mati\u00e8re.\nC. Premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape : d\u00e9termination d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e\n[50] Dans la pr\u00e9sente partie, je d\u00e9cris la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12, laquelle porte sur la mani\u00e8re dont il convient de d\u00e9terminer une peine juste et appropri\u00e9e. Je commence en abordant la situation dans laquelle la contestation constitutionnelle met en cause la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une t\u00e2che famili\u00e8re : un examen complet de toutes les dispositions pertinentes sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine qui figurent dans la l\u00e9gislation et la jurisprudence applicables. Comme la proportionnalit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine a trait \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de l\u2019individu qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal, il est n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise et les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Le but devrait \u00eatre de d\u00e9terminer aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que possible une peine tel qu\u2019il en ressortirait d\u2019une audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine traditionnelle \u2014 particuli\u00e8rement en raison du fait que cette peine serait purg\u00e9e si la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inconstitutionnelle.\n[51] Je passe ensuite aux cas o\u00f9 la contestation constitutionnelle consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des personnes d\u00e9linquantes se trouvant dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles au moyen de sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques. Puisque c\u2019est une loi d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui est contest\u00e9e, notre Cour a maintes fois utilis\u00e9 des sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables pour mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve sa port\u00e9e, son \u00e9tendue, sa nature et ses effets et autoris\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation de tels sc\u00e9narios \u00e0 ces fins. J\u2019explique les fins auxquelles ils servent et les limites auxquelles ils sont assujettis. Ils peuvent comporter des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, mais celles\u2011ci doivent \u00eatre raisonnables, en ce sens qu\u2019elles sont raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles et r\u00e9alistes. Bien qu\u2019un peu plus de souplesse s\u2019impose pour d\u00e9terminer quelle peine serait proportionn\u00e9e pour une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, toute tentative de pr\u00e9cision est encourag\u00e9e afin de s\u2019assurer que la comparaison \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape deux puisse s\u2019effectuer de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable.\n(1) D\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante\n[52] Lorsque la contestation constitutionnelle d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire se fait en fonction de la situation particuli\u00e8re de la personne d\u00e9linquante accus\u00e9e et d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable, la t\u00e2che qui incombe au juge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape un de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur est famili\u00e8re : d\u00e9terminer une peine juste et adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal. Dans la pr\u00e9sente partie, je donne un aper\u00e7u des dispositions et des principes pertinents en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine, en mettant l\u2019accent sur le besoin d\u2019arr\u00eater une peine juste, proportionn\u00e9e et pr\u00e9cise, eu \u00e9gard aux caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles de la personne d\u00e9linquante et aux circonstances entourant la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction.\na) Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine\n[53] Les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel et la common law s\u2019appliquent lorsque vient le temps d\u2019\u00e9valuer la peine juste et appropri\u00e9e dans le cas de la personne d\u00e9linquante concern\u00e9e ou d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible (Nur, par. 40\u201142). Chaque peine doit \u00eatre choisie compte tenu des faits propres \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en cause et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence existante (R. c. Nasogaluak, 2010 CSC 6, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 206, par. 43). Les tribunaux devraient employer les outils et les guides de d\u00e9termination de la peine qui sont les plus \u00e0 propos pour leur ressort. Au moment de fa\u00e7onner une peine juste, les juges peuvent renvoyer aux fourchettes de peines ou aux points de d\u00e9part qui conviennent pour arriver \u00e0 une peine proportionn\u00e9e, pourvu que ces outils concordent avec les principes et objectifs \u00e9tablis de d\u00e9termination de la peine (voir R. c. Parranto, 2021 CSC 46, par. 16).\n[54] Pour aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une peine juste et appropri\u00e9e dans un cas donn\u00e9, le Parlement a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019art. 718 du Code criminel (ou l\u2019art. 38 de la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale pour les adolescents , L.C. 2002, c. 1 , dans les cas qui s\u2019y pr\u00eatent). Il convient de tenir compte ad\u00e9quatement de divers objectifs comme la d\u00e9nonciation, la dissuasion, la r\u00e9insertion sociale, la r\u00e9paration des torts caus\u00e9s aux victimes, la conscientisation des personnes d\u00e9linquantes quant \u00e0 leurs responsabilit\u00e9s et, lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019isolement des personnes d\u00e9linquantes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Aucun objectif de d\u00e9termination de la peine ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres. Les tribunaux devraient \u00e9galement tenir compte de toute circonstance aggravante et att\u00e9nuante se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019infraction ou \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante.\n[55] En outre, l\u2019al. 718.2e) du Code criminel donne la directive obligatoire de tenir compte de la situation unique des d\u00e9linquants autochtones pour toutes les infractions (Gladue, par. 93; R. c. Ipeelee, 2012 CSC 13, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 84\u201185). Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine doit tenir compte des facteurs syst\u00e9miques ou contextuels qui peuvent avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la comparution de la personne d\u00e9linquante autochtone en cause devant le tribunal et des types de proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9termination de la peine et de sanctions qui peuvent \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9es dans le cas de cette personne d\u00e9linquante. Les sanctions substitutives doivent \u00eatre envisag\u00e9es. Bien que notre Cour n\u2019ait pas trait\u00e9 de la question, certaines cours d\u2019appel provinciales ont constat\u00e9 que, dans le cas des personnes d\u00e9linquantes noires et des groupes qui font l\u2019objet de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, la preuve du contexte social ou les facteurs contextuels qui ont peut\u2011\u00eatre contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de la personne d\u00e9linquante devant le tribunal peuvent \u00e9galement servir de facteur att\u00e9nuant lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine (voir, p. ex., R. c. Morris, 2021 ONCA 680, 159 O.R. (3d) 685, par. 13 et 87\u201195; R. c. Anderson, 2021 NSCA 62, 405 C.C.C. (3d) 1, par. 114).\nb) Proportionnalit\u00e9\n[56] La proportionnalit\u00e9 est un \u00ab pr\u00e9cepte central \u00bb du r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9termination de la peine canadien, dont les racines en pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent la reconnaissance en tant que principe fondamental de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.1 du Code criminel (Ipeelee, par. 36, citant R. c. Wilmott (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 33 (C.A. Ont.); voir R. c. Solowan, 2008 CSC 62, [2008] 3 R.C.S. 309, par. 12; Nasogaluak, par. 40\u201142; R. c. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 R.C.S. 500, par. 40\u201142). En effet, \u00ab ind\u00e9pendamment du poids que le juge souhaite accorder \u00e0 l\u2019un des objectifs [de d\u00e9termination de la peine prescrits aux art. 718 \u00e0 718.2 du Code criminel ], la peine doit respecter le principe fondamental de proportionnalit\u00e9 \u00bb (Nasogaluak, par. 40 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[57] L\u2019objectif de proportionnalit\u00e9 repose sur [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la justice \u00bb (R. c. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), p. 546). Il consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine injuste pour le [traduction] \u00ab bien commun \u00bb (p. 547) et joue un r\u00f4le restrictif pour assurer \u00ab la justice de la peine envers le d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (Ipeelee, par. 37). Pour ce qui est de la \u00ab condition sine qua non d\u2019une sanction juste \u00bb (par. 37), le concept indique que l\u2019ampleur de la peine inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante doit \u00eatre proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante (R. c. Safarzadeh\u2011Markhali, 2016 CSC 14, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 180, par. 70\u201171; R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089, par. 51\u201154; Ipeelee, par. 36 et 38; Nur, par. 43; C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10e \u00e9d. 2020), \u00a72.14).\n[58] La \u00ab gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction au sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et elle se refl\u00e8te dans la sanction potentielle impos\u00e9e par le Parlement et dans toute caract\u00e9ristique pr\u00e9cise de la perp\u00e9tration du crime (R. c. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), par. 90). La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction doit \u00eatre mesur\u00e9e en tenant compte des cons\u00e9quences des agissements de la personne d\u00e9linquante sur les victimes et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, ainsi que du pr\u00e9judice corporel et psychologique d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019infraction. Dans certains cas o\u00f9 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s ou de la haine sont pr\u00e9sents, la motivation de la personne d\u00e9linquante peut elle aussi s\u2019av\u00e9rer pertinente (voir le sous\u2011al. 718.2a)(i) du Code criminel ). La culpabilit\u00e9 morale ou le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante doit \u00eatre mesur\u00e9 en \u00e9valuant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs essentiels de l\u2019infraction, notamment sa mens rea, la conduite de la personne d\u00e9linquante dans la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, le mobile qui a pouss\u00e9 la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 commettre l\u2019infraction et les aspects du v\u00e9cu de cette personne qui renforcent ou diminuent sa responsabilit\u00e9 individuelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du crime, y compris sa situation personnelle et sa capacit\u00e9 mentale (Hamilton, par. 91; Boudreault, par. 68; Ipeelee, par. 73).\n[59] De plus, la peine impos\u00e9e doit \u00eatre proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la \u00ab culpabilit\u00e9 morale du d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (Ipeelee, par. 37). La peine ne doit pas exc\u00e9der la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante (Nasogaluak, par. 40\u201142; M. (C.A.), par. 40; R. c. Martineau, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 633, p. 645).\n[60] En exposant le processus en deux \u00e9tapes dans Nur, la juge en chef McLachlin a affirm\u00e9 au par. 46 :\nPremi\u00e8rement, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer ce qui constituerait une peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019infraction eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel . Deuxi\u00e8mement, il lui faut d\u00e9cider si la disposition contraint \u00e0 l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine totalement disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e.\nSur la base du passage pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, d\u2019aucuns soutiennent que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape ne consiste qu\u2019\u00e0 fixer une peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019infraction uniquement. Selon eux, seule la nature de l\u2019infraction compte, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de prendre en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019autres aspects de la proportionnalit\u00e9, tels que la culpabilit\u00e9 morale ou les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles de la personne d\u00e9linquante.\n[61] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, cette interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite est incompl\u00e8te et sugg\u00e8re que la juge en chef McLachlin a choisi, sans explication, de ne renvoyer qu\u2019\u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble bien connu de la proportionnalit\u00e9. Il est plus raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer que sa mention d\u2019une \u00ab peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00bb incorpore \u00e0 la fois la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Son exigence que la peine soit \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction des objectifs et des principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel reconna\u00eet et incorpore express\u00e9ment les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles et la situation de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Selon ces principes, il n\u2019existe aucune peine proportionn\u00e9e qui tient compte uniquement de l\u2019infraction et fait abstraction de la personne d\u00e9linquante. La d\u00e9termination de la peine envisag\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur englobe donc les deux aspects de la proportionnalit\u00e9.\nc) La peine doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9finie\n[62] La d\u00e9termination de la peine est une entreprise \u00e9minemment individualis\u00e9e et discr\u00e9tionnaire (R. c. Suter, 2018 CSC 34, [2018] 2 R.C.S. 496, par. 4; M. (C.A.), par. 92). Chaque peine doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e sur mesure \u00e0 l\u2019infraction en cause de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante concern\u00e9e (R. c. Bottineau, 2011 ONCA 194, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 227; R. c. Angelillo, 2006 CSC 55, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 728; R. c. Shoker, 2006 CSC 44, [2006] 2 R.C.S. 399). Il n\u2019y a pas de sanction [traduction] \u00ab universelle \u00bb (R. c. Lee, 2012 ABCA 17, 58 Alta. L.R. (5th) 30, par. 12), car la peine est \u00ab un processus profond\u00e9ment subjectif \u00bb et \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement individualis\u00e9 \u00bb (M. (C.A.), par. 92; R. c. Shropshire, [1995] 4 R.C.S. 227, par. 46) :\nLa d\u00e9termination d\u2019une peine juste et appropri\u00e9e est un art d\u00e9licat, o\u00f9 l\u2019on tente de doser soigneusement les divers objectifs soci\u00e9taux de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 morale du d\u00e9linquant et aux circonstances de l\u2019infraction, tout en ne perdant jamais de vue les besoins de la communaut\u00e9 et les conditions qui y r\u00e8gnent.\n(M. (C.A.), par. 91)\n[63] Au cours des plaidoiries, les avocats plaident souvent en faveur d\u2019une peine se situant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une certaine fourchette de peines, ou les cours d\u2019appel \u00e9tablissent des fourchettes ou points de d\u00e9part en qu\u00eate de parit\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine ne peut se contenter, au final, d\u2019infliger une peine approximative ou de proposer par ailleurs un \u00e9ventail de peines. Le juge doit formuler une peine individuelle, pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9finie. Il ne saurait ordonner qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante soit incarc\u00e9r\u00e9e pour deux ou trois mois, ou infliger une peine d\u2019\u00ab environ trois ans \u00bb ou \u00ab se situant dans la fourchette \u00bb. Le juge doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans chaque cas et fixer une peine pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9finie.\n[64] La d\u00e9termination de la peine n\u2019est pas une science exacte. Il peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer difficile pour les juges de choisir la peine parfaitement adapt\u00e9e au crime, car il existe souvent plus d\u2019une peine r\u00e9pondant bien \u00e0 un crime (Hamilton, par. 85 et 156; Ruby, \u00a72.5; Shropshire, par. 48, citant R. c. Muise (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119 (C.A. N.\u2011\u00c9.), p. 123\u2011124). Voil\u00e0 cependant le fardeau que supportent chaque jour les juges charg\u00e9s de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, s\u2019il est possible de mentionner les fourchettes de peines et points de d\u00e9part applicables \u00e0 l\u2019infraction en vue d\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la sanction juste, la peine inflig\u00e9e ne doit comporter aucune approximation. La question cl\u00e9 est la suivante : quelle est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la peine juste pour cette personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier?\n[65] La pr\u00e9cision et la certitude de la sanction juridique sont n\u00e9cessaires puisque tous doivent savoir exactement quelle peine a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e et quand elle prendra fin. De m\u00eame, si la peine minimale obligatoire est invalid\u00e9e, la peine fix\u00e9e par le juge \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur sera inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante. Le fait de choisir scrupuleusement une peine pr\u00e9cise et d\u00e9finie favorise l\u2019atteinte d\u2019un r\u00e9sultat \u00e9quitable sur le plan analytique et fond\u00e9 sur des principes \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12.\n[66] Quand le juge Lamer a \u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith, p. 1073, qu\u2019un tribunal doit d\u2019abord prendre en consid\u00e9ration \u00ab les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire afin de d\u00e9terminer quelles peines auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 appropri\u00e9es pour punir, r\u00e9habiliter ou dissuader ce contrevenant particulier \u00bb, il parlait de la fa\u00e7on dont il convient d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019une peine \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, et non pas de la mani\u00e8re dont il convient de tenir une audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Il n\u2019a pas dit que fixer la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape pouvait mettre en jeu une \u00ab gamme de peines \u00bb comme nous exhortent \u00e0 le faire certains intervenants. M\u00eame les personnes d\u00e9linquantes se trouvant dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de qui la latitude est plus grande, doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un dosage soign\u00e9 du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et se voir infliger une peine aussi pr\u00e9cise que cela est n\u00e9cessaire dans une proc\u00e9dure traditionnelle et habituelle de d\u00e9termination de la peine.\n(2) D\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 infliger aux personnes d\u00e9linquantes se trouvant dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles et le recours \u00e0 des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables\n[67] Dans d\u2019autres cas, les tribunaux seront appel\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration la situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible de personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui ne comparaissent pas devant eux. Dans ces cas, l\u2019analyse constitutionnelle est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par des, ou s\u2019effectue en fonction de, sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables qui soul\u00e8vent des questions r\u00e9alistes au sujet de la port\u00e9e de la peine minimale obligatoire et de son application \u00e0 tous. Les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling proposent que notre Cour laisse tomber l\u2019utilisation de sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. \u00c0 mon avis, cette proposition va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la jurisprudence de notre Cour et est d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de fondement. Dans la pr\u00e9sente partie, j\u2019explique que les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles sont un outil accept\u00e9 et appropri\u00e9 qui permet de cerner la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition attaqu\u00e9e afin d\u2019en \u00e9tudier la constitutionnalit\u00e9. J\u2019aborde la mani\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9laborer une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible; je traite des raisons pour lesquelles les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, dont l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, ne doivent pas \u00eatre exclues de l\u2019analyse; et je sugg\u00e8re que les hypoth\u00e8ses doivent \u00eatre raisonnables et que le processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de les mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve.\na) Les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles sont un outil d\u2019analyse accept\u00e9 et appropri\u00e9\n[68] \u00c0 mesure que s\u2019est constitu\u00e9e la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, notre Cour a toujours accept\u00e9 que les peines peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es non seulement au motif qu\u2019elles portent atteinte aux droits que garantit l\u2019art. 12 \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier, mais aussi au motif qu\u2019elles portent atteinte aux droits d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. \u00c0 partir de l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith, notre Cour a \u00e9tabli le recours \u00e0 une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable pour d\u00e9terminer si une peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Les juges majoritaires dans cette d\u00e9cision ont invalid\u00e9 une peine minimale obligatoire de sept ans pour importation de stup\u00e9fiants parce qu\u2019une telle peine serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e si elle \u00e9tait inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 une jeune personne hypoth\u00e9tique qui rentre chez elle en voiture au Canada avec une petite quantit\u00e9 de marijuana.\n[69] Depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith, des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soit explicitement utilis\u00e9es par notre Cour pour invalider des dispositions sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine (voir Nur, par. 82\u201183; Lloyd, par. 32\u201133; Boudreault, par. 55), soit confirm\u00e9es en principe lorsqu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9es (voir Goltz, p. 515; Morrisey, par. 31 et 51\u201153; Ferguson, par. 30; Bissonnette, par. 63). Fait important, dans les trois affaires o\u00f9 notre Cour a invalid\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires, elle l\u2019a fait en fonction d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable (Smith, Nur et Lloyd).\n[70] Outre l\u2019art. 12, l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative sur la base d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables constitue une m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse accept\u00e9e dans les contestations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es en tant qu\u2019outil d\u2019analyse dans la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7, ce qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des contestations de ce genre couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s (R. c. Heywood, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 761, p. 799; R. c. Appulonappa, 2015 CSC 59, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 754, par. 29\u201130 et 72\u201175; R. c. Ndhlovu, 2022 CSC 38, par. 87\u201188).\n[71] Dans Nur, notre Cour a \u00e9tabli certains principes obligatoires concernant l\u2019utilisation d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables. La juge en chef McLachlin a dit que l\u2019utilisation d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables se trouvait \u00ab au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00bb (par. 47) et les a int\u00e9gr\u00e9es au contenu essentiel de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12. Notre Cour a rejet\u00e9 fermement et clairement l\u2019argument voulant qu\u2019on laisse tomber les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables et que l\u2019analyse s\u2019attache principalement, voire uniquement, \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante qui saisit le tribunal (par. 48\u201164; voir aussi C. Fehr, \u00ab Tying Down the Tracks : Severity, Method, and the Text of Section 12 of the Charter \u00bb (2021), 25 Rev. can. D.P. 235, p. 240). D\u00e8s 2015, il \u00e9tait reconnu que \u00ab ne pas tenir compte des applications raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles d\u2019une disposition cr\u00e9ant une peine minimale obligatoire irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie de la Cour et limiterait de mani\u00e8re artificielle l\u2019analyse portant sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la disposition \u00bb (Nur, par. 49).\n[72] Exclure la prise en compte des r\u00e9percussions raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles d\u2019une disposition attaqu\u00e9e \u00ab r\u00e9duirait radicalement la port\u00e9e de la Charte et la facult\u00e9 qu\u2019ont les tribunaux de s\u2019acquitter de leur obligation de s\u2019assurer de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des lois et de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre constitutionnel \u00bb (Nur, par. 63). Comme c\u2019est la \u00ab nature de la loi \u00bb qui est en question, et non le statut du demandeur, ce dernier n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 all\u00e9guer des effets inconstitutionnels dans sa cause ou sur des tiers (par. 51, citant R. c. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, p. 314). En \u00e9laborant des hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables, le tribunal examine la port\u00e9e de la disposition attaqu\u00e9e, et \u00ab non pas simplement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine particuli\u00e8re prononc\u00e9e par un juge lors du proc\u00e8s \u00bb (Goltz, p. 503\u2011504; voir Big M Drug Mart, p. 314; Nur, par. 60). De plus, \u00ab [s]i une loi inconstitutionnelle ne pouvait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e qu\u2019au regard des faits pr\u00e9cis d\u2019une instance donn\u00e9e, des lois invalides pourraient demeurer en vigueur ind\u00e9finiment \u00bb (Nur, par. 51).\n[73] L\u2019utilisation efficace des ressources judiciaires favorise \u00e9galement le recours \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables, car celles\u2011ci permettent \u00e0 un juge d\u2019envisager une peine minimale obligatoire attaqu\u00e9e de plusieurs points de vue et aident \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le nombre de contestations qui seront instruites dans ou entre plusieurs ressorts. Fait important, elles favorisent la primaut\u00e9 du droit en soulignant que personne ne devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable ou condamn\u00e9 en application d\u2019une loi inconstitutionnelle (Lloyd, par. 16). Ainsi, [traduction] \u00ab permettre \u00e0 la personne accus\u00e9e d\u2019employer des sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables est plus susceptible de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objet de la Charte : prot\u00e9ger les citoyens contre les abus du pouvoir de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb (Fehr, p. 236).\n[74] C\u2019est pour ces raisons que, pour reprendre les propos de la juge en chef McLachlin, \u00ab [l]a Cour a toujours estim\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne pouvait contester une disposition l\u00e9gislative sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 m\u00eame lorsque ses propres droits n\u2019\u00e9taient pas bafou\u00e9s par la disposition \u00bb (Nur, par. 51; voir aussi Goltz, p. 503\u2011504). Selon une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, il n\u2019est point n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019attendre qu\u2019une \u00ab vraie \u00bb personne d\u00e9linquante se pr\u00e9sente pour attaquer la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[75] Le d\u00e9sir des juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling de retirer l\u2019utilisation de sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019art. 12 \u00e9tabli par notre Cour est donc tout \u00e0 fait contraire aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et aux principes. Ils se fondent sur certaines parties d\u2019opinions dissidentes de notre Cour et ne suivent pas les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s faisant autorit\u00e9 voulant que les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables soient un dispositif \u00e9tabli dont se servent les tribunaux pour d\u00e9cider si une peine prescrite par la loi est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12 (S. Chaster, \u00ab Cruel, Unusual, and Constitutionally Infirm : Mandatory Minimum Sentences in Canada \u00bb (2018), 23 Appeal 89, p. 96).\nb) D\u00e9finition des param\u00e8tres d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible\n[76] Un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable doit \u00eatre concoct\u00e9 avec soin. Bien qu\u2019il soit peut\u2011\u00eatre tentant de laisser le mot \u00ab hypoth\u00e9tique \u00bb avoir le dessus, c\u2019est le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du sc\u00e9nario qui doit \u00eatre soulign\u00e9 (Nur, par. 57). M\u00eame si la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure n\u2019a bien souvent pas expliqu\u00e9 ou \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les rouages de l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable, ou tendait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les hypoth\u00e8ses plus \u00e9troitement et d\u2019un point de vue plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, la d\u00e9marche analytique plus r\u00e9cente adopt\u00e9e dans les arr\u00eats Nur, Lloyd et Boudreault est plus large et ouvre la porte \u00e0 des hypoth\u00e8ses plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9es.\n[77] Parmi les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable, mentionnons les suivantes :\n(i) L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se doit \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible;\n(ii) Les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019analyse;\n(iii) La situation hypoth\u00e9tique doit \u00eatre raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes vis\u00e9s par l\u2019infraction en question;\n(iv) Les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles peuvent \u00eatre prises en compte pourvu qu\u2019elles ne soient pas adapt\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er des exemples invraisemblables ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce;\n(v) Le processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables.\n(i) L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se doit \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible\n[78] Dans toute la jurisprudence, les tribunaux se pr\u00e9occupent l\u00e9gitimement du fait que les hypoth\u00e8ses doivent \u00eatre raisonnables. Elles ne devraient pas \u00eatre des \u00ab situations invraisemblables ou difficilement imaginables \u00bb, ni \u00eatre des \u00ab exemples extr\u00eames ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (Morrisey, par. 30, citant Goltz, p. 506 et 515). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Goltz, la Cour s\u2019est attach\u00e9e aux circonstances qui \u00ab pourraient se pr\u00e9senter couramment dans la vie quotidienne \u00bb (p. 516).\n[79] Une plus grande souplesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, lorsque la Cour a conclu que la m\u00e9thode appropri\u00e9e consistait \u00e0 imaginer une personne d\u00e9linquante dont les caract\u00e9ristiques et la situation sont raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles compte tenu de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire et du bon sens (par. 62). Le choix et l\u2019utilisation de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur sont significatifs et vont au\u2011del\u00e0 de la question de savoir si une application projet\u00e9e du droit est commune ou probable :\nLe crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable ne s\u2019applique pas uniquement aux situations qui se pr\u00e9senteront vraisemblablement dans le cadre de l\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et habituelle de la loi. Il requiert plut\u00f4t qu\u2019on se demande quelles situations sont raisonnablement susceptibles de se pr\u00e9senter. Il vise les cas dont il est pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019ils tombent sous le coup des conditions minimales de perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction. Seules sont \u00e9cart\u00e9es les situations \u00ab invraisemblables \u00bb ou \u00ab n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb . . . [par. 68]\n[80] Ainsi, il faut se demander quel effet a la disposition sur d\u2019autres personnes raisonnablement susceptibles de tomber sous le coup de celle\u2011ci (Nur, par. 47) et quelles sont les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles o\u00f9 la loi pourrait s\u2019appliquer.\n(ii) Les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019analyse\n[81] Lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9finissent la port\u00e9e du sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique et les qualit\u00e9s d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, les tribunaux peuvent s\u2019appuyer sur les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s, comme l\u2019a fait notre Cour dans Boudreault. Bien que les cas limites puissent \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s (Morrisey), la Cour a confirm\u00e9 dans Nur qu\u2019il est permis de s\u2019appuyer sur les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s, car non seulement ils montrent toute l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes susceptibles de tomber concr\u00e8tement sous le coup de l\u2019infraction, mais les situations en cause se sont \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00bb (par. 72). Quoique potentiellement utiles, les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s ne devraient pas servir d\u2019autorisation ou de carcan, et les tribunaux peuvent modifier les faits d\u2019un cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 pour illustrer des sc\u00e9narios raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles (par. 62 et 72). Les cas \u00e0 la disposition des tribunaux ne se limitent pas aux situations hypoth\u00e9tiques.\n(iii) La situation hypoth\u00e9tique doit \u00eatre raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes vis\u00e9s par l\u2019infraction en question\n[82] L\u2019\u00e9tendue, l\u2019ampleur et la port\u00e9e de la disposition attaqu\u00e9e occupent une place importante sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12. On peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques propos\u00e9es mettent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve le genre de conduite qui devrait raisonnablement tomber sous le coup de la disposition attaqu\u00e9e et les effets raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles de celle\u2011ci (Nur, par. 62).\n[83] Pour \u00eatre raisonnable, la situation hypoth\u00e9tique doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019infraction en question. Elle doit mettre en jeu une conduite qui tombe sous le coup de la disposition pertinente. La port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction peut \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9e, et il est permis d\u2019en \u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e9tendue compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont elle peut \u00eatre commise et de son auteur. Il n\u2019est cependant pas utile de forcer chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif au moyen de faits fantaisistes. Les combinaisons incroyables de comportements \u00e9tranges en disent plus long au tribunal sur l\u2019imagination des avocats que sur la v\u00e9ritable port\u00e9e de la disposition attaqu\u00e9e. Le sc\u00e9nario dans son ensemble doit \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible.\n(iv) Les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles peuvent \u00eatre prises en compte pourvu qu\u2019elles ne soient pas adapt\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er des exemples invraisemblables ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[84] Plusieurs intervenants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et dans Hilbach cherchent \u00e0 restreindre l\u2019utilisation de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, par exemple, propose que les circonstances personnelles att\u00e9nuantes [traduction] \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9riques \u00bb qui ne sont pas \u00ab propres \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019infraction, comme l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, soient exclues de ces situations (m. interv., par. 13\u201120; transcription, p. 117\u2011118). Le procureur soutient que les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles immuables, comme la race, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les facteurs li\u00e9s \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 mentale ne fournissent pas de renseignements qui touchent directement \u00e0 l\u2019infraction et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019elles [traduction] \u00ab devraient \u00eatre exclues de l\u2019analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb (transcription, p. 119). D\u2019apr\u00e8s le procureur, il ne suffit pas qu\u2019un sc\u00e9nario soit [traduction] \u00ab possible en th\u00e9orie \u00bb; on doit \u00e9galement \u00ab s\u2019attendre \u00bb \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente (p. 120\u2011121). De l\u2019avis du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, les caract\u00e9ristiques telles la race ou l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 ne sont pas des caract\u00e9ristiques \u00ab attendues \u00bb qu\u2019il convient d\u2019utiliser dans des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la directrice des poursuites p\u00e9nales accepte que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 puisse faire partie \u00e0 juste titre d\u2019une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable.\n[85] Des arguments similaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, lorsque la Cour a statu\u00e9 que de telles caract\u00e9ristiques ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre retranch\u00e9es du test. En fait, un \u00ab examen des situations dont il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019elles tombent sous le coup de la loi peut tenir compte des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles des personnes auxquelles pourrait s\u2019appliquer la peine minimale obligatoire \u00bb (par. 76). Dans cette affaire, la Cour a effectivement invalid\u00e9 la disposition sur la base d\u2019une situation hypoth\u00e9tique mettant en cause le propri\u00e9taire responsable d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, titulaire d\u2019un permis, qui a entrepos\u00e9 incorrectement et inconsciemment une arme vis\u00e9e par un permis d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui contrevenait \u00e0 la loi (par. 82). De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lloyd, la Cour a invalid\u00e9 la peine minimale d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vue pour certaines infractions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la drogue en se fondant sur deux sc\u00e9narios diff\u00e9rents. Les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques \u00e9taient d\u00e9taill\u00e9es : l\u2019une concernait une personne marginalis\u00e9e qui connaissait la pauvret\u00e9, avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 terme sa d\u00e9sintoxication, et avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure. Dans l\u2019autre situation hypoth\u00e9tique, une personne avait partag\u00e9 une petite quantit\u00e9 de drogue avec un ami ou conjoint. Dans Boudreault, notre Cour a abord\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste les diff\u00e9rentes circonstances concr\u00e8tes dans lesquelles se trouvent des d\u00e9linquants, y compris la pauvret\u00e9, la maladie, la d\u00e9ficience, la d\u00e9pendance et d\u2019autres d\u00e9savantages qui pouvaient r\u00e9duire la culpabilit\u00e9 morale d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante, montrant ainsi des caract\u00e9ristiques r\u00e9elles et pr\u00e9visibles de vrais d\u00e9linquants (par. 55 et 58).\n[86] Notre Cour ne devrait pas s\u2019\u00e9carter de la m\u00e9thode et de la d\u00e9marche confirm\u00e9es dans les arr\u00eats Nur, Lloyd et Boudreault. En principe, les caract\u00e9ristiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles dans le cas des d\u00e9linquants qui comparaissent devant les tribunaux canadiens, comme l\u2019\u00e2ge, la pauvret\u00e9, la race, l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et la d\u00e9pendance, ne devraient pas \u00eatre occult\u00e9es. La proportionnalit\u00e9, un principe obligatoire de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tabli par le Code criminel , n\u00e9cessite la prise en compte de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de la situation particuli\u00e8re de la personne d\u00e9linquante, y compris ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles (Nasogaluak, par. 42; Ipeelee, par. 38). L\u2019\u00e9valuation que l\u2019on fait de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire devrait elle aussi \u00eatre ancr\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re similaire dans les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de la vie des gens.\n[87] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les dispositions obligatoires sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine et les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s contemporaines, il n\u2019y a aucune bonne raison pour laquelle la race et l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 ne pourraient pas elles aussi \u00eatre des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles pertinentes en droit pour les sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 718.2e) du Code criminel a caract\u00e8re obligatoire et a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la surincarc\u00e9ration des Autochtones et \u00e0 leur repr\u00e9sentation disproportionn\u00e9e au sein du syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale canadien. La triste v\u00e9rit\u00e9, c\u2019est qu\u2019il est plus que \u00ab possible en th\u00e9orie \u00bb que l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 fasse partie des caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante. Non seulement les d\u00e9linquants autochtones se trouvent dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles au sens envisag\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, les statistiques enregistr\u00e9es au fil des ans d\u00e9montrent que les Autochtones sont largement surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant les tribunaux. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour les personnes noires et d\u2019autres d\u00e9linquants racis\u00e9s qui sont surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale et dont les d\u00e9savantages historiques et syst\u00e9miques subis peuvent r\u00e9duire leur culpabilit\u00e9 morale (Ipeelee, par. 73; Anderson, par. 146; Morris, par. 179).\n[88] La crainte qui sous\u2011tend la positon du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario est que, si les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, tels les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue, sont prises en compte, la peine juste sera alors tellement r\u00e9duite \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que la disproportion deviendrait plus grande \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, ce qui fragiliserait davantage les peines minimales obligatoires sur le plan constitutionnel (D. Stuart, \u00ab Boudreault : The Supreme Court Strikes Down Mandatory Victim Surcharges to Protect Vulnerable Offenders \u00bb (2019), 50 C.R. (7th) 276). Je n\u2019accepte pas que tout enjeu constitutionnel susceptible de se pr\u00e9senter dans de telles circonstances d\u00e9coulera de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique propos\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que de la port\u00e9e et des effets juridiques de la peine minimale obligatoire. Tel qu\u2019il est expliqu\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail en ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, la norme constitutionnelle est stricte au chapitre de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. L\u2019article 12 n\u2019est pas viol\u00e9 du fait de l\u2019absence ou de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un principe de d\u00e9termination de la peine, m\u00eame un principe aussi important que celui \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e) et lorsque l\u2019infraction met en cause une conduite grave, les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles et la situation de la personne d\u00e9linquante rev\u00eatent n\u00e9cessairement moins d\u2019importance (Latimer, par. 85).\n[89] Le Parlement est r\u00e9put\u00e9 savoir que la peine minimale qu\u2019il choisit s\u2019applique \u00e0 \u00ab chacun \u00bb, tout comme le droit garanti par l\u2019art. 12 \u00e0 la protection contre tous traitements ou peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s. Cela signifie que tous les gens, peu importe leurs caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection de l\u2019art. 12. Le Canada est un pays vaste et diversifi\u00e9, et les gens poss\u00e8dent des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles susceptibles d\u2019aggraver ou d\u2019att\u00e9nuer leur culpabilit\u00e9 morale. Il convient d\u2019analyser les effets d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019aune de la port\u00e9e de la disposition et de la dur\u00e9e de la peine choisie, mais \u00e9galement au regard de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la population \u00e0 laquelle elle est vou\u00e9e s\u2019appliquer.\n[90] L\u2019int\u00e9gration des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles immuables aux sc\u00e9narios hypoth\u00e9tiques renforce le dispositif analytique en aidant les tribunaux \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la port\u00e9e de la sanction obligatoire. Des individus dont la culpabilit\u00e9 est r\u00e9duite pourraient \u00eatre passibles de peines minimales obligatoires. Il se peut que le Parlement ait fix\u00e9 des peines en songeant \u00e0 une certaine personne d\u00e9linquante sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir pleinement \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que la sanction obligatoire s\u2019applique \u00e0 des d\u00e9linquants dont la culpabilit\u00e9 morale est r\u00e9duite en raison de leur situation d\u00e9savantageuse, y compris la marginalisation ou la discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\n[91] L\u2019utilisation de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles comporte une limite importante : les sc\u00e9narios ne devraient pas mettre en cause la personne d\u00e9linquante la plus \u00ab sympathi[que] \u00bb; ils devraient plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9senter une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible (Nur, par. 75). La situation hypoth\u00e9tique ne saurait n\u2019avoir qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre invraisemblable ou tout \u00e0 fait irr\u00e9aliste (par. 76). Le tribunal devrait se m\u00e9fier des sc\u00e9narios d\u00e9taill\u00e9s regorgeant de facteurs att\u00e9nuants conjugu\u00e9s \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation qui \u00e9largit et force le sens technique de l\u2019infraction, comme certaines des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques \u00e9voqu\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky dans le pourvoi connexe (Hilbach, par. 89).\n[92] Il n\u2019est gu\u00e8re logique d\u2019\u00e9valuer des sc\u00e9narios qui, compte tenu du bon sens et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire, semblent farfelus. Comme le montrent les salles d\u2019audience au Canada, il arrive parfois que la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u00e9passe la fiction. Cela ne devrait toutefois pas inviter les tribunaux \u00e0 envisager chaque cas \u00ab sympathique \u00bb au motif qu\u2019il pourrait se pr\u00e9senter ou se pr\u00e9sentera peut\u2011\u00eatre un jour. Il peut y avoir un rare cas o\u00f9 tous les facteurs sont att\u00e9nuants et ont pour effet de r\u00e9duire la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante, mais l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire met en relief le besoin de voir \u00e0 ce que le sc\u00e9nario dans son ensemble soit raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit la juge en chef McLachlin dans Nur, \u00ab [u]ne loi ne saurait \u00eatre rendue inop\u00e9rante sur la base de pures conjectures \u00bb (par. 62).\n(v) Le processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables\n[93] Il revient \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante\/demanderesse de formuler et d\u2019avancer la situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible sur laquelle repose l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la disposition attaqu\u00e9e est inconstitutionnelle. Toutes les parties devraient id\u00e9alement se voir accorder une possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de contester ou de commenter le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique avant de pr\u00e9senter des arguments sur ses cons\u00e9quences au plan constitutionnel. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est courant que les tribunaux interrogent les avocats \u00e0 propos du contenu et des contours de tout sc\u00e9nario propos\u00e9 en tant que situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une bonne pratique qui apporte de la transparence aux arguments et rend le processus \u00e9quitable. Je conviens avec la juge Antonio que la rigueur du processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables (par. 69). Il y a des avantages \u00e0 donner aux parties l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur ce qu\u2019est une personne d\u00e9linquante r\u00e9aliste et raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Les parties peuvent ainsi aider le juge \u00e0 d\u00e9cider quel genre de situation hypoth\u00e9tique est raisonnable dans les circonstances. Toutefois, bien qu\u2019il faille encourager la mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable au moyen du processus contradictoire, cela n\u2019est pas obligatoire en ce sens que l\u2019absence de cette mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve ne constitue pas une erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision.\nc) D\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible\n[94] Les m\u00eames principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de d\u00e9termination de la peine s\u2019appliquent lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de fixer la peine \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Cela veut dire que les juges charg\u00e9s de la d\u00e9termination de la peine : seront li\u00e9s par le Code criminel ; prendront connaissance des propositions relatives \u00e0 la peine \u00e0 imposer faites par les avocats; et utiliseront la m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse retenue dans leur ressort (qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des fourchettes de peines ou des points de d\u00e9part). Comme pour les affaires impliquant une vraie personne d\u00e9linquante, les tribunaux devraient fixer une peine d\u00e9finie aussi \u00e9troitement que possible pour une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnable pr\u00e9visible. Le tribunal peut cependant trouver plus difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir une peine pr\u00e9cise pour une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, puisque les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques sont \u00e9voqu\u00e9es en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou de faits d\u00e9taill\u00e9s. En cons\u00e9quence, une certaine latitude peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer n\u00e9cessaire dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine juste pour une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Si le tribunal n\u2019est peut\u2011\u00eatre pas en mesure d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un seul chiffre, les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ne sont pas tr\u00e8s utiles non plus. Affirmer, par exemple, que la jurisprudence \u00e9tayerait une peine de trois \u00e0 cinq ans ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 la question de savoir quelle peine la personne d\u00e9linquante se verrait autrement infliger et ne facilite pas l\u2019analyse. Les tribunaux peuvent pr\u00e9ciser, par exemple, qu\u2019une peine serait \u00ab autour \u00bb d\u2019un certain nombre de mois. Pour d\u00e9terminer la peine \u00e0 imposer \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, il faut essentiellement adopter la m\u00eame d\u00e9marche qu\u2019emploient les juges lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent chaque jour les peines des d\u00e9linquants dans les salles d\u2019audience des quatre coins du pays. Toute estimation doit \u00eatre circonscrite et rigoureusement d\u00e9finie.\n[95] Donner une port\u00e9e trop large \u00e0 ce qui constituerait une peine juste risque de faire d\u00e9vier l\u2019analyse et de fausser l\u2019\u00e9valuation du caract\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 en r\u00e9duisant de mani\u00e8re injuste la disparit\u00e9 entre la peine inflig\u00e9e et la peine minimale obligatoire. En effet, comme l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable vise \u00e0 tester les limites du champ d\u2019application d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire, la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re peine juste qui est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible occupera une place importante dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la grande marge d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019int\u00e9grer de la flexibilit\u00e9 dans la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e.\n[96] Je passe maintenant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse.\nD. Deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape : la norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e\n[97] Une fois que la peine juste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, cette derni\u00e8re se transforme en une comparaison entre la peine juste ainsi \u00e9tablie et la peine pr\u00e9vue par la disposition contest\u00e9e. Que la peine minimale obligatoire soit contest\u00e9e en fonction de ses effets sur le contrevenant en cause ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible se trouvant dans une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable, la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est le crit\u00e8re applicable pour invalider cette peine en vertu de l\u2019art. 12 au motif qu\u2019elle est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e (Nur, par. 39 et 77; Lloyd, par. 22; Smith, p. 1073).\n[98] Je d\u00e9bute ci\u2011dessous par deux points pr\u00e9liminaires : premi\u00e8rement, j\u2019explique les raisons pour lesquelles les juges d\u2019appel O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling ont commis une erreur en concluant que l\u2019art. 12 ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 l\u2019emprisonnement et, deuxi\u00e8mement, je r\u00e9affirme que la comparaison s\u2019applique \u00e0 la peine inflig\u00e9e ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle. Je me penche ensuite sur la fa\u00e7on dont la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e, j\u2019explique pourquoi elle demeure la norme applicable sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12 et j\u2019expose le cadre d\u2019analyse permettant de d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Je passe ensuite en revue les indicateurs d\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et j\u2019insiste sur le fait que l\u2019on doit mettre l\u2019accent sur l\u2019infraction en question, la peine pr\u00e9vue et leurs effets sur les personnes passibles de la sanction minimale pr\u00e9vue.\n(1) La protection offerte par l\u2019art. 12 contre les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es s\u2019applique aux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019emprisonnement cruelles et inusit\u00e9es\n[99] Les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling se sont tromp\u00e9s dans leur raisonnement et dans leur d\u00e9cision. Le juge Wakeling n\u2019a pas suivi des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de notre Cour ayant force obligatoire sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte , y compris l\u2019art. 12 . Il a utilis\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode personnelle et singuli\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine plut\u00f4t que de se conformer aux crit\u00e8res juridiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le Code criminel et dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour faisant autorit\u00e9.\n[100] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, sa conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019art. 12 s\u2019applique uniquement aux peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es et que, comme l\u2019emprisonnement ne constitue pas une peine inusit\u00e9e, l\u2019art. 12 ne prot\u00e8ge pas contre les peines d\u2019emprisonnement excessives, est tout simplement erron\u00e9e. L\u2019expression peines \u00ab cruelles et inusit\u00e9es \u00bb n\u2019a pas un sens aussi limit\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de la \u00ab formulation concise d\u2019une norme \u00bb qui s\u2019inspire de valeurs sociales et morales fondamentales plus larges (Smith, p. 1069 et 1072, le juge Lamer, et p. 1088, le juge McIntyre, dissident, citant Miller c. La Reine, [1977] 2 R.C.S. 680, p. 690).\n[101] L\u2019emprisonnement est le ch\u00e2timent le plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re qui peut \u00eatre inflig\u00e9 au Canada (Gladue, par. 36 et 40), et \u00ab [o]utre la peine de mort, l\u2019emprisonnement est la sentence la plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re impos\u00e9e par la loi \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Motor Vehicle Act (C.\u2011B.), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 486, p. 532, la juge Wilson, motifs concordants). Non seulement l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration prive\u2011t\u2011elle totalement la personne d\u00e9linquante de sa libert\u00e9, elle a aussi des r\u00e9percussions en cha\u00eene sur pratiquement tous les aspects de sa vie, de sa sant\u00e9 physique et mentale, de son employabilit\u00e9, de ses enfants et de sa communaut\u00e9 (R. Mangat, More Than We Can Afford : The Costs of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing (2014), p. 40\u201144).\n[102] Comme l\u2019art. 12 a pour objet de pr\u00e9server la dignit\u00e9 humaine, il prot\u00e8ge contre les peines d\u2019emprisonnement exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es. Il permet d\u2019\u00e9viter que des d\u00e9linquants soient condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 des peines totalement injustifi\u00e9es ou carr\u00e9ment injustes, y compris des p\u00e9riodes d\u2019emprisonnement exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es et abusives. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les effets potentiellement d\u00e9vastateurs de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sur la personne d\u00e9linquante (Bissonnette, par. 97), les co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s qu\u2019elle comporte font en sorte qu\u2019elle ne peut \u00eatre impos\u00e9e sans limites, examen ou justification. Notre Cour n\u2019a aucune raison de changer de cap et de soustraire les peines d\u2019emprisonnement manifestement excessives \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 12.\n(2) La comparaison est fond\u00e9e sur la peine, sans tenir compte de la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle\n[103] La Couronne a soutenu que, lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9value la disparit\u00e9 entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire, le tribunal devrait tenir compte de la possibilit\u00e9 de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle. Notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9 ce m\u00eame argument dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, o\u00f9 elle a jug\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019on compare une peine minimale obligatoire \u00e0 la peine juste, on doit mettre l\u2019accent sur la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame. Par cons\u00e9quent, les tribunaux ne doivent pas consid\u00e9rer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle comme un facteur r\u00e9duisant l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de la peine contest\u00e9e, et ce, parce que la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle ne peut rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e (Nur, par. 98).\n[104] La prise en compte de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle dans la comparaison fausse l\u2019analyse en introduisant des sp\u00e9culations injustifi\u00e9es au lieu de comparer deux choses semblables, en l\u2019occurrence deux peines. La lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle est \u00ab un privil\u00e8ge d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative et non un droit \u00bb qui d\u00e9pend d\u2019une d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire de la commission des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles (Nur, par. 98). Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00ab [\u00e0] l\u2019expiration du temps d\u2019\u00e9preuve, la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle n\u2019est pas garantie au contrevenant \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 41). De plus, le syst\u00e8me de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle \u00ab met en place un processus ind\u00e9pendant et distinct de celui de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00bb (par. 37). C\u2019est au tribunal, et non \u00e0 la commission des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles, qu\u2019il revient de s\u2019assurer que la peine inflig\u00e9e n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Le r\u00f4le de la commission des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles est de d\u00e9terminer si la personne d\u00e9linquante peut \u00eatre remise en libert\u00e9 sans danger dans la collectivit\u00e9 (Nur, par. 98).\n[105] L\u2019obligation constitutionnelle de veiller \u00e0 ce que les peines ne soient pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es ne devrait pas \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e des tribunaux judiciaires \u00e0 un tribunal administratif qui exerce ses activit\u00e9s dans un contexte juridique et constitutionnel diff\u00e9rent. La prise en compte de la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle obligerait les juges \u00e0 aborder les complexit\u00e9s des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives r\u00e9gissant la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle et \u00e0 s\u2019interroger, par exemple, sur la place \u00e0 r\u00e9server aux rapports indiquant que les d\u00e9linquants autochtones et noirs sont souvent lib\u00e9r\u00e9s plus tard pendant leur incarc\u00e9ration et ont un taux plus faible d\u2019octroi de la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice, La lumi\u00e8re sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue : d\u00e9fis, exp\u00e9riences et possibilit\u00e9s dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale canadien (2017), p. 8; Bureau de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur correctionnel, \u00c9tude de cas sur la diversit\u00e9 dans les services correctionnels : l\u2019exp\u00e9rience des d\u00e9tenus de race noire dans les p\u00e9nitenciers (2013), par. 84). Enfin, m\u00eame si elle est accord\u00e9e, \u00ab [l]e fait de croire que la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle met fin \u00e0 la peine du contrevenant rel\u00e8ve du mythe. La mise en libert\u00e9 sous condition a uniquement pour effet de modifier les conditions dans lesquelles la peine est purg\u00e9e, mais la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame demeure en vigueur, et ce, pour toute la dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 89, citant M. (C.A.), par. 57).\n(3) Ce qu\u2019il faut entendre par peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e\n[106] Pour aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019art. 12, la peine doit d\u2019abord se distinguer d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e et \u00eatre disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 celle\u2011ci. Le premier volet de la comparaison consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser en quoi, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la peine juste (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape) est diff\u00e9rente de la peine minimale obligatoire. Le tribunal mesure ensuite les effets de cette disparit\u00e9.\n[107] En second lieu, la peine doit \u00eatre disproportionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re flagrante ou \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 d\u00e9mesur\u00e9. Il faut, pour ce faire, cerner l\u2019existence d\u2019une disparit\u00e9 entre les peines et \u00e9valuer les effets et la gravit\u00e9 de la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019aune des normes constitutionnelles.\n[108] Le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019existence et de l\u2019ampleur de toute disparit\u00e9 entre la peine juste et la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue s\u2019apparente \u00e0 celui qui est suivi lorsqu\u2019une peine est port\u00e9e en appel et contest\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle est \u00ab manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e \u00bb. En pareil cas, il y a une comparaison entre la peine qui serait juste et celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e. Les tribunaux ma\u00eetrisent bien cette norme (Parranto, par. 30 et 38). Les facteurs dont ils tiennent compte comprennent la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante, les objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine et toute circonstance aggravante ou att\u00e9nuante.\n[109] La disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est toutefois une norme constitutionnelle. En utilisant des expressions comme \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Boudreault, par. 45; Lloyd, par. 24, citant Morrisey, par. 26; Wiles, par. 4, citant Smith, p. 1072), \u00ab odieuse ou intol\u00e9rable \u00bb pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00ab de nature \u00e0 choquer la conscience \u00bb des Canadiens et des Canadiennes (Morrisey, par. 26; Lloyd, par. 33; Ferguson, par. 14), notre Cour a insist\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises pour dire que la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est une norme exigeante (Lloyd, par. 24; Steele c. \u00c9tablissement Mountain, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1385, p. 1417).\n[110] La question de savoir si une peine \u00ab port[e] atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb, est odieuse ou intol\u00e9rable, \u00ab choqu[e] la conscience \u00bb ou porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine est une question normative (voir Bissonnette, par. 65). La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question ne d\u00e9pend pas de l\u2019opinion du tribunal quant \u00e0 savoir si une majorit\u00e9 de Canadiens et de Canadiennes sont en faveur de cette sanction. L\u2019opinion de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne sur la peine appropri\u00e9e doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction des valeurs et des objectifs qui sous\u2011tendent notre jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine et de notre jurisprudence relative \u00e0 la Charte .\n[111] Le point de d\u00e9part est que la proportionnalit\u00e9 est un pr\u00e9cepte de base du ch\u00e2timent. Cela signifie que la peine inflig\u00e9e doit avoir un rapport direct avec l\u2019infraction commise. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la juge Wilson :\nIl faut que la sentence soit appropri\u00e9e et proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction. Ce n\u2019est que dans ce cas que le public peut \u00eatre convaincu que le contrevenant \u00ab m\u00e9ritait \u00bb la punition qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e et avoir confiance dans l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la rationalit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me.\n(Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Motor Vehicle Act (C.\u2011B.), p. 533)\n[112] La proportionnalit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la justice envers la personne d\u00e9linquante et ne permet pas de punir injustement \u00ab pour le bien commun \u00bb (Priest, p. 547; voir Ipeelee, par. 37). Bien que l\u2019on puisse admettre que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soit profond\u00e9ment pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le comportement criminel \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la condamnation, les gens tiennent \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que les tribunaux infligent des peines justes et \u00e9quitables qui ne sont pas cruelles ou inusit\u00e9es ou exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 la sanction m\u00e9rit\u00e9e.\n[113] De plus, le crit\u00e8re exigeant de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est cens\u00e9 exprimer une certaine d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9labore des dispositions en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Le mot \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00bb indique que le Parlement n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019imposer des peines parfaitement proportionn\u00e9es (Goltz, p. 501; R. c. Lyons, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 309, p. 344\u2011345), au risque de nuire \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir des normes de ch\u00e2timents, y compris des peines minimales obligatoires (Lloyd, par. 45). En effet, s\u2019agissant des peines minimales obligatoires, il existe probablement une certaine disproportion entre la peine adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019individu et la peine minimale obligatoire uniforme.\n[114] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, une peine peut \u00eatre manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e en ce sens qu\u2019une juridiction d\u2019appel interviendrait, tout en ne r\u00e9pondant pas au crit\u00e8re constitutionnel permettant de conclure qu\u2019elle est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire R. c. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), un jeune homme de 21 ans souffrant d\u2019un trouble maniaco\u2011d\u00e9pressif non trait\u00e9 avait plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir utilis\u00e9 une arme \u00e0 feu pour commettre un vol qualifi\u00e9 et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire de 4 ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour cette infraction. Le juge Rosenberg a exprim\u00e9 de nombreuses et s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves au sujet de la justesse de la peine dans le cas de cette personne d\u00e9linquante et a indiqu\u00e9 que, s\u2019il appliquait la norme habituelle de contr\u00f4le en appel, il estimerait qu\u2019une peine de trois \u00e0 quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement serait manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e. Il a n\u00e9anmoins conclu ce qui suit, au par. 72 :\n[traduction] Cela n\u2019est toutefois pas la m\u00eame chose que la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e et je ne suis pas convaincu, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 objective de toute infraction impliquant l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, m\u00eame non charg\u00e9e, qu\u2019une peine de pr\u00e8s de quatre ans choque la conscience.\n[115] Les tribunaux doivent \u00ab \u00e9viter de consid\u00e9rer que toute peine disproportionn\u00e9e ou excessive est contraire \u00e0 la Constitution \u00bb, puisque l\u2019art. 12 existe afin de contr\u00f4ler les limites du processus de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Smith, p. 1072, le juge Lamer, et p. 1091, le juge McIntyre, dissident, mais non sur ce point). Il arrive \u00ab tr\u00e8s rarement \u00bb qu\u2019un tribunal conclue qu\u2019une peine viole l\u2019art. 12, puisque le crit\u00e8re est \u00ab \u00e0 bon droit strict et exigeant \u00bb (Steele, p. 1417; voir aussi Goltz, p. 502).\n(4) La disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est la norme applicable\n[116] La norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e a fait l\u2019objet de critiques de la part des parties ainsi que de diverses autres sources. Les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling se sont dits d\u2019avis que la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9terminer si une peine est cruelle et inusit\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019objectif fondamental \u00bb de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, qui, selon le juge O\u2019Ferrall, est la protection de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et le respect de la loi (par. 117). Le juge Wakeling a quant \u00e0 lui fait remarquer que la proportionnalit\u00e9 n\u2019avait aucun rapport avec l\u2019art. 12 parce que les r\u00e9dacteurs ne l\u2019avaient pas express\u00e9ment incluse dans le libell\u00e9 de la loi (par. 229\u2011230).\n[117] Pour d\u2019autres, le crit\u00e8re est trop exigeant. Par exemple, une intervenante a fait valoir qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019existe pas de peine \u201csimplement excessive\u201d \u00bb et que \u00ab [t]oute peine d\u2019emprisonnement qui n\u2019est pas adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation personnelle de la personne d\u00e9linquante ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle est \u201csimplement excessive\u201d \u00bb (m. interv., British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, par. 19 (italique omis); voir aussi R. Cairns Way, \u00ab A Disappointing Silence : Mandatory Minimums and Substantive Equality \u00bb (2015), 18 C.R. (7th) 297).\n[118] Or, dans tous les cas relevant de l\u2019art. 12, notre Cour a retenu la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e comme norme applicable et il n\u2019y a aucune raison de modifier la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un principe viable et \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 qui est fermement ancr\u00e9 dans la dignit\u00e9 humaine et les normes fondamentales de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Il a \u00e9galement l\u2019avantage d\u2019\u00eatre une norme \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e qui reconna\u00eet le pouvoir du Parlement de poursuivre des objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine et d\u2019explorer des options qui ne constituent pas des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. En outre, les \u00e9claircissements apport\u00e9s dans le pr\u00e9sent arr\u00eat sur ce qui constitue une disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e favoriseront, esp\u00e9rons\u2011le, la certitude et une plus grande facilit\u00e9 d\u2019application. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour pouvoir conclure qu\u2019elle viole l\u2019art. 12, une peine d\u2019emprisonnement obligatoire doit \u00eatre exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 ce qui aurait autrement \u00e9t\u00e9 une peine juste (Smith, p. 1072\u20111074).\n(5) La peine minimale obligatoire est\u2011elle exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e?\n[119] La fa\u00e7on dont les tribunaux appliquent depuis longtemps la norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e aux peines minimales obligatoires permet de mieux comprendre les facteurs ou les caract\u00e9ristiques qui guident cette analyse. Notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de peines minimales obligatoires dans 5 affaires : (1) l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 sans possibilit\u00e9 de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle avant 25 ans en cas de meurtre au premier degr\u00e9 dans Luxton; (2) la peine minimale obligatoire de 7 jours d\u2019emprisonnement et de 300 $ d\u2019amende par suite d\u2019une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule durant une interdiction dans Goltz; (3) une peine minimale obligatoire de 4 ans pour n\u00e9gligence criminelle causant la mort par suite de l\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu dans Morrisey; (4) la peine minimale obligatoire pour meurtre au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9, soit l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 sans possibilit\u00e9 de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle avant 10 ans, dans Latimer; (5) la peine minimale obligatoire de 4 ans pour homicide involontaire coupable avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu dans Ferguson.\n[120] Notre Cour a \u00e9galement invalid\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires \u00e0 trois reprises, y compris dans deux de ses arr\u00eats les plus r\u00e9cents. Dans l\u2019affaire Smith, notre Cour a invalid\u00e9 une peine minimale obligatoire de sept ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour importation de drogues, pr\u00e9vue au par. 5(2) de la Loi sur les stup\u00e9fiants, S.R.C. 1970, c. N\u20111. Dans l\u2019affaire Nur, les peines minimales obligatoires de trois et cinq ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte qui est charg\u00e9e ou gard\u00e9e avec des munitions facilement accessibles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es inop\u00e9rantes. Dans l\u2019affaire Lloyd, la Cour a invalid\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an d\u2019emprisonnement pr\u00e9vue par la div. 5(3)a)(i)(D) de la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances , L.C. 1996, c. 19 , pour trafic ou possession d\u2019une substance r\u00e9glement\u00e9e en vue d\u2019en faire le trafic.\n[121] La d\u00e9cision et le raisonnement dans ces d\u00e9cisions fournissent des indications utiles sur les cas o\u00f9 une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. La Cour a, dans certaines affaires, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 divers facteurs susceptibles d\u2019influer sur cette \u00e9valuation; et un certain nombre de propositions et de principes utiles ont fait leur apparition. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Smith, notre Cour a retenu quatre facteurs pour \u00e9valuer la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire : la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles de la personne d\u00e9linquante, les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et l\u2019effet r\u00e9el de la peine sur cette personne. Elle a ajout\u00e9 par la suite d\u2019autres facteurs dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Goltz. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, notre Cour a \u00e9tabli le test \u00e0 deux volets \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a violation de l\u2019art. 12 et, bien que la juge en chef McLachlin n\u2019ait pas explicitement mentionn\u00e9 les facteurs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, elle a tenu compte de la port\u00e9e des comportements vis\u00e9s par la peine minimale obligatoire, de la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite reproch\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 celle vis\u00e9e par la peine minimale obligatoire et de la question de savoir si la peine \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre un objectif p\u00e9nal r\u00e9gulier. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault, qui ne portait pas sur une peine minimale obligatoire, mais qui s\u2019appuyait sur la jurisprudence traitant de cette question, notre Cour a expliqu\u00e9 que ces facteurs ne faisaient pas partie d\u2019un test obligatoire ou \u00ab rigide \u00bb (par. 48; Latimer, par. 75). Certains facteurs peuvent faire ressortir des consid\u00e9rations importantes et demeurer pertinents.\n[122] Il y a toutefois lieu de les regrouper pour simplifier l\u2019analyse et pour se concentrer plus directement sur les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments cruciaux qui doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019on se penche sur la validit\u00e9 ou la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires : (1) la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction; (2) les effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante; (3) la sanction, y compris l\u2019\u00e9quilibre atteint par ses objectifs.\n[123] Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont particuli\u00e8rement pertinents dans le cas des peines minimales obligatoires. En optant pour des peines minimales obligatoires comme outil de d\u00e9termination de la peine, le Parlement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer ce type de peine \u00e0 une gamme de situations et a choisi de supprimer la soupape de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 constitutionnelle que constitue le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des juges de traiter des cas individuels. Le Parlement a d\u00e9fini l\u2019infraction qui rend son auteur passible d\u2019une peine minimale particuli\u00e8re, ainsi que sa nature, sa gravit\u00e9, sa port\u00e9e et son \u00e9tendue. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qui serait assujetti \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire, que ce soit explicitement ou implicitement, en fonction de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019infraction ou de la mani\u00e8re dont la sanction est impos\u00e9e. Et il a prescrit la sanction ou la peine \u00e0 appliquer pour chacune des peines minimales obligatoires qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9vues.\n[124] La port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, les effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante et la sanction sont les trois principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont une incidence sur l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Dans certains cas, un seul de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments permet de conclure que la peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Dans d\u2019autres cas, la conclusion que la peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e ou qu\u2019elle est conforme \u00e0 la Constitution sera le r\u00e9sultat de la combinaison ou de l\u2019interaction de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Par exemple, une infraction de type r\u00e9glementaire qui comporte une large port\u00e9e et n\u2019est punissable que d\u2019une sanction l\u00e9g\u00e8re ne porte sans doute pas atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine autant qu\u2019une v\u00e9ritable infraction criminelle qui sanctionne par un lourd ch\u00e2timent un comportement moins r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible.\na) La port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction\n[125] La port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction demeure un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important dans l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e et il importe d\u2019\u00e9tudier toutes les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019infraction contest\u00e9e. La jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire est plus susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre contest\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle vise des comportements disparates dont la gravit\u00e9 et pour lesquels le degr\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante varient consid\u00e9rablement (Lloyd, par. 24; Smith, p. 1078). D\u2019ailleurs, la disposition qui rend passible d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire l\u2019auteur d\u2019une infraction \u00ab qui peut \u00eatre perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e de nombreuses mani\u00e8res et dans de nombreuses circonstances diff\u00e9rentes, par une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes, se r\u00e9v\u00e8le vuln\u00e9rable sur le plan constitutionnel \u00bb (Lloyd, par. 3; voir aussi par. 24, 27 et 35\u201136). Ainsi, plus la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction est vaste, plus il est probable que la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9voie une longue p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement pour des actes qui pr\u00e9sentent peu de risques pour le public et comportent une faible faute morale (Nur, par. 83). En pareil cas, la peine est susceptible de viser un comportement qui ne m\u00e9rite manifestement pas la peine minimale obligatoire.\n[126] Dans l\u2019affaire Smith, notre Cour a invalid\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire de sept ans pour importation de drogues que pr\u00e9voyait la Loi sur les stup\u00e9fiants en raison du fait que la peine obligatoire s\u2019appliquait peu importe le type ou la quantit\u00e9 de substance import\u00e9s et peu importe que la substance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 import\u00e9e pour en faire le trafic ou pour usage personnel. L\u2019infraction ratissait trop large et ses effets \u00e9taient trop vastes. Elle s\u2019appliquait notamment au cas hypoth\u00e9tique d\u2019une jeune personne rentrant au Canada avec son premier joint de marijuana, alors que ce comportement ne justifiait pas la peine minimale obligatoire.\n[127] Dans l\u2019affaire Nur, la Cour a invalid\u00e9 les peines minimales obligatoires de trois et cinq ans pour la possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou arme \u00e0 autorisation restreinte qui est charg\u00e9e ou gard\u00e9e avec des munitions facilement accessibles parce que l\u2019infraction \u00ab s\u2019appliqu[ait] \u00e0 une vaste gamme de comportements potentiels \u00bb (par. 82), y compris des violations qui pr\u00e9sentaient peu de risque pour le public et qui n\u2019\u00e9taient gu\u00e8re plus graves que des infractions de type r\u00e9glementaire (par. 83). L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction \u00e9tait la possession et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire la preuve d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice (par. 84). L\u2019infraction visait donc, \u00e0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, le [traduction] \u00ab hors\u2011la\u2011loi qui, dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s criminelles, se rend dans un lieu public muni d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte charg\u00e9e \u00bb et, \u00e0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, le \u00ab propri\u00e9taire responsable d\u2019une arme, titulaire d\u2019un permis, qui entrepose son arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire avec des munitions \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, mais qui se m\u00e9prend sur le lieu d\u2019entreposage autoris\u00e9 \u00bb (par. 82). Cette derni\u00e8re conduite ne pr\u00e9sentait gu\u00e8re ou pas de danger pour le public et ne comportait qu\u2019une faible faute morale, voire aucune (par. 83). D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Cour, \u00ab infliger une peine de trois ans d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 une personne qui a essentiellement commis une infraction r\u00e9glementaire d\u00e9roge totalement aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00bb (par. 83). La disposition contest\u00e9e englobait un \u00e9ventail trop large de comportements criminels et pr\u00e9voyaient de longues p\u00e9riodes d\u2019emprisonnement dans des situations o\u00f9 il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019imposer des peines d\u2019emprisonnement aussi longues pour atteindre les objectifs p\u00e9naux par ailleurs r\u00e9guliers du Parlement, soit la protection du public, la dissuasion d\u2019autrui de faire de m\u00eame et la r\u00e9probation morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante (par. 104).\n[128] Dans l\u2019affaire Lloyd, la Cour a recouru \u00e0 des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables pour examiner la port\u00e9e r\u00e9elle de dispositions qui semblaient avoir une port\u00e9e relativement \u00e9troite et qui interdisaient le trafic ou la possession de stup\u00e9fiants en vue d\u2019en faire le trafic en vertu de la div. 5(3)a)(i)(D) de la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances . Les juges majoritaires ont conclu que la loi englobait une vaste gamme de comportements potentiels et qu\u2019elle visait donc non seulement des cas graves de trafic de stup\u00e9fiants, mais aussi des comportements beaucoup moins r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles (par. 27). Ces dispositions r\u00e9servaient aux personnes qui se partageaient de petites quantit\u00e9s de drogues entre amis, conjoints ou personnes ayant un probl\u00e8me de d\u00e9pendance le m\u00eame traitement qu\u2019aux trafiquants de drogue commerciaux et professionnels.\n[129] Le tribunal doit donc d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la mens rea et l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction englobent une gamme de comportements, ainsi que le degr\u00e9 variable de gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Pour d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e d\u2019une infraction, le tribunal peut se demander si l\u2019infraction implique n\u00e9cessairement qu\u2019un tort soit caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne ou simplement qu\u2019il y ait un risque de pr\u00e9judice, s\u2019il existe des fa\u00e7ons de commettre l\u2019infraction qui pr\u00e9sentent relativement peu de danger, et dans quelle mesure la mens rea de l\u2019infraction exige une culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e chez la personne d\u00e9linquante. Pour d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction, on doit aussi se rappeler que l\u2019art. 12 n\u2019est pas une norme \u00e0 ce point s\u00e9v\u00e8re qu\u2019elle exigerait des peines parfaitement adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque nuance morale qui caract\u00e9rise la situation du d\u00e9linquant (Lyons, p. 344\u2011345). Toutefois, pour citer la mise en garde faite par la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lloyd, par. 35 : \u00ab Si le l\u00e9gislateur tient \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir des peines minimales obligatoires pour des infractions qui ratissent large, il lui faudra envisager de r\u00e9duire leur champ d\u2019application de mani\u00e8re qu\u2019elles ne visent que les d\u00e9linquants qui m\u00e9ritent de se les voir infliger. \u00bb\n[130] La nature de l\u2019infraction et la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la peine par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019infraction contest\u00e9e peuvent influencer l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Pour \u00e9valuer la peine minimale obligatoire dont est saisi le tribunal dans un cas donn\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9ventail g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des infractions p\u00e9nales fournira le contexte n\u00e9cessaire. Divers types d\u2019interdictions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et sont assorties de peines minimales, en partant des infractions de type r\u00e9glementaire jusqu\u2019aux v\u00e9ritables crimes. Dans le cas des infractions de type r\u00e9glementaire, les tribunaux s\u2019attendent \u00e0 ce que les peines correspondantes soient moins s\u00e9v\u00e8res. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, les tribunaux peuvent s\u2019attendre \u00e0 des peines plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res dans le cas des infractions qui causent un pr\u00e9judice grave ou dont la mens rea est grave. Par exemple, la disposition de la Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, dont la validit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Goltz exigeait l\u2019imposition de 7 jours d\u2019emprisonnement et d\u2019une amende de 300 $ aux personnes reconnues coupables pour la premi\u00e8re fois de conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule durant une interdiction. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une disposition \u00e0 la fois r\u00e9glementaire et pr\u00e9ventive qui visait \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les personnes faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une interdiction de conduire en raison de leur dossier de conduite dangereuse ne pr\u00e9sentent pas de risque pour autrui. La Cour a confirm\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de la peine minimale obligatoire dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Goltz en partie parce que la disposition s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie restreinte de comportements coupables et que la peine effectivement impos\u00e9e \u00e9tait \u00ab moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re qu\u2019il ne le para\u00eet peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00bb (p. 514). En effet, cette peine pouvait \u00eatre purg\u00e9e au cours de quelques fins de semaine ou, par suite d\u2019une r\u00e9duction de peine m\u00e9rit\u00e9e, en cinq jours plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en sept comme prescrit (p. 514). De plus, le r\u00e9gime administratif r\u00e9gissant l\u2019infraction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un examen approfondi effectu\u00e9 par le groupe de travail sur la conduite automobile du gouvernement de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, et le r\u00e9gime visait express\u00e9ment les conducteurs qui m\u00e9prisaient ouvertement la loi (p. 507 et 511).\n[131] Lorsque la peine minimale contest\u00e9e est pr\u00e9vue par une disposition qui exige que le contrevenant ait commis un acte pr\u00e9cis ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9termin\u00e9, le tribunal \u00e9value la port\u00e9e de la disposition et la gravit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice dans le cadre de son analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Par exemple, l\u2019affaire Luxton concernait un meurtre au premier degr\u00e9 et l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle. L\u2019affaire Ferguson portait sur un homicide involontaire coupable au cours duquel un agent de la GRC avait abattu un d\u00e9tenu. L\u2019affaire Latimer traitait du cas d\u2019un p\u00e8re qui avait tu\u00e9 son enfant atteinte de paralysie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale, et l\u2019affaire Morrisey concernait la mort d\u2019un ami avec qui l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait amus\u00e9 \u00e0 se chamailler avec une arme \u00e0 feu. L\u2019actus reus de ces infractions impliquait la mort d\u2019une personne : un pr\u00e9judice sp\u00e9cifique qui s\u2019\u00e9tait concr\u00e9tis\u00e9 et qui \u00e9tait de la plus grande gravit\u00e9. On peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que ces facteurs aient un poids consid\u00e9rable dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[132] Les tribunaux peuvent \u00e9galement tenir compte des fourchettes de peines et des points de d\u00e9part pour les infractions de cette nature, puisque ces outils sont utiles pour \u00e9valuer la proportionnalit\u00e9 et la parit\u00e9. Ils sont le fruit d\u2019un consensus judiciaire sur la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, et ils favorisent la parit\u00e9 en r\u00e9duisant les grandes disparit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Parranto, par. 20, citant Lacasse, par. 2; voir aussi R. c. Stone, [1999] 2 R.C.S. 290, par. 244; Nasogaluak, par. 44; R. c. Smith, 2019 SKCA 100, 382 C.C.C. (3d) 455, par. 126). Sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12, ces outils peuvent aider les tribunaux \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure une peine minimale obligatoire est conforme en derni\u00e8re analyse aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine, dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9calage marqu\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 une peine autrement juste. Les peines minimales obligatoires pr\u00e9vues pour des infractions similaires peuvent \u00e9galement faciliter cette analyse.\nb) Les effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante\n[133] La s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des effets de la peine minimale obligatoire sur les gens qui en sont passibles doit \u00eatre prise en compte pour \u00e9valuer le degr\u00e9 de disproportion de la peine. Pour mesurer l\u2019impact global de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante concern\u00e9e ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, les tribunaux doivent s\u2019efforcer de d\u00e9finir le pr\u00e9judice pr\u00e9cis caus\u00e9 par le ch\u00e2timent. Ils doivent pour ce faire analyser les cons\u00e9quences que la peine contest\u00e9e peut avoir sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, tant de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques et qualit\u00e9s qui leur sont propres. Cet aspect est essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019objectif sous-jacent de l\u2019art. 12. Si la peine obligatoire a pour effet d\u2019infliger des douleurs et des souffrances psychologiques \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante au point de porter atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9, la sanction ne peut \u00eatre tenue pour valide (9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., par. 51).\n[134] Le tribunal devrait certainement tenir compte de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement suppl\u00e9mentaire impos\u00e9e par la peine minimale obligatoire. Compte tenu des r\u00e9percussions profondes de l\u2019emprisonnement, l\u2019importance et la dur\u00e9e de la peine rev\u00eatent une grande importance sur le plan personnel et social. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019on compare sur le plan quantitatif la peine d\u2019emprisonnement proportionnelle \u00e0 celle pr\u00e9vue par la disposition qui cr\u00e9e la peine minimale obligatoire, il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que cette \u00e9valuation ne se r\u00e9sume pas \u00e0 un calcul math\u00e9matique abstrait, mais implique du pr\u00e9cieux temps qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante peut passer de fa\u00e7on injustifi\u00e9e (et possiblement inconstitutionnelle) en prison.\n[135] Les tribunaux doivent tenir compte de l\u2019effet de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause. Le principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 implique que lorsque l\u2019emprisonnement a un effet plus grand sur une personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier, il peut y avoir lieu de lui accorder une r\u00e9duction de peine (Suter, par. 48; B. L. Berger, \u00ab Proportionality and the Experience of Punishment \u00bb, dans D. Cole et J. Roberts, dir., Sentencing in Canada : Essays in Law, Policy, and Practice (2020), 368, p. 368). Pour cette raison, les tribunaux ont r\u00e9duit des peines afin de tenir compte de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la prison relativement plus dure pour certains d\u00e9linquants, comme les d\u00e9linquants faisant partie des forces de l\u2019ordre, ceux qui souffrent d\u2019un handicap (R. c. Salehi, 2022 BCCA 1, par. 66\u201171 (CanLII); R. c. Nuttall, 2001 ABCA 277, 293 A.R. 364, par. 8\u20119; R. c. A.R. (1994), 92 Man. R. (2d) 183 (C.A.); R. c. Adamo, 2013 MBQB 225, 296 Man. R. (2d) 245, par. 65; R. c. Wallace (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (C.A. Ont.), p. 100), ou pour ceux dont l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la prison est plus dure en raison du racisme syst\u00e9mique (R. c. A.F. (1997), 101 O.A.C. 146, par. 17; R. c. Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114, 93 O.R. (3d) 643, par. 37; R. c. Marfo, 2020 ONSC 5663, par. 52 (CanLII)). Pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire soit correctement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019incidence de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces consid\u00e9rations individualis\u00e9es (L. Kerr et B. L. Berger, \u00ab Methods and Severity : The Two Tracks of Section 12 \u00bb (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 235, p. 238 et 244\u2011245).\n[136] Les effets de la peine ne se mesurent pas uniquement en chiffres. Ils sont \u00ab souvent le produit de plusieurs facteurs \u00bb, y compris la \u00ab nature [de la peine] et les circonstances dans lesquelles elle est impos\u00e9e \u00bb (Smith, p. 1073). Ainsi, comme le fait remarquer le juge Lamer, \u00ab une peine de vingt ann\u00e9es pour une premi\u00e8re infraction contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, mais il en serait de m\u00eame d\u2019une peine de trois mois d\u2019emprisonnement dans le cas o\u00f9 les autorit\u00e9s p\u00e9nitentiaires d\u00e9cideraient qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre purg\u00e9e dans une cellule d\u2019isolement \u00bb (p. 1073). Lorsque le dossier de preuve qui leur est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 est suffisant, les tribunaux devraient tenir compte de l\u2019incidence que peuvent avoir sur la personne d\u00e9linquante qui est devant eux les conditions de d\u00e9tention \u2014 par exemple, la diff\u00e9rence entre les mesures de soutien dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les d\u00e9tenus qui purgent une peine avec sursis non privative de libert\u00e9 et celles offertes aux d\u00e9tenus qui purgent une peine d\u2019emprisonnement dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance se rallient de plus en plus \u00e0 ce point de vue (voir Adamo, par. 55 et 65; L. Kerr, \u00ab Sentencing Ashley Smith : How Prison Conditions Relate to the Aims of Punishment \u00bb (2017), 32 R.C.D.S. 187, p. 201).\n[137] De plus, notre Cour a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises des doutes qui entourent depuis longtemps l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires ou de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en tant qu\u2019outils de dissuasion (Nur, par. 113\u2011114; Bissonnette, par. 47; R. c. Proulx, 2000 CSC 5, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 61, par. 107; voir aussi Commission canadienne sur la d\u00e9termination de la peine, R\u00e9former la sentence : une approche canadienne (1987), p. 149\u2011151). Bien que la certitude d\u2019une sanction p\u00e9nale puisse avoir certains effets dissuasifs, la preuve empirique indique qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019est pas plus dissuasive qu\u2019une peine proportionn\u00e9e moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re (Nur, par. 114).\nc) La sanction et ses objectifs\n[138] Pour ce qui est des sanctions constituant des peines minimales obligatoires, le Parlement en fixe la dur\u00e9e en fonction de ses objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine. \u00c0 leur tour, lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9valuent la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, les tribunaux examinent la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la sanction impos\u00e9e par le Parlement afin de d\u00e9terminer si la peine minimale va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine pertinents au regard de l\u2019infraction particuli\u00e8re en tenant compte \u00ab des objectifs p\u00e9naux l\u00e9gitimes et du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des solutions de rechange possibles \u00bb, et si oui, dans quelle mesure (Smith, p. 1099\u20111100).\n[139] La d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion, tant g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que sp\u00e9cifique, sont des objectifs valables en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Bissonnette, par. 46\u201147 et 49\u201150). Les peines exemplaires repr\u00e9sentent une \u00ab d\u00e9claration collective [. . .] que la conduite du contrevenant doit \u00eatre punie parce qu\u2019elle a port\u00e9 atteinte au code des valeurs fondamentales de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (M. (C.A.), par. 81), et le besoin de d\u00e9nonciation est intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (Ipeelee, par. 37). Lorsque les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019infraction contreviennent manifestement au \u00ab code des valeurs fondamentales \u00bb des Canadiens et des Canadiennes, et appellent une forte condamnation, notre Cour fait preuve d\u2019une plus grande d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9dicte une peine minimale obligatoire (Morrisey, par. 47). De m\u00eame, la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut justifier l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re qui se situe \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la fourchette des peines qui ne sont pas \u00ab cruelles et inusit\u00e9es \u00bb (Morrisey, par. 45; Nur, par. 45). La dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne peut toutefois justifier \u00e0 elle seule une peine minimale obligatoire : on ne peut infliger \u00e0 une personne une peine totalement disproportionn\u00e9e afin de dissuader ses concitoyens de d\u00e9sob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la loi (Nur, par. 45; Bissonnette, par. 51). Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit le juge Lamer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de condamner les \u00ab petits \u00bb contrevenants pour dissuader \u00ab l\u2019auteur d\u2019une infraction grave \u00bb (p. 1080).\n[140] La d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du Parlement d\u2019imposer des peines exemplaires ne peut \u00eatre sans limites, car cet objectif pourrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour justifier des peines d\u2019une dur\u00e9e illimit\u00e9e (Bissonnette, par. 46, citant Ruby, \u00a71.22). En \u00e9dictant des peines minimales obligatoires, le Parlement peut privil\u00e9gier certains objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres, \u00e0 condition de respecter certaines limites (Lloyd, par. 45; Morrisey, par. 45\u201146). Aucun objectif de d\u00e9termination de la peine ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres (Nasogaluak, par. 43). Chaque objectif de d\u00e9termination de la peine demeure pertinent pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une peine qui respecte la dignit\u00e9 humaine. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 12, le r\u00f4le accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale dans la peine minimale obligatoire examin\u00e9e aidera \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la disposition constitue une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e.\n[141] Bien que la r\u00e9insertion sociale n\u2019ait pas de statut constitutionnel distinct, la Cour a, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bissonnette, expliqu\u00e9 le lien solide qui existe entre l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9insertion sociale et la dignit\u00e9 humaine (par. 83; Safarzadeh\u2011Markhali, par. 71). Les commentaires formul\u00e9s au sujet des infractions qui peuvent \u00eatre cruelles et inusit\u00e9es de par leur nature valent aussi pour les peines minimales obligatoires selon le premier volet de l\u2019art. 12. La r\u00e9insertion sociale \u00ab exprime la conviction que chaque individu porte en lui la capacit\u00e9 de se r\u00e9habiliter et de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 83; voir Lacasse, par. 4). La Cour a conclu qu\u2019une peine qui fait totalement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion sociale ne respecterait pas la dignit\u00e9 humaine et serait incompatible avec cette derni\u00e8re, et qu\u2019elle constituerait de ce fait une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12 (Bissonnette, par. 85). L\u2019affirmation que fait le juge Gonthier au par. 45 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Morrisey, suivant laquelle il n\u2019y a pas violation de l\u2019art. 12 en raison de la \u00ab pr\u00e9sence ou [de] l\u2019absence de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00bb doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la conclusion de notre Cour que \u00ab [p]our respecter la dignit\u00e9 humaine, le Parlement doit laisser la porte entrouverte \u00e0 la r\u00e9habilitation, m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 cet objectif rev\u00eat une importance minime \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 85).\n[142] Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici de faire primer la r\u00e9insertion sociale sur les autres objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine, mais bien de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il lui reste une certaine place \u00ab dans un syst\u00e8me p\u00e9nal fond\u00e9 sur le respect de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 chaque individu \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 88). Il s\u2019ensuit donc que, pour \u00eatre compatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine et, partant, pour respecter l\u2019art. 12, la peine ou la d\u00e9termination de la peine doit tenir compte de la r\u00e9insertion sociale. Comme l\u2019a fait observer une intervenante : [traduction] \u00ab La personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue coupable d\u2019un crime n\u2019est pas simplement une cible sur laquelle la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peut exprimer sa r\u00e9probation; elle demeure un \u00eatre humain qui poss\u00e8de des droits et qui est dot\u00e9 de la dignit\u00e9 humaine et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de garanties juridiques \u00bb (voir m. interv., Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles, par. 25). Toute peine minimale obligatoire qui a pour effet d\u2019exclure la r\u00e9insertion sociale ou d\u2019en faire totalement abstraction est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle est incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine.\n[143] Les tribunaux devraient v\u00e9rifier si la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019emprisonnement pr\u00e9vue par la loi est trop excessive \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019autres solutions potentiellement ad\u00e9quates. Ce serait par exemple le cas si le Parlement impose une longue peine d\u2019emprisonnement alors qu\u2019une absolution conditionnelle r\u00e9pondrait par ailleurs \u00e0 ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine ou si le Parlement impose l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration alors qu\u2019une amende constituerait une sanction ad\u00e9quate. Il n\u2019existe pas de formule math\u00e9matique permettant de d\u00e9terminer le nombre pr\u00e9cis d\u2019ann\u00e9es qui fait qu\u2019une peine est excessive par rapport \u00e0 un objectif p\u00e9nal l\u00e9gitime. Dans tous les cas, l\u2019analyse doit \u00eatre contextuelle et il n\u2019existe pas de chiffre pr\u00e9cis au\u2011del\u00e0 ou en de\u00e7\u00e0 duquel une peine devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\n[144] Une peine minimale obligatoire sera toutefois suspecte sur le plan constitutionnel et n\u00e9cessitera un examen minutieux lorsqu\u2019elle ne conf\u00e8re pas au juge le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019infliger d\u2019autres peines que l\u2019emprisonnement dans des situations o\u00f9 la personne d\u00e9linquante ne devrait pas \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emprisonnement, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de la culpabilit\u00e9 de son auteur. Cela dit, une peine minimale peut \u00eatre exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e comprendrait une longue peine d\u2019emprisonnement. La peine minimale obligatoire qui alourdit la peine d\u2019emprisonnement de la personne d\u00e9linquante peut avoir un effet important, compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences profondes de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sur la vie et la libert\u00e9 de cette personne. La peine minimale obligatoire qui a un tel effet ne peut \u00eatre cat\u00e9goriquement exclue de l\u2019examen minutieux ayant cours dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12, comme le sugg\u00e8rent les juges O\u2019Ferrall et Wakeling. M\u00eame si, en pareil cas, les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre constitutionnel ne concernent pas les diff\u00e9rents types de peines, l\u2019examen des peines minimales obligatoires n\u00e9cessite toujours de consid\u00e9rer de mani\u00e8re nuanc\u00e9e la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\n[145] Les tribunaux devraient \u00e9valuer la peine \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9. En tant que manifestation de la proportionnalit\u00e9, la parit\u00e9 aide les tribunaux \u00e0 fixer une peine proportionn\u00e9e (R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 32\u201133). Lorsqu\u2019elle pr\u00e9voit une peine d\u2019emprisonnement relativement plus courte, la peine minimale obligatoire sera tout de m\u00eame exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e si elle repr\u00e9sente un \u00e9cart intol\u00e9rable par rapport \u00e0 la peine proportionn\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit de situations dans lesquelles m\u00eame la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re diff\u00e9rence entre la peine proportionn\u00e9e et la peine minimale obligatoire porterait atteinte aux normes de d\u00e9cence et choquerait la conscience des Canadiens et des Canadiennes.\n[146] Le chiffre que le Parlement fixe comme minimum obligatoire a \u00e9galement de l\u2019importance. Pour certaines peines, seule la dur\u00e9e permet de conclure qu\u2019elles sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Smith, le juge Lamer a fait observer qu\u2019une \u00ab peine de vingt ann\u00e9es pour une premi\u00e8re infraction contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb. Lorsque la peine est nettement plus lourde que ce que serait autrement la fourchette de peines sans la peine minimale obligatoire, la disposition risque d\u2019imposer une peine s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour une gamme de comportements qui ne m\u00e9ritent peut\u2011\u00eatre pas une telle peine. De plus, si la peine minimale obligatoire se situe \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de la fourchette de peines pour cette infraction, il y a un risque accru qu\u2019une peine disproportionn\u00e9e soit impos\u00e9e \u00e0 ceux qui commettent les formes les moins graves de cette infraction.\n(6) Conclusion\n[147] La jurisprudence offre des indications utiles sur les facteurs qui ont \u00e9clair\u00e9 les tribunaux dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les tribunaux n\u2019ont toutefois pas \u00e0 s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 un test rigide ou \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie immuable de facteurs afin de d\u00e9terminer si un ch\u00e2timent sanctionn\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. Les juges doivent plut\u00f4t se concentrer sur trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9valuent la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de peines minimales obligatoires : la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, les effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante et la sanction. Le premier volet de l\u2019analyse est souvent ax\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction et sur la question de savoir si elle englobe un vaste ensemble de comportements disparates. L\u2019examen des effets de la sanction sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause ou sur une personne contrevenante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les tribunaux devraient examiner les effets concrets que la peine peut avoir sur la personne d\u00e9linquante, tant en ce qui concerne la dur\u00e9e de son incarc\u00e9ration que les conditions physiques dans lesquelles elle purgera sa peine. L\u2019interaction entre chacun de ces trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments devrait orienter l\u2019analyse que font les tribunaux de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[148] L\u2019analyse de la peine vise souvent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 en cause est excessive par rapport aux objectifs l\u00e9gitimes du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Pour ce faire, les tribunaux doivent dans bien des cas examiner les principes premiers de d\u00e9termination de la peine qui sous\u2011tendent la peine obligatoire pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019aucun objectif individuel de d\u00e9termination de la peine n\u2019est appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres. Les juges doivent demeurer conscients des solutions de rechange potentiellement ad\u00e9quates \u00e0 la peine contest\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, je passe maintenant \u00e0 la contestation, par M. Hills, de la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b). Il est \u00e9galement important de pr\u00e9ciser le contexte dans lequel intervient l\u2019infraction en cause.\nE. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 244.2(3)b) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9\n[149] Monsieur Hills a tir\u00e9 plusieurs coups de feu avec une carabine de chasse en direction d\u2019une maison r\u00e9sidentielle, sachant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e ou sans se soucier qu\u2019elle le soit ou non. Monsieur Hills admet que la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans son cas.\n[150] Il dit plut\u00f4t que cette peine minimale serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique o\u00f9 une jeune personne d\u00e9charge intentionnellement, en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence, un pistolet ou une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 qui est incapable de percer les murs de la r\u00e9sidence (voir la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, par. 14). Comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011dessous, le sc\u00e9nario \u00e9voqu\u00e9 par M. Hills est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. De plus, je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine pour dire qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans ce sc\u00e9nario. \u00c0 mon avis, la juge Antonio a commis une erreur en surestimant la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause dans ce sc\u00e9nario r\u00e9aliste.\n(1) Monsieur Hills \u00e9voque un sc\u00e9nario raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible\n[151] La Couronne a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre \u2014 et le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a accept\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit \u2014 que M. Hills a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 un sc\u00e9nario raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Tout d\u2019abord, le sc\u00e9nario propos\u00e9 par M. Hills rel\u00e8ve de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction et ne force ni ne d\u00e9nature ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs. L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction exige que la personne d\u00e9linquante d\u00e9charge une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb en direction d\u2019un \u00ab lieu \u00bb, ce qui signifie \u00ab tout b\u00e2timent ou construction \u00bb. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019une r\u00e9sidence constitue un lieu. La seule question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si une carabine ou un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 constitue une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 2 du Code criminel , m\u00eame si ces armes ne peuvent pas percer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel. L\u2019expert appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par M. Hills a dissip\u00e9 tout doute \u00e0 ce sujet et a corrig\u00e9 la \u00ab lacune au chapitre de la preuve \u00bb qui avait auparavant amen\u00e9 certains tribunaux \u00e0 refuser d\u2019examiner un sc\u00e9nario semblable (voir R. c. Oud, 2016 BCCA 332, 339 C.C.C. (3d) 379, par. 46).\n[152] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019expert a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que huit fusils ou pistolets \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 tiraient un projectile avec une vitesse suffisante pour satisfaire au \u00ab test de l\u2019\u0153il de cochon \u00bb, mais que la plupart d\u2019entre eux \u00e9taient incapables de perforer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel. Ces huit dispositifs \u00e9taient les suivants : (1) un pistolet de type \u00ab airsoft \u00bb, (2) un fusil \u00e0 balles BB de mod\u00e8le Daisy Red Ryder, (3) un marqueur de paintball, (4) une carabine \u00e0 plomb pour mineurs, (5) une carabine \u00e0 plomb de calibre .177 pour adultes, (6) un pistolet \u00e0 plomb de calibre .22, (7) une carabine \u00e0 plomb de calibre .22 et (8) une carabine semi\u2011automatique Rugger de calibre 10\/22. L\u2019expert a conclu qu\u2019il existait [traduction] \u00ab un grand nombre de pistolets et de carabines \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 couramment disponibles au Canada qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019arme \u00e0 feu du Code criminel , mais qui ne sont pas capables de perforer un assemblage de mur \u00e0 ossature r\u00e9sidentielle typique \u00bb (d.a., p. 393; voir aussi la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, par. 16).\n[153] La Couronne a accept\u00e9 la conclusion de l\u2019expert selon laquelle certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 sont des armes \u00e0 feu au sens de l\u2019art. 2 du Code criminel , mais sont incapables de perforer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel typique. Je n\u2019ai pas de r\u00e9serve non plus au sujet de la conclusion de l\u2019expert.\n[154] Il est aussi raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible d\u2019imaginer une jeune personne d\u00e9charger un fusil \u00e0 balles BB ou un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison. Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, [traduction] \u00ab on peut facilement concevoir des situations dans lesquelles une jeune personne pourrait faire exactement ce qui est envisag\u00e9 dans cette situation hypoth\u00e9tique \u00bb (par. 17). La personne d\u00e9linquante pourrait le faire dans le cadre d\u2019un jeu, pour passer le temps ou pour faire un mauvais coup. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible : (1) qu\u2019une jeune personne d\u00e9charge intentionnellement une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence; (2) sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve une personne ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019en trouve ou non; (3) que l\u2019\u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb d\u00e9charg\u00e9e soit un pistolet ou une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 class\u00e9 comme une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 2 du Code criminel , tout en \u00e9tant incapable de percer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel typique.\n(2) Une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans un sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9visible n\u2019impliquerait pas l\u2019emprisonnement\n[155] Je passe \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur et \u00e0 la question de la peine juste pour la personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qui se trouve en pareille situation. La norme de contr\u00f4le empreinte de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui s\u2019applique habituellement en appel aux d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de peines s\u2019applique \u00e0 la peine inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause (Lacasse, par. 11\u201112). Toutefois, pour les peines inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9linquants hypoth\u00e9tiques, les m\u00eames raisons invoqu\u00e9es pour justifier la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence ont moins de poids, car la peine juste est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en supposant des faits, et non en soupesant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9els (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, par. 18 et 74).\n[156] II n\u2019est toutefois pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019indiquer dans quels cas une cour de r\u00e9vision peut tirer sa propre conclusion sur la peine qui serait juste dans le cas d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, puisque je suis d\u2019accord avec le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine pour dire que la peine juste pour cette jeune personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique comporterait une p\u00e9riode de probation et qu\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab certain qu\u2019une telle personne d\u00e9linquante ne serait pas condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 une peine de quatre ans de p\u00e9nitencier ou m\u00eame \u00e0 une peine qui s\u2019en approcherait \u00bb (par. 19). D\u2019ailleurs, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte et de la culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la personne d\u00e9linquante en pareil cas, ce sc\u00e9nario s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une infraction mineure de m\u00e9fait pour lequel le sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine ou une probation pourrait convenir. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante sont faibles dans ce sc\u00e9nario, si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re surtout les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019infraction et la mens rea de cette personne. En ce qui concerne la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, les cons\u00e9quences de celle\u2011ci pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique sont relativement faibles dans ce sc\u00e9nario. L\u2019actus reus de cette infraction n\u2019exige pas la pr\u00e9sence de qui que ce soit au \u00ab lieu \u00bb o\u00f9 l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e. M\u00eame si une autre personne \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente, la preuve d\u2019expert \u00e9tablit le danger minimal que posent les actes de la personne d\u00e9linquante, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la puissance de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duite. \u00c0 mon avis, la juge Antonio a commis une erreur en exag\u00e9rant les risques encourus par le public dans ce sc\u00e9nario.\n[157] Je n\u2019accepte pas l\u2019id\u00e9e que le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 le risque qu\u2019un projectile traverse une fen\u00eatre ouverte ou frappe un passant. Une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ne requiert pas que quiconque se trouve l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le projectile est tir\u00e9, et le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tait clairement conscient de ces risques lorsqu\u2019il a fait observer que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019essence de l\u2019infraction est le danger d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice potentiel, qui peut \u00eatre caus\u00e9 par des coups de feu tir\u00e9s au hasard en direction d\u2019un lieu. Le danger ne devrait pas d\u00e9pendre de la question de savoir si l\u2019individu tire des coups de feu dans un b\u00e2timent, \u00e0 travers une fen\u00eatre ou en direction d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur. Le danger est toujours pr\u00e9sent \u00bb (par. 41 (italique omis)). Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence conscient des risques m\u00eames que la juge Antonio semble lui reprocher d\u2019avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9s.\n[158] \u00c0 mon avis, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que les armes \u00e0 feu en cause pr\u00e9sentaient un risque beaucoup moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que des armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles, m\u00eame en tenant compte des risques \u00e9voqu\u00e9s par la juge Antonio. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019expert avait [traduction] \u00ab corrig\u00e9 \u00bb la \u00ab lacune au chapitre de la preuve \u00bb dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oud (par. 26). La \u00ab lacune \u00bb dans Oud concernait notamment l\u2019absence de preuve permettant de d\u00e9terminer si le fait de tirer un projectile d\u2019une carabine ou un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab beaucoup moins grave que le fait de d\u00e9charger un fusil ordinaire \u00bb (Oud, par. 47).\n[159] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve d\u2019expert a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 pouvaient \u00eatre beaucoup moins dangereux, et que certains d\u2019entre eux \u00e9taient incapables de causer d\u2019autres dommages que la fissuration du rev\u00eatement de vinyle d\u2019une maison. De plus, certains des dispositifs que l\u2019expert a test\u00e9s \u00e9taient litt\u00e9ralement con\u00e7us pour tirer des projectiles sur d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 des fins sportives. Lorsqu\u2019on combine ces consid\u00e9rations avec le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il se trouve quelqu\u2019un dans les parages lorsque le projectile est tir\u00e9, je ne vois aucun probl\u00e8me avec la conclusion du juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine selon laquelle le risque pour la vie et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est faible dans la situation hypoth\u00e9tique \u00e9voqu\u00e9e par M. Hills (par. 16). Je ne vois pas de pr\u00e9judice important, r\u00e9el ou potentiel, d\u00e9coulant du fait pour une personne d\u00e9linquante de d\u00e9charger un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison lorsque personne n\u2019est dans les parages, et ce, m\u00eame si ce comportement tombe sous le coup de l\u2019article contest\u00e9.\n[160] En ce qui concerne la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante, la Couronne affirme que la double mens rea permet d\u2019adapter la pr\u00e9sente infraction de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle englobe un comportement particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019exigence de la double mens rea ne contribue gu\u00e8re \u00e0 restreindre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction. Pour la reconna\u00eetre coupable, il suffit de conclure que la personne d\u00e9linquante avait connaissance de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autrui ou ne s\u2019en est pas souci\u00e9. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 autrui pour d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Alors que l\u2019insouciance requiert \u00ab la connaissance d\u2019un danger ou d\u2019un risque et la persistance dans une conduite qui engendre le risque que le r\u00e9sultat prohib\u00e9 se produise \u00bb (Sansregret c. La Reine, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 570, p. 584), il suffit que la personne d\u00e9linquante se soit montr\u00e9e insouciante quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autrui \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu \u2014 y compris un fusil de paintball, une arme de type \u00ab airsoft \u00bb ou un fusil \u00e0 balles BB \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9charg\u00e9e. L\u2019insouciance envisag\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) n\u2019oblige pas la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 songer explicitement au fait qu\u2019elle met d\u2019autres personnes en danger. Je conviens avec le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine qu\u2019un tel sc\u00e9nario r\u00e9v\u00e8le un comportement immature et une faible culpabilit\u00e9 morale (par. 17 et 19).\n[161] La jeunesse constitue une circonstance att\u00e9nuante lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Le sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique est un exemple d\u2019un comportement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme criminel qui r\u00e9v\u00e8le peut\u2011\u00eatre davantage un manque d\u2019encadrement ou de surveillance qu\u2019une intention criminelle de la part de la personne d\u00e9linquante. Dans le cas des jeunes d\u00e9linquants, les principes de la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de la d\u00e9nonciation devraient passer apr\u00e8s celui de la r\u00e9insertion sociale (R. c. Nassri, 2015 ONCA 316, 125 O.R. (3d) 578, par. 31). Dans ce sc\u00e9nario, la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne devrait jouer qu\u2019un r\u00f4le limit\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une peine juste (Ruby, \u00a71.36; R. c. Mohenu, 2019 ONCA 291, par. 12\u201113 (CanLII)). La dissuasion sp\u00e9cifique et la r\u00e9insertion sociale devraient plut\u00f4t \u00eatre les objectifs premiers lorsque vient le temps de d\u00e9terminer les peines \u00e0 infliger \u00e0 de jeunes d\u00e9linquants qui en sont \u00e0 leur premi\u00e8re infraction (Priest, p. 543\u2011544; R. c. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574, 268 O.A.C. 385, par. 32; R. c. T. (K.), 2008 ONCA 91, 89 O.R. (3d) 99, par. 41\u201142).\n[162] Ainsi, puisque la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante sont peu \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans ce sc\u00e9nario et que le jeune \u00e2ge de cette personne constitue une circonstance att\u00e9nuante, la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e est le sursis au prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une peine d\u2019au plus 12 mois de probation.\n(3) La peine minimale est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e\n[163] Je passe maintenant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur et je me demande si la peine minimale obligatoire en cause oblige le tribunal \u00e0 infliger une peine qui est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste. En me fondant sur cette situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable, je conclus que la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Cela \u00ab choquerait la conscience \u00bb des Canadiens et des Canadiennes d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour un acte qui pr\u00e9sente plus ou moins le m\u00eame risque pour le public que le fait de lancer une pierre \u00e0 travers la fen\u00eatre d\u2019une maison r\u00e9sidentielle.\n[164] Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est l\u2019infraction. Comme dans les affaires Nur et Lloyd, la peine minimale obligatoire qui nous int\u00e9resse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019applique \u00e0 une vaste gamme de comportements. \u00c0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du spectre, il y a le comportement de M. Hills, qui pr\u00e9sente un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 de pr\u00e9judice et d\u00e9montre une grande culpabilit\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, il y a le sc\u00e9nario pr\u00e9visible \u00e9voqu\u00e9 par M. Hills, qui ne pr\u00e9sente gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public et comporte une faible faute. La large port\u00e9e de la peine minimale est principalement attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb englobe des dispositifs capables d\u2019infliger des blessures mortelles ainsi que des dispositifs con\u00e7us pour tirer des projectiles sur d\u2019autres personnes dans la pratique d\u2019un sport r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif. La d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab lieu \u00bb englobe tout, d\u2019une remise de jardin \u00e0 une voiture, occup\u00e9e ou non. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il y ait quelqu\u2019un dans le secteur o\u00f9 les coups de feu sont tir\u00e9s. Bien que je convienne que le fait de d\u00e9charger une carabine de chasse en direction d\u2019une maison est un acte tr\u00e8s grave et tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible (comme dans le cas de M. Hills), on ne peut pas en dire autant du sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) risque davantage d\u2019\u00eatre inconstitutionnel parce qu\u2019il englobe un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019actes disparates qui comprennent des infractions dont la gravit\u00e9 et le degr\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante varient. L\u2019infraction a une vaste port\u00e9e.\n[165] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment concerne les effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause ou sur une personne d\u00e9linquante raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans aurait des effets pr\u00e9judiciables importants sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants, qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par notre droit p\u00e9nal comme ayant de grandes chances de r\u00e9insertion sociale. Il s\u2019ensuit que les peines auxquelles sont condamn\u00e9s les jeunes d\u00e9linquants sont souvent ax\u00e9es sur la r\u00e9insertion sociale. Pour donner la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale, les tribunaux devraient faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les jeunes d\u00e9linquants de la peine la plus courte possible, proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (voir R. c. Brown, 2015 ONCA 361, 126 O.R. (3d) 797, par. 7; R. c. Laine, 2015 ONCA 519, 338 O.A.C. 264, par. 85). Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que le milieu carc\u00e9ral n\u2019est souvent pas un cadre qui permet de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de r\u00e9forme des jeunes (Ruby, \u00a75.191). Les jeunes d\u00e9linquants incarc\u00e9r\u00e9s dans des p\u00e9nitenciers f\u00e9d\u00e9raux sont souvent victimes d\u2019intimidation, recrut\u00e9s par des gangs d\u2019adultes pour leur protection, et ils risquent d\u2019\u00eatre plac\u00e9s en isolement (Bureau de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur correctionnel et Bureau de l\u2019intervenant provincial en faveur des enfants et des jeunes, Occasions manqu\u00e9es : L\u2019exp\u00e9rience des jeunes adultes incarc\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les p\u00e9nitenciers f\u00e9d\u00e9raux (2017)). Pour la jeune personne d\u00e9linquante en cause, la diff\u00e9rence entre une peine de r\u00e9forme purg\u00e9e dans la collectivit\u00e9 et une p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de quatre ans serait profond\u00e9ment pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[166] L\u2019effet de la peine minimale obligatoire est extr\u00eamement dur en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 l\u2019instar des peines minimales en cause dans les affaires Nur et Lloyd, elle a pour effet de remplacer une mesure probatoire par quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Non seulement la peine minimale prescrit\u2011elle la sanction p\u00e9nale \u00ab de dernier recours \u00bb, mais elle impose quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Cela milite fortement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la peine minimale au regard de l\u2019art. 12.\n[167] Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment est la sanction. Une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement est excessive au point d\u2019\u00eatre en d\u00e9calage marqu\u00e9 par rapport aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine et va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Parlement atteigne ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour cette infraction. Une peine minimale d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans pour une jeune personne d\u00e9linquante qui d\u00e9charge un fusil \u00e0 balles BB en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence est draconienne. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une peine qui va bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour prot\u00e9ger le public, condamner le comportement de la personne d\u00e9linquante ou dissuader d\u2019autres personnes de se livrer \u00e0 des actes semblables. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9nonciation est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (Ipeelee, par. 37). Ici, la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction est faible et on ne peut raisonnablement sugg\u00e9rer que la conduite adopt\u00e9e par la personne d\u00e9linquante dans ce sc\u00e9nario contrevient grandement \u00e0 des valeurs morales fondamentales. La dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne peut pas non plus justifier la peine minimale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car \u00ab on ne peut infliger \u00e0 une personne une peine totalement disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la seule fin de dissuader ses concitoyens de d\u00e9sob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la loi \u00bb (Nur, par. 45). Bien que notre Cour ait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9nonciation et de la dissuasion dans le cas des infractions relatives aux armes \u00e0 feu (Morrisey, par. 46), cela ne permet pas pour autant de mettre l\u2019accent sur ces objectifs dans toutes les affaires impliquant des armes \u00e0 feu, notamment en raison de la d\u00e9finition large d\u2019arme \u00e0 feu et lorsque l\u2019infraction ne pose gu\u00e8re ou pas de danger (comme l\u2019affaire Nur elle\u2011m\u00eame l\u2019illustre, par. 82\u201184). La peine minimale ne t\u00e9moigne pas non plus d\u2019un respect pour les principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9. Une peine de quatre ans pour ce qui est tout au plus une forme mineure de m\u00e9fait est totalement en d\u00e9calage par rapport aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Contrairement aux peines minimales obligatoires dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Hilbach (voir par. 72\u201173 et 95), rien ne justifie d\u2019insister dans une large mesure sur la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion dans ce sc\u00e9nario.\n[168] Une comparaison entre les peines impos\u00e9es pour d\u2019autres crimes de m\u00eame gravit\u00e9 et la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce r\u00e9v\u00e8le une grande disproportion. Prenons, par exemple, les affaires R. c. Pretty, 2005 BCCA 52, 208 B.C.A.C. 79, R. c. Schnare, [1988] N.S.J. No. 118 (QL), 1988 CarswellNS 568 (WL) (C.A.), et R. c. Cheung, Gee and Gee (1977), 5 A.R. 356 (C.S. (Div. 1re inst.)), dans lesquelles le fait d\u2019avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil \u00e0 plomb en direction d\u2019un immeuble avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des accusations de m\u00e9fait et o\u00f9 le d\u00e9linquant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine bien inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) (en l\u2019occurrence le sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine dans Pretty; une peine de deux mois d\u2019emprisonnement assortie de deux ans de probation et d\u2019une restitution dans Schnare; et le sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine ainsi qu\u2019une restitution dans Cheung). Dans l\u2019affaire Pretty, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un jeune d\u00e9linquant qui \u00e9prouvait de l\u2019animosit\u00e9 envers son voisin et qui avait d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil \u00e0 balles BB en direction de la maison de ce dernier. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine et plac\u00e9 le d\u00e9linquant en probation pendant 12 mois. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la peine. Dans l\u2019affaire Schnare, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un jeune homme qui s\u2019\u00e9tait mis \u00e0 tirer avec un fusil \u00e0 plomb et avait endommag\u00e9 plusieurs maisons et des v\u00e9hicules en mouvement. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de deux mois assortie d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de probation de deux ans et d\u2019une condamnation \u00e0 payer des milliers de dollars en guise de restitution. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse a confirm\u00e9 sa peine. Enfin, dans l\u2019affaire Cheung, les trois jeunes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9s d\u2019avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil \u00e0 plomb en direction d\u2019un commerce et de v\u00e9hicules situ\u00e9s \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Ils s\u2019\u00e9taient tous vu imposer un sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine de 12 mois et une ordonnance de restitution. Ces affaires comparables m\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine : un sursis au prononc\u00e9 de la peine assorti d\u2019une probation d\u2019au plus 12 mois constituerait une peine juste pour la personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique (d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, par. 19). Une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019infraction commise par une personne d\u00e9linquante se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible comparativement \u00e0 d\u2019autres crimes de gravit\u00e9 semblable.\n[169] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. Il s\u2019applique \u00e0 une infraction qui englobe une vaste gamme de comportements, allant d\u2019actes qui ne pr\u00e9sentent gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00e0 d\u2019autres qui posent un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9. Son effet, \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la fourchette, est aussi grave que les peines minimales dont il \u00e9tait question dans les affaires Nur et Lloyd. La d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion ne peuvent \u00e0 elles seules justifier un tel r\u00e9sultat. La sanction t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris total des normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine, et la peine d\u2019emprisonnement obligatoire aurait des effets n\u00e9fastes importants sur une jeune personne d\u00e9linquante. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces consid\u00e9rations, je conviens avec M. Hills que les Canadiens et Canadiennes seraient indign\u00e9s d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison.\n[170] Comme la Couronne n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument ou de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un des rares cas o\u00f9 une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12 peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte , je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 aborder cette question.\nF. La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a\u2011t\u2011elle commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte du rapport Gladue de M. Hills et de son statut de M\u00e9tis au moment o\u00f9 elle lui a inflig\u00e9 une nouvelle peine?\n[171] Monsieur Hills soutient que la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas tenu compte de son rapport Gladue et de son statut de M\u00e9tis au moment o\u00f9 elle lui a inflig\u00e9 une nouvelle peine. Il demande \u00e0 notre Cour de r\u00e9tablir la peine de trois ans et demi de prison inflig\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance.\n[172] Comme je conclus que le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) \u00e9tait inconstitutionnel, je ne vois aucune raison de modifier la peine qu\u2019il a inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Hills. Les parties ne pr\u00e9tendent pas que la peine inflig\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine est manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e ni qu\u2019il a commis une autre erreur de principe qui a une incidence sur la peine. De plus, les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la peine ont droit \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence en appel (Lacasse, par. 11 et 67). Puisque la Cour d\u2019appel a modifi\u00e9 la peine prononc\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) \u00e9tait constitutionnel, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner cette partie de ses motifs.\n[173] En conclusion, la peine inflig\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine est r\u00e9tablie et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander si la Cour d\u2019appel a commis une erreur en n\u2019\u00e9valuant pas le rapport Gladue de M. Hills et son statut de M\u00e9tis.\nG. R\u00e9paration\n[174] Ayant conclu que l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) viole l\u2019art. 12 et que cette violation n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte , la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante, avec effet imm\u00e9diat, conform\u00e9ment au par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 . Les parties n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation sur d\u2019autres r\u00e9parations pouvant \u00eatre accord\u00e9es en vertu de la Charte en cas de violation de l\u2019art. 12 , comme celles examin\u00e9es dans les arr\u00eats Boudreault (par. 103) et Bissonnette (par. 135\u2011136).\nVI. Conclusion\n[175] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi. Le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta est infirm\u00e9. La peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Elle viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte et n\u2019est pas sauvegard\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier. Elle est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante, avec effet imm\u00e9diat, conform\u00e9ment au par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 , et la d\u00e9claration s\u2019applique r\u00e9troactivement. La peine de trois ans et demi \u00e0 laquelle M. Hills a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine est r\u00e9tablie.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\nI. Introduction\n[176] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation de ma coll\u00e8gue la juge Martin du cadre d\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Cependant, je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 sa tentative de clarifier le cadre \u00e9tabli au moyen d\u2019un nouveau test \u00e0 trois volets applicable \u00e0 la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Je ne souscris pas non plus \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019elle donne \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , et \u00e0 l\u2019application de celle-ci \u00e0 la situation hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Hills au proc\u00e8s. \u00c0 mon avis, la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans anciennement prescrite par l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel ne viole pas l\u2019art. 12 .\nII. Cadre juridique\n[177] L\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale obligatoire viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte est bien \u00e9tablie. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e il y a huit mois par la Cour, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23. Premi\u00e8rement, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer \u00ab ce qui constituerait une peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019infraction eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et aux principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 63, citant R. c. Nur, 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773, par. 46). Deuxi\u00e8mement, il lui faut se demander si la peine minimale obligatoire contraint le juge \u00e0 infliger une peine \u00ab totalement disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb (ou autrement dit, exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e) par rapport \u00e0 la peine qui serait juste et proportionn\u00e9e soit pour le d\u00e9linquant en cause, soit pour un autre d\u00e9linquant plac\u00e9 dans une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable (Bissonnette, par. 63; Nur, par. 46; R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130, par. 23).\n[178] Dans les pr\u00e9sents pourvois connexes, ma coll\u00e8gue adh\u00e8re \u00e0 ce cadre d\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 3 et 40; R. c. Hilbach, 2023 CSC 3, par. 34). Cependant, en cherchant \u00e0 donner \u00ab des rep\u00e8res, des directives et des \u00e9claircissements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 3), elle a, \u00e0 mon humble avis, introduit une incertitude et une confusion regrettables. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, ma coll\u00e8gue \u00e9nonce trois \u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ments [. . .] qui doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9s \u00bb : (1) la port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction; (2) les effets de la peine sur le d\u00e9linquant; et (3) la \u00ab sanction \u00bb et ses objectifs (par. 122). Chacune de ces consid\u00e9rations est pertinente lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur. Elles n\u2019indiquent pas si la peine minimale prescrite par la loi est \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb, au\u2011del\u00e0 de simplement excessive, par comparaison avec la dur\u00e9e de ce qui constituerait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction.\n[179] Premi\u00e8rement, si la \u00ab port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction \u00bb sont larges, la gamme de peines justes sera plus vaste. Ce qui est en cause, sur le plan constitutionnel, c\u2019est la peine juste la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re pour un comportement dont on pourrait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il tombe sous le coup de la peine minimale contest\u00e9e. D\u2019ailleurs, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la \u00ab vaste gamme de comportements \u00bb vis\u00e9e par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donne ma coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019une peine non carc\u00e9rale serait juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour le d\u00e9linquant hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. Hills au proc\u00e8s (par. 5, 164 et 169). Cependant, cela n\u2019est pas pertinent lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider par la suite, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, si une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement est plus que simplement excessive, mais est \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00bb par rapport \u00e0 cette peine en particulier. La \u00ab port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction \u00bb ne font qu\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es pour une infraction donn\u00e9e.\n[180] Deuxi\u00e8mement, ma coll\u00e8gue met l\u2019accent sur les effets de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. Encore une fois, avec \u00e9gards, cela pr\u00eate \u00e0 confusion pour deux raisons. La premi\u00e8re est que ces effets \u2014 et l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9insertion sociale \u2014 sont directement pertinents lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur. En fait, comme l\u2019affirme ma coll\u00e8gue, \u00ab [l]es tribunaux doivent tenir compte de l\u2019effet de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause \u00bb et \u00ab lorsque l\u2019emprisonnement a un effet plus grand sur une personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier, il peut y avoir lieu de lui accorder une r\u00e9duction de peine \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 135 (je souligne)). Il s\u2019agit simplement de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli. La deuxi\u00e8me raison est que les effets de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sont examin\u00e9s non pas isol\u00e9ment, mais relativement \u00e0 une infraction particuli\u00e8re (voir Bissonnette, par. 49). Le fait qu\u2019une \u00ab peine d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans aurait des effets pr\u00e9judiciables importants sur les jeunes d\u00e9linquants \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 165) n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9. Mais cela peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre vrai pour ceux qui commettent un meurtre ou d\u2019autres infractions plus graves. Nous sommes dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 tol\u00e9rer des peines \u00e0 caract\u00e8re punitif plus longues \u2014 malgr\u00e9 les effets d\u00e9vastateurs de l\u2019emprisonnement \u2014 pour les auteurs de crimes plus graves. Comme le fait remarquer ma coll\u00e8gue, \u00ab [p]our donner la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale, les tribunaux devraient faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les jeunes d\u00e9linquants de la peine la plus courte possible, proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction \u00bb (par. 165 (je souligne)).\n[181] Troisi\u00e8mement, ma coll\u00e8gue met l\u2019accent sur la \u00ab sanction \u00bb et ses objectifs. Je suis d\u2019accord que les tribunaux devraient toujours tenir compte de l\u2019interaction entre la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation et les autres objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Or, ce troisi\u00e8me \u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00bb est au c\u0153ur de l\u2019analyse \u2014 d\u00e9terminer si le Parlement a outrepass\u00e9 les limites constitutionnelles en punissant certains d\u00e9linquants. Dans son analyse, ma coll\u00e8gue revient en grande partie aux m\u00eames principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine qui sont directement pertinents lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, notamment la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant (voir par. 167). \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, sa conclusion repose toujours sur la question de savoir si la diff\u00e9rence dans la dur\u00e9e entre la peine minimale de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement et la peine \u00ab juste \u00bb plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re \u00ab indign[erait] \u00bb les Canadiens et les Canadiennes (par. 169).\n[182] Par cons\u00e9quent, et bien que je sois consciente de la difficult\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si une peine minimale atteint le niveau requis pour \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, la nouvelle approche \u00e0 trois volets pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par ma coll\u00e8gue n\u2019aide pas \u00e0 trancher cette question. Elle ne fait que reprendre les consid\u00e9rations pertinentes pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, la question de savoir si une peine minimale est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste \u2014 c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. la question de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une peine qui est plus que simplement excessive mais qui est \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (R. c. Smith, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1045, p. 1072, citant Miller c. La Reine, [1977] 2 R.C.S. 680, p. 688, le juge en chef Laskin; Lloyd, par. 24); qui \u00ab choquer[ait] la conscience \u00bb des Canadiens (Lloyd, par. 33); qui serait \u00ab odieuse ou intol\u00e9rable \u00bb pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (R. c. Boudreault, 2018 CSC 58, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 599, par. 126, citant Lloyd, par. 24; Smith, p. 1072; R. c. Morrisey, 2000 CSC 39, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 90, par. 26); ou qui serait \u00ab incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb (Bissonnette, par. 60) \u2014 demeure un jugement normatif (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 110).\n[183] C\u2019est ce qu\u2019illustre le pourvoi connexe. Malgr\u00e9 le nouveau test \u00e0 trois volets qu\u2019\u00e9nonce la juge Martin, les conclusions finales tir\u00e9es par celle\u2011ci dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hilbach d\u00e9pendent de la question de savoir si les peines minimales de cinq et quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour vol qualifi\u00e9 perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 utilisation restreinte ou avec une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire, respectivement, \u00ab choque[raient] la conscience \u00bb ou seraient \u00ab excessive[s] au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb par comparaison avec la peine juste de deux \u00e0 trois ans d\u2019emprisonnement (Hilbach, par. 81 et 108). En revanche, les juges Karakatsanis et Jamal per\u00e7oivent le m\u00eame \u00e9cart diff\u00e9remment. Ils estiment qu\u2019il est \u00ab difficile de concevoir comment une peine repr\u00e9sentant pr\u00e8s du double de la dur\u00e9e d\u2019une peine proportionn\u00e9e ne choquerait pas la conscience des Canadiens \u00bb (Hilbach, par. 145; voir aussi par. 118 et 161). Selon ces deux points de vue, la question de savoir \u00e0 quel moment une p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement additionnelle devient excessive au point de constituer une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e est une question de jugement.\n[184] Je ne conteste pas qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 une peine non carc\u00e9rale. Je ne suis tout simplement pas d\u2019accord pour dire que la probation pourrait constituer une peine proportionn\u00e9e dans les applications raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement, et pour les motifs qui suivent, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) ne vise pas les comportements qui ne pr\u00e9sentent \u00ab gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00bb ou qui comportent une \u00ab faible faute morale \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 5, 125, 164 et 169; Nur, par. 83). Intentionnellement d\u00e9charger une arme \u00e0 feu qui met la vie en danger en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, est plut\u00f4t un comportement hautement coupable et r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible.\nIII. Analyse\n[185] Monsieur Hills ne conteste pas la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) relativement \u00e0 sa propre situation. Il le fait plut\u00f4t sur la base d\u2019un d\u00e9linquant hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s. Il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de commencer en interpr\u00e9tant la port\u00e9e de la disposition cr\u00e9ant l\u2019infraction, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue des comportements raisonnablement vis\u00e9s par l\u2019infraction.\nA. Interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a)\n[186] Comme notre Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e raisonnable d\u2019une loi contest\u00e9e est essentiellement une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative (par. 61). Au nom des juges majoritaires, la juge en chef McLachlin a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\nAu fond, le tribunal se demande seulement ce qui suit. Quelle est la port\u00e9e de la loi? Quels actes pourraient raisonnablement tomber sous le coup de la loi? Quelle est l\u2019incidence raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible de la loi? Telles sont les questions que les tribunaux se posent toujours pour d\u00e9limiter la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition cr\u00e9ant une infraction et se prononcer sur sa constitutionnalit\u00e9. [Je souligne; par. 61.]\n[187] Pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e raisonnable de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), je dois lire les mots de la disposition dans leur contexte global en suivant leur sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie du Code criminel , son objet et l\u2019intention du Parlement (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7e \u00e9d. 2022), \u00a7 2.01(1)). Cette approche moderne est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9somption que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019adopter des dispositions conformes \u00e0 la Charte . Si une disposition peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois inconstitutionnelle selon une interpr\u00e9tation et constitutionnelle selon une autre, cette seconde interpr\u00e9tation doit pr\u00e9valoir (Sullivan, \u00a7 16.01; R. c. Sharpe, 2001 CSC 2, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 45, par. 33). Il \u00ab faut rechercher la v\u00e9ritable intention du l\u00e9gislateur et appliquer le sens qui correspond \u00e0 ses objets \u00bb (R. c. Hasselwander, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 398, p. 413, citant P.\u2011A. C\u00f4t\u00e9, Interpr\u00e9tation des lois (2e \u00e9d. 1990); voir aussi Sullivan, \u00a7 2.01(2)).\n[188] \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)b), le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) n\u2019exige pas express\u00e9ment que le d\u00e9linquant ait agi \u00ab sans se soucier de la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui \u00bb. Cependant, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, je conclus que les deux infractions pr\u00e9vues au par. 244.2(1) exigent, \u00e0 tout le moins, une appr\u00e9ciation subjective du pr\u00e9judice ou danger potentiel pour autrui. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large que pr\u00e9conise ma coll\u00e8gue, la disposition contest\u00e9e est d\u2019une port\u00e9e suffisamment restreinte pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019imposition de peines exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de conduites raisonnablement susceptibles de tomber sous le coup de la loi.\n(1) Intention du l\u00e9gislateur\n[189] L\u2019article 244.2 du Code criminel a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en 2009, dans le cadre de la r\u00e9ponse du Parlement \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge intentionnelle et insouciante d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu. Le ministre de la Justice a d\u00e9crit l\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 244.2 en ces termes :\nNous proposons \u00e9galement d\u2019inscrire une nouvelle infraction au Code criminel , qui ciblerait les fusillades au volant d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur et autres d\u00e9charges intentionnelles d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu effectu\u00e9es sans le moindre souci de la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\n. . .\n\u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, les infractions permettant d\u2019intenter des poursuites dans ce genre de causes incluent l\u2019utilisation n\u00e9gligente d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ou la d\u00e9charge d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu dans l\u2019intention de causer des l\u00e9sions corporelles. Les infractions fond\u00e9es sur la n\u00e9gligence ne traduisent pas convenablement la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une fusillade au volant d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur, qui suppose une conduite consciemment irresponsable.\nPar contre, l\u2019article 244 exige une preuve que l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9charg\u00e9e en direction d\u2019une personne pr\u00e9cise dans l\u2019intention de la blesser, et cela est insuffisant. Bien que cela convienne dans le cas o\u00f9 le tireur vise une cible pr\u00e9cise, il peut parfois \u00eatre difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir cette preuve dans le cas d\u2019une fusillade au volant d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur o\u00f9 l\u2019intention est d\u2019intimider une bande rivale, ou encore dans bien des cas o\u00f9 le tireur d\u00e9charge sauvagement son arme sans viser une cible pr\u00e9cise.\nL\u2019infraction que nous proposons [l\u2019art. 244.2] comblera un vide dans le Code criminel et apportera une r\u00e9ponse adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 ce comportement. Cette nouvelle infraction exige la preuve que l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019est concentr\u00e9 sur le fait que la d\u00e9charge de son arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui, et conscient de ce fait, est quand m\u00eame all\u00e9 de l\u2019avant. Ce genre d\u2019individus s\u2019en moquent tout simplement. [Je souligne.]\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 144, no 29, 2e sess., 40e l\u00e9g., 12 mars 2009, p. 1687\u20111688)\n[190] Ainsi, le Parlement entendait viser un d\u00e9linquant qui \u00ab s\u2019est concentr\u00e9 sur le fait que la d\u00e9charge de son arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui \u00bb. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 tout au long des d\u00e9bats l\u00e9gislatifs :\nCette infraction vise toute personne qui d\u00e9chargerait intentionnellement son arme \u00e0 feu en affichant une attitude irresponsable envers la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. En d\u2019autres termes, elle ne met pas l\u2019accent sur les cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment recherch\u00e9es, mais plut\u00f4t sur le m\u00e9pris intentionnel envers la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\nIl y a quelque chose de particuli\u00e8rement troublant pour moi dans une situation o\u00f9 une personne sait qu\u2019utiliser une arme \u00e0 feu met la vie d\u2019autrui en danger, mais la d\u00e9charge tout de m\u00eame. Ce genre de comportement r\u00e9clame une r\u00e9action plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re, et le projet de loi C\u201114 la pr\u00e9voit. [Je souligne.]\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 12 mars 2009, p. 1702 (Mme Dona Cadman))\nLe projet de loi C\u201114 pr\u00e9sente des modifications dans quatre domaines.\n. . .\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, il \u00e9rige en infraction le fait de d\u00e9charger intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu sans se soucier de la vie ou de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. [Je souligne.]\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 144, no 45, 2e sess., 40e l\u00e9g., 24 avril 2009, p. 2675 (M. Daniel Petit); voir aussi les commentaires semblables faits dans D\u00e9bats du S\u00e9nat, vol. 146, no 31, 2e sess., 40e l\u00e9g., 5 mai 2009, p. 732\u2011733 (hon. John D. Wallace).)\n[191] Par cons\u00e9quent, il convient d\u2019abord de noter que le Parlement n\u2019entendait manifestement pas que l\u2019art. 244.2 vise la d\u00e9charge insouciante d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ou dans des situations qui ne posent par ailleurs \u00ab gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 5, 164 et 169). Il visait plut\u00f4t, aux al. 244.2(1)a) et 244.2(1)b), le fait de tirer en m\u00e9prisant intentionnellement la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui dans des situations qui \u00ab met[ent] la vie d\u2019autrui en danger \u00bb.\n(2) Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a)\n[192] C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce contexte l\u00e9gislatif que j\u2019examine les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). L\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 et exige que le d\u00e9linquant d\u00e9charge une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un \u00ab lieu \u00bb, que le par. 244.2(2) d\u00e9finit largement afin d\u2019y inclure tout b\u00e2timent ou construction. Je conviens avec la juge Martin que l\u2019actus reus ne requiert pas que quiconque soit pr\u00e9sent au \u00ab lieu \u00bb o\u00f9 l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e (par. 8 et 156\u2011160). Cependant, nous divergeons d\u2019opinion en ce qui concerne la \u00ab large \u00bb port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction, qui, selon elle, est \u00ab principalement attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019actus reus \u00bb (par. 164). \u00c0 mon avis, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction est consid\u00e9rablement restreinte par l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment moral qui l\u2019accompagne, comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011dessous.\na) Double mens rea\n[193] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 244.2(1)a) requiert une double mens rea : (1) la d\u00e9charge intentionnelle d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu; et (2) la connaissance de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019occupants ou le fait de ne pas se soucier de la pr\u00e9sence ou non d\u2019occupants. Par cons\u00e9quent, le d\u00e9linquant ne peut savoir, ni m\u00eame penser, que \u00ab personne n\u2019est dans les parages \u00bb, ou encore se montrer \u00ab insoucian[t] quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autrui \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 159\u2011160 (italique omis)), lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9charge intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu. Il doit plut\u00f4t savoir que le lieu est occup\u00e9 ou faire preuve d\u2019insouciance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ce qui exige \u00ab la connaissance d\u2019un danger ou d\u2019un risque et la persistance dans une conduite qui engendre le risque que le r\u00e9sultat prohib\u00e9 se produise \u00bb (Sansregret c. La Reine, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 570, p. 584). La culpabilit\u00e9 dans le cas d\u2019insouciance se justifie par la prise de conscience du risque et par le fait d\u2019agir malgr\u00e9 celui\u2011ci, un \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit positif comparativement \u00e0 celui des infractions fond\u00e9es sur la n\u00e9gligence ou l\u2019\u00ab insoucian[ce] \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 160). \u00c0 tout le moins, donc, le d\u00e9linquant vis\u00e9 par l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) doit avoir connaissance du risque que courent les occupants et n\u00e9anmoins tirer intentionnellement en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, malgr\u00e9 ce risque.\n[194] La double mens rea exig\u00e9e en application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) doit en outre \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objet et du but de la disposition. En adoptant le par. 244.2(1), le Parlement souhaitait inclure la d\u00e9charge d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu dans des situations qui compromettaient la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. Il l\u2019a fait en \u00e9dictant deux infractions, pr\u00e9vues aux al. a) et b) : premi\u00e8rement, lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9linquant tire intentionnellement en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants; et, deuxi\u00e8mement, dans d\u2019autres situations o\u00f9 un d\u00e9linquant tire intentionnellement sans se soucier de la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) est un exemple \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un cas de tir \u2014 en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, o\u00f9 l\u2019auteur sait qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou ne se soucie pas qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants \u2014 qui compromet la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\n[195] L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation subjective du pr\u00e9judice ou du danger potentiel peut \u00eatre plus facile dans les cas classiques de fusillades routi\u00e8res, ou lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9linquant tire intentionnellement en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu aux termes de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), que dans les cas de tirs insouciants g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement vis\u00e9s par l\u2019al. 244.2(1)b). Mais il serait absurde et contraire \u00e0 l\u2019intention express\u00e9ment \u00e9nonc\u00e9e du Parlement de consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) s\u2019applique \u00e0 des cas de tirs o\u00f9 le d\u00e9linquant ne m\u00e9prise pas, \u00e0 tout le moins, de fa\u00e7on subjective et insouciante la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un risque pour la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. \u00c0 mon avis, la connaissance de la simple pr\u00e9sence d\u2019occupants ou une insouciance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est insuffisante pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9. Les deux volets du par. 244.2(1) entendaient plut\u00f4t viser des cas de tirs o\u00f9 le d\u00e9linquant \u00e9tait conscient du fait qu\u2019il faisait courir un risque de danger \u00e0 autrui.\nb) Interpr\u00e9tations ant\u00e9rieures de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a)\n[196] Mon interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), plus restreinte que celle de ma coll\u00e8gue, est conforme \u00e0 celle des cours d\u2019appel qui ont examin\u00e9 la disposition. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Oud, 2016 BCCA 332, 339 C.C.C. (3d) 379, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019infraction vise [traduction] \u00ab toutes les d\u00e9charges intentionnelles d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu dans des situations hautement dangereuses pour autrui, sciemment ou avec insouciance \u00bb (par. 35 (je souligne)). S\u2019il est vrai que la cour ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait pas d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert en mati\u00e8re d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu pour \u00e9valuer une situation hypoth\u00e9tique semblable \u00e0 celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Hills en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, elle a n\u00e9anmoins interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction restrictivement, concluant que l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) est [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019application suffisamment pr\u00e9cise \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00ab ne ratisse pas trop large \u00bb (par. 32). Je suis tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord.\n[197] Ma coll\u00e8gue la juge Martin met l\u2019accent sur l\u2019importance de la preuve d\u2019expert produite en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui, selon le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, [traduction] \u00ab a corrig\u00e9 \u00bb la \u00ab lacune au chapitre de la preuve \u00bb dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oud, notamment, sur la question de savoir si le fait de tirer un projectile d\u2019un fusil \u00e0 plomb ou \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 \u00e9tait beaucoup moins grave que le d\u00e9chargement d\u2019un fusil ordinaire (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 151 et 158). Cependant, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oud, la cour a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019infraction est de port\u00e9e restreinte et la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction place cette peine minimale obligatoire dans la gamme de peines proportionn\u00e9es pour toute situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible \u00bb (par. 51 (je souligne)).\n[198] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Itturiligaq, 2020 NUCA 6, la Cour d\u2019appel du Nunavut a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas d\u2019un homme qui avait intentionnellement tir\u00e9 avec une carabine de chasse en direction du profil du toit d\u2019une maison qu\u2019il savait occup\u00e9e. L\u2019unique balle est ressortie du toit et n\u2019a caus\u00e9 aucune blessure. Comme ce fut le cas dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oud, la cour a conclu que l\u2019infraction visait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et dangereux de tirer avec un fusil en direction d\u2019un espace ou d\u2019un lieu ouvert [. . .] sachant que d\u2019autres personnes peuvent s\u2019y trouver ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019y trouver ou non d\u2019autres personnes \u00bb (par. 48 (CanLII)). Le Parlement avait pour objectif de [traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9er une infraction qui interdisait la d\u00e9charge intentionnelle d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu dans une situation o\u00f9 le tireur \u00e9tait conscient du fait que tirer avec le fusil \u00e9tait susceptible de mettre la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en danger \u00bb (par. 47 (je souligne)).\n(3) Conclusion sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a)\n[199] \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le par. 244.2(1) de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober le \u00ab fait pour une personne [. . .] de d\u00e9charger un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison lorsque personne n\u2019est dans les parages \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 159 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Avec \u00e9gards, cette interpr\u00e9tation large de la conduite vis\u00e9e par le par. 244.2(1) est dissoci\u00e9e du contexte l\u00e9gislatif ainsi que de l\u2019objet et du but de la disposition. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e correctement, l\u2019exigence de double mens rea de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) vise uniquement les d\u00e9linquants qui d\u00e9chargent intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants \u2014 et qui ont donc song\u00e9 au fait que tirer \u00e9tait susceptible de mettre la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en danger. Cette interpr\u00e9tation respecte la pr\u00e9somption de constitutionnalit\u00e9 et l\u2019intention v\u00e9ritable du Parlement, qui visait explicitement les d\u00e9linquants ayant une appr\u00e9ciation subjective du fait que la d\u00e9charge de leur arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\n(4) Effet de la concession de la Couronne\n[200] Avant d\u2019appliquer mon interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) \u00e0 la situation hypoth\u00e9tique qu\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e M. Hills au proc\u00e8s, je souhaite examiner bri\u00e8vement la nature de la concession faite par la Couronne lors du voir\u2011dire :\n[traduction] . . . je pense qu\u2019il est juste de dire, sans -- comme l\u2019explique mon coll\u00e8gue -- sans conc\u00e9der carr\u00e9ment que la situation hypoth\u00e9tique elle\u2011m\u00eame pourrait donner lieu -- je pense qu\u2019il est assez clair que la situation hypoth\u00e9tique portait sur une jeune personne avec un fusil \u00e0 plomb tirant sur une structure o\u00f9 l\u2019on sait que des sans\u2011abri s\u2019y trouvent parfois, ce serait une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans les circonstances \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve d\u2019expert qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue.\n(d.a., vol. I, p. 252)\n[201] La Couronne a ajout\u00e9 que la d\u00e9fense, par l\u2019entremise de son expert en armes \u00e0 feu, avait [traduction] \u00ab perfectionn\u00e9 la situation hypoth\u00e9tique vague ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour en Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019affaire Oud \u00bb, qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9sum\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant \u00ab non \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve quant \u00e0 savoir si cela constituerait ou non une arme \u00e0 feu en droit, et quelle serait la probabilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par cette arme \u00bb (p. 252).\n[202] \u00c0 mon avis, la Couronne a clairement conc\u00e9d\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique, \u00e0 savoir [traduction] \u00ab [qu\u2019]il existe des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu [selon la d\u00e9finition qu\u2019en donne le Code criminel ] qui ne sont pas susceptibles de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer une structure tr\u00e8s simple \u00bb (p. 252), sur le fondement de la preuve accept\u00e9e de l\u2019expert de la d\u00e9fense. Du point de vue de la preuve, elle a affirm\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab [qu\u2019]aucune preuve additionnelle n\u2019a \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir davantage la situation hypoth\u00e9tique \u00bb (p. 253). Cependant, la Couronne n\u2019a pas, \u00e0 mon avis, conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction seraient \u00e9tablis dans la situation hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 par la suite que [traduction] \u00ab bien \u00e9videmment, l\u2019observation de la Couronne est qu\u2019il est possible de traiter de cette situation en recourant \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation att\u00e9nu\u00e9e \u00bb (p. 254).\n[203] Par cons\u00e9quent, la question de savoir si la Couronne a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que le fait de tirer sur une grange \u00ab o\u00f9 l\u2019on sait que des sans\u2011abri s\u2019y trouvent parfois \u00bb peut donner lieu \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e est en grande partie non pertinente et non contest\u00e9e. Le principal effet de la concession a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019acceptation par la Couronne du fait que certaines armes \u00e0 feu ne pouvaient p\u00e9n\u00e9trer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel. Cependant, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que la position de la Couronne est que la mens rea de l\u2019infraction serait \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019exemple de la grange, sans plus, ou qu\u2019une telle situation constituerait une application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), le fait de tirer sur une grange serait exclu en l\u2019absence de connaissance ou d\u2019insouciance quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019occupants, et donc sans une appr\u00e9ciation subjective d\u2019un risque pour la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\nB. Application du cadre d\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur\n(1) Qu\u2019est\u2011ce qu\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a)?\n[204] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je ne partage pas l\u2019opinion de la juge Martin selon laquelle le \u00ab sursis au prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une peine d\u2019au plus 12 mois de probation \u00bb (par. 162) pourrait constituer une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e en application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Il faut alors se demander si, suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) englobe n\u00e9anmoins des cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles pour lesquels une peine de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e (Oud, par. 50). Je conclus que non. Bien que potentiellement excessive, la peine minimale contest\u00e9e n\u2019est pas excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence ou d\u2019\u00eatre odieuse ou intol\u00e9rable pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\na) La simple probation n\u2019est pas une peine proportionn\u00e9e\n[205] La d\u00e9cision de la juge Martin en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce porte sur le cas hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. Hills au proc\u00e8s d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab jeune personne d\u00e9charg[eant] intentionnellement, en direction d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence, un pistolet ou une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 \u00bb (2018 ABQB 945, 79 Alta. L.R. (6th) 161, par. 14). Elle conclurait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible relevant du champ d\u2019application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle une peine de probation serait appropri\u00e9e. Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Cette situation, sans plus, ne comporte pas d\u2019actes qui pourraient raisonnablement tomber sous le coup de la loi (Nur, par. 61), et ce, pour trois raisons.\n[206] Premi\u00e8rement, le cas du jeune d\u00e9linquant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. Hills est con\u00e7u principalement en fonction de l\u2019actus reus de l\u2019infraction. Rien ne permet de conclure que la mens rea requise serait \u00e9tablie. La situation hypoth\u00e9tique est silencieuse quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le d\u00e9linquant a song\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019occupants, et au risque correspondant pour leur vie ou leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il a choisi de tirer intentionnellement sur le b\u00e2timent. Je ne conteste pas que l\u2019actus reus, \u00e0 lui seul, engloberait un vaste \u00e9ventail de conduites, y compris le cas hypoth\u00e9tique du pistolet ou de la carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense. Cependant, l\u2019exigence de double mens rea de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) sert \u00e0 limiter l\u2019\u00e9tendue des comportements qui rel\u00e8vent \u00e0 juste titre du champ d\u2019application de cette disposition. Cette exigence de double mens rea rend les d\u00e9linquants hautement coupables et bl\u00e2mables.\n[207] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019opinion des juges majoritaires repose sur l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle la situation \u00ab pr\u00e9visible \u00bb pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Hills ne pr\u00e9sente \u00ab gu\u00e8re de danger pour le public \u00bb. Je suis en d\u00e9saccord. Suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), le d\u00e9linquant doit avoir song\u00e9 au fait que la d\u00e9charge de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. De plus, une arme \u00e0 feu, par d\u00e9finition, doit \u00eatre \u00ab susceptible [. . .] d\u2019infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort \u00e0 une personne \u00bb (Code criminel , art. 2 ). Ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que les armes \u00e0 feu comprennent ou non certains dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) ne vise que l\u2019utilisation des carabines ou pistolets \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 qui sont susceptibles d\u2019infliger des cons\u00e9quences graves ou mortelles. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, cette disposition ne vise pas une personne qui \u00ab d\u00e9charg[e] un fusil de paintball en direction d\u2019une maison lorsque personne n\u2019est dans les parages \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 159), ce que l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne sait pas lorsqu\u2019il appuie sur la d\u00e9tente. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, qui vise un comportement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment insouciant, serait tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente si l\u2019accus\u00e9 savait au moment de la commission de l\u2019infraction qu\u2019il tirait sur un b\u00e2timent vide.\n[208] La position de ma coll\u00e8gue d\u00e9pend, en effet, de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un mur r\u00e9sidentiel pour prot\u00e9ger les occupants. Avec \u00e9gards, cela fait abstraction ou minimise d\u2019autres risques inh\u00e9rents lorsqu\u2019une personne choisit de d\u00e9charger intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu qui met la vie en danger en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent. \u00c0 la Cour d\u2019appel, la juge Antonio a analys\u00e9 ces risques, y compris la possibilit\u00e9 que des balles puissent p\u00e9n\u00e9trer une fen\u00eatre ou une porte, les effets psychologiques sur les occupants ou les voisins, le risque d\u2019une r\u00e9action violente d\u2019une cible ou d\u2019un t\u00e9moin et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, l\u2019incidence sur le sentiment de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans les communaut\u00e9s (2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226, par. 80\u201182). Dans le pourvoi connexe Hilbach, ma coll\u00e8gue mentionne des risques semblables, y compris le \u00ab risque de blessure physique grave [. . .] lorsque des armes \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 sont utilis\u00e9es au cours d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 \u00bb, et affirme que le \u00ab risque de traumatisme psychologique que peut susciter l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 demeure semblable \u00e0 celui que peut susciter une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle \u00bb (par. 98). Elle signale aussi la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une escalade de violence et la difficult\u00e9 de distinguer entre les armes \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 et les armes conventionnelles. \u00c0 mon avis, ces m\u00eames consid\u00e9rations s\u2019appliquent aux cas de tirs intentionnels en application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a).\n[209] Ma coll\u00e8gue conc\u00e8de que \u00ab le fait de d\u00e9charger une carabine de chasse en direction d\u2019une maison est un acte tr\u00e8s grave et tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible \u00bb, comme dans le cas de M. Hills (par. 164). \u00c0 mon avis, il en est ainsi ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si une balle de cette carabine pourrait, de fait, transpercer le mur d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence donn\u00e9e. La pertinence de la distinction fond\u00e9e sur le mur r\u00e9sidentiel est affaiblie par le fait que m\u00eame des armes conventionnelles, y compris les carabines de chasse couramment utilis\u00e9es, peuvent ne pas perforer des murs de brique typiques. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le rapport de l\u2019expert de la d\u00e9fense portait [traduction] \u00ab exclusivement sur les assemblages de mur \u00e0 ossature de bois \u00bb, mais y \u00e9tait jointe une \u00e9tude ant\u00e9rieure qui concluait que \u00ab les murs typiques construits de brique ou \u00e0 parement de brique sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9sistants \u00e0 la perforation par balle de toutes les armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles, y compris les armes de poing et les fusils de chasse communs \u00bb (d.a., vol. I, p. 393 (je souligne)). Ces murs de brique [traduction] \u00ab ne pourraient \u00eatre perfor\u00e9s que par les plus grosses armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles \u00bb, par exemple les mitrailleuses Browning de calibre .50 (p. 393). Bien que les carabines \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 soient assur\u00e9ment moins dangereuses que les armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles, elles demeurent susceptibles d\u2019infliger des blessures graves ou la mort. La question de savoir si certaines armes \u00e0 feu peuvent dans les faits perforer un mur r\u00e9sidentiel en particulier ne devrait pas \u00eatre le facteur d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a).\n[210] Troisi\u00e8mement, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019accent que met ma coll\u00e8gue sur le fait que le d\u00e9linquant hypoth\u00e9tique soit \u00ab jeune \u00bb (par. 161 et 165), les peines minimales obligatoires pr\u00e9vues dans le Code criminel ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux jeunes d\u00e9linquants vis\u00e9s par la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale pour les adolescents, L.C. 2002, c. 1, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire ceux qui sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de moins de 18 ans. Bien que l\u2019\u00e2ge puisse constituer un facteur att\u00e9nuant dans la d\u00e9termination d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e, et que la r\u00e9insertion sociale demeure un principe important dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine, l\u2019accent que met ma coll\u00e8gue sur les \u00ab jeunes d\u00e9linquants \u00bb doit \u00eatre mis en contexte.\n[211] Au fond, le fait de tirer intentionnellement avec n\u2019importe quelle arme \u00e0 feu \u2014 qui, par d\u00e9finition, doit \u00eatre susceptible d\u2019infliger des blessures graves ou la mort \u2014 en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, est une conduite hautement dangereuse et coupable. Dans de tels cas, l\u2019absence de blessures graves ou de mort ne sera qu\u2019une question de chance (Oud, par. 61). Je rejette l\u2019id\u00e9e que la commission d\u2019une infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement, puisse \u00eatre \u00ab tout au plus une forme mineure de m\u00e9fait \u00bb ou que l\u2019infraction ne pose par ailleurs \u00ab gu\u00e8re ou pas de danger \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 167), vu la mens rea requise et la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite.\n[212] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la simple probation n\u2019est pas une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans une application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a).\nb) Une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e requiert, \u00e0 tout le moins, une p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration\n[213] Dans le cas de d\u00e9linquants hypoth\u00e9tiques, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, ni possible, pour les tribunaux d\u2019attribuer \u00e0 la peine ou \u00e0 la fourchette de peines des valeurs pr\u00e9cises. Ceux\u2011ci doivent plut\u00f4t \u00ab consid\u00e9rer, ne serait\u2011ce qu\u2019implicitement, l\u2019\u00e9chelle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des peines qui sont appropri\u00e9es \u00bb (Lloyd, par. 23). L\u2019examen des situations qui sont raisonnablement susceptibles de tomber sous le coup de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) doit prendre appui sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire et le bon sens (Nur, par. 62). Cela exclut l\u2019utilisation d\u2019exemples invraisemblables ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de m\u00eame que l\u2019utilisation de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles pour constituer un dossier qui inspirerait la plus grande sympathie possible (par. 75).\n[214] Suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte de la disposition contest\u00e9e, je con\u00e7ois difficilement un cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible o\u00f9 une peine inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 une peine de plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u2019emprisonnement serait juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00ab \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et au degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant \u00bb en application de l\u2019art. 718.1 du Code criminel . Le principe fondamental de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, la proportionnalit\u00e9, exige une peine qui est suffisamment s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour d\u00e9noncer l\u2019infraction, mais qui n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas ce qui est juste et appropri\u00e9 compte tenu de la culpabilit\u00e9 morale du d\u00e9linquant et de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (Bissonnette, par. 50). Sans \u00e9gard aux cons\u00e9quences ultimes, l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a) vise les tirs d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment insouciants et dangereux avec des armes \u00e0 feu qui sont, par d\u00e9finition, susceptibles d\u2019infliger des blessures mettant la vie en danger. C\u2019est le caract\u00e8re insouciant du comportement \u2014 l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice potentiel, que celui\u2011ci se mat\u00e9rialise ou non \u2014 qui est grave et hautement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, et qui fait en sorte qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration est une peine proportionn\u00e9e.\n[215] La comparaison que fait ma coll\u00e8gue avec les peines inflig\u00e9es dans les affaires R. c. Pretty, 2005 BCCA 52, 208 B.C.A.C. 79, R. c. Schnare, [1988] N.S.J. No. 118 (QL), 1988 CarswellNS 568 (WL) (C.A.), et R. c. Cheung, Gee and Gee (1977), 5 A.R. 356 (C.S. (Div. 1re inst.)), aide \u00e0 illustrer la diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) et les infractions de \u00ab m\u00e9fait \u00bb qui remontent \u00e0 des d\u00e9cennies. Il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair que les fusils \u00e0 plomb utilis\u00e9s dans ces affaires pourraient \u00eatre class\u00e9s comme des armes \u00e0 feu et, plus important encore, que les d\u00e9linquants satisferaient \u00e0 la double mens rea requise par l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a). Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) ne vise que l\u2019accus\u00e9 qui \u00ab s\u2019est concentr\u00e9 sur le fait que la d\u00e9charge de son arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui, et conscient de ce fait, est quand m\u00eame all\u00e9 de l\u2019avant \u00bb (D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 12 mars 2009, p. 1687\u20111688). Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que cela constitue une \u00ab forme mineure de m\u00e9fait \u00bb (motifs de la juge Martin, par. 167). Rien n\u2019indique que des d\u00e9linquants semblables \u00e0 ceux des affaires Pretty, Schnare ou Cheung aient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a), ni qu\u2019ils puissent l\u2019\u00eatre, suivant une interpr\u00e9tation correcte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction.\n[216] Pour prendre un exemple plus r\u00e9cent, l\u2019accus\u00e9 de 19 ans dans l\u2019affaire Nur a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 40 mois d\u2019emprisonnement pour la simple possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e charg\u00e9e (R. c. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, conf. par 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773). Cette peine est, bien entendu, moindre que celles inflig\u00e9es en application de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) qu\u2019ont confirm\u00e9es ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es les cours d\u2019appel pour la d\u00e9charge intentionnelle d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu dans les arr\u00eats Itturiligaq (quatre ans), R. c. McMillan, 2016 MBCA 12, 326 Man. R. (2d) 56 (quatre ans), Oud (cinq ans) et R. c. Lyta, 2013 NUCA 10, 561 A.R. 146 (cinq ans). Ces infractions ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 commises avec des armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles. Cependant, y substituer des armes \u00e0 feu \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 ne r\u00e9duirait pas suffisamment la gravit\u00e9 des infractions et la culpabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9linquants pour justifier une peine inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de la dur\u00e9e de celle jug\u00e9e juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans les arr\u00eats Itturiligaq, McMillan, Oud et Lyta. Par d\u00e9finition, toutes les armes \u00e0 feu doivent \u00eatre susceptibles d\u2019infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort.\n[217] \u00c0 mon avis, une peine de deux ans devrait \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme correspondant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es dans les applications raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a).\n(2) Une peine de quatre ans est\u2011elle exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e?\n[218] La peine minimale de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 244.2(3)b) aurait pour effet, \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de la gamme de peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es, de doubler la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration dans les cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Il ne faudrait pas en minimiser les cons\u00e9quences, lesquelles peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9vastatrices. Cependant, je ne peux conclure, sur le plan constitutionnel, que cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement additionnelle atteindrait le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par notre Cour en ce qui concerne les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es.\n[219] Une peine outrepasse les limites constitutionnelles lorsqu\u2019elle est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et non simplement excessive (Bissonnette, par. 61). La peine doit \u00eatre \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Smith, p. 1072, citant Miller, p. 688, le juge en chef Laskin; Lloyd, par. 24), et \u00ab odieuse ou intol\u00e9rable \u00bb pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Boudreault, par. 126, citant Lloyd, par. 24; Smith, p. 1072; Morrisey, par. 26). Comme le juge en chef Wagner, au nom d\u2019une Cour unanime, l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 plus r\u00e9cemment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bissonnette, elle doit \u00eatre \u00ab excessive au point de ne pas \u00eatre compatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb (par. 60).\n[220] Par cons\u00e9quent, ce n\u2019est que tr\u00e8s rarement qu\u2019un tribunal conclura, et a conclu, qu\u2019une peine est si exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e qu\u2019elle viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte (voir Steele c. \u00c9tablissement Mountain, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1385, p. 1417, le juge Cory; Boudreault, par. 127\u2011128, la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, dissidente, mais non sur ce point; Bissonnette, par. 70). Les tribunaux doivent \u00e0 juste titre faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les d\u00e9cisions de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de peines (Bissonnette, par. 70; Lloyd, par. 45). Dans un passage maintes fois cit\u00e9, le juge Borins a dit ce qui suit \u00e0 propos de cette d\u00e9f\u00e9rence :\n[traduction] Il n\u2019appartient pas au tribunal de se prononcer sur la sagesse du l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en ce qui concerne la gravit\u00e9 de diverses infractions et les diff\u00e9rentes peines qui peuvent \u00eatre inflig\u00e9es aux personnes reconnues coupables de les avoir commises. Le l\u00e9gislateur jouit d\u2019une large discr\u00e9tion pour interdire certains comportements consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme criminels et pour d\u00e9terminer quelle doit \u00eatre la sanction appropri\u00e9e. Si le jugement d\u00e9finitif quant \u00e0 savoir si une peine exc\u00e8de les limites constitutionnelles fix\u00e9es par la Charte constitue \u00e0 bon droit une fonction judiciaire, le tribunal devrait n\u00e9anmoins h\u00e9siter \u00e0 intervenir dans les vues m\u00fbrement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies du l\u00e9gislateur et ne le faire que dans les cas les plus manifestes o\u00f9 la peine prescrite est excessive, comparativement \u00e0 la peine pr\u00e9vue pour d\u2019autres infractions, au point de constituer une atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence.\n(R. c. Guiller (1985), 48 C.R. (3d) 226 (C. dist. Ont.), p. 238)\n[221] \u00c0 mon avis, une peine de quatre ans ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00ab excessive \u00bb au point d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb ou de par ailleurs \u00ab porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb. Le seuil de l\u2019art. 12 est n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans les cas o\u00f9 la question en litige est la dur\u00e9e de la peine, par opposition aux peines qui sont cruelles et inusit\u00e9es par nature, comme la torture ou la castration. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par la juge Martin dans le pourvoi connexe Hilbach selon laquelle il est loisible au Parlement de mettre l\u2019accent sur les objectifs de dissuasion et de d\u00e9nonciation dans le contexte d\u2019infractions li\u00e9es aux armes \u00e0 feu (par. 73). Une arme \u00e0 feu incarne la \u00ab menace supr\u00eame de mort aux yeux de ceux qui y font face \u00bb (R. c. Felawka, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 199, p. 211). Notre Cour a maintes fois confirm\u00e9 la fonction de d\u00e9nonciation des peines minimales pour des comportements qui portent atteinte au \u00ab code des valeurs fondamentales \u00bb de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Morrisey, par. 47; R. c. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 R.C.S. 500, par. 81). Tirer intentionnellement avec une arme \u00e0 feu qui menace la vie en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, est un exemple clair de comportement qui porte atteinte au code des valeurs fondamentales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\n[222] Je souscris aux conclusions respectives de la Cour d\u2019appel du Nunavut et de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre un objectif p\u00e9nal valide \u00bb (Itturiligaq, par. 95) et qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ne vise que les comportements qui, en toutes circonstances, seront hautement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles et contraires \u00e0 la paix de la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb (Oud, par. 44). En insistant sur le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019art. 12, le juge La Forest a expliqu\u00e9 que le mot \u00ab exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00bb traduit \u00ab le souci qu\u2019avait cette Cour de ne pas astreindre le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 une norme \u00e0 ce point s\u00e9v\u00e8re [. . .] qu\u2019elle exigerait des peines parfaitement adapt\u00e9es aux nuances morales qui caract\u00e9risent chaque crime et chaque d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (R. c. Lyons, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 309, p. 344\u2011345). Je suis d\u2019accord. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je me garde \u00ab de remettre en question les choix [de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] des \u00e9lus \u00bb (Nur, par. 144, le juge Moldaver, dissident) sur le fondement d\u2019une situation hypoth\u00e9tique qui, \u00e0 mon avis, n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire et le bon sens.\n[223] \u00c0 ma connaissance, la situation hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) \u2014 et ne pourrait non plus y donner lieu, suivant mon interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019infraction, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019ait song\u00e9 au fait que la d\u00e9charge de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu compromettrait la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se \u00ab rel\u00e8ve davantage de la fiction que de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00bb et ne constitue pas une assise valable pour r\u00e9duire \u00e0 n\u00e9ant la solution r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie du Parlement \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 la fois grave et complexe (voir Nur, par. 133, le juge Moldaver, dissident).\nIV. Modifications l\u00e9gislatives\n[224] Avant de conclure, je souhaite bri\u00e8vement commenter la Loi modifiant le Code criminel et la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances, L.C. 2022, c. 15. Ayant re\u00e7u la sanction royale le 17 novembre 2022, la mesure l\u00e9gislative a modifi\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 244.2(3) b) et a abrog\u00e9 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel (en cause dans Hilbach), supprimant ainsi la peine minimale de quatre ans en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pr\u00e9vue pour les infractions vis\u00e9es au par. 244.2(1) commises avec des armes \u00e0 feu sans restriction ou non prohib\u00e9es.\n[225] Cette loi traduit un choix de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, par le gouvernement, qui n\u2019est pas pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ancienne loi violait l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 CSC 44, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 134, par. 104). Bien que le ministre de la Justice ait reconnu g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sentation de la mesure l\u00e9gislative, que certaines peines minimales obligatoires sont susceptibles de mener \u00e0 des peines qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es, je conviens avec la directrice des poursuites p\u00e9nales que cela ne saurait \u00eatre vu comme une reconnaissance qu\u2019une disposition ou une peine minimale en particulier n\u2019est pas ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la Charte . Comme pour le texte original de l\u2019art. 244.2 adopt\u00e9 en 2009, il rel\u00e8ve du Parlement de r\u00e9glementer les infractions li\u00e9es aux armes \u00e0 feu comme il l\u2019entend. Cela comprend la mise en balance des objectifs de la dissuasion et de la d\u00e9nonciation avec ceux de la r\u00e9insertion sociale, de la proportionnalit\u00e9 et de la discr\u00e9tion judiciaire dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine.\nV. Conclusion\n[226] Correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019al. 244.2(1)a) vise les d\u00e9linquants qui tirent intentionnellement avec une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent ou d\u2019un autre lieu, sachant qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve des occupants ou sans se soucier qu\u2019il s\u2019y trouve ou non des occupants, et qui ont donc song\u00e9 au fait que la d\u00e9charge de leur arme \u00e0 feu \u00e9tait susceptible de compromettre la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui. \u00c0 mon avis, une peine minimale de quatre ans pour un tel comportement n\u2019est ni \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb ni \u00ab incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb au point de constituer une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019art. 12.

C\u201146, art. 344(1) a)(i), a.1 ).\nApr\u00e8s avoir commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur, H, un Autochtone de 19 ans, a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 une accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9 avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e en contravention du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) du Code criminel . Le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 344(1) a)(i) prescrit une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans d\u2019emprisonnement dans le cas d\u2019une condamnation pour une premi\u00e8re infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte. Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, H, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , a contest\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire, soutenant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au regard de sa situation et qu\u2019elle constituait une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 . Il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019une peine de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de H.\nDans une affaire distincte, Z a commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur et a reconnu sa culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9 avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu en contravention de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel . \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1) imposait une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement en cas de d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour vol qualifi\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e. Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, Z a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , une contestation visant la peine minimale obligatoire, s\u2019appuyant sur une s\u00e9rie de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques. La juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de Z. Elle a conclu, toutefois, que la peine \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) inop\u00e9rant. Elle a condamn\u00e9 Z \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de trois ans.\nLes appels de la Couronne dans les dossiers de H et de Z ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instruits conjointement. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 les appels sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions \u00e9tablissant les peines minimales obligatoires, mais a ajout\u00e9 un an \u00e0 la peine de H, concluant qu\u2019un emprisonnement de trois ans \u00e9tait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. Elle a refus\u00e9 de modifier la peine de Z. La Couronne interjette appel \u00e0 la Cour des d\u00e9clarations d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions pr\u00e9voyant les peines minimales obligatoires.\nArr\u00eat (les juges Karakatsanis et Jamal sont dissidents) : Le pourvoi est accueilli.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Moldaver, Brown, Rowe, Martin et Kasirer : Les peines minimales obligatoires \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et \u00e0 l\u2019ancien al. 344(1)a.1) sont constitutionnelles et ne constituent pas des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es.\nDans le pourvoi connexe R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, la Cour a confirm\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable aux contestations de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce cadre, d\u00e9terminer si les peines minimales obligatoires pour vol qualifi\u00e9 sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es commande une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes. Le tribunal doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel . Le tribunal doit ensuite se demander si la disposition contest\u00e9e l\u2019oblige \u00e0 infliger une peine qui est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. La question de savoir si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e d\u00e9pendra de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, des effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante et de la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame et de ses objectifs. Cette \u00e9valuation en deux \u00e9tapes peut se faire en fonction soit a) de la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal, soit b) d\u2019une autre personne d\u00e9linquante dans un cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible.\nL\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 devrait s\u2019inscrire dans l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 718.2e) du Code criminel exige l\u2019examen de la situation particuli\u00e8re des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones relativement \u00e0 toutes les infractions lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Les juges charg\u00e9s de la d\u00e9termination de la peine doivent tenir compte des facteurs syst\u00e9miques ou contextuels distinctifs qui peuvent avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait que la personne d\u00e9linquante autochtone se retrouve devant les tribunaux, ainsi que des types de proc\u00e9dures de d\u00e9termination de la peine et de sanctions qui, dans les circonstances, peuvent \u00eatre appropri\u00e9es pour cette personne d\u00e9linquante. Lorsqu\u2019il entre en jeu, l\u2019al. 718.2e) s\u2019applique \u00e0 trois diff\u00e9rentes parties de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 . Premi\u00e8rement, les tribunaux doivent tenir compte de l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent la peine de la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause; l\u2019omission de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue est une erreur susceptible de mener \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une peine n\u2019est pas indiqu\u00e9e. Deuxi\u00e8mement, lorsque les tribunaux \u00e9laborent des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, ils peuvent examiner des situations mettant en cause des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones. Enfin, l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 est pertinente \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 . L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la question de savoir si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e d\u00e9pend, en partie, de l\u2019effet de la peine sur les personnes d\u00e9linquantes, notamment les personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones, et du fait qu\u2019elle rend compte d\u2019objectifs p\u00e9naux valables et de principes reconnus en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine, qui comprennent le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 718.2e).\nDans le cas de H, la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans prescrite au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Pour ce qui est de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, soit d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction, un emprisonnement de trois ans est une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour H. Il s\u2019agit du point de d\u00e9part adopt\u00e9 pour le vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e simple commis dans de petits \u00e9tablissements commerciaux en l\u2019absence de pr\u00e9judice physique r\u00e9el. Outre le fait que l\u2019infraction commise par H comportait l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e, elle a aussi caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice physique aux deux commis du d\u00e9panneur. Qui plus est, H a point\u00e9 sa carabine sur deux employ\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait en probation et faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance d\u2019interdiction au moment de l\u2019infraction, et il a impliqu\u00e9 un adolescent de 13 ans dans un crime violent. La peine de deux ans impos\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, qui \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure d\u2019une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re au point de d\u00e9part, \u00e9tait manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e.\nPour ce qui est de la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l\u2019analyse en deux \u00e9tapes, soit d\u00e9terminer si une peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, la peine minimale obligatoire, bien qu\u2019elle soit s\u00e9v\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle fr\u00f4le la limite, n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de H. Premi\u00e8rement, pour ce qui est de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, la peine minimale en cause n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e large au point d\u2019englober des comportements qui pr\u00e9sentent relativement peu de risque de pr\u00e9judice. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 et la culpabilit\u00e9 des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui en sont reconnues coupables sont relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9es. Le vol qualifi\u00e9 est une infraction grave en raison de l\u2019actus reus requis, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le recours ou la menace de recours \u00e0 la violence ou \u00e0 la force lors du vol ou de la tentative de vol de biens. L\u2019ajout d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quation ne fait qu\u2019accro\u00eetre la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction. Les cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 sont faciles \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer : il y a le risque de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de blessures corporelles graves pour les victimes et les passants, et m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de coups de feu, l\u2019exposition \u00e0 cette menace comporte le risque de pr\u00e9judice psychologique profond. L\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e non charg\u00e9e ne r\u00e9duit pas consid\u00e9rablement la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, car la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu cr\u00e9e une situation extr\u00eamement instable et dangereuse. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments moraux requis pour que la peine minimale s\u2019applique sugg\u00e8rent un degr\u00e9 relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9. La personne d\u00e9linquante qui commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte doit avoir l\u2019intention de voler et avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019utiliser la violence ou la force (ou de menacer de le faire). L\u2019infraction ne consiste pas en une d\u00e9cision prise par inadvertance de mettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public \u00e0 risque, mais en un choix conscient de mettre \u00e0 grand risque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une autre personne. Bien que la situation personnelle de H att\u00e9nue quelque peu sa culpabilit\u00e9, les actes qu\u2019il a commis constituent une infraction grave comportant un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 morale.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, pour ce qui est des effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante, une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de cinq ans aurait des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9fastes sur la r\u00e9insertion sociale de H, au regard de la conclusion du juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine selon laquelle une peine purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier accroissait la probabilit\u00e9 que H r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le milieu des gangs. Pour bon nombre de personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones, la peine sera plus difficile car celles\u2011ci sont plus durement touch\u00e9es par l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et sont souvent trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans les milieux carc\u00e9raux. De plus, l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration elle\u2011m\u00eame est souvent une fa\u00e7on culturellement inappropri\u00e9e de sanctionner les actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles commis par des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones. Ces effets doivent avoir beaucoup de poids.\nPour ce qui est de la peine et de ses objectifs, les tribunaux doivent d\u2019abord examiner quels objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine le Parlement a prioris\u00e9s en adoptant la peine minimale obligatoire et, ensuite, se demander si la peine minimale va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au Parlement d\u2019atteindre ses objectifs. Dans le cas de H, la d\u00e9cision du Parlement de prioriser la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion est justifiable. La peine minimale obligatoire vise une conduite qui justifie manifestement la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation vigoureuse qu\u2019indique une lourde peine d\u2019emprisonnement. Le Parlement peut \u00e9dicter des peines minimales obligatoires qui indiquent que l\u2019insouciance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la vie et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui dans la manipulation d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu n\u2019est tout simplement pas acceptable. Il y a aussi un besoin de dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019une personne met en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en brandissant une arme \u00e0 feu. Les gestes de H correspondent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 la conduite que le Parlement voulait dissuader. Il y a donc lieu de faire preuve d\u2019une plus grande retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du choix du Parlement de pr\u00e9voir une peine minimale. De plus, la peine minimale obligatoire dans le cas de H ne d\u00e9roge pas totalement aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour une infraction de cette nature. Bien qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans soit sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la peine \u00e0 laquelle H serait condamn\u00e9, elle ne d\u00e9passe pas de beaucoup ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Parlement atteigne ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. La diff\u00e9rence entre la peine minimale obligatoire et la situation particuli\u00e8re de H ne portent pas atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence.\nDans le cas de Z, cinq situations hypoth\u00e9tiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Toutefois, ces situations sont insuffisantes pour \u00e9tablir que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. La peine minimale obligatoire ne choque pas la conscience ou n\u2019est pas excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence. Bien que la peine soit s\u00e9v\u00e8re, le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e n\u2019est pas atteint.\nPremi\u00e8rement, parmi les cinq situations, seules deux sont raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles sont des situations dont on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles se produisent, selon le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills. La premi\u00e8re situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable porte sur un Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9 de 21 ans qui souffre d\u2019alcoolisme et est atteint de l\u2019ensemble des troubles caus\u00e9s par l\u2019alcoolisation f\u0153tale, et qui se trouve dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eame et est couch\u00e9 face contre terre dans un banc de neige lorsqu\u2019une bonne samaritaine s\u2019arr\u00eate pour l\u2019aider. Il empoigne la femme, met la main \u00e0 sa propre ceinture pour lui faire voir un fusil \u00e0 balles BB et saisit le sac \u00e0 main de celle\u2011ci. Le fusil \u00e0 balles BB fonctionne et est susceptible de crever un \u0153il, mais il n\u2019est pas charg\u00e9e. La deuxi\u00e8me situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable porte sur un Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9 de 26 ans, qui souffre de toxicomanie et de schizophr\u00e9nie et qui a un casier judiciaire peu charg\u00e9. Lors d\u2019une rencontre avec son trafiquant de drogue dans un stationnement, il sort un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, le pointe en direction de son trafiquant et prend quelques comprim\u00e9s de m\u00e9thamph\u00e9tamine.\nDe plus, deux situations hypoth\u00e9tiques tir\u00e9es de d\u00e9cisions publi\u00e9es sont raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Les deux affaires portaient sur de jeunes personnes d\u00e9linquantes impliqu\u00e9es dans des vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs : une Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 ans, qui avait plaid\u00e9 coupable en tant que participante \u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur, o\u00f9 l\u2019auteur principal de l\u2019infraction avait utilis\u00e9 une fausse arme \u00e0 feu; et un jeune d\u00e9linquant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 18 ans qui avait utilis\u00e9 un fusil \u00e0 balles BB pour perp\u00e9trer un vol qualifi\u00e9 et qui a plaid\u00e9 coupable.\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de la d\u00e9marche, une peine de deux ans \u00e0 deux ans et demi d\u2019emprisonnement est une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans ces situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Ces situations comportaient des vols impliquant de la violence dans la rue, une infraction dont la fourchette de peines est d\u2019environ 12 \u00e0 18 mois, en plus de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme, en particulier une arme \u00e0 feu, ce qui est un facteur aggravant. De plus, elles comportaient l\u2019emploi de la force envers la victime, un degr\u00e9 de planification et un casier judiciaire. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pour r\u00e9gler une dispute li\u00e9e \u00e0 la drogue pr\u00e9sente aussi un risque grave pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, une consid\u00e9ration qui justifie une lourde peine. N\u00e9anmoins, la culpabilit\u00e9 morale des personnes d\u00e9linquantes est att\u00e9nu\u00e9e lorsque des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et de d\u00e9pendance sous\u2011tendent leurs gestes, ainsi que tout facteur applicable \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue.\nQuant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la d\u00e9marche, le minimum obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans ces situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Pour ce qui est de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, les situations ne d\u00e9montrent pas que la peine minimale obligatoire ratisse trop large et englobe des personnes d\u00e9linquantes dont la culpabilit\u00e9 morale est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9e. La mens rea et l\u2019actus reus de cette infraction s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un ensemble relativement limit\u00e9 de comportements violents, et la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir fait de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e un acte pr\u00e9cis ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9termin\u00e9 pour \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable. Du point de vue de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, il n\u2019y a pas de diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable entre la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle et une arme \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9. Les situations invoqu\u00e9es par Z n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) s\u2019applique dans des circonstances ne comportant que peu ou pas de danger pour le public ou peu ou pas de faute. Les distinctions entre la l\u00e9talit\u00e9 des armes \u00e0 feu en cause, ou la responsabilit\u00e9 en tant que participant, n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas des degr\u00e9s de gravit\u00e9 radicalement diff\u00e9rents dans le contexte de cette infraction. Dans toutes ces situations, pour voler, une personne d\u00e9linquante fait le choix conscient de mettre une autre personne \u00e0 risque de blessures graves et d\u2019un traumatisme psychologique consid\u00e9rable. Toutefois, les effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante sont graves. La situation personnelle de la personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique indique que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration exig\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) pourrait vraisemblablement entra\u00eener de graves effets n\u00e9fastes. Finalement, un examen de la peine et de ses objectifs r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) et celle fond\u00e9e sur le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) sont semblables. Le Parlement a choisi d\u2019imposer la condamnation morale forte qu\u2019une lourde peine d\u2019emprisonnement signale, ce qui est raisonnable vu que le choix des personnes d\u00e9linquantes de mettre \u00e0 risque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique contrevient aux valeurs morales fondamentales. Il convient donc de faire preuve d\u2019une plus grande d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du Parlement d\u2019\u00e9dicter un minimum obligatoire.\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 : Il y a accord avec la majorit\u00e9 quant au dispositif de l\u2019appel. Toutefois, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s en dissidence dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, il y a d\u00e9saccord avec le nouveau test \u00e0 trois \u00e9tapes \u00e9labor\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse existant. Il d\u00e9coule de l\u2019application de ce cadre juridique que la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et celle prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) ne sont pas excessives au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence ou de choquer la conscience des Canadiens.\nLes juges Karakatsanis et Jamal (dissidents) : Le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 344(1)a)(i) et l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel violent la garantie constitutionnelle contre les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Ces peines ne peuvent \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9es par application de l\u2019article premier, et elles devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es inop\u00e9rantes en vertu du par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 .\nLa peine de cinq ans \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de H. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a correctement examin\u00e9 les faits, la jurisprudence ainsi que les objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine pertinents avant de conclure qu\u2019une peine de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la situation de H. Cette conclusion commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Dans la d\u00e9termination d\u2019une peine juste, les tribunaux ne doivent pas suivre syst\u00e9matiquement des points de d\u00e9part, \u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement toute perspective de r\u00e9insertion sociale ou encore d\u00e9former la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction en \u00e9cartant des faits pertinents (par exemple le fait que l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e ou non). Dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine de H, le juge a mis en balance les facteurs aggravants importants ainsi que les circonstances personnelles tragiques de celui\u2011ci, notamment le fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 par ses parents, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 par ses grands\u2011parents paternels (tous deux des survivants des pensionnats autochtones) et qu\u2019il a eu une enfance et une adolescence marqu\u00e9es par la pauvret\u00e9, une cellule familiale bris\u00e9e, des abus physiques et une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 des substances. Ces circonstances sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le genre de contexte ou de facteurs syst\u00e9miques que la Cour a reconnu comme \u00e9tant att\u00e9nuants lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, et il est imp\u00e9rieux que les juges charg\u00e9s de d\u00e9terminer les peines consid\u00e8rent de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e les conditions sociales particuli\u00e8res auxquelles sont expos\u00e9s les peuples autochtones au Canada. Il choquerait la conscience d\u2019envoyer un jeune d\u00e9linquant autochtone en prison pendant cinq ans alors que, comme a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le juge de la peine, une telle d\u00e9cision serait pr\u00e9judiciable tant au d\u00e9linquant qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. De plus, une sentence qui repr\u00e9sente le double ou presque d\u2019une peine juste est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Il est difficile de concevoir comment une telle peine ne choquerait pas la conscience des Canadiens. Une peine de cinq ans n\u2019est pas compatible avec une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 12 et ne tient pas non plus compte des profondes cons\u00e9quences que toute incarc\u00e9ration aurait sur la vie et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9linquant, sans compter les r\u00e9percussions connexes qu\u2019elle aurait pour ce dernier et sa famille. M\u00eame si une peine juste dans le cas de H \u00e9tait une peine de trois ans, une peine de cinq ans serait tout de m\u00eame exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\nLa peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est elle aussi exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Elle a une port\u00e9e inconstitutionnellement large et s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9visible \u00e0 un large \u00e9ventail de situations, y compris des cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9linquant peut \u00eatre jeune, \u00eatre d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 des substances ou avoir aid\u00e9 le d\u00e9linquant principal ou fait usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu tel un fusil \u00e0 balles BB. Infliger cette peine minimale obligatoire dans certaines de ces situations serait excessif au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence. Une peine de quatre ans va au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019exemple classique d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu et vise aussi des conduites moins extr\u00eames. Bien que la gravit\u00e9 objective d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu soit toujours importante, la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction commise d\u00e9pend des circonstances entourant l\u2019infraction et varie consid\u00e9rablement. Un large \u00e9ventail de personnes commettent des vols \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e. La prise en consid\u00e9ration de telles circonstances et caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9claire sur la port\u00e9e raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible du texte de loi et refl\u00e8te la nature intrins\u00e8quement individualis\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et la mani\u00e8re dont la proportionnalit\u00e9 implique une \u00e9valuation tant de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction que de la culpabilit\u00e9 morale du d\u00e9linquant. Cela fait en sorte que l\u2019art. 12 tient compte de la composition courante des d\u00e9linquants du syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale. Vu la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9finition du terme arme \u00e0 feu (qui inclut les fusils \u00e0 balles BB, les fusils de paintball et les fusils \u00e0 clous), la gamme de conduites vis\u00e9es par l\u2019infraction (y compris le degr\u00e9 de participation au crime et la nature de cette participation, le niveau de violence et le niveau de sophistication), ainsi que la fr\u00e9quence de certaines circonstances personnelles, circonstances qui s\u2019entrecroisent souvent (notamment l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, la jeunesse, les d\u00e9pendances \u00e0 diverses substances et les efforts de r\u00e9insertion sociale), il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans dans un p\u00e9nitencier constituerait une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e pour certains d\u00e9linquants.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge Martin\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : R. c.

Introduction\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si les peines minimales obligatoires pour vol qualifi\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , constituent des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es au sens de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Plus particuli\u00e8rement, M. Hilbach conteste la peine minimale de cinq ans d\u2019emprisonnement prescrite au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) lorsqu\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 est commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte, soutenant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au regard de sa situation. Monsieur Zwozdesky s\u2019appuie sur une s\u00e9rie de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques pour contester la peine minimale de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement auparavant pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire est utilis\u00e9e. La peine minimale obligatoire prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019instruction du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Malgr\u00e9 cette modification l\u00e9gislative, les pr\u00e9sents motifs abordent la peine minimale obligatoire telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 auparavant adopt\u00e9e.\n[2] Dans le pourvoi connexe R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable aux contestations de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . La question de savoir si une peine minimale est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e d\u00e9pendra de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, des effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante et de la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame et de ses objectifs. \u00c0 ce chapitre, les caract\u00e9ristiques classiques des infractions qui se trouvent \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s du spectre peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9gag\u00e9es et pourraient fournir des indications. Par exemple, certaines infractions, bien que potentiellement tr\u00e8s graves, peuvent \u00eatre commises dans une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de circonstances par un vaste \u00e9ventail de personnes d\u00e9linquantes, incluant des circonstances qui sont pratiquement inoffensives et des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui sont presque moralement irr\u00e9prochables. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles rel\u00e8vent d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019infractions pour lesquelles les peines minimales obligatoires sont particuli\u00e8rement susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre invalid\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte parce qu\u2019elles constituent des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. Il en est ainsi parce que la peine minimale obligatoire prescrite peut, dans certains cas, \u00eatre si s\u00e9v\u00e8re et ses effets si prononc\u00e9s qu\u2019elle donne lieu \u00e0 une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine appropri\u00e9e dans un cas donn\u00e9 (voir, p. ex., Hills; R. c. Smith, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1045; R. c. Nur, 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773; R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130).\n[3] En revanche, certaines infractions pouvant entra\u00eener de lourdes peines minimales obligatoires, comme un emprisonnement de quatre \u00e0 cinq ans, sont formul\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas pouvoir \u00eatre commises dans des situations inoffensives par des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui sont presque moralement irr\u00e9prochables. Au contraire, elles sont presque toujours graves et commises par des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui ont un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 morale. Les infractions qui rel\u00e8vent de cette cat\u00e9gorie sont d\u00e9finies restrictivement, et la port\u00e9e, l\u2019objet et la mens rea de celles\u2011ci sont limit\u00e9s. Elles comportent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des actes de violence, des menaces de violence ou des comportements qui sont fondamentalement dangereux, dans des situations qui donnent lieu \u00e0 un risque r\u00e9el de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de graves blessures corporelles. De plus, elles exigent un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 morale de la part des personnes d\u00e9linquantes, qu\u2019elles soient participantes \u00e0 l\u2019infraction ou auteures principales de celle\u2011ci, pour justifier une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9.\n[4] Pour cette cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019infractions, la peine minimale obligatoire peut, si l\u2019on applique les principes ordinaires de d\u00e9termination de la peine, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme trop lourde et manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e dans certains cas. Toutefois, pour ces infractions, il y a peu de risques qu\u2019une peine satisfaisant au crit\u00e8re de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e soit inflig\u00e9e, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la peine minimale obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport aux peines qui seraient appropri\u00e9es, si l\u2019on applique les principes ordinaires de d\u00e9termination de la peine, pour une conduite dont on pourrait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle rel\u00e8ve de sa port\u00e9e (voir, p. ex., R. c. Morrisey, 2000 CSC 39, [2000] 2 R.C.S. 90; R. c. Ferguson, 2008 CSC 6, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 96; R. c. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.); Lapierre c. R. [1998] R.J.Q. 677 (C.A.); R. c. McIvor, 2018 MBCA 29, [2018] 5 W.W.R. 139).\n[5] \u00c9videmment, ce ne sont pas toutes les infractions qui rel\u00e8veront clairement de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces deux cat\u00e9gories d\u2019infractions et celles\u2011ci ne sont pas destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des conditions pr\u00e9alables. Ces cat\u00e9gories peuvent plut\u00f4t servir de point de d\u00e9part pour d\u00e9cider si une peine minimale obligatoire donn\u00e9e est constitutionnelle ou non.\n[6] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, et le pourvoi connexe, fournissent des exemples classiques de ces deux cat\u00e9gories d\u2019infractions. Dans l\u2019affaire Hills, la disposition contest\u00e9e imposait une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour une infraction pouvant \u00eatre commise dans une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de circonstances par un vaste \u00e9ventail de personnes d\u00e9linquantes. En revanche, l\u2019infraction dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est d\u00e9finie restrictivement et la port\u00e9e, l\u2019objet et la mens rea de celle\u2011ci sont limit\u00e9s. Les peines minimales obligatoires contest\u00e9es s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un comportement qui pr\u00e9sente un risque important pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des victimes et du public. Le risque de violence et de traumatisme psychologique se rapportant \u00e0 tout vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu est \u00e9lev\u00e9. \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence de l\u2019infraction donnant lieu \u00e0 la peine minimale obligatoire en cause dans l\u2019affaire Hills, l\u2019\u00e9ventail de comportements tombant sous le coup du vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu n\u2019est pas vaste au point o\u00f9 les peines minimales s\u2019appliquent dans des situations qui pr\u00e9sentent peu de danger ou qui comportent une faible faute morale.\n[7] Appliquant le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, je conclus que ni le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) ni l\u2019ancien al. 344(1)a.1) ne sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s. En \u00e9dictant les peines minimales obligatoires en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Parlement \u00e9tait libre de prioriser la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune des dispositions.\nII. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif\n[8] S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , les intim\u00e9s contestent les peines minimales obligatoires prescrites au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel . Les peines minimales obligatoires en cause d\u00e9coulent de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 en contravention de l\u2019art. 343 du Code criminel . L\u2019article 343 du Code criminel d\u00e9finit quatre mani\u00e8res dont l\u2019infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 peut \u00eatre commise :\n343 Commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 quiconque, selon le cas :\na) vole et, pour extorquer la chose vol\u00e9e ou emp\u00eacher ou ma\u00eetriser toute r\u00e9sistance au vol, emploie la violence ou des menaces de violence contre une personne ou des biens;\nb) vole quelqu\u2019un et, au moment o\u00f9 il vole, ou imm\u00e9diatement avant ou apr\u00e8s, blesse, bat ou frappe cette personne ou se porte \u00e0 des actes de violence contre elle;\nc) se livre \u00e0 des voies de fait sur une personne avec l\u2019intention de la voler;\nd) vole une personne alors qu\u2019il est muni d\u2019une arme offensive ou d\u2019une imitation d\u2019une telle arme.\n[9] Bien qu\u2019il y ait quatre fa\u00e7ons dont un vol qualifi\u00e9 peut \u00eatre commis, les exigences de l\u2019actus reus et de la mens rea conf\u00e8rent au vol qualifi\u00e9 un caract\u00e8re plut\u00f4t particulier : en tant qu\u2019infraction, il combine une infraction contre les biens et une infraction contre la personne, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il figure dans la partie IX du Code criminel , intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Infractions contre les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb. En ce qui concerne l\u2019actus reus, l\u2019emploi de la violence ou de la force est une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 au titre des al. 343a) \u00e0 c), et l\u2019al. 343d) exige que la personne d\u00e9linquante soit \u00ab muni[e] d\u2019une arme offensive \u00bb. En outre, trois des quatre fa\u00e7ons dont un vol qualifi\u00e9 peut \u00eatre commis (al. 343a), b) et d)) exigent qu\u2019un vol ait effectivement lieu. Ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments tendent donc \u00e0 restreindre l\u2019infraction \u00e0 un \u00e9ventail relativement \u00e9troit de comportements graves, qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement trait\u00e9s s\u00e9v\u00e8rement lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine (M. Manning et P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff : Criminal Law (5e \u00e9d. 2015), \u00b622.59).\n[10] En ce qui concerne ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments moraux, le vol qualifi\u00e9 comporte une double exigence de mens rea. Premi\u00e8rement, la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019employer la violence ou la force et, dans le cas de l\u2019al. 343d), elle doit avoir l\u2019intention de porter l\u2019arme offensive en question (R. c. Pelletier (1992), 44 Q.A.C. 168, par. 6-14; R. c. Strong (1990), 111 A.R. 12 (C.A.), par. 33; R. c. Nadolnick, 2003 ABCA 363, 339 A.R. 348, par. 21; R. c. Roberts, 2016 NLTD(G) 18, 377 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 174, par. 152\u2011154). Deuxi\u00e8mement, que le vol qualifi\u00e9 ait r\u00e9ellement comport\u00e9 un vol (al. 343a), b) et d)) ou simplement une intention de voler (al. 343c)), la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir eu la mens rea requise pour le vol, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 2 du Code criminel d\u00e9finit \u00ab voler \u00bb comme \u00ab [l]e fait de commettre un vol \u00bb. La mens rea exig\u00e9e pour le vol comprend une intention frauduleuse, l\u2019absence de droit ou d\u2019apparence de droit sur le bien et l\u2019intention de priver le propri\u00e9taire de son bien (Lafrance c. La Reine, [1975] 2 R.C.S. 201; R. c. Dorosh, 2003 SKCA 134, [2004] 8 W.W.R. 613, par. 14).\n[11] Hormis l\u2019al. 343d), l\u2019art. 343 ne cr\u00e9e pas d\u2019infraction distincte de \u00ab vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e \u00bb. Toutefois, lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu est employ\u00e9e dans un vol qualifi\u00e9 commis selon l\u2019une des mani\u00e8res pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 343, le par. 344(1) entre en jeu. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte est utilis\u00e9e, la personne d\u00e9linquante est passible d\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement obligatoire de cinq ans dans le cas d\u2019une premi\u00e8re infraction (sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i)). Avant l\u2019adoption des modifications r\u00e9centes au Code criminel en 2022, lorsque l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu n\u2019\u00e9tait ni \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ni prohib\u00e9e, une peine obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement s\u2019appliquait (al. 344(1) a.1)) :\n344 (1) Quiconque commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 est coupable d\u2019un acte criminel passible :\na) s\u2019il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, ou s\u2019il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction et que celle\u2011ci est perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e au profit ou sous la direction d\u2019une organisation criminelle ou en association avec elle, de l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, la peine minimale \u00e9tant :\n(i) de cinq ans, dans le cas d\u2019une premi\u00e8re infraction,\n(ii) de sept ans, en cas de r\u00e9cidive;\na.1) dans les autres cas o\u00f9 il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, de l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, la peine minimale \u00e9tant de quatre ans;\nb) dans les autres cas, de l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9.\n[12] Une question ayant une incidence sur la port\u00e9e de la disposition contest\u00e9e se pose quant \u00e0 savoir si le par. 344(1) est une disposition cr\u00e9ant une infraction ou s\u2019il se rapporte \u00e0 la seule d\u00e9termination de la peine (R. c. Watson, 2008 ONCA 614, 240 O.A.C. 370, par. 24; R. c. D. (A.), 2003 BCCA 106, 173 C.C.C. (3d) 177, par. 30). Bien que cette question n\u2019ait pas de cons\u00e9quences en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 et des origines de cette disposition, le Parlement semble avoir model\u00e9 le par. 344(1) en s\u2019inspirant du par. 85(1) du Code criminel , qui \u00e9rige en infraction le fait de commettre un acte criminel en utilisant une arme \u00e0 feu, et du par. 85(3) , qui prescrivait auparavant une peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an d\u2019emprisonnement. Il s\u2019ensuit que les peines minimales obligatoires pr\u00e9vues au par. 344(1) doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re similaire au par. 85(1) . Celui-ci est ainsi formul\u00e9 :\nUsage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une infraction\n85 (1) Commet une infraction quiconque, qu\u2019il cause ou non des l\u00e9sions corporelles en cons\u00e9quence ou qu\u2019il ait ou non l\u2019intention d\u2019en causer, utilise une arme \u00e0 feu :\na) soit lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte criminel qui ne constitue pas une infraction pr\u00e9vue [\u00e0 certains articles, y compris \u00e0 l\u2019article] 344 (vol qualifi\u00e9) . . .\n[13] Avant l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 344, les poursuites pour vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu se faisaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en inculpant la personne d\u00e9linquante d\u2019une infraction principale, par exemple de vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019ancien art. 302, et de l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 83 (l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de l\u2019actuel art. 85, usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9; voir, p. ex., Lapierre; R. c. Covin, [1983] 1 R.C.S. 725). Le paragraphe 85(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 afin d\u2019imposer des peines s\u00e9v\u00e8res pour les infractions couramment commises avec des armes \u00e0 feu, comme le vol qualifi\u00e9 (par. 85(3) du Code criminel ; McGuigan c. La Reine, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 284, le juge Dickson (plus tard juge en chef), p. 316\u2011317 et 319, renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019ancien art. 83 ).\n[14] Toutefois, en 1995, apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 344, le vol qualifi\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soustrait de la liste des actes criminels pouvant fonder une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 au titre du par. 85(1) (Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , L.C. 1995, c. 39 , art. 139 et 149). De toute \u00e9vidence, le Parlement avait conclu qu\u2019une peine encore plus rigoureuse que la peine minimale d\u2019un an prescrite par le par. 85(3) \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e pour commettre un vol qualifi\u00e9. Le texte de l\u2019art. 85 renforce la conclusion voulant que cette disposition ait servi de mod\u00e8le \u00e0 l\u2019art. 344, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la similarit\u00e9 du texte des deux dispositions. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il est question, au par. 85(1) , de \u00ab quiconque [. . .] utilise une arme \u00e0 feu [. . .] lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte criminel \u00bb, tandis que le par. 344(1) s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00ab lors de la perp\u00e9tration [du vol qualifi\u00e9] \u00bb.\n[15] Puisque le Parlement a model\u00e9 l\u2019art. 344 en s\u2019inspirant de l\u2019art. 85, l\u2019\u00ab usage \u00bb d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu devrait recevoir la m\u00eame d\u00e9finition aux art. 344 et 85. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Steele, 2007 CSC 36, [2007] 3 R.C.S. 3, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante \u00ab utilise \u00bb une arme \u00e0 feu au sens du par. 85(1) lorsque l\u2019arme est en sa possession physique ou \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, et lorsque \u00ab pour faciliter la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime ou pour prendre la fuite, [elle] r\u00e9v\u00e8le par ses propos ou ses gestes la pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9elle d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ou sa disponibilit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate \u00bb (par. 32 (en italique dans l\u2019original)).\n[16] L\u2019exigence qu\u2019il y ait \u00ab usage \u00bb d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu restreint davantage la port\u00e9e du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) et ne s\u2019applique que si une arme \u00e0 feu est utilis\u00e9e pour menacer de violence ou de force lors d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9. Le simple fait de poss\u00e9der une arme \u00e0 feu n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 \u00ab utiliser \u00bb une arme \u00e0 feu (Steele, par. 25\u201128). Cela emp\u00eache, par exemple, l\u2019application des peines minimales obligatoires lorsqu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante avait simplement en sa possession une arme \u00e0 feu et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait, en th\u00e9orie, \u00ab muni[e] d\u2019une arme \u00bb au sens de l\u2019al. 343d). Qui plus est, l\u2019\u00ab usage \u00bb suppose un degr\u00e9 de faute subjective. La personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019utiliser l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu pendant qu\u2019elle commet l\u2019infraction ou qu\u2019elle prend la fuite apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir commise (R. c. Purcell, 2007 ONCA 101, 220 O.A.C. 207, par. 16\u201118).\n[17] De plus, l\u2019art. 344 incorpore la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb dans le Code criminel , ainsi que les expressions \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e \u00bb et \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte \u00bb. Une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 comme \u00e9tant \u00ab [t]oute arme susceptible, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un canon qui permet de tirer du plomb, des balles ou tout autre projectile, d\u2019infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort \u00e0 une personne \u00bb. Les \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9es \u00bb et les \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte \u00bb sont deux cat\u00e9gories particuli\u00e8res d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu soumises \u00e0 une r\u00e9glementation stricte sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu et du Code criminel . Les armes \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9es comprennent les armes de poing pourvues d\u2019un canon court, les carabines et les fusils de chasse \u00e0 canon tronqu\u00e9 et les armes \u00e0 feu automatiques (Code criminel , par. 84(1) ; Nur, par. 7). La possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e est ill\u00e9gale, \u00e0 moins que la personne poss\u00e9dait l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019interdiction (Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , art. 12 ; Nur, par. 7). Les armes \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte sont \u00ab [d]angereuses en soi \u00bb et \u00ab sont couramment utilis\u00e9es lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019actes criminels \u00bb. Elles s\u2019entendent de toute arme de poing qui n\u2019est pas une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e, de certaines armes \u00e0 feu semi\u2011automatiques et de certaines armes \u00e0 feu mesurant moins d\u2019une longueur donn\u00e9e (Nur, par. 7; Code criminel , par. 84(1) ).\n[18] Les armes \u00e0 feu qui ne sont ni prohib\u00e9es ni \u00e0 autorisation restreinte rel\u00e8vent d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu dont la possession fait l\u2019objet de moins de contraintes. Cette cat\u00e9gorie r\u00e9siduelle comprend les armes \u00e0 feu ordinaires, comme les fusils de chasse, lesquelles sont assujetties au r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9livrance de permis pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu . D\u2019autres sont exclues de l\u2019application de la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu en application du par. 84(3) du Code criminel , en raison de leur vitesse initiale r\u00e9duite. Parmi les armes \u00e0 feu exclues, citons les dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 comme les fusils de paintball et les armes \u00e0 balles BB. Ces dispositifs \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 constituent des \u00ab armes \u00e0 feu \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 il faut l\u2019entendre pour l\u2019application du Code criminel , puisqu\u2019elles peuvent tout de m\u00eame causer des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves (Hills, par. 13\u201114). Les distinctions au sein du r\u00e9gime canadien de r\u00e9glementation des armes \u00e0 feu sont \u00e0 la base des arguments avanc\u00e9s par les parties devant notre Cour sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires.\n[19] Ayant expos\u00e9 le contexte l\u00e9gislatif des peines minimales obligatoires en cause, je me penche maintenant sur les faits et l\u2019historique judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nIII. Historique judiciaire et l\u00e9gislatif\nA. R. c. Hilbach, Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta, 2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359\n[20] Le 9 juin 2017, M. Hilbach et un complice \u00e2g\u00e9 de 13 ans ont commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 avec une carabine \u00e0 canon tronqu\u00e9 non charg\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9panneur \u00e0 Edmonton. Le visage dissimul\u00e9, M. Hilbach a point\u00e9 la carabine en direction des deux employ\u00e9s et a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui remette la caisse, tandis que son complice a donn\u00e9 un coup de poing \u00e0 un des employ\u00e9s et un coup de pied \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Ils sont partis avec 290 $ en billets de loterie et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9s peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Au moment de l\u2019infraction, M. Hilbach avait 19 ans, \u00e9tait en probation et faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une interdiction de possession d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable et condamn\u00e9 pour plusieurs autres infractions 3 mois plus t\u00f4t. En janvier 2018, M. Hilbach a plaid\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 en utilisant une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e en contravention du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) du Code criminel et d\u2019avoir viol\u00e9 le par. 117.01(1) du Code criminel , qui \u00e9rige en infraction le fait pour quiconque de poss\u00e9der une arme \u00e0 feu pendant que cela lui est interdit par une ordonnance judiciaire. Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, M. Hilbach, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , a contest\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans pr\u00e9vue au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i). Monsieur Hilbach a soutenu que la disposition contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans sa situation particuli\u00e8re en tant que d\u00e9linquant se trouvant devant le tribunal.\n[21] Monsieur Hilbach est Autochtone. Il est membre de la Nation crie d\u2019Ermineskin. Devant le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, M. Hilbach a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport pr\u00e9sentenciel et un rapport Gladue, qui indiquait que sa famille avait fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 des pensionnats, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019alcoolisme et de toxicomanie et qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. Il a poursuivi ses \u00e9tudes jusqu\u2019en 10e ann\u00e9e, a travaill\u00e9 dans l\u2019industrie de la construction et travaillait aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un organisme venant en aide aux adolescents et aux jeunes adultes \u00e0 risque de faire partie de gangs et de se livrer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles. Il a une fille, qui \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 mois au moment de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Il a reconnu avoir une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l\u2019alcool et un casier judiciaire pour plusieurs infractions, notamment prof\u00e9ration de menaces, voies de fait, m\u00e9fait et manquements \u00e0 un engagement. Son histoire personnelle est marqu\u00e9e par des s\u00e9vices physiques, de la violence familiale, du ch\u00f4mage chronique et l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 des gangs.\n[22] Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019une peine de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Hilbach. En se demandant s\u2019il y avait disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que m\u00eame si la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9e et que la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9taient importantes, les effets d\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de cinq ans dans un p\u00e9nitencier \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab graves \u00bb, car une peine plus longue accroissait la probabilit\u00e9 \u00ab d\u2019une vie de comportement criminel et autres comportements antisociaux \u00bb (par. 14). La r\u00e9insertion sociale de M. Hilbach \u00e9tait mieux servie par une courte p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. En outre, sa jeunesse \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment att\u00e9nuant et les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue avaient contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019infraction. Le plus fondamental de ces facteurs \u00e9tait la pauvret\u00e9 de M. Hilbach, qui l\u2019a pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 agir comme il l\u2019a fait et \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 des facteurs syst\u00e9miques donnant lieu \u00e0 des revenus plus faibles chez les Autochtones. Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tait convaincu que ces consid\u00e9rations justifieraient une peine inf\u00e9rieure au point de d\u00e9part de trois ans \u00e9tabli par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta pour les simples vols \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e dans des \u00e9tablissements commerciaux dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183. Puisqu\u2019une peine de cinq ans repr\u00e9sentait plus du double d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e, et puisqu\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement dans un p\u00e9nitencier \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab qualitativement \u00bb diff\u00e9rente, il a conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e (par. 43). La Couronne n\u2019a pas formul\u00e9 d\u2019arguments fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019article premier de la Charte , si bien que le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur cette question (par. 5).\nB. R. c. Zwozdesky, Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta, 2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386\n[23] Le 13 septembre 2016, M. Zwozdesky et deux complices masqu\u00e9s ont commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur \u00e0 Caslan, en Alberta. Un des complices a pouss\u00e9 une employ\u00e9e, a point\u00e9 un fusil de chasse \u00e0 canon tronqu\u00e9 dans sa direction et a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui remette la caisse. Un coup de feu a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9 dans une \u00e9tag\u00e8re. Monsieur Zwozdesky n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019auteur principal de l\u2019infraction. Il n\u2019est pas entr\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9panneur pendant le vol qualifi\u00e9, mais il a conduit le v\u00e9hicule dans lequel ses complices sont mont\u00e9s pour se rendre au d\u00e9panneur et pour prendre la fuite. Monsieur Zwozdesky a reconnu sa culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu en contravention de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel et \u00e0 l\u2019accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9 en contravention de l\u2019al. 344(1) b) du Code criminel d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me incident. Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, M. Zwozdesky a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , une contestation visant la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1).\n[24] Monsieur Zwozdesky \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de presque 56 ans au moment de la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Il avait neuf ann\u00e9es de scolarit\u00e9 et n\u2019avait aucun casier judiciaire. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 dans plusieurs accidents de la route, le dernier important s\u2019\u00e9tant produit en 2000. Par cons\u00e9quent, il souffrait d\u2019un grave dysfonctionnement cognitif post\u2011traumatique, de fibromyalgie, d\u2019atteinte nerveuse et de douleur chronique et il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler. Pour traiter sa douleur, il recourait \u00e0 des m\u00e9dicaments sur ordonnance, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des drogues ill\u00e9gales dures et douces. Il n\u2019a gard\u00e9 aucun souvenir du vol qualifi\u00e9 du 13 septembre 2016, car il \u00e9tait sous l\u2019effet de la drogue. La juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu qu\u2019il est possible qu\u2019il ait particip\u00e9 aux vols qualifi\u00e9s pour satisfaire son besoin de consommation r\u00e9sultant de sa douleur chronique.\n[25] La juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire contest\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Zwozdesky, puisqu\u2019une peine de trois \u00e0 quatre ans \u00e9tait juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son infraction. Elle a conclu, toutefois, que la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Les vols \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e peuvent \u00eatre commis dans une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de circonstances et par un large \u00e9ventail de personnes d\u00e9linquantes. La peine minimale serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 les personnes d\u00e9linquantes sont jeunes, autochtones et\/ou aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes de d\u00e9pendance. Au soutien de cette conclusion, la juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au jugement R. c. Hilbach, 2018 ABQB 526. Comme la Couronne n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019observations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article premier de la Charte , la juge ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si l\u2019atteinte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) inop\u00e9rant. Ayant invalid\u00e9 la disposition \u00e9tablissant la peine minimale obligatoire, elle a condamn\u00e9 M. Zwozdesky \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de trois ans pour vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu.\nC. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta, 2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245\n[26] La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta a instruit conjointement les appels de la Couronne dans les dossiers de M. Hilbach et de M. Zwozdesky. Les juges Strekaf et Feehan, majoritaires, ont rejet\u00e9 les appels de la Couronne sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions \u00e9tablissant les peines minimales obligatoires, mais ont ajout\u00e9 un an \u00e0 la peine de M. Hilbach. Dans sa dissidence, le juge Wakeling a conclu que les deux dispositions pr\u00e9voyant des peines minimales obligatoires \u00e9taient constitutionnelles et que les peines inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 chacun des d\u00e9linquants \u00e9taient inad\u00e9quates.\n[27] Les juges majoritaires ont conclu qu\u2019une peine de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Hilbach et ont plut\u00f4t conclu qu\u2019un emprisonnement de trois ans \u00e9tait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. Une peine de trois ans \u00e9tait le point de d\u00e9part pour les vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnas, et une peine de cette dur\u00e9e correspondait \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction commise par M. Hilbach. En infligeant une peine inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 trois ans d\u2019emprisonnement, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a accord\u00e9 trop d\u2019importance aux facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue applicables \u00e0 M. Hilbach et n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 suffisamment de poids \u00e0 la dissuasion et \u00e0 la d\u00e9nonciation, ainsi qu\u2019aux facteurs aggravants de l\u2019infraction. Cependant, le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) demeurait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans le cas de M. Hilbach, puisqu\u2019il emp\u00eachait la prise en compte de facteurs att\u00e9nuants et \u00e9levait [traduction] \u00ab la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion au point de minimiser les objectifs de r\u00e9insertion sociale, l\u2019imposition d\u2019une sanction juste et les consid\u00e9rations particuli\u00e8res qui s\u2019appliquent aux personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones \u00bb (par. 53).\n[28] Les juges majoritaires ont souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine selon laquelle un emprisonnement de trois ans \u00e9tait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Zwozdesky et ils ont refus\u00e9 de modifier sa peine en cons\u00e9quence. Toutefois, les juges majoritaires ont aussi convenu que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans cinq situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, y compris lorsque la personne d\u00e9linquante est jeune, autochtone, qu\u2019elle souffre de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et de d\u00e9pendance et qu\u2019elle a commis le vol qualifi\u00e9 avec un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9. Dans ces situations, la peine minimale obligatoire est susceptible d\u2019\u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 plus du double d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. La Couronne n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument pour que la mesure l\u00e9gislative soit sauvegard\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte .\n[29] Le juge Wakeling, dissident, \u00e9tait d\u2019avis d\u2019annuler les jugements d\u00e9clarant que le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s. Il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son opinion, exprim\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Hills, 2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226, selon laquelle la jurisprudence de notre Cour sur l\u2019art. 12 est non fond\u00e9e et devrait \u00eatre revue. N\u00e9anmoins, le juge Wakeling a fait remarquer qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019un de ces cas extraordinaires \u00bb (par. 89) qui satisfont au crit\u00e8re de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith. Le juge Wakeling \u00e9tait en outre d\u2019avis d\u2019accro\u00eetre la dur\u00e9e des peines de M. Hilbach et de M. Zwozdesky au\u2011del\u00e0 des peines minimales obligatoires.\n[30] En septembre 2021, M. Zwozdesky est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la Cour a autoris\u00e9 la Couronne \u00e0 interjeter appel. Apr\u00e8s que les avocats de M. Zwozdesky ont demand\u00e9 de poursuivre la proc\u00e9dure en application de l\u2019art. 76 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame , L.R.C. 1985, c. S\u201126 , la Cour leur a reconnu la qualit\u00e9 pour agir comme amici curiae en application de la r\u00e8gle 92 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, DORS\/2002\u2011156.\nD. Modifications l\u00e9gislatives\n[31] Apr\u00e8s que l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, le Parlement a introduit et adopt\u00e9 la Loi modifiant le Code criminel et la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances, L.C. 2022, c. 15. La loi a re\u00e7u la sanction royale le 17 novembre 2022 et a abrog\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1). Lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire est utilis\u00e9e pour commettre un vol qualifi\u00e9, cette infraction n\u2019entra\u00eene plus de peine minimale obligatoire. Bien que je reconnaisse cette modification l\u00e9gislative, les pr\u00e9sents motifs abordent la disposition telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 promulgu\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, avec les peines minimales obligatoires applicables. Les parties n\u2019invoquent pas dans leurs plaidoiries le choix du Parlement d\u2019abroger cette mesure et, pour cette raison, je n\u2019examinerai pas cette question plus attentivement.\nIV. Question en litige\n[32] La question \u00e0 trancher dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est celle de savoir si les peines minimales obligatoires d\u2019emprisonnement pr\u00e9vues au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel contreviennent \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte .\nV. Analyse\n[33] Dans les motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, rendu simultan\u00e9ment au pr\u00e9sent arr\u00eat, notre Cour a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 le cadre d\u2019analyse bien \u00e9tabli de l\u2019art. 12 et a donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il s\u2019applique \u00e0 la contestation d\u2019une disposition pr\u00e9voyant une peine minimale obligatoire. Je commence par r\u00e9affirmer bri\u00e8vement ces principes avant de les appliquer au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nA. Le crit\u00e8re permettant de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a violation de l\u2019art. 12\n(1) Le cadre d\u2019analyse\n[34] D\u00e9terminer si les peines minimales obligatoires pour vol qualifi\u00e9 sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es commande une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes. Le tribunal doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour l\u2019infraction eu \u00e9gard aux objectifs et principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tablis par le Code criminel (Hills, par. 40; R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23, par. 63; R. c. Boudreault, 2018 CSC 58, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 599, par. 46; Nur, par. 46). Le tribunal doit ensuite se demander si la disposition contest\u00e9e l\u2019oblige \u00e0 infliger une peine qui est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 la peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e (Hills, par. 40; Bissonnette, par. 63; Nur, par. 46; Smith, p. 1072). Cette \u00e9valuation en deux \u00e9tapes peut se faire en fonction soit (1) de la personne d\u00e9linquante qui compara\u00eet devant le tribunal, comme ce sera le cas de M. Hilbach, soit (2) d\u2019une autre personne d\u00e9linquante dans un cas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, comme l\u2019a propos\u00e9 M. Zwozdesky (Hills, par. 41; Bissonnette, par. 63; Nur, par. 46).\n[35] Aux deux \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse, les tribunaux sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre scrupuleux (Hills, par. 50\u201152). Faire preuve de rigueur analytique \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, et fixer une peine aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que possible, assurent que l\u2019exercice comparatif \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape ne soit pas fauss\u00e9. Dans certains cas, l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e peut \u00eatre plus apparente lorsque la peine juste fix\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u2019est pas de nature carc\u00e9rale \u2014 par exemple, lorsqu\u2019elle aurait comport\u00e9 une probation, plut\u00f4t que l\u2019emprisonnement, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Hills (par. 156). Cependant, le m\u00eame processus de comparaison fond\u00e9 sur des principes s\u2019applique lorsque l\u2019on compare des peines d\u2019emprisonnement afin de d\u00e9terminer si et quand la dur\u00e9e d\u2019une peine carc\u00e9rale devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\n[36] Le cadre de la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 est d\u00e9crit dans le pourvoi connexe Hills \u00e0 partir du par. 122 et comprend l\u2019examen de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, des effets de celle\u2011ci sur la personne d\u00e9linquante et de la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame. Un seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment ou la combinaison de plusieurs d\u2019entre eux peut mener \u00e0 une conclusion qu\u2019il y a disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les peines minimales obligatoires qui visent un \u00e9ventail de comportements dont la gravit\u00e9 et le degr\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante varient sont suspectes sur le plan constitutionnel (Hills, par. 125; Lloyd, par. 24; Boudreault, par. 45; Smith, p. 1078). Plus la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction est large, plus il est probable que la peine minimale obligatoire constitue une peine d\u2019emprisonnement exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e pour des comportements qui ne comportent qu\u2019un faible risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et une culpabilit\u00e9 morale peu \u00e9lev\u00e9e (Hills, par. 125; Nur, par. 83). En pareil cas, la peine minimale risque davantage d\u2019englober des comportements qui sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9s.\n[37] Quant au deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, le tribunal doit \u00e9galement tenir compte des r\u00e9percussions que la peine minimale obligatoire peut avoir sur la personne d\u00e9linquante. Cette analyse requiert l\u2019\u00e9tude des impacts que peut avoir celle-ci sur la personne d\u00e9linquante r\u00e9elle ou raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible \u2014 tant de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques et qualit\u00e9s qui lui sont propres (Hills, par. 133). Les caract\u00e9ristiques de la personne d\u00e9linquante, notamment l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, la race, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge et les facteurs de sant\u00e9 mentale peuvent \u00eatre pertinentes aux fins de cette analyse (Hills, par. 135).\n[38] Le troisi\u00e8me volet exige une analyse du ch\u00e2timent inflig\u00e9 sous forme de peine minimale obligatoire (Hills, par. 138). Le tribunal doit \u00e9valuer la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la peine impos\u00e9e et d\u00e9terminer si la sanction pr\u00e9vue va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00ab compte tenu des objectifs p\u00e9naux l\u00e9gitimes et du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des solutions de rechange possibles \u00bb (Smith, p. 1099\u20111100). Le Parlement peut imposer des peines en fonction de ses objectifs p\u00e9naux, y compris ceux de la d\u00e9nonciation et de la dissuasion, dans le respect des limites fix\u00e9es par la Constitution. Toutefois, aucun objectif particulier de d\u00e9termination de la peine ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres (R. c. Nasogaluak, 2010 CSC 6, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 206, par. 43). La r\u00e9insertion sociale doit faire partie du calcul de toutes les sanctions p\u00e9nales, puisque la sanction qui fait totalement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion est incompatible avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine (Bissonnette, par. 85; Hills, par. 141). Les tribunaux devraient examiner s\u2019il existe des solutions de rechange \u00e0 la peine obligatoire qui r\u00e9pondraient \u00e9galement aux objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine. La peine minimale obligatoire qui ne conf\u00e8re pas au juge le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019infliger une peine autre que l\u2019emprisonnement lorsque cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire sera suspecte sur le plan constitutionnel et n\u00e9cessitera un examen minutieux (Hills, par. 144). Toutes les peines doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9 (R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 32\u201133; Hills, par. 145).\n(2) Les peines minimales obligatoires et les personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones\n[39] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 718.2e) du Code criminel exige l\u2019examen de la situation particuli\u00e8re des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones relativement \u00e0 toutes les infractions lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine (R. c. Gladue, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 688, par. 93; R. c. Ipeelee, 2012 CSC 13, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 84\u201185). Il pr\u00e9voit \u00ab l\u2019examen, plus particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9linquants autochtones, de toutes les sanctions substitutives qui sont raisonnables dans les circonstances \u00bb. Les principes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019examen des rapports Gladue sont \u00e9tablis : ces consid\u00e9rations doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es dans tous les cas o\u00f9 elles sont pertinentes, y compris lorsque l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e est grave. Les juges charg\u00e9s de la d\u00e9termination de la peine doivent tenir compte des facteurs syst\u00e9miques ou contextuels distinctifs qui peuvent avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait que la personne d\u00e9linquante autochtone se retrouve devant les tribunaux, ainsi que des types de proc\u00e9dures de d\u00e9termination de la peine et de sanctions qui, dans les circonstances, peuvent \u00eatre appropri\u00e9es pour cette personne d\u00e9linquante (Ipeelee, par. 59\u201160).\n[40] Certaines parties et certains intervenants ont soulev\u00e9 des questions portant sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 devrait s\u2019inscrire dans l\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, par exemple, a fait valoir que cette caract\u00e9ristique devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme une circonstance att\u00e9nuante [traduction] \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9rique \u00bb qui est exclue du champ des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables. Ces arguments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, o\u00f9 la Cour a conclu que \u00ab l\u2019examen des situations dont il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019elles tombent sous le coup de la loi peut tenir compte des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles des personnes auxquelles pourrait s\u2019appliquer la peine minimale obligatoire \u00bb (par. 76).\n[41] Lorsqu\u2019il entre en jeu, l\u2019al. 718.2e) s\u2019applique \u00e0 trois diff\u00e9rentes parties de l\u2019analyse.\n[42] Premi\u00e8rement, dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12, les tribunaux doivent tenir compte de l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent la peine de la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause. L\u2019omission de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue est une erreur susceptible de mener \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une peine n\u2019est pas indiqu\u00e9e (Ipeelee, par. 86\u201187). Ainsi, lorsque la personne d\u00e9linquante est autochtone, comme M. Hilbach, le tribunal devra n\u00e9cessairement tenir compte des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue afin de fixer une peine qui est juste et proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape.\n[43] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les tribunaux peuvent examiner des situations mettant en cause des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones en \u00e9laborant des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles (Hills, par. 86). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les statistiques sur l\u2019emprisonnement des personnes autochtones, il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019un d\u00e9linquant hypoth\u00e9tique soit autochtone, et la prise en compte de l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique, dans le contexte d\u2019une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable, cadre avec les directives l\u00e9gislatives imp\u00e9ratives donn\u00e9es par le Parlement \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e). Les Autochtones aux prises avec la pauvret\u00e9, une situation pr\u00e9caire en mati\u00e8re de logement ou des d\u00e9ficiences et des d\u00e9pendances comparaissent avec \u00ab une r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 effarante devant nos tribunaux provinciaux \u00bb et il est donc raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019ils commettent une infraction (Boudreault, par. 55).\n[44] Enfin, l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9 est pertinente \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12. Notre Cour affirme depuis longtemps que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la question de savoir si une peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e d\u00e9pend, en partie, du fait qu\u2019elle rend compte d\u2019objectifs p\u00e9naux valables et de principes reconnus en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Boudreault, par. 48; Smith, p. 1072; R. c. Goltz, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 485, p. 500; R. c. Latimer, 2001 CSC 1, [2001] 1 R.C.S. 3, par. 86; Morrisey, par. 28). Le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 718.2e) est au c\u0153ur des principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine au Canada depuis 1999. La m\u00e9thodologie prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e), ainsi que les normes qu\u2019elle incarne, sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments bien \u00e9tablis de notre jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine, tout autant que la parit\u00e9 et la proportionnalit\u00e9. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 718.2e) est n\u00e9cessairement pertinent dans un cadre d\u2019analyse fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019art. 12 qui exige que les tribunaux \u00e9valuent les effets des peines minimales obligatoires \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des normes et objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Qui plus est, comme l\u2019illustre l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault, l\u2019incidence d\u2019une peine sur les objectifs du Parlement pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e) peut justifier l\u2019invalidation d\u2019une peine en application de l\u2019art. 12. Par cons\u00e9quent, rien ne justifie d\u2019exclure la prise en compte de l\u2019al. 718.2e) du Code criminel \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des \u00e9tapes du cadre d\u2019analyse de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[45] Les types de consid\u00e9rations susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9es en application de l\u2019al. 718.2e) dans le cadre de la contestation d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 comprennent, par exemple, la question de savoir si une mesure probatoire aurait autrement \u00e9t\u00e9 une solution de rechange valable \u00e0 l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration en application des principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue ou, comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault, la question de savoir si les effets d\u2019une peine peuvent \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement s\u00e9v\u00e8res lorsque les circonstances touchant les personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones sont prises en compte (par. 94). Notre Cour a reconnu, par exemple, que les personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre plus fortement affect\u00e9es par l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration que les personnes d\u00e9linquantes non autochtones (Gladue, par. 68). Les tribunaux peuvent retenir ces pr\u00e9occupations comme motifs qui \u00e9tayent la conclusion qu\u2019une peine minimale est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit qu\u2019une violation de l\u2019art. 12 demeure un crit\u00e8re exigeant et qu\u2019une peine n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e en raison de la pr\u00e9sence ou de l\u2019absence d\u2019un seul principe de d\u00e9termination de la peine.\n[46] Je me penche maintenant sur les contestations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019art. 12 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Hilbach et M. Zwozdesky.\nB. Application\n[47] J\u2019examine d\u2019abord l\u2019appel de M. Hilbach, o\u00f9 il soutient que le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 en ce qui concerne sa propre situation. Je me pencherai ensuite sur le cas de M. Zwozdesky, qui reconna\u00eet la proportionnalit\u00e9 de la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa situation, mais qui invoque une s\u00e9rie de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques pour contester la disposition pr\u00e9voyant la peine minimale obligatoire.\n(1) Application au cas de M. Hilbach\n[48] La Couronne soutient que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont eu tort de conclure que le sous-al. 344(1)a)(i) \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans le cas de M. Hilbach, car ils ont fait abstraction de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction commise par celui-ci et ont omis de reconna\u00eetre que la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9taient des objectifs p\u00e9naux valables en cons\u00e9quence. Je suis aussi de cet avis. La peine minimale obligatoire \u00e0 laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 M. Hilbach est une sanction s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Toutefois, compte tenu (1) de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction; (2) des effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante; et (3) de la peine elle\u2011m\u00eame, je ne suis pas convaincue que la peine minimale obligatoire satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n(a) Un emprisonnement de trois ans est une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour M. Hilbach\n[49] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont infirm\u00e9 la peine de deux ans moins un jour inflig\u00e9e par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et ont plut\u00f4t conclu qu\u2019un emprisonnement de trois ans \u00e9tait une peine juste pour M. Hilbach. Aucune des parties ne conteste la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel selon laquelle une peine de trois ans est une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour M. Hilbach. Aucune situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance, et nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 en cr\u00e9er une ici. L\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 se fera uniquement en fonction des faits du cas de M. Hilbach.\n[50] En imposant une peine qui \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure d\u2019une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re au point de d\u00e9part pour les infractions de cette nature en Alberta, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a omis de soupeser ad\u00e9quatement la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et les facteurs aggravants consid\u00e9rables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme l\u2019ont affirm\u00e9 les juges majoritaires (aux par. 11 et 46), l\u2019emprisonnement de trois ans \u00e9tait le point de d\u00e9part adopt\u00e9 pour le vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e simple commis dans de petits \u00e9tablissements commerciaux [traduction] \u00ab qui s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par un succ\u00e8s modeste, voire nul \u00bb et \u00ab en l\u2019absence de pr\u00e9judice physique r\u00e9el \u00bb reconnu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnas, par. 19 (je souligne). Outre le fait que l\u2019infraction commise par M. Hilbach comportait l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e, elle a aussi caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice physique, puisque son complice a \u00e9t\u00e9 physiquement violent avec les deux commis du d\u00e9panneur au cours du vol qualifi\u00e9. Qui plus est, M. Hilbach a point\u00e9 sa carabine sur deux employ\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait en probation et faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance d\u2019interdiction au moment de l\u2019infraction. Il a en outre impliqu\u00e9 un adolescent de 13 ans dans un crime violent. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de facteurs aggravants qui pourraient justifier une peine sup\u00e9rieure au point de d\u00e9part \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnas. Bien que j\u2019accepte les facteurs att\u00e9nuants relev\u00e9s par le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, je suis d\u2019accord avec les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel pour dire qu\u2019une peine inf\u00e9rieure d\u2019une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re au point de d\u00e9part \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnas serait manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e.\n(b) Le minimum obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans le cas de M. Hilbach\n[51] Notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que le seuil pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019une peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019art. 12 est \u00e9lev\u00e9 (Lloyd, par. 24). La peine minimale obligatoire ne peut \u00eatre simplement excessive, non indiqu\u00e9e ou disproportionn\u00e9e. Elle doit \u00eatre \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Hills, par. 109, citant Boudreault, par. 45; Lloyd, par. 24, citant Morrisey, par. 26; R. c. Wiles, 2005 CSC 84, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 895, par. 4, citant Smith, p. 1072). Ce n\u2019est que \u00ab tr\u00e8s rarement \u00bb qu\u2019une peine contreviendra \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12, car le crit\u00e8re auquel il faut satisfaire est \u00ab \u00e0 bon droit strict et exigeant \u00bb (Steele c. \u00c9tablissement Mountain, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 1385, p. 1417). Tel que je l\u2019explique plus loin, une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans, bien qu\u2019elle soit s\u00e9v\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle fr\u00f4le la limite, n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Hilbach. La peine minimale en cause n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e large au point d\u2019englober des comportements qui pr\u00e9sentent relativement peu de risque de pr\u00e9judice. Bien que la situation personnelle de M. Hilbach att\u00e9nue quelque peu sa culpabilit\u00e9, les actes qu\u2019il a commis constituent une infraction grave comportant un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9 morale. M\u00eame si les effets de l\u2019emprisonnement sur M. Hilbach, un d\u00e9linquant autochtone, seront s\u00e9rieux, une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de cinq ans dans son cas n\u2019est pas totalement en d\u00e9calage par rapport aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Par cons\u00e9quent, la proportionnalit\u00e9 et la parit\u00e9 ne sont pas compromises comme elles l\u2019\u00e9taient dans les affaires Nur, Lloyd et Hills. Les objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine et sa d\u00e9cision de prioriser la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion sont justifi\u00e9s dans le cas de cette infraction. Il y a donc lieu de faire preuve d\u2019une plus grande retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du choix du Parlement de pr\u00e9voir une peine minimale.\n(i) La port\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction\n[52] Comme notre Cour l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises, les peines minimales obligatoires sont plus vuln\u00e9rables sur le plan constitutionnel lorsqu\u2019elles s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une vaste gamme de circonstances (Nur, par. 81\u201182; Lloyd, par. 3, 24, 27 et 35\u201136). Plus vaste est la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction faisant l\u2019objet de la peine minimale, plus il est probable que la peine minimale imposera une longue peine d\u2019emprisonnement pour un comportement qui pr\u00e9sente peu de risques pour le public et comporte une faible faute morale (Hills, par. 125; Nur, par. 83). Par cons\u00e9quent, le tribunal doit tenir compte du degr\u00e9 variable de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et de la culpabilit\u00e9 en cause et se demander si la peine vise un comportement qui ne justifie pas l\u2019imposition de la peine minimale obligatoire.\n[53] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 ne ratisse pas trop large de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober des comportements qui comportent une faible faute morale ou qui pr\u00e9sentent peu de risques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et la culpabilit\u00e9 des personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui en sont reconnues coupables sont relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9es. D\u2019abord, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il est commis sans arme \u00e0 feu, le vol qualifi\u00e9 est une infraction grave en raison de l\u2019actus reus requis, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le recours ou la menace de recours \u00e0 la violence ou \u00e0 la force lors du vol ou de la tentative de vol de biens. L\u2019ajout d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quation ne fait qu\u2019accro\u00eetre la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction. De plus, la simple possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ne suffit pas pour conclure \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant. Celui\u2011ci doit utiliser l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction. Comme l\u2019a \u00e9crit notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Felawka, [1993] 4 R.C.S. 199, lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu est utilis\u00e9e pour menacer ou intimider, elle \u00ab incarne en soi la menace supr\u00eame de mort aux yeux de ceux qui y font face \u00bb (p. 211). Les armes \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9es comptent parmi les outils les plus puissants dans la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime. Par exemple, les carabines \u00e0 canon tronqu\u00e9 peuvent avoir une force meurtri\u00e8re, tout en \u00e9tant plus faciles \u00e0 dissimuler, \u00e0 transporter et \u00e0 manipuler dans des espaces restreints, comme les d\u00e9panneurs.\n[54] Les cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 sont faciles \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer. Il y a le risque de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de blessures corporelles graves pour les victimes et les passants si l\u2019arme est d\u00e9charg\u00e9e. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de coups de feu, l\u2019exposition \u00e0 cette menace comporte le risque de pr\u00e9judice psychologique profond. On peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les commis de magasin qui sont victimes d\u2019infractions comme celle perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e par M. Hilbach souffrent d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice psychologique. Dans l\u2019affaire R. c. Al\u2011Isawi, 2017 BCCA 163, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 524, l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait servi d\u2019une fausse arme \u00e0 feu pour commettre des vols qualifi\u00e9s dans 10 petites pharmacies et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 10 chefs de vol qualifi\u00e9 en contravention du par. 85(2) du Code criminel . Cinq des victimes avaient fait \u00e9tat de sentiments d\u2019hypervigilance, de traumatisme et de crainte pour leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 personnelle (par. 29). Outre les menaces imm\u00e9diates aux victimes, il existe des risques plus larges pour la collectivit\u00e9. Brandir une arme \u00e0 feu dans un magasin peut raisonnablement provoquer une r\u00e9action de recours \u00e0 la force, soit par les policiers qui interviennent lors du vol qualifi\u00e9 en cours, soit par des passants qui tentent d\u2019intervenir. Par cons\u00e9quent, le risque d\u2019escalade de la violence est aigu.\n[55] L\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e non charg\u00e9e ne r\u00e9duit pas consid\u00e9rablement la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction. La pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, m\u00eame non charg\u00e9e, [traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9e en elle\u2011m\u00eame une situation extr\u00eamement instable et dangereuse \u00bb (Al\u2011Isawi, par. 57 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Une arme \u00e0 feu charg\u00e9e peut facilement \u00eatre confondue avec une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e, notamment par les personnes d\u00e9linquantes elles\u2011m\u00eames. En outre, le fait d\u2019accorder une peine \u00e0 rabais pour avoir brandi une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e ne tient pas compte du risque bien r\u00e9el qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante d\u00e9charge accidentellement une arme \u00e0 feu qu\u2019elle croyait non charg\u00e9e. Il fait \u00e9galement abstraction, pour des raisons pratiques, de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 prouver si l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e ou non, m\u00eame si l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu utilis\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e. Qui plus est, une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e est utilis\u00e9e pour la m\u00eame raison qu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu charg\u00e9e : pour laisser planer \u00ab la menace supr\u00eame de mort aux yeux de ceux qui y font face \u00bb (Felawka, p. 211). Les victimes de vol qualifi\u00e9 ne savent pas si l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu est charg\u00e9e ou non. Il en va de m\u00eame des passants et des policiers qui interviennent lors de vols qualifi\u00e9s (R. c. Stewart, 2010 BCCA 153, 253 C.C.C. (3d) 301, par. 37; R. c. Uniat, 2015 ONCA 197, par. 5 (CanLII)). Que l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu ait une force meurtri\u00e8re au moment de l\u2019infraction ou non, \u00ab [l]\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un crime en exacerbe l\u2019effet terrorisant, que l\u2019arme soit vraie ou fausse. Ce but pr\u00e9cis demeure dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas \u00bb (Steele, par. 23). Par cons\u00e9quent, le traumatisme psychologique associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e est comparable \u00e0 celui associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu charg\u00e9e (R. c. Breese, 2021 ONSC 1611, par. 34 (CanLII); R. c. John, 2016 ONSC 396, par. 27 (CanLII); R. c. Stoddart, [2005] O.J. No. 6076 (QL), 2005 CarswellOnt 6523 (WL) (C.S.J.), par. 6, conf. par 2007 ONCA 139, 221 O.A.C. 108; R. c. Asif, 2020 ONSC 1403, par. 40 (CanLII); R. c. Charley, 2019 ONSC 6490, par. 45 (CanLII)). Il en va de m\u00eame du risque d\u2019escalade de la violence.\n[56] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments moraux requis pour que le minimum s\u2019applique sugg\u00e8rent un degr\u00e9 relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de culpabilit\u00e9. La personne d\u00e9linquante qui commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte doit avoir l\u2019intention de voler et avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00ab utiliser \u00bb la violence ou la force (ou de menacer de le faire). Elle doit faire le choix conscient d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la violence ou \u00e0 la force. Pour que la peine minimale obligatoire s\u2019applique, ce choix s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019utiliser une arme \u00e0 feu en particulier pour commettre l\u2019infraction \u2014 la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019employer l\u2019arme. L\u2019infraction ne consiste pas en une d\u00e9cision prise par inadvertance de mettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public \u00e0 risque, mais en un choix conscient de mettre \u00e0 grand risque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une autre personne.\n[57] L\u2019infraction a une certaine \u00e9tendue. \u00c0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019\u00e9ventail, l\u2019al. 344(1)a) englobe, par exemple, les personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui organisent des vols qualifi\u00e9s complexes et coordonn\u00e9s dans de grandes institutions en utilisant des armes automatiques et qui causent des blessures graves ou la mort. \u00c0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure de l\u2019\u00e9ventail, l\u2019article vise des individus qui, comme M. Hilbach, commettent des vols simples dans des stations\u2011service en utilisant des armes \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9es non charg\u00e9es. Les diff\u00e9rentes peines plus lourdes que la peine minimale refl\u00e8tent bien cette \u00e9chelle de gravit\u00e9 et ces divers degr\u00e9s de culpabilit\u00e9. Toutefois, le fil conducteur qui relie chacun de ces cas est l\u2019intention de voler et de profiter de la terreur profonde qu\u2019inspire la menace d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu brandie \u00e0 courte distance. Dans chaque cas, la personne d\u00e9linquante utilise une arme \u00e0 feu pour susciter la peur chez sa victime afin d\u2019en tirer un avantage. Bien que la situation personnelle de la personne accus\u00e9e et les motivations de son comportement varient, ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments demeurent constants. C\u2019est ce caract\u00e8re particulier du comportement dont parlait le juge Proulx dans l\u2019affaire Lapierre, qui aggrave l\u2019infraction et expose son auteur \u00e0 cette peine minimale (p. 684).\n[58] \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques examin\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, les personnes qui contreviennent \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a) commettent de [traduction] \u00ab vrai[s] crime[s] \u00bb (R. c. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, par. 205\u2011206, conf. par 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773). Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019infraction comporte une culpabilit\u00e9 morale minime, voire nulle, et qui n\u2019expose le public qu\u2019\u00e0 peu voire pas de danger (Nur, par. 82\u201183). Les personnes d\u00e9clar\u00e9es coupables en vertu de cet article ne ressemblent pas \u00e0 l\u2019individu dont il est question dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se propos\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Smith, \u00e0 savoir un jeune surpris en possession de son premier \u00ab joint de mari \u00bb alors qu\u2019il rentre au Canada (p. 1053). \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique invoqu\u00e9e pour invalider la disposition en cause dans l\u2019affaire Hills \u2014 \u00e0 savoir, une situation mettant en cause une jeune personne ayant utilis\u00e9 un fusil de paintball qui ne pouvait pas perforer le mur d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence ordinaire \u2014 il est impossible d\u2019\u00e9liminer le caract\u00e8re imm\u00e9diat de la menace personnelle qui est inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019infraction. La nature et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction exigent la pr\u00e9sence de victimes. Dans les faits, il y a deux victimes r\u00e9elles de l\u2019infraction commise par M. Hilbach. Pour cette raison, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette peine minimale obligatoire est si large qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 des situations qui posent un risque relativement faible de pr\u00e9judice (comme dans les affaires Smith, Nur, Lloyd ou Hills).\n(ii) Les effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante\n[59] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment exige que les tribunaux examinent les effets de la peine obligatoire sur la personne d\u00e9linquante en cause. Si elle a pour effet d\u2019infliger \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9linquante des douleurs et des souffrances psychologiques au moyen d\u2019une peine ou d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9gradant et d\u00e9shumanisant, la peine est vuln\u00e9rable sur le plan constitutionnel dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante (Hills, par. 133; Qu\u00e9bec (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) c. 9147\u20110732 Qu\u00e9bec inc., 2020 CSC 32, par. 51).\n[60] Pour \u00e9valuer les effets \u2014 et donc les r\u00e9percussions \u2014 qui d\u00e9coulent de la peine prescrite sur la personne d\u00e9linquante r\u00e9elle ou hypoth\u00e9tique, le tribunal doit tenir compte des ann\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019emprisonnement impos\u00e9es par la peine minimale obligatoire. Toutefois, l\u2019art. 12 suppose une analyse contextuelle et il n\u2019y aucun nombre pr\u00e9cis au\u2011del\u00e0 ou en de\u00e7\u00e0 duquel une peine devient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Le tribunal peut tenir compte des conditions de d\u00e9tention de la personne d\u00e9linquante dans lesquelles elle purgera la peine obligatoire, y compris la question de savoir si la peine minimale obligatoire substitue l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 une mesure probatoire, ainsi que toute caract\u00e9ristique ou circonstance qui accro\u00eet la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la peine dans le cas de la personne d\u00e9linquante (Hills, par. 133). Il convient de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que l\u2019accent est mis sur la peine, et non sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des effets de la peine minimale (Hills, par. 104, citant Bissonnette, par. 37 et 41, et Nur, par. 98).\n[61] Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a relev\u00e9 deux effets importants. \u00c0 cinq ans, la peine minimale obligatoire \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 plus du double d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. De plus, la peine \u00e9tait pire sur le plan qualitatif, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle devait \u00eatre purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier.\n[62] J\u2019accepte la conclusion du juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine selon laquelle les effets de la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans sont [traduction] \u00ab s\u00e9v\u00e8res \u00bb dans le cas de M. Hilbach. Une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de cinq ans aurait des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9fastes sur la r\u00e9insertion sociale de M. Hilbach, au regard de la conclusion du juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine selon laquelle une peine purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier accroissait la probabilit\u00e9 que M. Hilbach r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le milieu des gangs. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans est relativement plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re et, comme pour bon nombre de personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones, la peine sera plus difficile pour M. Hilbach en cons\u00e9quence (Gladue, par. 68). Les personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones sont plus durement touch\u00e9es par l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et sont souvent trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans les milieux carc\u00e9raux. Les Autochtones sont plus susceptibles de subir des incidents de recours \u00e0 la force dans des p\u00e9nitenciers f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et ont un acc\u00e8s limit\u00e9 \u00e0 des programmes adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 leur culture (Bureau de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur correctionnel, Rapport annuel 2021\u20112022 (2022)). De plus, l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration elle\u2011m\u00eame est souvent une fa\u00e7on culturellement inappropri\u00e9e de sanctionner les actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles commis par des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones (Gladue, par. 68).\n[63] En d\u00e9finitive, ces consid\u00e9rations soutiennent la conclusion selon laquelle une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e se situerait en de\u00e7\u00e0 de la peine minimale obligatoire, malgr\u00e9 la violence grave que comporte l\u2019infraction qu\u2019il a commise. Appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e d\u2019un point de vue purement quantitatif, la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement qui d\u00e9passe une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e n\u2019est pas n\u00e9gligeable. De fait, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lloyd, notre Cour a invalid\u00e9 une peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019un an d\u2019emprisonnement (par. 6). Personne ne se porterait raisonnablement volontaire pour une ou deux ann\u00e9es de plus en prison que ce qu\u2019un juge consid\u00e8re comme juste, puisque de telles p\u00e9riodes additionnelles d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration donneraient lieu \u00e0 de grandes difficult\u00e9s pour la personne d\u00e9linquante et ses proches. Ces effets doivent donc avoir beaucoup de poids.\n(iii) La peine et ses objectifs\n[64] Dans ce volet, les tribunaux doivent d\u2019abord examiner quels objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine le Parlement a prioris\u00e9s en adoptant la peine minimale obligatoire et, ensuite, se demander si la peine minimale va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au Parlement d\u2019atteindre ses objectifs (Hills, par. 138). La d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion sont des principes reconnus de d\u00e9termination de la peine que le Parlement peut utiliser pour exprimer la d\u00e9sapprobation de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des infractions graves (Hills, par. 139). Bien que les formes de punitions qui font totalement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion sociale soient incompatibles avec la dignit\u00e9 humaine et violent l\u2019art. 12 (Bissonnette, par. 85), aucun objectif de d\u00e9termination de la peine ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tous les autres (Nasogaluak, par. 43).\n[65] D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019il n\u2019exclut pas compl\u00e8tement la r\u00e9insertion sociale de son calcul, le Parlement peut prioriser \u00e0 juste titre certains objectifs, comme la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019autres lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tablit une peine minimale. Les peines exemplaires repr\u00e9sentent \u00ab une d\u00e9claration collective [. . .] que la conduite du contrevenant doit \u00eatre punie parce qu\u2019elle a port\u00e9 atteinte au code des valeurs fondamentales de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (R. c. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 R.C.S. 500, par. 81). Lorsque les cons\u00e9quences des infractions contreviennent manifestement au \u00ab code des valeurs fondamentales \u00bb de la population canadienne et commandent une forte condamnation, notre Cour fait preuve d\u2019une plus grande d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers le Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9dicte une peine minimale obligatoire qui priorise la d\u00e9nonciation (Hills, par. 139, citant Morrisey, par. 47). Le besoin de d\u00e9nonciation est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (Hills, par. 139, citant Ipeelee, par. 37). De m\u00eame, bien que la dissuasion \u00e0 elle seule ne puisse emp\u00eacher une peine minimale obligatoire d\u2019\u00eatre cruelle et inusit\u00e9e, elle peut \u00ab justifier l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine qui, quoique s\u00e9v\u00e8re, se situe \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la fourchette des peines qui ne sont pas cruelles et inusit\u00e9es \u00bb (Morrisey, par. 45).\n[66] Cela dit, la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation ne sauraient \u00eatre prioris\u00e9es \u00e0 tout prix. Une telle approche justifierait des peines d\u2019une dur\u00e9e illimit\u00e9e (Hills, par. 140). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9valuent l\u2019objectif p\u00e9nal valable de la peine minimale obligatoire et son respect des objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine, les tribunaux devraient prendre en consid\u00e9ration la mesure dans laquelle la peine contest\u00e9e adh\u00e8re aux principes de proportionnalit\u00e9 et de parit\u00e9 (Hills, par. 145).\n[67] La parit\u00e9 exige \u00ab l\u2019infliction de peines semblables \u00e0 celles inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9linquants pour des infractions semblables commises dans des circonstances semblables \u00bb (al. 718.2b)). Les fourchettes de peines et les points de d\u00e9part sont des outils utiles dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la proportionnalit\u00e9 et de la parit\u00e9, car ils refl\u00e8tent un consensus judiciaire sur la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une infraction et aident \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les \u00e9carts substantiels entre les peines inflig\u00e9es (R. c. Parranto, 2021 CSC 46, par. 20, citant R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089, par. 2). Les peines minimales obligatoires, de m\u00eame que la fourchette de peines \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le Parlement pour des infractions semblables, peuvent elles aussi \u00eatre utiles dans cette analyse.\n[68] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a reconnu que m\u00eame si la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation sont des consid\u00e9rations importantes, la peine minimale obligatoire accorde beaucoup trop d\u2019importance \u00e0 ces objectifs par rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale et aux facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9taient du m\u00eame avis, faisant une analogie avec les suramendes compensatoires dont il \u00e9tait question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault.\n[69] Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont eu tort de conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun objectif p\u00e9nal valable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La peine minimale obligatoire est en soi davantage ax\u00e9e sur la dissuasion, la d\u00e9nonciation et le ch\u00e2timent que sur la r\u00e9insertion sociale et d\u2019autres objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Nur, par. 44). Par cons\u00e9quent, la question ne se limite pas \u00e0 savoir si la peine minimale priorise ces objectifs. Les tribunaux devraient plut\u00f4t se demander si la mesure dans laquelle le Parlement a choisi de prioriser la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9tabli la peine est justifi\u00e9e. Dans le cas de M. Hilbach, la d\u00e9cision du Parlement de prioriser la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion est justifiable.\n[70] Comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9, le besoin de d\u00e9nonciation est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de communiquer le fait que notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 condamne les actes qui portent atteinte \u00e0 nos valeurs morales fondamentales (M. (C.A.), par. 81; Ipeelee, par. 37). Il convient de faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9dicte des peines minimales obligatoires exemplaires dans les cas o\u00f9 la conduite, comme le vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e, porte manifestement atteinte \u00e0 nos valeurs les plus fondamentales.\n[71] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, la peine minimale obligatoire vise une conduite qui justifie manifestement la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation vigoureuse qu\u2019indique une lourde peine d\u2019emprisonnement. Comme l\u2019a reconnu le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion \u00e9taient des consid\u00e9rations [traduction] \u00ab importantes \u00bb dans le cas de M. Hilbach, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction (par. 20). L\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte lors de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un risque grave pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morrisey, le Parlement peut \u00e9dicter des peines minimales obligatoires qui indiquent que l\u2019insouciance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la vie et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui dans la manipulation d\u2019armes \u00e0 feu n\u2019est \u00ab tout simplement pas acceptable \u00bb (par. 47 (soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)). Par cons\u00e9quent, la peine minimale obligatoire s\u2019applique \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie de comportements qui commandent une forte condamnation.\n[72] La dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme l\u2019a reconnu notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morrisey, \u00ab [l]e besoin de dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne saurait \u00eatre contest\u00e9 \u00bb lorsqu\u2019une personne met en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en brandissant une arme \u00e0 feu (par. 46). \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la peine obligatoire minimale dans cette affaire, la peine minimale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00ab exige que les personnes qui ont une arme \u00e0 feu dans les mains fassent preuve de prudence en la manipulant \u00bb (Morrisey, par. 46). Bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith indique qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas vraiment n\u00e9cessaire de punir le \u00ab petit \u00bb d\u00e9linquant pour dissuader l\u2019auteur d\u2019infractions graves (\u00e0 la p. 1080), il n\u2019y a pas de \u00ab petits \u00bb d\u00e9linquants dans la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019entendait notre Cour dans les arr\u00eats Nur, Smith et Lloyd. Les gestes de M. Hilbach, par exemple, correspondent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 la conduite que le Parlement voulait dissuader. Par cons\u00e9quent, la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut justifier une peine qui est plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re mais qui se situe tout de m\u00eame dans l\u2019\u00e9ventail des peines qui ne sont pas cruelles et inusit\u00e9es (Morrisey, par. 45; Nur, par. 45).\n[73] Ma conclusion selon laquelle le Parlement pouvait prioriser la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine portant sur le vol qualifi\u00e9, qui confirme l\u2019importance de ces objectifs dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine pour cette infraction (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10e \u00e9d. 2020), \u00a723.494). Elle est \u00e9galement compatible avec l\u2019importance accrue qu\u2019accordent les tribunaux \u00e0 ces objectifs dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu est utilis\u00e9e pour commettre des actes de violence interpersonnelle (voir, p. ex., R. c. Jones, 2012 ONCA 609, par. 12 (CanLII); R. c. Maytwayashing, 2018 MBCA 36, par. 40 (CanLII); R. c. Agin, 2018 BCCA 133, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 258, par. 67; R. c. D. (Q.) (2005), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (C.A. Ont.), par. 78; R. c. Marshall, 2015 ONCA 692, 340 O.A.C. 201, par. 49; R. c. Bellissimo, 2009 ONCA 49, par. 5 (CanLII); R. c. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745, 277 O.A.C. 233, par. 13\u201114). Dans ce contexte, les tribunaux ont insist\u00e9 sur le besoin de d\u00e9nonciation et de dissuasion, \u00e0 la fois pour signifier l\u2019aversion de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la violence li\u00e9e aux armes \u00e0 feu et pour communiquer aux d\u00e9linquants \u00e9ventuels qu\u2019une peine importante accompagne l\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pour commettre des actes de violence (D. (Q.), par. 77\u201178; Jones, par. 12; R. c. Mark, 2018 ONSC 447, par. 24 (CanLII); R. c. Thavakularatnam, 2018 ONSC 2380, par. 21 (CanLII)).\n[74] Dans le cas de d\u00e9linquants comme M. Hilbach, dont la culpabilit\u00e9 morale est r\u00e9duite en raison, par exemple, de retards de d\u00e9veloppement ou d\u2019un trouble li\u00e9 \u00e0 la consommation d\u2019une substance, la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans peut exc\u00e9der ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs du Parlement en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Hills, par. 138). Dans le cas de M. Hilbach, une peine de d\u00e9tention minimale de cinq ans est une sanction s\u00e9v\u00e8re compte tenu de sa situation personnelle.\n[75] N\u00e9anmoins, le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine n\u2019a pas tenu compte du fait que la pr\u00e9sente affaire se distingue des affaires Nur, Smith et Lloyd dans la mesure o\u00f9 une lourde peine d\u2019emprisonnement est une peine proportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Hilbach. En effet, comme je l\u2019ai fait remarquer, la d\u00e9fense ne conteste pas le fait que l\u2019emprisonnement de trois ans est une peine juste. Par cons\u00e9quent, contrairement aux affaires Nur, Smith et Lloyd, la peine minimale obligatoire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019impose pas une longue peine d\u2019emprisonnement, la sanction \u00ab de dernier recours \u00bb, lorsqu\u2019une telle peine ne serait pas par ailleurs possible, ou m\u00eame courante. Les peines minimales obligatoires sont n\u00e9cessairement plus vuln\u00e9rables lorsqu\u2019elles remplacent une peine de probation par de longues p\u00e9riodes d\u2019emprisonnement. Bien qu\u2019il demeure n\u00e9anmoins important de comparer deux peines comportant de longues p\u00e9riodes d\u2019emprisonnement, il peut \u00eatre plus difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente situation que dans celles en cause dans les affaires Nur et Lloyd.\n[76] La peine minimale obligatoire pour vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte dans le cas de M. Hilbach ne d\u00e9roge pas totalement aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour une infraction de cette nature. Tout d\u2019abord, les peines inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 deux ans d\u2019emprisonnement sont relativement rares en cas de vol qualifi\u00e9, qui n\u2019emporte pas de peine minimale obligatoire lorsqu\u2019il est commis sans arme ou avec une arme autre qu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu (Ruby, \u00a723.498). Lorsqu\u2019une arme (autre qu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu) est utilis\u00e9e pour la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement commercial, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la limite inf\u00e9rieure se situe dans la fourchette d\u2019un an ou deux, l\u2019\u00e9chelon du milieu se situant entre trois et cinq ans et la limite sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tant d\u2019environ huit ans (Ruby, \u00a7\u00a723.521, 23.528 et 23.532). M\u00eame sans peine minimale obligatoire, la fourchette de peines pour vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte serait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, car l\u2019usage d\u2019une arme aussi dangereuse repr\u00e9sente un facteur aggravant. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que l\u2019on puisse soutenir qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la peine \u00e0 laquelle M. Hilbach serait condamn\u00e9 et \u00e0 la limite inf\u00e9rieure qui serait probablement \u00e9tablie par ailleurs, la peine minimale ne d\u00e9passe pas de beaucoup ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Parlement atteigne ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine.\n[77] Par cons\u00e9quent, le cas de M. Hilbach ne d\u00e9montre pas que la peine minimale obligatoire d\u00e9roge au principe de parit\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame mesure que les peines minimales dans les affaires Smith, Nur, Lloyd et Hills. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, de lourdes peines d\u2019emprisonnement de plusieurs ann\u00e9es sont la norme pour cette infraction. Cela permet de distinguer la pr\u00e9sente affaire de l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, o\u00f9 la peine minimale obligatoire en cause imposait des peines d\u2019emprisonnement de trois ans pour ce qui \u00e9tait essentiellement des infractions r\u00e9glementaires, un r\u00e9sultat qui \u00ab d\u00e9roge[ait] totalement \u00bb aux pratiques de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour de telles infractions (par. 83). On ne peut affirmer que, comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nur, il y a une [traduction] \u00ab discordance totale \u00bb entre le minimum obligatoire et le comportement de M. Hilbach (par. 83). Compte tenu du lien entre la parit\u00e9 et la proportionnalit\u00e9, ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de appuie la conclusion selon laquelle la peine minimale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e.\n[78] En outre, la peine minimale obligatoire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement analogue aux suramendes compensatoires obligatoires examin\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault. Dans cette affaire, les suramendes compensatoires obligatoires avaient pour objectifs p\u00e9naux de recueillir des fonds pour les services aux victimes et d\u2019accro\u00eetre la responsabilisation des personnes d\u00e9linquantes envers les victimes et la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (par. 62). Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre de ces objectifs p\u00e9naux n\u2019\u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre atteints dans le cas de personnes d\u00e9linquantes imp\u00e9cunieuses ou d\u00e9munies, qui \u00e9taient sans le sou (par. 63). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas improbable que les objectifs p\u00e9naux associ\u00e9s au minimum obligatoire soient atteints, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le comportement de M. Hilbach correspond pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que le Parlement entendait d\u00e9noncer et dissuader. Qui plus est, la proportionnalit\u00e9 et la parit\u00e9 \u00e9taient compromises dans une plus grande mesure dans l\u2019affaire Boudreault, car les suramendes imposaient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des peines d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 des personnes d\u00e9linquantes imp\u00e9cunieuses, bien que de telles sanctions soient r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux pires personnes d\u00e9linquantes du Canada (par. 79). Le minimum en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019harmonise davantage avec les normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour une infraction de cette nature.\n[79] Cela dit, comme dans l\u2019affaire Boudreault, la peine minimale ne contribue pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019intention du Parlement de r\u00e9soudre le grave probl\u00e8me de la surrepr\u00e9sentation des Autochtones en prison, consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e). Elle ne favorise pas non plus l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9insertion sociale. Une peine qui nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Hilbach d\u2019\u00e9viter la vie de gang, et qui accro\u00eet la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il r\u00e9cidive en cons\u00e9quence, ne favorise pas la r\u00e9insertion sociale. Bien que la peine minimale ne contribue peut\u2011\u00eatre pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale de M. Hilbach, je ne crois pas que la peine minimale fait compl\u00e8tement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion sociale en tant que principe de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Hills, par. 34). Le Parlement n\u2019a pas choisi une peine minimale qui priorise la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de la r\u00e9insertion sociale dans le cas de M. Hilbach.\n[80] M\u00eame en examinant ses effets sous l\u2019angle de l\u2019al. 718.2e), je suis incapable de conclure que la peine minimale va au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Parlement atteigne ses objectifs au point o\u00f9 elle fait totalement abstraction de la r\u00e9insertion sociale et porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Comme je l\u2019ai fait remarquer, le Parlement \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de prioriser la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion plut\u00f4t que la r\u00e9insertion sociale, vu la nature de cette infraction. Qui plus est, bien que la peine minimale s\u2019\u00e9carte des principes de parit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9 dans le cas de M. Hilbach, il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte pas une peine qui est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e par rapport aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour cette infraction.\n[81] Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re que la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est \u00e9valu\u00e9e selon un seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 : la peine doit \u00eatre \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Hills, par. 109, citant Boudreault, par. 45; Lloyd, par. 24, citant Morrisey, par. 26; Wiles, par. 4, citant Smith, p. 1072). Ce n\u2019est que \u00ab tr\u00e8s rarement \u00bb que l\u2019on peut qualifier ainsi une peine, puisque la norme est \u00ab \u00e0 bon droit strict[e] et exigeant[e] \u00bb et cens\u00e9e exprimer une certaine d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Parlement lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9labore des dispositions en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de la peine (Hills, par. 115, citant Steele c. \u00c9tablissement Mountain, p. 1417). La norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019art. 12 n\u2019exige pas que les peines soient \u00ab parfaitement adapt\u00e9es aux nuances morales qui caract\u00e9risent chaque crime et chaque d\u00e9linquant \u00bb (R. c. Lyons, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 309, p. 344\u2011345). La diff\u00e9rence entre la peine minimale obligatoire et la situation particuli\u00e8re de M. Hilbach ne \u00ab port[e pas] atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb. Conclure que la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans la situation de M. Hilbach saperait la norme \u00e9lev\u00e9e au c\u0153ur de la jurisprudence de notre Cour portant sur l\u2019art. 12.\n[82] Pour ces motifs, la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans prescrite au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Puisque M. Hilbach ne propose pas de situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles o\u00f9 le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9, je passe maintenant \u00e0 la contestation de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Zwozdesky.\n(2) Application au cas de M. Zwozdesky\n[83] Les amici curiae pour M. Zwozdesky conc\u00e8dent que la peine minimale obligatoire contest\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans son cas. Ils pr\u00e9sentent plut\u00f4t cinq situations o\u00f9, soutiennent\u2011ils, la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. La Couronne fait valoir que plusieurs de ces situations ne sont pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, elles ne d\u00e9montrent pas que le minimum est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. Au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions, la Couronne s\u2019appuie sur les m\u00eames pr\u00e9occupations que celles qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve dans le cas de M. Hilbach, invoquant la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et le besoin connexe de d\u00e9nonciation et de dissuasion.\n[84] Les situations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les amici font \u00e9tat de circonstances qui ne sont pas abord\u00e9es dans le cas de M. Hilbach, y compris la responsabilit\u00e9 des parties, les vols qualifi\u00e9s non planifi\u00e9s ou impulsifs et l\u2019usage d\u2019armes \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9. Bien que ces circonstances comportent un degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 et de culpabilit\u00e9 moindres par rapport au cas de M. Hilbach, elles sont insuffisantes pour \u00e9tablir que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. Le Parlement peut \u00e0 juste titre prioriser la dissuasion et la d\u00e9nonciation dans ces circonstances \u00e9galement et, comme dans le cas de M. Hilbach, celles\u2011ci ne d\u00e9montrent pas qu\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans pour vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu d\u00e9roge totalement aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine. Je me penche d\u2019abord sur les situations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les amici de M. Zwozdesky.\n(a) Quelles situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles font intervenir la disposition pr\u00e9voyant la peine minimale obligatoire contest\u00e9e?\n[85] Les amici pr\u00e9sentent cinq situations d\u00e9taill\u00e9es o\u00f9 le minimum obligatoire serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9. Dans chaque situation, la personne d\u00e9linquante a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 une infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu. Les situations sont les suivantes :\n(1) \u00c9ric, un chasseur \u00ab cr\u00e9tin \u00bb \u00e2g\u00e9 de 18 ans, affronte deux autres chasseurs en train de d\u00e9pecer un cerf sur son terrain, qu\u2019il soup\u00e7onne de braconnage sur la foi de \u00ab potins de la ville \u00bb \u00e0 propos d\u2019un des chasseurs. Les intrus ont des vignettes pour le cerf. \u00c9ric l\u00e8ve sa carabine en direction des chasseurs, sans toutefois les viser directement. Les deux chasseurs choisissent de laisser le cerf et \u00c9ric finit de le d\u00e9pecer et l\u2019apporte chez lui.\n(2) Danielle, une jeune toxicomane de la rue \u00e2g\u00e9e de 19 ans, est victime de traite en vue du commerce du sexe par son petit ami. Celui\u2011ci porte une arme \u00e0 feu \u2014 elle le sait, car il l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment utilis\u00e9e pour la menacer. Ils d\u00e9cident de voler \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9talage du fromage et des rasoirs dans une \u00e9picerie. Lorsqu\u2019ils sont intercept\u00e9s par un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, Danielle crie : \u00ab D\u00e9gagez de notre chemin \u2014 il a un fusil! \u00bb. Le fusil n\u2019est pas montr\u00e9, mais les policiers le trouvent \u00e0 la ceinture du petit ami lorsque le couple est arr\u00eat\u00e9 par la suite.\n(3) Chahid, un jeune de 19 ans r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 d\u2019un pays en guerre, a des difficult\u00e9s d\u2019apprentissage et souffre d\u2019un syndrome de stress post\u2011traumatique. Lors d\u2019une promenade \u00e0 pied, son ami s\u2019approche de deux personnes \u00e0 un arr\u00eat d\u2019autobus, il leur fait voir qu\u2019il a une arme de poing \u00e0 la ceinture et les somme de lui remettre leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, ce qu\u2019ils font. Chahid ignorait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment que son ami avait une arme \u00e0 feu et il ignorait aussi que celui-ci avait planifi\u00e9 un vol qualifi\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, il [traduction] \u00ab fait nerveusement le guet \u00bb. Il se trouve que des policiers sont \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 et s\u2019appr\u00eatent \u00e0 intervenir. Chahid dit \u00e0 son ami de s\u2019enfuir, mais les deux sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s. Lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine, Chahid a termin\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes secondaires, il est inscrit dans un programme postsecondaire de formation professionnelle et il subvient \u00e0 ses besoins en effectuant des travaux manuels. Une peine de plus de six mois le mettrait \u00e0 risque d\u2019expulsion. Il plaide coupable \u00e0 titre de participant \u00e0 l\u2019infraction.\n(4) Brian, un Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9 de 21 ans qui souffre d\u2019alcoolisme et est atteint de l\u2019ensemble des troubles caus\u00e9s par l\u2019alcoolisation f\u0153tale, se trouve dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eame et est couch\u00e9 face contre terre dans un banc de neige lorsqu\u2019une bonne samaritaine s\u2019arr\u00eate pour l\u2019aider. Il empoigne la femme, met la main \u00e0 sa propre ceinture pour lui faire voir une arme \u00e0 balles BB et saisit le sac \u00e0 main de celle\u2011ci. L\u2019arme \u00e0 balles BB fonctionne et est susceptible de crever un \u0153il, mais elle n\u2019est pas charg\u00e9e.\n(5) Adam, un Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9 de 26 ans, souffre de toxicomanie et de schizophr\u00e9nie et a un casier judiciaire peu charg\u00e9. Lors d\u2019une rencontre avec son trafiquant de drogue dans un stationnement, il sort un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, le pointe en direction de son trafiquant et prend quelques comprim\u00e9s de m\u00e9thamph\u00e9tamine. Avant la d\u00e9termination de la peine, il re\u00e7oit un traitement pour la schizophr\u00e9nie et sa toxicomanie.\n[86] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu que parmi les cinq situations, les cas d\u2019Adam et de Brian \u00e9taient des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles pour l\u2019application d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 12 et que les autres ne l\u2019\u00e9taient pas. Je suis aussi de cet avis. Le cas de Brian s\u2019inspire d\u2019un d\u00e9linquant \u00ab v\u00e9ritable \u00bb, dont les faits sont relat\u00e9s dans le jugement R. c. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266. Pour ce qui est d\u2019Adam, le vol qualifi\u00e9 commis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un trafiquant de drogue est une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Que cette infraction soit commise par une personne souffrant de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et de toxicomanie est manifestement pr\u00e9visible. Bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre relativement peu courant d\u2019utiliser un pistolet \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 pour commettre cette infraction, ces armes sont sans aucun doute utilis\u00e9es dans les vols qualifi\u00e9s (voir, par exemple, R. c. Lodoen, instruit en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Johnas).\n[87] Les situations mettant en cause \u00c9ric, Danielle et Chahid ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables. Comme leur nom l\u2019indique, les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles sont des situations dont on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles se produisent, selon le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire (Nur, par. 74). Voici les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, par. 77 :\n(i) L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se doit \u00eatre raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible;\n(ii) Les cas r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019analyse;\n(iii) La situation hypoth\u00e9tique doit \u00eatre raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des actes vis\u00e9s par l\u2019infraction en question;\n(iv) Les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles peuvent \u00eatre prises en compte pourvu qu\u2019elles ne soient pas adapt\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er des exemples invraisemblables ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce;\n(v) Le processus accusatoire est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve les hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables.\n[88] Comme l\u2019a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, il ne faut pas que les situations hypoth\u00e9tiques raisonnables soient \u00ab invraisemblables ou difficilement imaginables \u00bb, ni des \u00ab exemples extr\u00eames ou n\u2019ayant qu\u2019un faible rapport avec l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (Hills, par. 78, citant Morrisey, par. 30, citant Goltz, p. 506 et 515). Les caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles comme l\u2019\u00e2ge, l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et la d\u00e9pendance sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinentes, car elles sont communes aux personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui se retrouvent devant les tribunaux canadiens. Toutefois, il faut se garder d\u2019utiliser ces caract\u00e9ristiques pour constituer une personne d\u00e9linquante le plus sympathique possible (Hills, par. 91; Nur, par. 75). Selon le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience judiciaire, les personnes d\u00e9linquantes qui n\u2019ont que des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles att\u00e9nuantes sont rares et il est encore plus improbable de voir de telles personnes d\u00e9linquantes dans les situations les plus improbables relevant de la port\u00e9e d\u2019une infraction. Superposer les facteurs att\u00e9nuants et forcer le sens de chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif d\u2019une infraction produisent une situation hypoth\u00e9tique qui est fantaisiste et non raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible (Hills, par. 91). Les tribunaux ne sont pas tenus de se pencher sur chacune des hypoth\u00e8ses pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les avocats s\u2019ils estiment que certaines ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des situations \u00ab raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles \u00bb.\n[89] Bien que relevant en th\u00e9orie de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1), la situation d\u2019\u00c9ric est invraisemblable et constitue un cas limite. Quant \u00e0 Chahid, sa situation satisfait tout juste au crit\u00e8re d\u2019une personne qui a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une infraction ou qui l\u2019a encourag\u00e9e en application du par. 21(1) du Code criminel et force le sens des \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs de l\u2019infraction (R. c. Briscoe, 2010 CSC 13, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 411, par. 18). Cette situation implique un comportement qui ne tomberait probablement pas sous le coup de la disposition. Dans l\u2019affaire Hills, la Cour a conclu que, bien qu\u2019on puisse \u00e9tudier la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction pour en d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue, il n\u2019est pas utile de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif de l\u2019infraction (par. 83). Les situations mettant en cause Danielle et Chahid superposent de multiples caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles att\u00e9nuantes et les cas d\u2019application les plus inusit\u00e9s de l\u2019infraction afin de cr\u00e9er la \u00ab personne d\u00e9linquante la plus sympathique \u00bb. Ces situations hypoth\u00e9tiques servent davantage \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer \u00ab l\u2019imagination des avocats \u00bb qu\u2019\u00e0 cerner la v\u00e9ritable port\u00e9e de la disposition (Hills, par. 83). Il n\u2019est gu\u00e8re utile d\u2019\u00e9valuer la disposition contest\u00e9e en fonction de situations farfelues reposant sur l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle les situations imagin\u00e9es pourraient se produire un jour. Par cons\u00e9quent, les situations impliquant \u00c9ric, Danielle et Chahid ne sont pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles.\n[90] Les juges majoritaires ont \u00e9galement conclu que deux situations hypoth\u00e9tiques tir\u00e9es de d\u00e9cisions publi\u00e9es, R. c. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, et Lodoen, \u00e9taient raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Les deux affaires portaient sur de jeunes d\u00e9linquants impliqu\u00e9s dans des vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs. L\u2019affaire Link concernait une Autochtone \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 ans, qui avait plaid\u00e9 coupable en tant que participante \u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur, o\u00f9 l\u2019auteur principal de l\u2019infraction avait utilis\u00e9 une fausse arme \u00e0 feu (par. 1 et 7\u201122). Le d\u00e9linquant dans l\u2019affaire Lodoen \u00e9tait un jeune \u00e2g\u00e9 de 18 ans qui avait utilis\u00e9 un fusil \u00e0 balles BB pour perp\u00e9trer un vol qualifi\u00e9 et qui a plaid\u00e9 coupable (Johnas, par. 68). Ni l\u2019affaire Link ni l\u2019affaire Lodoen ne mettaient en cause la peine minimale dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je reconnais qu\u2019elles sont pr\u00e9visibles, pourvu qu\u2019elles soient modifi\u00e9es pour relever de la port\u00e9e des peines minimales.\n(b) Une peine de deux ans \u00e0 deux ans et demi d\u2019emprisonnement est une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles\n[91] Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne aux peines justes et proportionn\u00e9es pour Adam, Brian et les personnes d\u00e9linquantes dans les situations qui s\u2019inspirent des affaires Link et Lodoen. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu qu\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles indiqu\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t serait un emprisonnement d\u2019environ deux ans (par. 70). Ni la Couronne ni la d\u00e9fense ne contestent la conclusion des juges majoritaires sur ce point. Pour ma part, je ne vois pas non plus de raison d\u2019intervenir.\n[92] Les infractions commises par Adam et Brian comportaient des vols impliquant de la violence dans la rue, une infraction dont la fourchette de peines est d\u2019environ 12 \u00e0 18 mois. Bien entendu, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme, en particulier une arme \u00e0 feu, est un facteur aggravant dans chaque cas. L\u2019infraction commise par Brian comportait aussi l\u2019emploi de la force envers la victime, tandis que dans le cas d\u2019Adam, l\u2019infraction comportait un degr\u00e9 plus important de planification. Il avait aussi un casier judiciaire. Qui plus est, dans le cas d\u2019Adam, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pour r\u00e9gler une dispute li\u00e9e \u00e0 la drogue pr\u00e9sente un risque grave pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, une consid\u00e9ration qui justifie une lourde peine (R. c. Delchev, 2014 ONCA 448, 323 O.A.C. 19, par. 20). Cela pourrait justifier des peines qui d\u00e9passent consid\u00e9rablement cette fourchette. N\u00e9anmoins, la culpabilit\u00e9 morale des deux d\u00e9linquants est att\u00e9nu\u00e9e en raison des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et de d\u00e9pendance qui sous\u2011tendaient leurs gestes, ainsi que de tout facteur applicable \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conviens qu\u2019une peine d\u2019environ deux ans serait juste et proportionn\u00e9e dans ces cas.\n[93] Les situations qui s\u2019inspirent des affaires Link et Lodoen justifieraient de fa\u00e7on similaire des peines d\u2019environ 18 mois \u00e0 2 ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Il s\u2019agit dans les deux cas de vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs impliquant de jeunes d\u00e9linquants qui en \u00e9taient \u00e0 leur premi\u00e8re infraction, de sorte que le point de d\u00e9part de trois ans \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnas s\u2019applique. Alors que la d\u00e9linquante dans l\u2019affaire Link s\u2019\u00e9tait vu infliger une peine avec sursis de 18 mois, l\u2019infraction comportait l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une fausse arme \u00e0 feu (par. 120). Qui plus est, la juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu qu\u2019aucune faute ne pouvait \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9e dans l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu, car cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab boulevers\u00e9e et surprise quand une arme a \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 117). Une peine d\u2019emprisonnement aurait donc \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e si Mme Link avait pris part au vol qualifi\u00e9 sachant qu\u2019une v\u00e9ritable arme \u00e0 feu serait utilis\u00e9e. L\u2019affaire Lodoen s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par une peine de 18 mois (par. 70). Dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 l\u2019arme correspond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, une peine sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 18 mois peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur aggravant. Ainsi, une peine d\u2019environ 18 mois \u00e0 2 ans serait appropri\u00e9e.\n(c) Le minimum obligatoire n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans les situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles\n[94] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9 dans les cas d\u2019Adam et de Brian, ainsi que dans les situations similaires aux affaires Link et Lodoen, soulignant que la peine minimale repr\u00e9sentait plus du double d\u2019une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, les juges majoritaires sont dans l\u2019erreur. Comme dans le cas du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i), compte tenu (1) de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, (2) des effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante; et (3) de la peine et de ses objectifs, la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pour vol qualifi\u00e9 ne \u00ab porte pas atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb.\n[95] Pour ce qui est de la port\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019infraction, comme dans le cas de M. Hilbach, les situations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ici ne d\u00e9montrent pas que la peine minimale obligatoire ratisse trop large et englobe des personnes d\u00e9linquantes dont la culpabilit\u00e9 morale est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Monsieur Zwozdesky soul\u00e8ve trois principaux facteurs qui rendent ces situations relativement moins graves en comparaison au cas de M. Hilbach : elles concernent des pistolets \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9, elles sont non planifi\u00e9es (comme dans le cas de Brian) et elles mettent en cause des personnes participant \u00e0 l\u2019infraction (comme dans le cas de Mme Link). \u00c0 mon avis, aucune de ces consid\u00e9rations n\u2019\u00e9tablit que le minimum est si vaste qu\u2019il s\u2019applique dans des circonstances qui comportent peu de faute et peu de danger.\n[96] Les cours d\u2019appel provinciales ont confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des peines minimales obligatoires pour le vol qualifi\u00e9, m\u00eame dans le cas de personnes accus\u00e9es inspirant la sympathie, parce que la mens rea et l\u2019actus reus de cette infraction s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un ensemble relativement limit\u00e9 de comportements violents et que la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir fait de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e un acte pr\u00e9cis ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9termin\u00e9 pour \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable (Hills, par. 131; R. c. McIntyre, 2019 ONCA 161, 429 C.R.R. (2d) 346; McIvor; Lapierre; R. c. Wust (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43 (C.A. C.\u2011B.); McDonald; R. c. Bernarde, 2018 NWTCA 7). De plus, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McDonald, le juge Rosenberg a conclu qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans constituerait probablement une peine manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e dans le cas de l\u2019accus\u00e9 en cause selon la norme de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en appel. Toutefois, la peine n\u2019atteignait pas le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 permettant de conclure qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, car le Parlement pouvait r\u00e9primer par des peines s\u00e9v\u00e8res les infractions li\u00e9es aux armes \u00e0 feu. Le juge Rosenberg a conclu que, compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 objective de l\u2019infraction, une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de quatre ans ne choquait pas la conscience et ne portait pas atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence (p. 666 et 669).\n[97] Le vol qualifi\u00e9 constitue une infraction grave, m\u00eame s\u2019il est commis sans arme, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019infraction comporte le recours ou la menace de recours \u00e0 la violence dans le vol de biens. Qui plus est, chacune des situations comporte l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb dans ce contexte comprend les carabines et les fusils de chasse ordinaires vis\u00e9s par le r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9livrance de permis instaur\u00e9 par la Loi sur les armes \u00e0 feu , de m\u00eame que les dispositifs munis d\u2019un canon qui peuvent \u00eatre achet\u00e9s sans permis, par exemple les armes \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 comme les fusils \u00e0 balles BB et les pistolets \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, pour constituer une arme \u00e0 feu, au fond, ces dispositifs doivent pouvoir infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves, comme crever l\u2019\u0153il d\u2019une personne. Comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 dans le cas de M. Hilbach, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00ab incarne en soi la menace supr\u00eame de mort aux yeux de ceux qui y font face \u00bb (Felawka, p. 211). Cela est \u00e9galement vrai lorsqu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu ordinaire est utilis\u00e9e, par exemple une carabine ou un fusil de chasse. Bien qu\u2019une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 ne soit peut\u2011\u00eatre pas susceptible de causer une blessure mortelle, la personne d\u00e9linquante qui utilise une telle arme pour intimider autrui exploite la peur que provoquent les armes \u00e0 feu conventionnelles et, \u00e0 tout le moins, menace d\u2019infliger des blessures graves. Je ne suis pas convaincue que puisque la peine minimale s\u2019applique lorsque la personne d\u00e9linquante ne fait qu\u2019utiliser une arme \u00e0 feu, par opposition \u00e0 une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou \u00e0 autorisation restreinte, il y a peu de risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique.\n[98] Il est important d\u2019examiner l\u2019infraction du point de vue des victimes dans les situations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a toujours une personne expos\u00e9e \u00e0 un risque s\u00e9rieux de blessure, peu importe qu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle ou \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 soit utilis\u00e9e. Pour les victimes, le risque de blessure physique grave subsiste lorsque des armes \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 sont utilis\u00e9es au cours d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9, un risque qui n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent dans le cas des fausses armes \u00e0 feu. Qui plus est, le risque de traumatisme psychologique que peut susciter l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 demeure semblable \u00e0 celui que peut susciter une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle. Comme l\u2019a conclu la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Al\u2011Isawi, [traduction] \u00ab le fait qu\u2019une personne d\u00e9linquante se serve d\u2019une vraie ou d\u2019une fausse arme \u00e0 feu ne change rien au pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime, qui ne verra pas la diff\u00e9rence \u00bb (par. 39). Je ne suis pas convaincue que les victimes d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9, comme dans les cas d\u2019Adam et de Brian, auront normalement la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019esprit de distinguer une carabine \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 d\u2019une carabine conventionnelle, pas plus qu\u2019elles pourront faire la distinction entre un fusil de chasse charg\u00e9 ou non. Il y a, en cons\u00e9quence, le risque d\u2019escalade de la violence, car une telle menace mortelle apparente risque d\u2019engendrer une r\u00e9action dangereuse chez les passants et les policiers qui interviennent dans un incident. Par cons\u00e9quent, du point de vue de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, il n\u2019y a pas de diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable entre la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle et une arme \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9.\n[99] La menace constante pour les victimes et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique distingue cette infraction de celle en cause dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills. Un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec ou sans arme \u00e0 feu est le recours \u00e0 la violence r\u00e9elle ou \u00e0 la menace de violence contre une personne lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction. Le fait que la menace est imm\u00e9diate distingue l\u2019infraction de la situation hypoth\u00e9tique \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Hills. La personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir l\u2019intention de faire na\u00eetre la peur dans le c\u0153ur de sa victime. La personne d\u00e9linquante a choisi d\u2019utiliser une arme \u00e0 feu, sachant qu\u2019elle peut en tirer un avantage appr\u00e9ciable en raison de la peur universelle que suscitent les armes \u00e0 feu chez les gens. Lorsqu\u2019on \u00e9value la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction, on ne saurait minimiser ou n\u00e9gliger la menace pour les victimes et le public dans ces situations.\n[100] En outre, la culpabilit\u00e9 au c\u0153ur de cette infraction ne diff\u00e8re pas profond\u00e9ment de celle qu\u2019implique l\u2019infraction vis\u00e9e au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et est la m\u00eame pour toutes les personnes accus\u00e9es de cette infraction. Pour que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) s\u2019applique, la personne d\u00e9linquante doit avoir l\u2019intention de voler et avoir l\u2019intention de recourir \u00e0 la violence ou \u00e0 la force (ou de menacer d\u2019y avoir recours). La personne d\u00e9linquante doit \u00e9galement avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019utiliser l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu. Par cons\u00e9quent, un choix conscient de menacer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu doit \u00eatre fait. Cela est vrai que l\u2019infraction soit perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e ou non \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu conventionnelle ou \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019instar du cas de M. Hilbach, bien qu\u2019il y ait sans aucun doute des circonstances personnelles att\u00e9nuantes qui r\u00e9duisent la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante dans les situations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky, il subsiste un degr\u00e9 essentiel de faute d\u00e9coulant du choix de menacer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\n[101] Monsieur Zwozdesky soul\u00e8ve n\u00e9anmoins la possibilit\u00e9 que la culpabilit\u00e9 des participants \u00e0 l\u2019infraction soit moindre, citant en exemple l\u2019affaire Link. Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincue que l\u2019affaire Link illustre l\u2019id\u00e9e que la faute morale des participants \u00e0 l\u2019infraction est moindre que celle des auteurs principaux. La question de savoir si le r\u00f4le de la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 titre de personne qui a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction ou qui l\u2019a encourag\u00e9e repr\u00e9sente un facteur att\u00e9nuant dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine d\u00e9pend fortement du contexte (R. c. Overacker, 2005 ABCA 150, 367 A.R. 250, par. 23\u201126; R. c. Hennessey, 2010 ABCA 274, 490 A.R. 35, par. 47). Une peine \u00e0 rabais accord\u00e9e uniquement parce qu\u2019une personne a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une infraction ou l\u2019a encourag\u00e9e irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet des dispositions concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 des participants \u00e0 l\u2019art. 21, lequel fait en sorte que \u00ab [q]uel que soit le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9, la responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle est la m\u00eame \u00bb (R. c. Vu, 2012 CSC 40, [2012] 2 R.C.S. 411, par. 58 (je souligne), citant R. c. Thatcher, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 652, p. 689\u2011690). Lorsque l\u2019auteur principal de l\u2019infraction et la personne qui l\u2019a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la commettre ou l\u2019a encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire ont des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires diff\u00e9rents, ou lorsqu\u2019il y a des circonstances aggravantes, comme un comportement agressif, qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019auteur principal de l\u2019infraction mais pas \u00e0 la personne qui l\u2019a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la commettre ou l\u2019a encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire, la peine de cette derni\u00e8re peut \u00eatre moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re que celle inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019auteur principal (McIvor, par. 29; R. c. Price (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (C.A. Ont.), par. 54\u201156). Toutefois, ils sont tenus conjointement responsables de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction initiale. En principe et en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, conclure autrement encouragerait les personnes d\u00e9linquantes \u00e0 aider \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019infractions ou \u00e0 l\u2019encourager. Par cons\u00e9quent, restreindre l\u2019application de la peine minimale aux personnes qui aident \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019infractions ou qui l\u2019encouragent n\u2019est pas suffisant pour en \u00e9tablir l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9.\n[102] Pour que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) s\u2019applique, la personne qui aide \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction ou qui l\u2019encourage comme le pr\u00e9voit le par. 21(1) doit avoir connaissance ou son \u00e9quivalent de l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu. Comme je l\u2019ai fait remarquer, l\u2019art. 344 s\u2019inspire de l\u2019art. 85 du Code criminel . Rien dans le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 344 n\u2019indique que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tendre son application aux personnes d\u00e9linquantes dont la culpabilit\u00e9 est moindre que celle requise pour une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 en application de l\u2019art. 85 . Les \u00ab r\u00e8gles habituelles de la complicit\u00e9 \u00bb des parties sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 21 s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019art. 85 (Steele, par. 33; voir aussi McGuigan, p. 307\u2011308). Par cons\u00e9quent, dans une situation comme celle de l\u2019affaire Link, la personne qui aide \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction doit avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019aider l\u2019auteur principal en sachant (ou, du moins, en ignorant volontairement) que ce dernier avait l\u2019intention d\u2019utiliser l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu pour commettre le vol qualifi\u00e9 (Briscoe, par. 15\u201118). Autrement dit, une personne doit consciemment choisir de fournir de l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019auteur principal tout en ayant la connaissance ou son \u00e9quivalent qu\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu est utilis\u00e9e. Pour cette raison, la d\u00e9linquante inconsciente dans l\u2019affaire Link n\u2019\u00e9tait pas passible de la peine minimale. Lorsque cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment est \u00e9tabli, je ne suis pas convaincue que la culpabilit\u00e9 de la personne d\u00e9linquante soit moindre. \u00c0 titre de participant \u00e0 l\u2019infraction, la personne qui aide \u00e0 sa perp\u00e9tration b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la menace de violence engendr\u00e9e par l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu. Celle\u2011ci offre \u00e0 chaque partie une protection et assure la collaboration des victimes, un r\u00e9sultat qui profite \u00e0 la personne qui aide \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction et qui l\u2019encourage tout autant qu\u2019\u00e0 son auteur principal.\n[103] De plus, sans l\u2019apport de chaque participant, le vol qualifi\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas pu avoir lieu, un r\u00e9sultat qui justifie de traiter de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on les auteurs principaux de l\u2019infraction et les personnes qui aident \u00e0 sa perp\u00e9tration. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour d\u2019appel anglaise,\n[traduction] dans le cas d\u2019un crime de ce genre, il n\u2019y a pas de distinction \u00e0 faire [dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine] entre ceux qui ont effectivement recours \u00e0 la violence et ceux qui se tiennent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart et qui, m\u00eame s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas recours \u00e0 la violence, sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 s\u2019enfuir en voiture, \u00e0 kidnapper ou \u00e0 accomplir toute autre t\u00e2che pouvant \u00eatre de mise. Si la Cour ou un juge de premi\u00e8re instance se penche sur un cas de vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e dans une banque commis avec une arme \u00e0 feu ou des barres de fer, ou d\u2019un fourgon de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 transportant de grandes quantit\u00e9s de billets vers une succursale d\u2019une banque, il ne s\u2019arr\u00eate normalement pas pour se demander si un pr\u00e9venu en particulier a effectivement braqu\u00e9 le caissier ou le garde, s\u2019il avait une arme \u00e0 feu ou une barre de fer ou s\u2019il \u00e9tait le conducteur se tenant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur pr\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019enfuir en voiture. Tous sont \u00e9galement coupables, car si chacun n\u2019avait pas jou\u00e9 son r\u00f4le, le crime n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre perp\u00e9tr\u00e9.\n(R. c. Church (1985), 7 Cr. App. R. (S.) 370, p. 372)\n[104] Monsieur Zwozdesky se fonde \u00e9galement sur la possibilit\u00e9 que des vols qualifi\u00e9s soient non planifi\u00e9s. Dans le cas de Brian, par exemple, l\u2019intention de commettre l\u2019infraction n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e que lorsque la bonne samaritaine a tent\u00e9 de lui offrir de l\u2019aide. Le degr\u00e9 de planification de l\u2019infraction peut \u00eatre un facteur aggravant dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine. Dans le cas de Brian, toutefois, l\u2019absence de planification ne saurait \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une absence de culpabilit\u00e9. La situation comporte le recours intentionnel \u00e0 la force, le vol d\u2019un sac \u00e0 main et la menace de violence par le d\u00e9linquant en brandissant un fusil \u00e0 balles BB, qu\u2019il avait choisi de porter sur lui en public. Ce que Brian a en commun avec toutes les autres personnes d\u00e9linquantes accus\u00e9es en vertu de cet article, c\u2019est qu\u2019il a vu l\u2019occasion de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier financi\u00e8rement de la peur qu\u2019une autre personne avait des armes \u00e0 feu et qu\u2019il en a profit\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la culpabilit\u00e9 que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 Brian. Cette situation est, encore une fois, un cas o\u00f9 la personne d\u00e9linquante choisit de menacer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en utilisant une arme \u00e0 feu.\n[105] Pour ces motifs, les situations invoqu\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) s\u2019applique dans des circonstances ne comportant que peu ou pas de danger pour le public ou peu ou pas de faute. Je ne suis pas convaincue que les distinctions entre la l\u00e9talit\u00e9 des armes \u00e0 feu en cause, ou la responsabilit\u00e9 en tant que participant, \u00e9tablissent des degr\u00e9s de gravit\u00e9 radicalement diff\u00e9rents dans le contexte de cette infraction. Au fond, dans toutes ces situations, pour voler, une personne d\u00e9linquante fait le choix conscient de mettre une autre personne \u00e0 risque de blessures graves et d\u2019un traumatisme psychologique consid\u00e9rable. Comme l\u2019infraction commise par M. Hilbach, il s\u2019agit de \u00ab vrai[s] crime[s] \u00bb.\n[106] Les effets de la peine sur la personne d\u00e9linquante sont graves. Dans le cas des personnes d\u00e9linquantes autochtones, les effets sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre aussi graves que la peine minimale obligatoire en question dans le cas de M. Hilbach. Ces effets, comme dans le cas de M. Hilbach, sont importants et on ne saurait en faire abstraction ou les minimiser. Comme le souligne la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hills, les jeunes personnes d\u00e9linquantes sont souvent victimes d\u2019intimidation, sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre recrut\u00e9es par des gangs et risquent davantage de se retrouver plac\u00e9es en isolement (par. 165). Une peine d\u2019emprisonnement peut repr\u00e9senter un ch\u00e2timent plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour la personne accus\u00e9e atteinte d\u2019une maladie mentale que pour les autres. Les tribunaux ont indiqu\u00e9 que les personnes incarc\u00e9r\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des soins appropri\u00e9s pendant leur incarc\u00e9ration et que, pour certaines personnes d\u00e9linquantes atteintes de troubles mentaux, toute p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration peut \u00eatre extr\u00eamement nuisible \u00e0 leur \u00e9tat mental (R. c. Wallace (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (C.A. Ont.), p. 100; R. c. Folino (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), par. 29\u201132). La situation personnelle de la personne d\u00e9linquante hypoth\u00e9tique indique que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration exig\u00e9e par l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) pourrait vraisemblablement entra\u00eener de graves effets n\u00e9fastes.\n[107] Un examen de la peine et de ses objectifs r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) et celle fond\u00e9e sur le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) sont semblables. Le Parlement a choisi d\u2019imposer la condamnation morale forte qu\u2019une lourde peine d\u2019emprisonnement signale, ce qui est raisonnable vu que le choix des personnes d\u00e9linquantes de mettre \u00e0 risque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique contrevient aux valeurs morales fondamentales. Il convient donc de faire preuve d\u2019une plus grande d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du Parlement d\u2019\u00e9dicter un minimum obligatoire. Comme dans le cas de M. Hilbach, la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a un r\u00f4le, car \u00ab [l]e besoin de dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne saurait \u00eatre contest\u00e9 \u00bb lorsqu\u2019une personne met en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui en brandissant une arme \u00e0 feu (Morrisey, par. 46). Cependant, il est vrai que la priorit\u00e9 qu\u2019accorde le Parlement \u00e0 la dissuasion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u00e9roge plus s\u00e9rieusement aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine dans le cas de d\u00e9linquants qui, comme Adam, souffrent de troubles mentaux, parce que ces types de d\u00e9linquants ne sont pas de bons candidats lorsque l\u2019on cherche \u00e0 dissuader d\u2019autres personnes (Ruby, \u00a75.316; R. c. Dedeckere, 2017 ONCA 799, 15 M.V.R. (7th) 177, par. 14; R. c. Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114, 93 O.R. (3d) 643, par. 38). De toute mani\u00e8re, en d\u00e9finitive, la peine minimale ne \u00ab d\u00e9roge [pas] totalement \u00bb aux normes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pour cette infraction, compte tenu des fourchettes de peines examin\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t en ce qui concerne le vol qualifi\u00e9. Toutefois, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans les motifs dissidents, la peine minimale obligatoire correspond en fait au double de ce qui serait une peine juste et proportionn\u00e9e pour les personnes d\u00e9linquantes hypoth\u00e9tiques si la peine obligatoire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appliqu\u00e9e.\n[108] N\u00e9anmoins, comme pour le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i), l\u2019absence de lien entre la peine minimale obligatoire et la situation personnelle des d\u00e9linquants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne rend pas la peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, la norme de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e est un crit\u00e8re rigoureux qui ne s\u2019applique que dans de rares cas. Si la peine en question \u00e9tait \u00e9valu\u00e9e selon la norme applicable en appel, je serais d\u2019avis que la peine minimale de quatre ans est manifestement non indiqu\u00e9e dans le cas des hypoth\u00e8ses raisonnables propos\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincue que la peine minimale obligatoire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00ab choqu[e] la conscience \u00bb (Lloyd, par. 33) ou est \u00ab excessive au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Hills, par. 109, citant Boudreault, par. 45; Lloyd, par. 24, citant Morrisey, par. 26; Wiles, par. 4, citant Smith, p. 1072). Bien que la peine soit s\u00e9v\u00e8re, le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e n\u2019est pas atteint en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Pour ces motifs, je suis convaincue que la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans d\u2019emprisonnement ne contrevient pas \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte .\n[109] Ayant conclu que ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des peines minimales obligatoires ne contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la question de savoir si la violation peut se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier.\nC. Conclusion\n[110] Le pourvoi de la Couronne est accueilli. Les peines minimales obligatoires \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et \u00e0 l\u2019ancien al. 344(1)a.1) sont constitutionnelles et ne constituent pas des peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. Les jugements de la Cour d\u2019appel sur ce moyen sont annul\u00e9s. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la peine de M. Zwozdesky, vu le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de celui\u2011ci.\n[111] Pour ce qui est de la peine de M. Hilbach, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il convient en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de surseoir \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la portion de la peine post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019appel. C\u2019est ce que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire. Dans les rares cas o\u00f9 les juridictions d\u2019appel ont impos\u00e9 des peines d\u2019emprisonnement conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions obligatoires du Code criminel , y compris des peines minimales obligatoires, elles ont sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la portion de la peine post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019appel. Un sursis de la peine post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019appel peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il y a un retard att\u00e9nuant dans le processus judiciaire, particuli\u00e8rement au stade de l\u2019appel, en l\u2019absence de toute faute de la personne d\u00e9linquante (R. c. Anderson, 2014 CSC 41, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 167; R. c. Proulx, 2000 CSC 5, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 61; R. c. McMillan, 2016 MBCA 12, 326 Man. R. (2d) 56; R. c. Shi, 2015 ONCA 646). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que plus de quatre ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis que M. Hilbach s\u2019est vu infliger sa peine, je suis convaincue que tel est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\n[112] Je souscris au dispositif de ma coll\u00e8gue la juge Martin en ce qui concerne l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par la Couronne. Cependant, pour les motifs que j\u2019expose en dissidence dans l\u2019affaire connexe R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, je dois, avec \u00e9gards, exprimer mon d\u00e9saccord quant au nouveau test \u00e0 trois \u00e9tapes qu\u2019elle \u00e9labore relativement \u00e0 la disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Nur, 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773, et confirm\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment dans R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23, par. 63.\n[113] Appliquant ce cadre juridique d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli, je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et celle prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019ancien al. 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , n\u2019atteignent pas le seuil \u00e9lev\u00e9 requis pour les qualifier de peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es. Bien qu\u2019elles puissent potentiellement \u00eatre excessives dans certaines situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, ces peines ne sont pas excessives au point de \u00ab porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (R. c. Smith, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1045, p. 1072) ou de \u00ab choquer la conscience des Canadiens \u00bb (R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130, par. 33). J\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLes juges Karakatsanis et Jamal \u2014\n[114] Les peines minimales obligatoires refl\u00e8tent la d\u00e9cision du Parlement que certains crimes sont si graves qu\u2019une sanction minimum doit \u00eatre inflig\u00e9e, ind\u00e9pendamment des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019infraction ou de son auteur. Lorsqu\u2019une telle peine existe, les tribunaux n\u2019ont pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019imposer une peine moindre.\n[115] Toutefois, les peines minimales obligatoires font l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen rigoureux au regard de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s , disposition qui garantit \u00e0 chacun le \u00ab droit \u00e0 la protection contre tous traitements ou peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s \u00bb. Elles sont davantage vuln\u00e9rables sur le plan constitutionnel lorsqu\u2019elles s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une infraction qui peut \u00eatre perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e de diverses fa\u00e7ons, suivant une vaste gamme de circonstances et par un large \u00e9ventail de personnes (R. c. Lloyd, 2016 CSC 13, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 130, par. 3). De telles dispositions seront inconstitutionnelles lorsqu\u2019elles sont, ou pourraient \u00eatre dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es \u00e0 ce qui serait par ailleurs une peine juste dans les circonstances.\n[116] Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi et dans le pourvoi connexe R. c. Hills, 2023 CSC 2, un total de trois peines minimales obligatoires sont en litige. Nous souscrivons aux motifs de notre coll\u00e8gue la juge Martin dans l\u2019affaire Hills. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 244.2(3) b) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 , qui impose l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans \u00e0 quiconque est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir d\u00e9charg\u00e9 intentionnellement une arme \u00e0 feu en direction d\u2019un lieu, en contravention de l\u2019al. 244.2(1) a), viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9 suivant l\u2019article premier de celle\u2011ci.\n[117] Cependant, nous ne sommes pas d\u2019accord avec la conclusion de notre coll\u00e8gue sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi : le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) du Code criminel , qui pr\u00e9voit une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans dans le cas d\u2019une premi\u00e8re infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9, s\u2019il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e; et l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1) du Code criminel , qui prescrit une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans applicable en cas de vol qualifi\u00e9 s\u2019il y a usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu. Nous soulignons que le Parlement a r\u00e9cemment abrog\u00e9 l\u2019al. 344(1) a.1) (Loi modifiant le Code criminel et la Loi r\u00e9glementant certaines drogues et autres substances, L.C. 2022, c. 15).\n[118] Le vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e est une infraction grave, qui commande en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral une peine \u00e0 purger dans un p\u00e9nitencier. \u00c0 notre avis, toutefois, les peines minimales obligatoires pr\u00e9vues par ces deux dispositions d\u00e9ploient un large filet inconstitutionnel, qui capture dans ses mailles des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles ces peines minimales obligatoires seraient exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es. Dans ces situations, les peines minimales obligatoires sont \u00ab excessive[s] au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence \u00bb (Lloyd, par. 24 et 87, citant Miller c. La Reine, [1977] 2 R.C.S. 680, p. 688, le juge en chef Laskin), et violent ainsi la garantie constitutionnelle contre les peines cruelles et inusit\u00e9es \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Ces peines ne sauraient \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9es par application de l\u2019article premier, et elles devraient par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es inop\u00e9rantes.\n[119] En cons\u00e9quence, nous rejetterions le pourvoi form\u00e9 par la Couronne.\nI. Contexte\nA. Ocean William Storm Hilbach\n[120] Monsieur Hilbach est un Autochtone de la Nation crie d\u2019Ermineskin. Alors qu\u2019il avait 19 ans et n\u2019avait pas d\u2019argent pour voyager de la ville \u00e0 sa r\u00e9serve, lui et son complice \u00e2g\u00e9 de 13 ans ont commis un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur en faisant usage d\u2019une carabine \u00e0 canon sci\u00e9e non charg\u00e9e. Monsieur Hilbach s\u2019est couvert le visage avec sa chemise et a point\u00e9 l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu en direction de deux commis du magasin, leur demandant de l\u2019argent. Son complice a donn\u00e9 un coup de poing \u00e0 l\u2019un des commis et un coup de pied \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Ils se sont enfuis avec 290 $ en billets de loterie et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9hend\u00e9s peu apr\u00e8s.\n[121] Monsieur Hilbach a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 des accusations de vol qualifi\u00e9 avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 utilisation restreinte (al. 344(1)a)), et de possession d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pendant que cela lui \u00e9tait interdit (par. 117.01(1)). Le juge charg\u00e9 de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a estim\u00e9 que, dans le cas de M. Hilbach, une peine juste et appropri\u00e9e \u00e9tait un emprisonnement de deux ans moins un jour. Il a conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans pr\u00e9vue au sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de M. Hilbach et contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait plus de deux fois plus longue qu\u2019une peine juste et qu\u2019elle serait purg\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral plut\u00f4t que provincial. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la disposition inop\u00e9rante (2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359).\n[122] La Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli en partie l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par la Couronne. Elle a jug\u00e9 que la peine inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Hilbach n\u2019\u00e9tait pas juste et elle y a substitu\u00e9 une peine de trois ans relativement \u00e0 l\u2019accusation de vol qualifi\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel a n\u00e9anmoins conclu que la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Hilbach et violait l\u2019art. 12. Elle ne pouvait \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9e par application de l\u2019article premier, et elle a en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante (2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245).\nB. Curtis Zwozdesky\n[123] Au moment de l\u2019infraction, M. Zwozdesky \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 53 ans, sans emploi et aux prises avec des d\u00e9pendances aux drogues. Il \u00e9tait le \u00ab conducteur de la voiture des fuyards \u00bb lors de deux vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs ruraux en Alberta. Durant le premier vol qualifi\u00e9, il est entr\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9panneur puis est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa voiture. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, ses complices sont entr\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9panneur, munis d\u2019un fusil de chasse modifi\u00e9. L\u2019un des complices a point\u00e9 l\u2019arme en direction de la commis, lui a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser de l\u2019argent dans un sac et il a tir\u00e9 sur une \u00e9tag\u00e8re avec le fusil. Personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9. L\u2019autre vol qualifi\u00e9 a eu lieu une semaine plus tard. Monsieur Zwozdesky a attendu dans la voiture pendant que les deux d\u00e9linquants principaux sont entr\u00e9s dans le magasin, ont brandi un fusil de chasse et ont asperg\u00e9 un commis de gaz poivr\u00e9 avant de s\u2019enfuir avec en mains de l\u2019argent comptant et des cigarettes.\n[124] Monsieur Zwozdesky a confess\u00e9 aux policiers et plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 un chef de vol qualifi\u00e9 avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu (al. 344(1)a.1)), et \u00e0 un chef de vol qualifi\u00e9 simple (al. 344(1)b)).\n[125] La juge charg\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine a conclu que la peine obligatoire de quatre ans prescrite par l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) ne serait pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Zwozdesky. Toutefois, en consid\u00e9rant d\u2019autres cas d\u2019application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles du texte de loi, elle a fait observer qu\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e peut \u00eatre commis suivant une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de circonstances, notamment par de jeunes d\u00e9linquants agissant de mani\u00e8re impulsive, par des d\u00e9linquants ayant des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et par des d\u00e9linquants jouant un r\u00f4le p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique dans la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction. Raisonnant que la peine minimale obligatoire pourrait constituer une peine cruelle et inusit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de d\u00e9linquants dans des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles, et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9e par application de l\u2019article premier, la juge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) inop\u00e9rant (2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386).\n[126] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord pour dire que l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) pourrait entra\u00eener l\u2019infliction de peines exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9es et ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la Couronne.\nII. Analyse\n[127] Monsieur Hilbach a contest\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans applicable en cas de vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e (sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i)), tandis que M. Zwozdesky a contest\u00e9 la peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans applicable en cas de vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu sans restrictions (al. 344(1)a.1)). \u00c0 notre avis, les deux dispositions violent l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte . Pour d\u00e9cider si une peine minimale obligatoire viole ou non l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte , les tribunaux proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 une analyse en deux \u00e9tapes (Hills, par. 40).\n[128] Premi\u00e8rement, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une peine proportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019infraction, en tenant compte des objectifs et des principes de d\u00e9termination de la peine pr\u00e9vus par le Code criminel , y compris le principe fondamental de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.1 : \u00ab La peine est proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et au degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant \u00bb. Dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une infraction, le tribunal peut prendre en compte les cons\u00e9quences des agissements du d\u00e9linquant sur les victimes et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par l\u2019infraction et, dans certains cas, les motivations du contrevenant (Hills, par. 58). Le tribunal doit mesurer le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant en \u00e9valuant \u00ab les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs essentiels de l\u2019infraction, notamment sa mens rea, la conduite de la personne d\u00e9linquante dans la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction, le mobile qui a pouss\u00e9 la personne d\u00e9linquante \u00e0 commettre l\u2019infraction et les aspects du v\u00e9cu de cette personne qui renforcent ou diminuent sa responsabilit\u00e9 individuelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du crime, y compris sa situation personnelle et sa capacit\u00e9 mentale \u00bb (Hills, par. 58, citant R. c. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), par. 91; R. c. Boudreault, 2018 CSC 58, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 599, par. 68; R. c. Ipeelee, 2012 CSC 13, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 73).\n[129] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le tribunal doit se demander si la peine minimale prescrite l\u2019oblige \u00e0 infliger une peine qui est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la peine qui serait par ailleurs juste. Pour d\u00e9cider si la peine minimale obligatoire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e, le tribunal doit examiner \u00ab trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments cruciaux \u00bb : (1) la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction; (2) les effets de la peine sur le d\u00e9linquant, \u00ab tant de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques et qualit\u00e9s qui [lui] sont propres \u00bb; (3) la sanction, y compris l\u2019\u00e9quilibre atteint par ses objectifs (Hills, par. 122\u2011138).\n[130] Si le tribunal conclut que la peine n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du d\u00e9linquant en cause, il doit ensuite se demander si elle serait disproportionn\u00e9e dans d\u2019autres situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles (R. c. Nur, 2015 CSC 15, [2015] 1 R.C.S. 773, par. 65).\n[131] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s en application de ce cadre d\u2019analyse, ni le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) ni l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) ne r\u00e9sistent au contr\u00f4le de leur constitutionnalit\u00e9. Le juge de la peine a correctement examin\u00e9 les faits, la jurisprudence ainsi que les objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine pertinents avant de conclure qu\u2019une peine de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait juste et proportionn\u00e9e eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la situation de M. Hilbach. Cette conclusion commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Dans la d\u00e9termination d\u2019une peine juste, les tribunaux ne doivent pas suivre syst\u00e9matiquement des points de d\u00e9part, \u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement toute perspective de r\u00e9insertion sociale ou encore d\u00e9former la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction en \u00e9cartant des faits pertinents ( p. ex. le fait que l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e ou non). Qui plus est, que la peine juste soit deux ans ou \u2014 comme le conclut notre coll\u00e8gue \u2014 trois ans, une sentence qui repr\u00e9sente le double ou presque de cette peine est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e et viole l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte .\n[132] La peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est elle aussi exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e. Elle a une port\u00e9e inconstitutionnellement large et s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9visible \u00e0 un large \u00e9ventail de situations, y compris des cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9linquant peut \u00eatre jeune, \u00eatre d\u00e9pendant \u00e0 des substances ou avoir aid\u00e9 le d\u00e9linquant principal ou fait usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu tel un fusil \u00e0 balles BB. Infliger la peine minimale obligatoire dans certaines de ces situations serait excessif au point de porter atteinte aux normes de la d\u00e9cence et, en cons\u00e9quence, serait inconstitutionnel (voir Lloyd, par. 24 et 87).\n[133] Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des dispositions ne peuvent \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9es par application de l\u2019article premier.\n[134] Nous allons examiner tour \u00e0 tour chacune des dispositions.\nA. Sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 344(1)a)(i) du Code criminel\n[135] Le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 344(1)a)(i) s\u2019applique lorsque le d\u00e9linquant commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 en faisant usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 utilisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si une peine de cinq ans est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Hilbach ou d\u2019un autre d\u00e9linquant se trouvant dans une situation raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Nous souscrivons aux d\u00e9cisions des deux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et concluons qu\u2019elle le serait dans le cas de M. Hilbach. Il n\u2019est par cons\u00e9quent pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner d\u2019autres cas d\u2019application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles du texte de loi.\n[136] Nous allons maintenant nous pencher sur ce que serait la peine juste dans le cas de M. Hilbach. Bien que les deux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de cinq ans \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e au regard de ce qui constituait la peine juste pour M. Hilbach, elles ont diverg\u00e9 d\u2019opinions quant \u00e0 ce que serait une peine juste. Le juge de la peine a conclu qu\u2019un emprisonnement de deux ans moins un jour \u00e9tait une peine juste, par r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au point de d\u00e9part de trois ans en ce qui concerne les vols qualifi\u00e9s commis dans des d\u00e9panneurs mentionn\u00e9 dans R. c. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183 (C.A.), par. 19; tandis que la Cour d\u2019appel a pour sa part statu\u00e9 qu\u2019une peine de trois ans \u00e9tait une peine juste, mettant davantage l\u2019accent sur la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion. Comme nous l\u2019expliquerons, nous ne voyons aucune raison de modifier l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation qu\u2019a faite le juge de la peine.\n[137] La gravit\u00e9 du crime est \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances, un fait que n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de constater le juge de la peine. Il a soulign\u00e9 que M. Hilbach avait commis une [traduction] \u00ab infraction violente grave \u00bb qui avait \u00ab le potentiel de causer des torts consid\u00e9rables \u00bb et qui aurait un impact durable sur les victimes et la communaut\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (par. 9). Il a \u00e9galement reconnu que le casier judiciaire de M. Hilbach et les violations par ce dernier de ses conditions de probation et de l\u2019ordonnance lui interdisant d\u2019avoir des armes \u00e0 feu en sa possession \u00e9taient d\u2019importants facteurs aggravants dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine (par. 10 et 12\u201113). Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments faisaient de la d\u00e9nonciation et de la dissuasion des [traduction] \u00ab consid\u00e9rations importantes \u00bb (par. 20).\n[138] Le juge de la peine a mis en balance ces consid\u00e9rations et les circonstances personnelles tragiques de M. Hilbach. Abandonn\u00e9 en tr\u00e8s bas \u00e2ge par ses parents, M. Hilbach a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 par ses grands\u2011parents paternels, tous deux des survivants des pensionnats autochtones. Son enfance et son adolescence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9es par la pauvret\u00e9, une cellule familiale bris\u00e9e, des abus physiques et une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 des substances. Ces circonstances ont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 le cours de la vie de M. Hilbach, et il en est de m\u00eame pour ce qui est du crime qu\u2019il a commis. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la conduite de M. Hilbach a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la pauvret\u00e9 \u2014 il avait besoin d\u2019argent pour rentrer chez lui dans la r\u00e9serve, mais il n\u2019en avait pas (par. 35). Comme l\u2019a fait observer le juge de la peine, [traduction] \u00ab ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnels, familiaux et communautaires ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les actions qu\u2019il a accomplies ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 \u00bb (par. 35).\n[139] Ces circonstances sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le genre de contexte ou de facteurs syst\u00e9miques que notre Cour a reconnu comme \u00e9tant att\u00e9nuants lors de la d\u00e9termination de la peine (Ipeelee, par. 73; R. c. Gladue, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 688). La pauvret\u00e9 end\u00e9mique r\u00e9gnant dans les r\u00e9serves, pauvret\u00e9 qui est intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 un historique de colonialisme, est une cause fr\u00e9quente de la criminalit\u00e9 autochtone (Gladue, par. 65). \u00c0 mesure que continue de monter en fl\u00e8che le nombre de d\u00e9linquants autochtones d\u00e9tenus au Canada, il est imp\u00e9rieux que les juges charg\u00e9s de d\u00e9terminer les peines consid\u00e8rent de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e les conditions sociales particuli\u00e8res auxquelles sont expos\u00e9s les peuples autochtones au Canada (voir R. Mangat, More Than We Can Afford : The Costs of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing (2014), p. 30\u201134; m. interv., Association du Barreau canadien, par. 24). Le juge de la peine n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en le faisant.\n[140] Le juge de la peine a \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre les effets qu\u2019aurait la peine sur le d\u00e9linquant et conclu que [traduction] \u00ab toute p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration aura un impact profond sur M. Hilbach \u00bb, en raison de sa jeunesse et de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019affiliation \u00e0 des gangs (par. 14). En d\u2019autres termes, une peine de cinq ans dans un p\u00e9nitencier nuirait \u00e0 la r\u00e9insertion sociale de M. Hilbach, en plus d\u2019avoir des cons\u00e9quences contre\u2011productives pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique en d\u00e9finitive. Bien que la r\u00e9insertion sociale ne soit pas un principe de justice fondamentale, l\u2019\u00e9carter enti\u00e8rement de l\u2019analyse peut entra\u00eener une disproportion exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Comme a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 notre Cour dans R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23, \u00ab [p]our respecter la dignit\u00e9 humaine \u00bb \u2014 et de ce fait l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte \u2014, \u00ab le Parlement doit laisser la porte entrouverte \u00e0 la r\u00e9habilitation, m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 cet objectif rev\u00eat une importance minime \u00bb (par. 85). Lorsqu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire compromet les perspectives de r\u00e9insertion sociale au lieu de les favoriser \u2014 comme a conclu le juge de la peine en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014, le r\u00e9sultat est une sanction qui d\u00e9roge \u00e0 un pr\u00e9cepte de base de notre syst\u00e8me de justice criminelle : le respect de la dignit\u00e9 humaine inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 chaque individu (Bissonnette, par. 87\u201188). Et il choquerait tout simplement la conscience d\u2019envoyer un jeune d\u00e9linquant autochtone en prison pendant cinq ans alors que, selon le juge de la peine, une telle d\u00e9cision serait pr\u00e9judiciable tant au d\u00e9linquant qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (par. 14 et 21).\n[141] La Cour d\u2019appel a toutefois conclu que le juge de la peine a commis une erreur de principe en omettant d\u2019accorder suffisamment de poids \u00e0 la d\u00e9nonciation et \u00e0 la dissuasion, et en insistant trop sur les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gladue (par. 49). La cour a conclu qu\u2019une peine juste \u00e9tait un emprisonnement de trois ans, lorsque le poids appropri\u00e9 \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ces facteurs (par. 50).\n[142] Cependant, \u00ab une cour d\u2019appel ne peut intervenir simplement parce qu\u2019elle aurait attribu\u00e9 un poids diff\u00e9rent aux facteurs pertinents \u00bb (R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089, par. 49; voir aussi Lloyd, par. 52\u201153). Nous sommes d\u2019accord pour dire que la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion sont des consid\u00e9rations importantes, mais il n\u2019y a pas de raison de modifier la conclusion du juge de la peine selon laquelle l\u2019infliction d\u2019une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de deux ans \u00e0 un d\u00e9linquant ayant commis une premi\u00e8re infraction servirait ces objectifs. De fait, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 notre Cour dans Bissonnette, \u00ab les objectifs de d\u00e9nonciation et de dissuasion ne sont pas mieux servis par l\u2019infliction de peines excessives \u00bb (par. 94). De plus, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boudreault, la Cour a reconnu que la d\u00e9nonciation et la dissuasion ne devraient pas \u00eatre \u00e9lev\u00e9es au\u2011dessus du principe de proportionnalit\u00e9, des objectifs de r\u00e9insertion sociale, ainsi que de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 718.2e) du Code criminel , de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la surrepr\u00e9sentation des peuples autochtones dans la population carc\u00e9rale (par. 81\u201183). Nous nous en remettons \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge de la peine en ce qui concerne les objectifs de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718 \u00e0 prioriser ( p. ex. la d\u00e9nonciation, la dissuasion et la r\u00e9insertion sociale) \u2014 ainsi que le poids \u00e0 attribuer aux principes secondaires de d\u00e9termination de la peine mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.2 (p. ex. l\u2019harmonisation et la mod\u00e9ration) (Lacasse, par. 54\u201155). Nous ne sommes pas persuad\u00e9s qu\u2019il a commis une erreur dans l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[143] Notre coll\u00e8gue n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. Elle accepte qu\u2019une peine de trois ans, ou d\u2019une dur\u00e9e plus longue, serait une peine juste et conclut que le juge de la peine a fait erreur en imposant une peine qui \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure d\u2019une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re au point de d\u00e9part pour les infractions de cette nature (par. 50-51). Cependant, les points de d\u00e9part ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 la question cl\u00e9 \u00e0 cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, question qui est la suivante, pour reprendre les termes utilis\u00e9s par notre coll\u00e8gue: \u00ab . . . quelle est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la peine juste pour cette personne d\u00e9linquante en particulier? \u00bb (Hills, par. 64). De plus, les points de d\u00e9part sont des outils, non des carcans (R. c. Parranto, 2021 CSC 46, par. 37; R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 36\u201137; Lacasse, par. 57). L\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00e9cart par rapport \u00e0 un point de d\u00e9part \u2014 \u00ab peu importe l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019\u00e9cart \u00bb \u2014 ne justifie pas en soi l\u2019intervention d\u2019une cour d\u2019appel (Parranto, par. 29). En appliquant par d\u00e9faut le point de d\u00e9part \u00e9tabli dans Johnas, l\u2019approche de notre coll\u00e8gue s\u2019\u00e9carte de la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente de la Cour, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire des arr\u00eats Parranto, Friesen et Lacasse.\n[144] Notre coll\u00e8gue souligne \u00e9galement que \u00ab [l]\u2019usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e non charg\u00e9e ne r\u00e9duit pas consid\u00e9rablement la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction \u00bb (par. 55). Bien que l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e ne permette pas de r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une infraction \u2014 puisque dans les deux cas l\u2019arme inspire la peur et est utilis\u00e9e comme outil de contrainte \u2014, les deux situations ne sont pas \u00e9quivalentes sur le plan de gravit\u00e9 ou de la culpabilit\u00e9 morale. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu non charg\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente n\u00e9cessairement un risque beaucoup moins grave pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique. Il est de loin plus r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible d\u2019entrer dans un espace public avec une arme \u00e0 feu charg\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cela sugg\u00e8re une intention de recourir au besoin \u00e0 une force l\u00e9tale. Les deux situations ne sauraient \u00eatre assimil\u00e9es aux fins de d\u00e9termination de la peine.\n[145] M\u00eame si notre coll\u00e8gue et la Cour d\u2019appel ont raison et qu\u2019une peine juste dans le cas de M. Hilbach est une peine de trois ans, nous sommes malgr\u00e9 tout d\u2019avis, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, qu\u2019une peine de cinq ans \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e (par. 54). La conclusion contraire de notre coll\u00e8gue est, soit dit en tout respect, intenable. Il est difficile de concevoir comment une peine repr\u00e9sentant pr\u00e8s du double de la dur\u00e9e d\u2019une peine proportionn\u00e9e ne choquerait pas la conscience des Canadiens. Cela n\u2019est pas compatible avec une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019art. 12 et ne tient pas non plus compte des profondes cons\u00e9quences que toute incarc\u00e9ration aurait sur la vie et la libert\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9linquant, sans compter les r\u00e9percussions connexes qu\u2019elle aurait pour ce dernier et sa famille.\n[146] En d\u00e9finitive, nous ne modifierions pas la d\u00e9cision selon laquelle une peine de cinq ans purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans les circonstances. Comme la peine minimale obligatoire serait inconstitutionnelle dans le cas de M. Hilbach, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner des cas d\u2019application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles du texte de loi.\nB. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 344(1)a.1) du Code criminel\n[147] La peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) est d\u2019inflig\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9linquant commet un vol qualifi\u00e9 en faisant usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu \u00e0 autorisation restreinte ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e. Tant devant la Cour d\u2019appel que devant notre Cour, M. Zwozdesky a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans \u00e9tait juste dans son cas. En cons\u00e9quence, la question consiste \u00e0 se demander si une peine de quatre ans est exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans d\u2019autres situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Nous concluons qu\u2019elle l\u2019est.\n[148] Une peine de quatre ans va au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019exemple classique d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 commis avec usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu et vise aussi des conduites moins extr\u00eames. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 344(1)a.1) exige que le d\u00e9linquant fasse \u00ab usage \u00bb de l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu lors de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction. Dans R. c. Steele, 2007 CSC 36, [2007] 3 R.C.S. 3, la Cour a fait observer que le mot \u00ab utilise \u00bb (\u00ab usage \u00bb dans la loi actuelle), dans le contexte d\u2019autres infractions li\u00e9es aux armes \u00e0 feu, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme englobant une vaste gamme de conduites, y compris le fait de d\u00e9charger l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu, de la braquer ou m\u00eame de simplement r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sa pr\u00e9sence par des propos (par. 27). Pour qu\u2019il y ait \u00ab usage \u00bb, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que des munitions soient accessibles pour l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu en question (R. c. Covin, [1983] 1 R.C.S. 725, p. 730), ni que le d\u00e9linquant ait l\u2019arme en sa possession physique, en autant que celle-ci est \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main (Steele, par. 32).\n[149] En outre, les armes \u00e0 feu ne sont pas toutes hautement r\u00e9glement\u00e9es. La d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb vise tout dispositif susceptible \u2014 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un canon qui permet de tirer un projectile \u2014 de percer un \u0153il, crit\u00e8re servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu peut infliger des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves ou la mort (R. c. Dunn, 2013 ONCA 539, 117 O.R. (3d) 171, par. 40, conf. par 2014 CSC 69, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 490). Cette d\u00e9finition inclut des armes \u00e0 feu \u2014 tels les fusils \u00e0 balles BB, les fusils de paintball ou m\u00eame les fusils \u00e0 clous \u2014 que l\u2019on peut se procurer relativement facilement dans des commerces de proximit\u00e9.\n[150] En cons\u00e9quence, bien que la gravit\u00e9 objective d\u2019un vol qualifi\u00e9 perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 avec une arme \u00e0 feu soit toujours importante, la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction commise \u2014 qui d\u00e9pend des circonstances entourant l\u2019infraction \u2014 varie consid\u00e9rablement (voir Friesen, par. 96). Par exemple, tout comme l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) vise les d\u00e9linquants brandissant un fusil de chasse qui envahissent un domicile et cambriolent ses occupants (R. c. Matwiy (1996), 178 A.R. 356 (C.A.)), il viserait aussi un d\u00e9linquant arm\u00e9 d\u2019un fusil \u00e0 balles BB qui soutire le sac \u00e0 main d\u2019une \u00e9trang\u00e8re (motifs de la C.A., par. 64; voir aussi R. c. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266).\n[151] De plus, un large \u00e9ventail de personnes commettent des vols \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e. \u00c0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du spectre, on trouve les criminels endurcis qui, anim\u00e9s par la cupidit\u00e9 et le m\u00e9pris pour l\u2019autorit\u00e9, organisent en s\u00e9rie des vols qualifi\u00e9s complexes, sans se laisser dissuader par les sanctions p\u00e9nales. \u00c0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du spectre, on trouve le d\u00e9linquant qui a eu une enfance tragique et dont c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re infraction, et qui, pouss\u00e9 par une d\u00e9pendance aux drogues, commet un seul et unique vol qualifi\u00e9 afin d\u2019assouvir son besoin d\u2019une dose rapide, puis se r\u00e9ins\u00e8re avec succ\u00e8s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avant la d\u00e9termination de sa peine. Une peine de quatre ans purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier peut \u00eatre proportionn\u00e9e, ou m\u00eame cl\u00e9mente, dans le premier exemple, alors qu\u2019elle peut fort bien \u00eatre exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e dans le second.\n[152] La prise en consid\u00e9ration de telles circonstances et caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9claire sur la port\u00e9e raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible du texte de loi (Hills, par. 58\u201161). Cela refl\u00e8te la nature intrins\u00e8quement individualis\u00e9e de la d\u00e9termination de la peine et la mani\u00e8re dont la proportionnalit\u00e9 implique une \u00e9valuation tant de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction que de la culpabilit\u00e9 morale du d\u00e9linquant (Nur, par. 43).\n[153] Une telle approche refl\u00e8te \u00e9galement le sens commun. Vu l\u2019\u00e9norme surrepr\u00e9sentation des Autochtones au sein de notre syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale, les affaires impliquant de tels d\u00e9linquants sont, logiquement, des situations raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles (Hills, par. 86\u201187). De fait, les peines minimales obligatoires ont une incidence disproportionn\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9linquants autochtones (Mangat, p. 30\u201134). De m\u00eame, les d\u00e9linquants qui sont pauvres, dans une situation pr\u00e9caire en mati\u00e8re de logement, aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes de d\u00e9pendances ou de sant\u00e9 mentale, ou handicap\u00e9es \u00ab comparaissent avec une r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 effarante devant nos tribunaux provinciaux \u00bb (Boudreault, par. 49\u201155). La prise en consid\u00e9ration de ces caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles permet de faire en sorte que l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte tienne compte de la composition courante des d\u00e9linquants du syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale (m. interv., Association du Barreau canadien, par. 24).\n[154] Cela dit, le type de d\u00e9linquants se trouvant dans des situations pr\u00e9visibles qu\u2019un tribunal peut prendre en compte ne doit pas \u00eatre d\u00e9raisonnablement \u00e9largi au point de cr\u00e9er des situations invraisemblables (Nur, par. 73\u201176). Des situations hypoth\u00e9tiques extr\u00eamement d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, comme celles avanc\u00e9es par M. Zwozdesky, sont pour cette raison inutiles en d\u00e9finitive. Des lois ne devraient pas \u00eatre invalid\u00e9es sur la base de conjectures. Toutefois, pour autant que de tels exemples sont raisonnables, cet examen est un aspect central de l\u2019analyse : le fait d\u2019\u00e9valuer la port\u00e9e raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible d\u2019une peine donn\u00e9e permet de s\u2019assurer que personne n\u2019est assujetti \u00e0 une loi inconstitutionnelle, mesure qui, \u00e0 son tour, permet r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objectif de l\u2019art. 12.\n[155] Les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de M. Hilbach constituent un exemple de situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable. Sa d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 en vertu du sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) est plus grave parce qu\u2019il y a eu usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu prohib\u00e9e. Mais malgr\u00e9 cela, le juge de la peine a conclu qu\u2019une peine juste aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un emprisonnement de deux ans moins un jour \u2014 la moiti\u00e9 de la peine obligatoire de quatre ans pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1), qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. M\u00eame si nous acceptions la conclusion de notre coll\u00e8gue et de la Cour d\u2019appel portant qu\u2019une peine de trois ans aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 juste, il s\u2019ensuit que M. Hilbach aurait d\u00fb se voir infliger une peine moins lourde s\u2019il avait fait usage d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu sans restrictions et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable en vertu de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1). Bien que le tribunal \u00ab n\u2019a[it] pas \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 la peine ou \u00e0 la fourchette de peines des valeurs pr\u00e9cises, sp\u00e9cialement dans le cas d\u2019une situation hypoth\u00e9tique raisonnable rev\u00eatant un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 \u00bb, il lui est utile de \u00ab consid\u00e9rer, ne serait\u2011ce qu\u2019implicitement, l\u2019\u00e9chelle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des peines qui sont appropri\u00e9es \u00bb (Lloyd, par. 23). Tout au plus, une peine \u00e0 purger dans une maison de correction aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une peine juste pour M. Hilbach s\u2019il avait commis son acte criminel avec une arme \u00e0 feu sans restrictions. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019une peine minimale obligatoire de quatre ans serait plus que simplement excessive dans les circonstances.\n[156] De surcro\u00eet, il n\u2019est pas rare que des crimes, tel le vol qualifi\u00e9, soient commis par plus d\u2019un d\u00e9linquant \u2014 il suffit de penser, par exemple, au \u00ab conducteur de la voiture des fuyards \u00bb (comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) ou au \u00ab guetteur \u00bb. Et, parce que \u00ab [l]e droit criminel canadien ne fait pas de distinction entre l\u2019auteur principal d\u2019une infraction et les participants \u00e0 l\u2019infraction pour d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle \u00bb (R. c. Briscoe, 2010 CSC 13, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 411, par. 13), quiconque aide ou encourage l\u2019auteur principal est coupable de la m\u00eame infraction et passible de la m\u00eame peine minimale obligatoire. C\u2019est le cas m\u00eame si l\u2019aide ou l\u2019encouragement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas planifi\u00e9 ou important.\n[157] Il est possible que les personnes qui aident et encouragent quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 commettre une infraction n\u2019aient pas automatiquement droit \u00e0 un rabais sur la dur\u00e9e de leur peine. Cependant, du seul fait qu\u2019une partie est criminellement responsable de la m\u00eame infraction que l\u2019auteur principal ne signifie pas qu\u2019elle m\u00e9rite la m\u00eame peine. Comme toujours, ce qui constitue une peine proportionn\u00e9e d\u00e9pendra des circonstances (Hills, par. 58), de fa\u00e7on plus particuli\u00e8re du degr\u00e9 de participation du d\u00e9linquant. La prise en consid\u00e9ration de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel dans la d\u00e9termination de la peine ne mine pas les dispositions relatives aux participants \u00e0 une infraction, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019incite des d\u00e9linquants \u00e0 aider ou \u00e0 encourager la perp\u00e9tration de crimes. Au contraire, elle est conforme au principe fondamental de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 718.1 : une peine doit \u00eatre proportionnelle \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction et au degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9linquant.\n[158] La Cour d\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Hilbach souligne que la responsabilit\u00e9 secondaire \u00e9largit \u00e9norm\u00e9ment la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction, et r\u00e9v\u00e8le encore plus l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) (par. 61 et 68). Nous sommes d\u2019accord pour dire que l\u2019affaire R. c. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, illustre bien ce fait.\n[159] Madame Link, une Autochtone, avait \u00e0 peine 18 ans et aucun casier judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9panneur. Aux prises avec des d\u00e9pendances \u00e0 l\u2019alcool et aux drogues depuis l\u2019\u00e2ge de 13 ans, ces probl\u00e8mes l\u2019ont amen\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019acoquiner avec un [traduction] \u00ab groupe d\u2019amis destructeurs \u00bb (par. 32). Au moment de l\u2019infraction, elle \u00e9tait sans domicile et, pour emprunter ses propres mots, elle [traduction] \u00ab volait pour survivre \u00bb (par. 53). \u00c0 l\u2019insu de Mme Link, son complice avait en sa possession une imitation d\u2019arme de poing qu\u2019il a point\u00e9e vers un employ\u00e9 pendant le vol qualifi\u00e9. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir son sac de cartouches de cigarettes apr\u00e8s que l\u2019arme a \u00e9t\u00e9 point\u00e9e. L\u2019employ\u00e9e l\u2019a d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] \u00ab complice, peut\u2011\u00eatre? \u00bb et \u00ab agit\u00e9e, pas vraiment impliqu\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 15). Elle a collabor\u00e9 avec les policiers, exprim\u00e9 des remords et repris sa vie en main apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement. Le juge de la peine l\u2019a condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 huit mois d\u2019emprisonnement avec sursis.\n[160] La Couronne plaide que l\u2019affaire Link n\u2019est pas un exemple d\u2019application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible du texte de loi : l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) ne s\u2019appliquait pas, car une imitation d\u2019arme de poing n\u2019est pas une \u00ab arme \u00e0 feu \u00bb, et Mme Link ne savait pas, avant le vol qualifi\u00e9, que son complice avait l\u2019arme \u00e0 feu sur lui. \u00c0 notre avis, cet argument rate la cible. La question consiste \u00e0 se demander si les caract\u00e9ristiques et la conduite du d\u00e9linquant peuvent aider le tribunal dans son examen des circonstances raisonnablement pr\u00e9visibles. Bien que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments aggravants aient pu \u00eatre absents dans les circonstances de Mme Link, nous sommes d\u2019accord pour dire que la peine inflig\u00e9e dans son cas \u00e9claire sur la nature de l\u2019infraction de vol qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e, la large fourchette de peines inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette infraction et les types de personnes qui la commettent.\n[161] Qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible ou non d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019intention coupable ou qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable arme de poing ou d\u2019une imitation, les circonstances de l\u2019affaire Link ne sont pas invraisemblables. Qui plus est, la diff\u00e9rence entre une imitation d\u2019arme de poing et une v\u00e9ritable arme de cette nature ne saurait expliquer le large \u00e9cart qui existe entre une peine de huit mois purg\u00e9e dans la communaut\u00e9 et une peine de quatre ans purg\u00e9e dans un p\u00e9nitencier. Le cas de Mme Link est une autre illustration qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une peine purg\u00e9e dans une maison de correction \u2014 voire une peine moindre \u2014 aurait pu \u00eatre une sanction proportionn\u00e9e suivant l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1). Une peine de quatre ans dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e en comparaison.\n[162] Vu la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9finition du terme arme \u00e0 feu (qui inclut les fusils \u00e0 balles BB, les fusils de paintball et les fusils \u00e0 clous), la gamme de conduites vis\u00e9es par l\u2019infraction (y compris le degr\u00e9 de participation au crime et la nature de cette participation, le niveau de violence et le niveau de sophistication), ainsi que la fr\u00e9quence de certaines circonstances personnelles, circonstances qui s\u2019entrecroisent souvent (notamment l\u2019autochtonit\u00e9, la jeunesse, les d\u00e9pendances \u00e0 diverses substances et les efforts de r\u00e9insertion sociale), il est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019une peine de quatre ans dans un p\u00e9nitencier constituerait une peine exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment disproportionn\u00e9e pour certains d\u00e9linquants.\n[163] En cons\u00e9quence, sur la base de l\u2019application raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible du texte de loi, nous souscrivons \u00e0 la conclusion des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures selon laquelle la peine minimale obligatoire pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12 de la Charte .\nC. Article premier\n[164] La Couronne n\u2019a avanc\u00e9 aucun argument fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019article premier de la Charte et ne s\u2019est donc pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau qui lui incombait de justifier la violation de l\u2019art. 12 . Les dispositions en cause ne peuvent pas \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9es par application de l\u2019article premier.\nIII. Dispositif\n[165] Par cons\u00e9quent, nous d\u00e9clarerions le sous\u2011al. 344(1)a)(i) et l\u2019al. 344(1)a.1) inop\u00e9rants en application du par. 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 .

En raison de son emploi, il jouissait d\u2019une immunit\u00e9 diplomatique. \u00c0 la suite de la d\u00e9couverte par une militaire des FAC en poste \u00e0 Washington de deux dispositifs d\u2019enregistrement audio dans sa r\u00e9sidence, le Service national des enqu\u00eates des Forces canadiennes (\u00ab SNEFC \u00bb) a effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate et a conclu qu\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que M avait commis les infractions de voyeurisme et de possession d\u2019un dispositif d\u2019interception clandestine de communications priv\u00e9es. Le SNEFC a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019aide de la police d\u2019Alexandria afin d\u2019obtenir un mandat suivant la loi de la Virginie. L\u2019ambassade canadienne a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de M relativement \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence et \u00e0 ses biens et la police d\u2019Alexandria a obtenu un mandat afin de fouiller sa r\u00e9sidence et les objets qui s\u2019y trouvaient, y compris les appareils \u00e9lectroniques, et d\u2019analyser les objets saisis.\nLorsque le SNEFC et la police d\u2019Alexandria ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le mandat de perquisition, les enqu\u00eateurs judiciaires ont scrut\u00e9 le contenu de certains appareils \u00e9lectroniques trouv\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9sidence de M afin de d\u00e9terminer lesquels devaient \u00eatre saisis. Ils ont d\u00e9couvert des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 des infractions non pr\u00e9vues, notamment une agression sexuelle. Les enqu\u00eateurs ont saisi les appareils, les ont envoy\u00e9s au Canada et ont obtenu des mandats canadiens de la Cour martiale en vue d\u2019analyser davantage leur contenu. M a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate devant la Cour martiale, plaidant que la fouille et la saisie de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques contrevenaient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte et demandant l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Le juge militaire a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, statuant que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale et qu\u2019en tout \u00e9tat de cause, la fouille et la saisie \u00e9taient compatibles avec les normes de la Charte . Il a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M coupable de voyeurisme, de possession d\u2019un dispositif d\u2019interception clandestine de communications priv\u00e9es, d\u2019agression sexuelle et de conduite d\u00e9shonorante. La Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du juge militaire. Elle a souscrit \u00e0 sa conclusion que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas et a statu\u00e9 que la preuve n\u2019avait aucune incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s en common law. De plus, elle a conclu que m\u00eame si la Charte s\u2019appliquait, la fouille ne contrevenait pas aux droits que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte garantit \u00e0 M.\nArr\u00eat : L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nLe juge en chef Wagner et les juges Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Kasirer et Jamal : Le SNEFC n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte garantit \u00e0 M. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 extraterritoriale de la Charte .\nUne perquisition ou une fouille vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte est raisonnable si elle est autoris\u00e9e par la loi, si la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019a rien d\u2019abusif et si la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re abusive. Les fouilles num\u00e9riques mettent en jeu des droits \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e sup\u00e9rieurs et distinctifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des donn\u00e9es personnelles. Une obligation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable s\u2019applique aux fouilles num\u00e9riques d\u2019appareils \u00e9lectroniques qui stockent des donn\u00e9es personnelles.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une autorisation visant l\u2019entr\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9sidence de M, ainsi que la fouille de celle\u2011ci et de ses biens, pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e uniquement par un magistrat local, en vertu de la loi de l\u2019\u00c9tat de Virginie. Le SNEFC a communiqu\u00e9 avec les autorit\u00e9s locales et a eu recours au seul m\u00e9canisme juridique \u00e0 sa disposition : il a d\u2019abord obtenu une renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019inviolabilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9sidence de M et de ses biens aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ambassade canadienne, et la police d\u2019Alexandria a ensuite obtenu un mandat de perquisition aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un magistrat local. Le mandat de la Virginie r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de l\u2019autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable pour les fouilles num\u00e9riques \u00e9tablie, et il autorisait express\u00e9ment la fouille et l\u2019analyse des appareils \u00e9lectroniques qui se trouvaient dans la r\u00e9sidence de M. Les policiers avaient des motifs pour fouiller les appareils \u00e9lectroniques car on pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils contiennent des preuves de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme. La fouille des appareils de M \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par la loi.\nDe plus, la fouille \u00e9tait raisonnable au regard des normes de la Charte . Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus intrusive que n\u00e9cessaire. Le mandat n\u2019englobait pas l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les infractions d\u2019agression sexuelle, mais la preuve inattendue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte lors du processus de triage des appareils \u00e9lectroniques sur les lieux de la fouille, comme l\u2019autorisait express\u00e9ment le mandat. La saisie des appareils incriminants et l\u2019obtention de mandats canadiens avant une analyse plus approfondie de leur contenu \u00e9taient conformes \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte . La th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue s\u2019applique aux fichiers r\u00e9v\u00e9lant la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle. Cette th\u00e9orie exige que les policiers aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement justifi\u00e9s pour une raison l\u00e9gitime de s\u2019introduire dans les lieux o\u00f9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis les objets bien en vue et que la preuve soit bien en vue, en ce qu\u2019elle est imm\u00e9diatement apparente et d\u00e9couverte par inadvertance. Ces deux exigences sont respect\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les enqu\u00eateurs avaient une justification l\u00e9gitime pour inspecter les fichiers contenant la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle. Les fichiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts pendant la recherche des types de fichiers sp\u00e9cifiquement recherch\u00e9s et autoris\u00e9s. De plus, les fichiers \u00e9taient bien en vue, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts par inadvertance et de leur caract\u00e8re illicite imm\u00e9diatement apparent. Les appareils contenant ces fichiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en vue de la saisie et d\u2019analyses plus pouss\u00e9es au Canada et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner en profondeur les fichiers afin de confirmer leur caract\u00e8re incriminant. L\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue est n\u00e9cessaire parce que les policiers n\u2019avaient aucun autre fondement justifiant la saisie des appareils contenant la preuve d\u2019une agression sexuelle.\nLe champ d\u2019application de la Charte est d\u00e9limit\u00e9 au par. 32(1) . La d\u00e9cision de la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Hape, 2007 CSC 26, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 292, est l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe concernant la port\u00e9e et les limites territoriales de la Charte au titre du par. 32(1) . Les intervenants ont invit\u00e9 la Cour \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, modifi\u00e9 ou infirm\u00e9, et s\u2019inspiraient de nombreuses critiques d\u2019auteurs concernant le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. La pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas un cas appropri\u00e9 pour r\u00e9examiner l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte . Premi\u00e8rement, les parties d\u00e9battent simplement de l\u2019application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Cour ne devrait pas infirmer un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sans qu\u2019une partie lui ait demand\u00e9 de le faire. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le r\u00e9examen de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape n\u2019aurait aucune incidence sur l\u2019issue du pourvoi. Troisi\u00e8mement, les critiques des auteurs ne constituent pas une raison suffisante pour faire fi du principe du stare decisis. Il est donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de remettre \u00e0 un autre jour tout r\u00e9examen du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape.\nLes juges Karakatsanis et Martin : Il y a accord pour dire que le pourvoi doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Le SNEFC n\u2019a pas enfreint l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont admissibles.\nL\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte est nettement soumise \u00e0 la Cour et c\u2019est une question qui se pose rarement, qui peut ais\u00e9ment \u00e9chapper au contr\u00f4le judiciaire, et qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019importantes critiques nourries de la part d\u2019experts en droit international. Il s\u2019agissait clairement de la question principale et pr\u00e9liminaire d\u00e9battue par les parties et de multiples intervenants, c\u2019\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9e, et la Cour a entendu des observations \u00e9toff\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, tant en droit constitutionnel qu\u2019en droit international. Par cons\u00e9quent, il convient de se prononcer sur la question centrale en litige : la Charte s\u2019applique\u2011t\u2011elle, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 32 , aux mesures d\u2019enqu\u00eate prises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger par les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes dans la situation de M?\nUne interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique du par. 32(1) de la Charte \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on extraterritoriale \u00e0 la conduite des agents du SNEFC lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019acquittent de leurs fonctions d\u2019enqu\u00eate dans un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, et qu\u2019un tribunal canadien peut \u00e9valuer cette conduite pour d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la Charte . Il est bien \u00e9tabli que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte doit \u00eatre t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, lib\u00e9rale et qu\u2019elle doit viser \u00e0 faire en sorte que les citoyens b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pleinement des protections accord\u00e9es par la Charte . Le texte et l\u2019objet de la Charte appuient son application extraterritoriale. Rien dans l\u2019art. 32 n\u2019impose ni m\u00eame ne sugg\u00e8re quelque limite territoriale que ce soit. Il restreint express\u00e9ment \u00e0 qui et \u00e0 quoi la Charte s\u2019applique, mais pas o\u00f9 elle s\u2019applique. Restreindre la port\u00e9e de la Charte \u00e0 tous les domaines relevant du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures n\u2019impose pas implicitement une limite territoriale. Ces mots ne font que renvoyer au partage des comp\u00e9tences pr\u00e9vu aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 . Le silence du par. 32(1) quant aux limites territoriales de la Charte \u00e9tait un choix d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. Si le par. 32(1) \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 faire une distinction entre les actes des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019\u00c9tat en sol canadien et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, une telle distinction aurait pu ais\u00e9ment \u00eatre formul\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re expresse, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ailleurs dans la Charte . L\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 32 \u00e9tait de restreindre l\u2019action du gouvernement, et le fait de permettre une action de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui n\u2019est pas restreinte par la Constitution serait incompatible avec la structure constitutionnelle du Canada, laquelle est bas\u00e9e sur le fait de pr\u00e9venir la conduite arbitraire de l\u2019\u00c9tat.\nLes juges majoritaires dans Hape ont eux aussi conclu que l\u2019art. 32 ne pr\u00e9voyait aucune limite territoriale expresse, mais, apr\u00e8s avoir recouru aux r\u00e8gles prohibitives du droit international coutumier, ils ont conclu que la Charte ne pouvait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas s\u2019appliquer aux actions des agents canadiens accomplies dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Cet aspect de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019importantes critiques nourries de la part d\u2019experts en droit international. Trois principales lacunes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9es \u00e0 cet arr\u00eat : (1) Hape a appliqu\u00e9 de mauvais principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, notamment des principes de comp\u00e9tence en droit international et un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1); (2) Hape a qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tort l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte d\u2019exercice ill\u00e9gal de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution; (3) les trois exceptions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans Hape sont inad\u00e9quates. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de pr\u00e9occupations importantes. Elles touchent au c\u0153ur de la jurisprudence de la Cour sur l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte , aux r\u00e9percussions pratiques de son application et au manque de coh\u00e9rence et de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 qui s\u2019ensuit dans ce domaine du droit. Bien que la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape demeure importante \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, vu ces pr\u00e9occupations, il convient de revoir le cadre d\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Toutefois, comme les juges majoritaires ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas l\u2019aborder, l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est erron\u00e9 doit \u00eatre remise \u00e0 une autre occasion.\nLes r\u00e8gles et directives de la Cour \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique imposent des limites \u00e0 ce que les intervenants peuvent plaider, mais ces limites n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 franchies en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Qui plus est, toute restriction du r\u00f4le des intervenants ne limite aucunement le pouvoir de la Cour de trancher des questions d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re que celle propos\u00e9e par les parties. Le r\u00f4le dont est investi la Cour, en tant que plus haut tribunal du pays, consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper la jurisprudence en analysant des questions qui ont de l\u2019importance pour le public, et une grande partie du travail de la Cour d\u00e9borde n\u00e9cessairement le strict minimum requis pour trancher le pourvoi. Bien que les intervenants ne doivent pas aborder de nouvelles questions, ils ont pour r\u00f4le d\u2019exprimer leur propre avis sur les questions de droit en soumettant des arguments utiles et diff\u00e9rents, ce qui \u00e9largit l\u2019\u00e9ventail des points de vue pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 remplir sa mission institutionnelle. Plusieurs intervenants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont fait exactement cela lorsqu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de revoir l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape : ils ont propos\u00e9 une conception diff\u00e9rente de la question de droit fondamentale de savoir si la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la conduite des agents du SNEFC.\n\u00c0 supposer que, conform\u00e9ment au par. 32(1) , la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la conduite des agents lors de leur enqu\u00eate, il n\u2019y a pas eu atteinte aux droits garantis \u00e0 M par l\u2019art. 8. Une fouille n\u2019est pas abusive si elle est autoris\u00e9e par la loi, si la loi n\u2019a rien d\u2019abusif et si la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re abusive; par ailleurs, une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable est requise pour la fouille d\u2019ordinateurs. Ces exigences sont respect\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par un juge de la Virginie autorisait express\u00e9ment la fouille d\u2019ordinateurs et d\u2019appareils \u00e9lectroniques, et on a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique de M. La loi qui autorisait la fouille \u00e9tait raisonnable compte tenu des normes relatives \u00e0 la Charte , et la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re abusive, puisque le mandat autorisait express\u00e9ment le processus de tri des appareils \u00e9lectroniques sur place.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019appliquer la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cette th\u00e9orie permet de saisir des objets sans mandat, mais M n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la saisie; il a plut\u00f4t plaid\u00e9 que la fouille enfreignait l\u2019art. 8. Les enqu\u00eateurs n\u2019ont pas cherch\u00e9 intentionnellement des fichiers au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qu\u2019autorisait le mandat. Lorsqu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9couvert que les appareils contenaient des preuves d\u2019autres infractions, ils les ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en vue de la saisie et d\u2019analyses plus pouss\u00e9es apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu un mandat canadien, et ils ont continu\u00e9 de chercher des preuves de voyeurisme, tel que le permettait le mandat. D\u00e9couvrir la preuve d\u2019une infraction non connexe ne les obligeait pas \u00e0 cesser enti\u00e8rement leur recherche relativement \u00e0 ce que le mandat les autorisait \u00e0 fouiller. La Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e0 trancher et ne devrait pas trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la question complexe de savoir dans quelles circonstances un fichier en particulier sur un appareil est saisi, par opposition aux circonstances o\u00f9 l\u2019appareil lui\u2011m\u00eame est saisi; ni M ni aucun des intervenants n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations \u00e0 ce sujet. De plus, la pr\u00e9misse suivant laquelle les fichiers d\u2019agression sexuelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis lorsque les policiers les ont vus au d\u00e9part est hautement discutable. Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il suffit que la saisie et le tri initiaux du portable contenant les preuves d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s par le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie et que la fouille et la saisie subs\u00e9quentes de ses fichiers \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es par le mandat canadien. La conduite des enqu\u00eateurs n\u2019exc\u00e9dait pas les limites de l\u2019autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable, et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue.\nLe juge Rowe : Il y a accord avec l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l\u2019analyse de la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9. Il y a d\u00e9saccord, toutefois, avec la d\u00e9marche des juges Karakatsanis et Martin concernant l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, qui d\u00e9borde le cadre des questions soulev\u00e9es par les parties et vise, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u00e0 l\u2019invitation des intervenants. Les parties se sont oppos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, tenant pour acquis que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent applicable. Aucune des parties n\u2019a remis en cause l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Au contraire, elles ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appliquer, avec les exceptions qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voit, aux faits du litige qui les oppose. Les deux tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure ont trait\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente affaire comme un cas d\u2019application ordinaire du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. La question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait continuer \u00e0 faire autorit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise aux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, pas plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la Cour.\nUne intervention vise \u00e0 saisir la Cour d\u2019all\u00e9gations utiles et diff\u00e9rentes du point de vue d\u2019un tiers fond\u00e9es sur son exp\u00e9rience et son expertise. Les intervenants fournissent d\u2019autres points de vue sur les questions juridiques soulev\u00e9es par les parties et les cons\u00e9quences plus larges que pourrait avoir la d\u00e9cision de la Cour. Les intervenants fournissent souvent une contribution importante. Pour ce faire, ils doivent agir \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des limites reconnues. De telles contraintes refl\u00e8tent une conception judicieuse du r\u00f4le des intervenants dans le cadre d\u2019un litige et du r\u00f4le de la Cour. Les parties m\u00e8nent leur cause comme elles l\u2019entendent et d\u00e9cident quelles questions soulever. Les intervenants ne doivent pas prendre position quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel; ils ne doivent pas soulever de nouvelles questions ou \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e des questions en litige ou y ajouter quoi que ce soit; et ils ne sont pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 apporter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter autrement le dossier sans permission pr\u00e9alable.\nLes intervenants qui outrepassent leur r\u00f4le causent pr\u00e9judice aux parties en usurpant la direction du litige. Le risque d\u2019inexactitude augmente lorsque les intervenants invitent la Cour \u00e0 raisonner dans l\u2019abstrait sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des d\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et d\u2019un dossier de preuve complet. Les interventions inappropri\u00e9es minent le processus d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel, qui repose sur un examen minutieux du dossier d\u2019appel et des questions soulev\u00e9es par les parties. Enfin, lorsque les intervenants \u00e9largissent les questions, les intervenants potentiels qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas intervenir sont priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leurs points de vue \u00e0 la Cour.\nSoulever la nouvelle question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait continuer \u00e0 faire autorit\u00e9 est une intervention inappropri\u00e9e. Elle fragilise l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 mener leur cause comme elles l\u2019entendent et est contraire \u00e0 leurs observations. Elle mine le processus d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel et exclut les intervenants potentiels. Elle invite la Cour \u00e0 raisonner dans l\u2019abstrait. La Cour n\u2019est pas saisie de la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devait continuer de faire autorit\u00e9 et le r\u00e9examen de cet arr\u00eat \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce exacerbe les pr\u00e9judices qu\u2019entra\u00eenent les interventions inappropri\u00e9es et fragilisent les limites interdisant l\u2019introduction de nouvelles questions.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s : R. c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi d\u00e9coule d\u2019une enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re criminelle effectu\u00e9e par le Service national des enqu\u00eates des Forces canadiennes (\u00ab SNEFC \u00bb) dans l\u2019\u00c9tat de Virginie, aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Le sujet de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, le caporal McGregor, plaide que la fouille et la saisie de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques contrevenaient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et il demande l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus en raison de ces op\u00e9rations.\n[2] Devant la Cour martiale, le caporal McGregor a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contest\u00e9s sur le fondement du par. 24(2) de la Charte . Il n\u2019a pas obtenu gain de cause. Le juge militaire l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable des chefs de voyeurisme, de possession d\u2019un dispositif d\u2019interception clandestine de communications priv\u00e9es, d\u2019agression sexuelle et de conduite d\u00e9shonorante. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale.\n[3] Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, la Cour est invit\u00e9e \u00e0 examiner l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte , au titre du par. 32(1) de celle\u2011ci. Les deux parties invoquent l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Hape, 2007 CSC 26, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 292, de notre Cour, qui est l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe sur la port\u00e9e et les limites territoriales de la Charte . Le caporal McGregor fait valoir que la Charte s\u2019appliquait aux actions du SNEFC, tandis que la Couronne plaide que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape impose un r\u00e9sultat contraire. Pour leur part, les intervenants ont ax\u00e9 leurs observations sur la question de savoir si le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, modifi\u00e9 ou infirm\u00e9.\n[4] En derni\u00e8re analyse, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la question de l\u2019extraterritorialit\u00e9 pour trancher le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Il en est ainsi parce que le SNEFC n\u2019a pas viol\u00e9 la Charte . Travaillant dans le cadre des limites de ses pouvoirs en Virginie, le SNEFC a sollicit\u00e9 la collaboration des autorit\u00e9s locales pour obtenir et ex\u00e9cuter un mandat suivant la loi de la Virginie. Le mandat accord\u00e9 autorisait express\u00e9ment la fouille, la saisie et l\u2019analyse des appareils \u00e9lectroniques du caporal McGregor. Les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert la preuve d\u2019une agression sexuelle par inadvertance lors du processus de tri des appareils, sur les lieux de la fouille; son caract\u00e8re incriminant \u00e9tait imm\u00e9diatement apparent. Bien que le mandat ne visait pas une telle preuve, les fichiers num\u00e9riques en cause relevaient nettement du champ d\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. De plus, le SNEFC a obtenu des mandats canadiens avant d\u2019entreprendre une analyse approfondie de ces appareils. Il est difficile de voir comment les enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC auraient pu agir diff\u00e9remment pour atteindre leurs objectifs l\u00e9gitimes d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Je conclus qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte garantit au caporal McGregor.\n[5] La pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas un cas appropri\u00e9 pour r\u00e9examiner le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ma conclusion selon laquelle les actions des enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC \u00e9taient conformes \u00e0 la Charte , un r\u00e9examen de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape n\u2019aurait aucun impact sur l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. De plus, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les parties n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour de r\u00e9examiner l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, mais ont plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 leurs plaidoiries sur la mani\u00e8re dont ce cadre d\u2019analyse devrait s\u2019appliquer aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne traite pas ci\u2011dessous de la question de savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; je d\u00e9montre plut\u00f4t que, m\u00eame si elle devait s\u2019appliquer, je serais tout de m\u00eame d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\nII. Contexte\n[6] Entre ao\u00fbt 2015 et mars 2017, le caporal McGregor \u00e9tait un militaire du rang au sein des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes r\u00e9guli\u00e8res affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat\u2011major de liaison des Forces canadiennes \u00e0 l\u2019ambassade du Canada, \u00e0 Washington. En raison de son emploi aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, le caporal McGregor avait le statut d\u2019agent diplomatique et jouissait d\u2019une immunit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 sa personne, ses biens et sa r\u00e9sidence, comme le pr\u00e9voit la Convention de Vienne sur les relations diplomatiques, R.T. Can. 1966 no 29.\n[7] En 2017, une militaire des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes en poste \u00e0 Washington a d\u00e9couvert deux dispositifs d\u2019enregistrement audio dans sa r\u00e9sidence. Elle croyait que le caporal McGregor les y avait plac\u00e9s et elle a signal\u00e9 cette d\u00e9couverte \u00e0 sa cha\u00eene de commandement. Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate, le SNEFC a conclu qu\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que le caporal McGregor avait commis les infractions de voyeurisme et de possession d\u2019un dispositif d\u2019interception clandestine de communications priv\u00e9es.\n[8] Le commandant ne pouvait pas d\u00e9livrer un mandat sur le fondement de l\u2019art. 273.3 de la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale , L.R.C. 1985, c. N\u20115 , afin d\u2019autoriser la fouille dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor, car celle\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas situ\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes. Le caporal\u2011chef Patridge, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur principal du SNEFC, a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019aide du service de police d\u2019Alexandria afin d\u2019obtenir un mandat suivant la loi de la Virginie, autorisant la fouille dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor \u00e0 Alexandria.\n[9] Le service de police d\u2019Alexandria a avis\u00e9 le SNEFC qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas demander un mandat en raison de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique que la Convention de Vienne conf\u00e9rait au caporal McGregor. Cela a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019envoi d\u2019une note diplomatique au Department of State am\u00e9ricain, dans laquelle l\u2019ambassade du Canada reconnaissait que [traduction] \u00ab le SNEFC collabore avec les autorit\u00e9s locales en Virginie et voudrait demander un mandat de perquisition afin d\u2019entrer dans la r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e du caporal McGregor en compagnie de policiers locaux, dans le but de recueillir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour les fins de son enqu\u00eate \u00bb (d.a., vol. I, p. 128). Dans la note, l\u2019ambassade renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 du caporal McGregor relativement \u00e0 sa [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses documents, de sa correspondance et de ses biens \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 30 de la Convention de Vienne, mais elle maintenait express\u00e9ment \u00ab l\u2019inviolabilit\u00e9 de sa personne et son immunit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019arrestation ou de d\u00e9tention \u00bb (p. 128).\n[10] Muni de la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique, le service de police d\u2019Alexandria a obtenu un mandat aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un magistrat local suivant la loi de la Virginie. Le mandat autorisait la fouille dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor \u00e0 Alexandria, de m\u00eame que la fouille des objets qui s\u2019y trouvaient \u2014 y compris les appareils \u00e9lectroniques. Le mandat autorisait en outre l\u2019analyse des objets saisis.\n[11] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2017, trois membres du SNEFC et le service de police d\u2019Alexandria ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le mandat de perquisition. Les agents du service de police d\u2019Alexandria ont d\u00e9fonc\u00e9 la porte, mis en place un p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et invit\u00e9 les enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC \u00e0 effectuer la fouille. Ces derniers ont pris le contr\u00f4le de la fouille. Deux enqu\u00eateurs judiciaires, l\u2019un du SNEFC et l\u2019autre du service de police d\u2019Alexandria, ont tri\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 des appareils \u00e9lectroniques trouv\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9sidence, scrutant leur contenu afin de d\u00e9terminer lesquels devaient \u00eatre saisis.\n[12] Pendant le processus de triage, les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 des infractions non pr\u00e9vues \u2014 notamment une agression sexuelle et ce qu\u2019ils pensaient \u00eatre de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile[1]. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur judiciaire du SNEFC, le lieutenant Rioux, a vu un fichier vid\u00e9o o\u00f9 le caporal McGregor se filmait pendant qu\u2019il touchait sexuellement une femme qui semblait \u00eatre allong\u00e9e inconsciente sur le sol.\n[13] Les enqu\u00eateurs n\u2019ont pas tri\u00e9 tous les appareils du caporal McGregor lorsqu\u2019ils ex\u00e9cutaient la fouille en raison des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis dans le mandat. Le service de police d\u2019Alexandria a saisi les appareils contenant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve incriminants ainsi que ceux qui n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un tri sur les lieux de la fouille. Les objets saisis \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor comprenaient trois faux d\u00e9tecteurs de fum\u00e9e munis de cam\u00e9ras cach\u00e9es, deux t\u00e9l\u00e9commandes pour ces cam\u00e9ras, deux appareils personnels d\u2019enregistrement audio, un r\u00e9veille\u2011matin ovale muni d\u2019une cam\u00e9ra, un r\u00e9veille\u2011matin carr\u00e9 muni d\u2019une cam\u00e9ra avec une t\u00e9l\u00e9commande, des ordinateurs portables, des appareils de stockage et des disques compacts.\n[14] Le service de police d\u2019Alexandria est retourn\u00e9 devant le magistrat de la Virginie pour rendre compte des appareils saisis, m\u00eame si le SNEFC en \u00e9tait d\u00e9positaire en tout temps. \u00c0 la suite de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, le SNEFC a envoy\u00e9 les appareils au Canada et a obtenu des mandats canadiens de la Cour martiale en vue d\u2019analyser davantage leur contenu. Un enqu\u00eateur du SNEFC a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation du caporal McGregor \u00e0 Washington et l\u2019a avis\u00e9 de son droit de recourir \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat, garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte .\nIII. Historique judiciaire\n[15] En premi\u00e8re instance, le juge militaire a statu\u00e9 que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale. Il a conclu que la fouille et la saisie \u00e9taient, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, compatibles avec les normes de la Charte , et a soulign\u00e9 que la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle relevait de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. Le juge militaire a donc admis la preuve relative \u00e0 l\u2019infraction d\u2019agression sexuelle (2018 CM 4023). Il a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le caporal McGregor coupable de deux chefs de voyeurisme, d\u2019un chef de possession d\u2019un dispositif d\u2019interception clandestine de communications priv\u00e9es, d\u2019un chef d\u2019agression sexuelle et d\u2019un chef de conduite d\u00e9shonorante (2019 CM 4015).\n[16] Dans une d\u00e9cision unanime, la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du juge militaire. Elle a souscrit \u00e0 sa conclusion que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas et a statu\u00e9 que la preuve n\u2019avait aucune incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s en common law. De plus, la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a conclu que m\u00eame si la Charte s\u2019appliquait, le r\u00e9sultat serait le m\u00eame parce que la fouille n\u2019a pas contrevenu aux droits que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte garantit au caporal McGregor (2020 CACM 8, 8 C.A.C.M. 481).\nIV. Questions en litige\n[17] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions principales :\n(i) La Charte s\u2019appliquait\u2011elle de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale aux enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC dans le cadre de la fouille dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor \u00e0 Alexandria, en Virginie?\n(ii) Les enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC ont\u2011ils port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits que la Charte garantit au caporal McGregor et, dans l\u2019affirmative, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus doivent\u2011ils \u00eatre exclus?\nV. Analyse\nA. Application extraterritoriale de la Charte\n[18] Le point de d\u00e9part de l\u2019analyse est le texte de la Constitution. Le champ d\u2019application de la Charte est d\u00e9limit\u00e9 au par. 32(1) :\n32 (1) La pr\u00e9sente charte s\u2019applique :\na) au Parlement et au gouvernement du Canada, pour tous les domaines relevant du Parlement, y compris ceux qui concernent le territoire du Yukon et les Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest;\nb) \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature et au gouvernement de chaque province, pour tous les domaines relevant de cette l\u00e9gislature.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat Hape de la Cour est l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe concernant la port\u00e9e et les limites territoriales de la Charte au titre du par. 32(1) . Selon le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans cet arr\u00eat, la Charte ne s\u2019applique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas aux autorit\u00e9s canadiennes qui participent \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est assortie de deux exceptions : (1) le consentement de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019application du droit canadien (par. 106); et (2) la participation du Canada \u00e0 un processus qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ses obligations internationales (par. 51\u201152 et 101; voir aussi Canada (Justice) c. Khadr, 2008 CSC 28, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 125, par. 18\u201119).\n[19] Contrairement aux citoyens civils canadiens, les membres des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes sont tenus d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019application extraterritoriale du droit criminel canadien (Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale , art. 67 et 163.5 ). De plus, la Convention entre les \u00c9tats parties au Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Atlantique Nord sur le statut de leurs forces, R.T. Can. 1953 no 13 \u2014 dont le Canada et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis sont signataires \u2014 gouverne le statut juridique, en droit international, des forces militaires d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es \u00e0 des fins officielles. La Convention dispose que l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019origine peut exercer ses pouvoirs de juridiction p\u00e9nale et disciplinaire sur les membres de ses forces militaires. Toutefois, la Convention ne conf\u00e8re aucune juridiction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019origine pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de fouilles dans des r\u00e9sidences situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des camps ou \u00e9tablissements militaires.\n[20] Le caporal McGregor pr\u00e9tend que la Charte s\u2019appliquait de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale \u00e0 la fouille et \u00e0 la saisie de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques par les autorit\u00e9s militaires canadiennes. Il souligne qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un membre des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes tenu d\u2019\u00eatre en sol \u00e9tranger et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait la cible d\u2019une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes, sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale et du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 . Selon le caporal McGregor, lorsque la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du territoire canadien, il devrait en principe en \u00eatre de m\u00eame pour la Charte . Je pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience devant notre Cour, le caporal McGregor a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appliquer la Charte uniquement aux actions des autorit\u00e9s canadiennes lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la fouille.\n[21] \u00c0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, les parties s\u2019accordent pour dire que la question de l\u2019application extraterritoriale devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9solue sur le fondement de la jurisprudence existante concernant le par. 32(1) de la Charte . Les intervenants, toutefois, invitent notre Cour \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, modifi\u00e9 ou infirm\u00e9. La plupart de leurs observations reposent sur de nombreuses critiques d\u2019auteurs o\u00f9 le cadre d\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est contest\u00e9 pour divers motifs d\u2019ordre constitutionnel et fond\u00e9s sur le droit international[2].\n[22] Certes, notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tenu compte d\u2019\u00e9crits doctrinaux en consid\u00e9rant la justesse de ses propres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents (voir Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, par. 39 et 209; Nishi c. Rascal Trucking Ltd., 2013 CSC 33, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 438, par. 28; Canada c. Craig, 2012 CSC 43, [2012] 2 R.C.S. 489, par. 29; Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Fraser, 2011 CSC 20, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 86\u201188, 146\u2011148 et 235\u2011246; R. c. Robinson, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 683, par. 39; Tolofson c. Jensen, [1994] 3 R.C.S. 1022, p. 1042; R. c. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 R.C.S. 740, p. 765\u2011771; London Drugs Ltd. c. Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 R.C.S. 299, p. 421\u2011423; R. c. Bernard, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 833, p. 865\u2011868). Bien entendu, cela ne signifie pas que les juges sont tenus d\u2019adopter l\u2019approche pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e dans les articles de doctrine ou que les critiques des auteurs constituent une raison suffisante pour faire fi du principe du stare decisis (voir Fraser, par. 86; R. c. Tran, 2010 CSC 58, [2010] 3 R.C.S. 350, par. 28\u201129; Friesen c. Canada, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 103, par. 56 et 58; B. (K.G.), p. 774\u2011777). Il importe de rappeler ce que j\u2019ai \u00e9crit avec mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Brown et Rowe dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Kirkpatrick, 2022 CSC 33, par. 248 : la seule existence de critiques ne justifie pas que la Cour infirme l\u2019un de ses propres jugements, mais elle peut aider une partie \u00e0 plaider en faveur de l\u2019infirmation d\u2019un jugement sur le fondement de motifs l\u00e9gitimes[3].\n[23] Je ne crois pas que la pr\u00e9sente affaire est un cas appropri\u00e9 pour r\u00e9examiner l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte . Les parties ne plaident pas que le cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9; elles d\u00e9battent simplement de son application aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 titre de r\u00e8gle, dont la Cour ne devrait s\u2019\u00e9carter que dans des situations rares et exceptionnelles, nous ne devrions pas infirmer un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sans qu\u2019une partie nous ait demand\u00e9 de le faire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, seuls certains intervenants nous ont demand\u00e9 d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape; en agissant ainsi, ils outrepassent leur r\u00f4le. Acc\u00e9der \u00e0 leur demande signifie que nous nous retrouverions \u00e0 trancher une question qui ne nous a pas d\u00fbment \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. De plus, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte n\u2019a aucune incidence sur l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. De fait, les actions des enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC \u00e9taient conformes \u00e0 la Charte , comme cela ressort clairement de l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 8 qui suit. Autrement dit, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi, m\u00eame si je devais accepter l\u2019argument du caporal McGregor selon lequel la Charte s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte.\n[24] Il est donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de remettre \u00e0 un autre jour tout r\u00e9examen du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Une approche empreinte de retenue est amplement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par notre jurisprudence. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge Sopinka dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Phillips c. Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la trag\u00e9die de la mine Westray), [1995] 2 R.C.S. 97 : \u00ab Notre Cour a dit \u00e0 maintes reprises qu\u2019elle ne devait pas se prononcer sur des points de droit lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de le faire pour r\u00e9gler un pourvoi. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai quand il s\u2019agit de questions constitutionnelles . . . \u00bb (par. 6; voir aussi R. c.

Il n\u2019y a pas de \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb (Cumming, p. 611) qui justifient de s\u2019\u00e9carter de ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Par cons\u00e9quent, je d\u00e9cline l\u2019invitation des intervenants \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner l\u2019approche qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter quant \u00e0 l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte . J\u2019ajouterais, comme l\u2019ont fait observer mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Brown et Rowe au par. 75 de l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Sharma, 2022 CSC 39, qu\u2019il est inappropri\u00e9 pour les intervenants de compl\u00e9ter le dossier de preuve en appel. Dans l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 8 qui suit, je d\u00e9montre que m\u00eame si la Charte devait s\u2019appliquer aux actions des enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC, le pourvoi serait tout de m\u00eame rejet\u00e9.\nB. Analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 8\n[25] Le caporal McGregor plaide que la fouille de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques violait les droits que lui garantit l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , soit parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par la loi, soit parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re abusive. Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011dessous, je rejette les deux arguments et je conclus que la conduite des enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC \u00e9tait compatible avec les exigences de la Charte .\n(1) Fouilles num\u00e9riques : principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\n[26] L\u2019article 8 de la Charte garantit le \u00ab droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives \u00bb. Une perquisition ou une fouille vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 est raisonnable \u00ab si elle est autoris\u00e9e par la loi, si la loi elle\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019a rien d\u2019abusif et si la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re abusive \u00bb (R. c. Collins, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 265, p. 278; voir aussi R. c. Caslake, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 51, par. 10; R. c. Nolet, 2010 CSC 24, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 851, par. 21; R. c.

Notre Cour a \u00e9tabli une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle \u00ab une perquisition ou une fouille doit [. . .] avoir fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une autorisation pr\u00e9alable, habituellement sous forme de mandat, accord\u00e9e par un arbitre neutre \u00bb (R. c. M. (M.R.), [1998] 3 R.C.S. 393, par. 44, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, p. 160\u2011162; voir aussi Vu, par. 22; R. c. Grant, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 223, p. 238\u2011239).\n[27] Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les tribunaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s aux difficult\u00e9s que posent les innovations technologiques dans l\u2019\u00e9volution du droit relatif aux fouilles, perquisitions et saisies. La jurisprudence de notre Cour sur les fouilles num\u00e9riques a toujours mis l\u2019accent sur les \u00ab divers droits \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u2014 \u00e0 la fois sup\u00e9rieurs et distinctifs \u2014 qui existent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des donn\u00e9es figurant dans un ordinateur personnel \u00bb (R. c. Reeves, 2018 CSC 56, [2018] 3 R.C.S. 531, par. 35; voir aussi Fearon, par. 74, 132 et 197; R. c. Spencer, 2014 CSC 43, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 212, par. 50; Vu, par. 40\u201141 et 47; R. c. Cole, 2012 CSC 53, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 34, par. 47; R. c. Morelli, 2010 CSC 8, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 253, par. 105\u2011106).\n[28] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu, la Cour a reconnu que la \u00ab nature particuli\u00e8re des ordinateurs \u00bb (par. 39) justifie des contraintes sp\u00e9cifiques sous l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , tant pour l\u2019autorisation que pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution raisonnable de fouilles num\u00e9riques. Dans un jugement unanime r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le juge Cromwell, la Cour a \u00e9tabli une \u00ab obligation [pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e] d\u2019obtenir une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable \u00bb applicable aux fouilles num\u00e9riques, comme cela est r\u00e9sum\u00e9 au par. 3 :\nEn pratique, voici ce que signifie l\u2019obligation d\u2019obtenir une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable : si les policiers ont l\u2019intention de fouiller les ordinateurs se trouvant dans le lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel ils sollicitent un mandat, ils doivent convaincre le juge de paix saisi de la demande d\u2019autorisation qu\u2019ils ont des motifs raisonnables de croire que tout ordinateur qu\u2019ils pourraient y trouver contiendra les choses qu\u2019ils recherchent. Si, dans le cours d\u2019une perquisition avec mandat, les policiers trouvent un ordinateur susceptible de contenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019ils sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 rechercher, et que le mandat dont ils disposent ne les autorise pas de mani\u00e8re expresse et pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 fouiller des ordinateurs, ils peuvent saisir l\u2019appareil, mais doivent obtenir une autre autorisation avant de le fouiller.\nJ\u2019ajoute que cette obligation s\u2019applique aux autres appareils \u00e9lectroniques qui ont [traduction] \u00ab une capacit\u00e9 de m\u00e9moire analogue \u00e0 celle d\u2019un ordinateur \u00bb (par. 38). Cette vaste cat\u00e9gorie comprend, par exemple, les appareils qui stockent des donn\u00e9es personnelles, comme les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones cellulaires (Fearon, par. 52).\n[29] Le fait que la fouille d\u2019un appareil \u00e9lectronique soit express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par mandat ne signifie pas que tout fichier qui y est contenu peut \u00eatre analys\u00e9 \u2014 m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019aucun protocole de fouille n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu, le juge Cromwell a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que les policiers sont \u00ab tenus de se conformer \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle requ\u00e9rant que la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la [fouille] ne soit pas abusive \u00bb (par. 61). En cons\u00e9quence, ils ne sont pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00ab passer sans discernement les appareils au peigne fin \u00bb (par. 61), mais doivent limiter leur fouille aux types de fichiers qui sont \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire[s] pour atteindre [les] objectifs \u00bb du mandat (par. 22). Si les policiers \u00ab s\u2019\u00e9taient rendu compte [. . .] qu\u2019il n\u2019existait en fait aucune raison de fouiller un logiciel ou un fichier sp\u00e9cifique dans l\u2019appareil, le droit relatif aux fouilles, perquisitions et saisies exigeait qu\u2019ils s\u2019abstiennent de le faire \u00bb (par. 61; voir aussi Fearon, par. 57 et 78; Reeves, par. 35).\n(2) Autorisation de la fouille\n[30] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une autorisation pr\u00e9alable d\u2019entr\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e uniquement par un magistrat local, en vertu de la loi de l\u2019\u00c9tat de Virginie. Ni le Code criminel ni la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale ne pr\u00e9voient la d\u00e9livrance de mandats autorisant la fouille de r\u00e9sidences priv\u00e9es situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[31] Compte tenu de la port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e du droit canadien, le SNEFC a communiqu\u00e9 avec les autorit\u00e9s locales et a eu recours au seul m\u00e9canisme juridique \u00e0 sa disposition. Le SNEFC a d\u2019abord obtenu la note diplomatique suivante de l\u2019ambassade canadienne :\n[traduction] . . . l\u2019ambassade a l\u2019honneur de renoncer \u00e0 l\u2019inviolabilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e du caporal McGregor, ainsi que de ses documents, de sa correspondance et de ses biens, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 30 de la Convention de Vienne sur les relations diplomatiques, \u00e0 seule fin de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un mandat de perquisition obtenu dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du SNEFC. De m\u00eame, l\u2019ambassade a l\u2019honneur de renoncer \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 du caporal McGregor de la juridiction civile et p\u00e9nale des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, strictement dans la mesure n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au tribunal comp\u00e9tent de d\u00e9livrer le mandat requis \u00e0 cette seule fin. L\u2019ambassade maintient express\u00e9ment toutes les autres immunit\u00e9s applicables, y compris l\u2019inviolabilit\u00e9 de sa personne et son immunit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019arrestation ou de d\u00e9tention. [Je souligne.]\n(d.a., vol. I, p. 128)\n\u00c0 la demande des enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC, le service de police d\u2019Alexandria a ensuite obtenu un mandat de perquisition aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un magistrat de la Virginie. Je souligne que le mandat de la Virginie r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de l\u2019\u00ab autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable \u00bb pour les fouilles num\u00e9riques \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu. Il autorisait express\u00e9ment non seulement la fouille dans la r\u00e9sidence du caporal McGregor, mais aussi la fouille et l\u2019analyse des appareils \u00e9lectroniques qui s\u2019y trouvaient :\n[traduction] Par la pr\u00e9sente, il vous est ordonn\u00e9, au nom de l\u2019\u00c9tat, de proc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la fouille du lieu, de la personne ou des choses qui suivent, de jour ou de nuit\n. . .\n\u00e0 la recherche des biens, objets et\/ou personnes qui suivent :\nAppareil photo, magn\u00e9toscope, autres dispositifs \u00e9lectroniques d\u2019enregistrement audio\/photo\/vid\u00e9o, ordinateur, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, autres dispositifs d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet, dispositifs de services Internet, dispositifs de stockage \u00e9lectronique externe, et de faire l\u2019analyse des objets saisis. La photographie des locaux et\/ou des objets saisis est autoris\u00e9e. [Je souligne.]\n(d.i., p. 2)\n[32] N\u00e9anmoins, le caporal McGregor soutient que la participation du SNEFC \u00e0 la fouille n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par la loi. Son premier argument \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est que la fouille ne respectait pas l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , parce que l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu exige un mandat distinct autorisant la fouille d\u2019appareils \u00e9lectroniques, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire un mandat distinct de celui autorisant la fouille de la r\u00e9sidence elle\u2011m\u00eame. Toutefois, la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que la substance de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu ne vise pas la forme du mandat de perquisition, mais plut\u00f4t l\u2019exigence que les policiers aient des motifs distincts de fouiller les appareils \u00e9lectroniques (Vu, par. 48). De tels motifs existaient en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car on pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les appareils contiennent des preuves de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme.\n[33] L\u2019argument principal du caporal McGregor concernant l\u2019autorisation est que la fouille ne tombait pas sous le coup de la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique accord\u00e9e par le Canada au titre de la Convention de Vienne. Il en est ainsi, selon lui, parce que la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique ne visait pas la fouille et la saisie de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques, puisqu\u2019elle s\u2019appliquait uniquement \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Alexandria, en Virginie.\n[34] Je ne peux faire droit \u00e0 cet argument. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019accepte que le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer la fouille des appareils \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur la Convention de Vienne, je conclus que, selon une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la note diplomatique de l\u2019ambassade canadienne, la renonciation englobait \u00e0 la fois la fouille de la r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e du caporal McGregor et la fouille de ses appareils \u00e9lectroniques. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence expresse aux \u00ab biens \u00bb du caporal McGregor dans la note diplomatique contredit manifestement son argument selon lequel [traduction] \u00ab [l]a renonciation se limitait \u00e0 [sa] r\u00e9sidence [. . .]. Elle ne visait pas le contenu des appareils \u00e9lectroniques \u00bb (m.a., par. 187). L\u2019argument du caporal McGregor selon lequel la fouille de ses appareils n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par la loi ne peut donc pas \u00eatre retenu.\n(3) Caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la fouille\n[35] Le caporal McGregor fait en outre valoir que la fouille \u00e9tait abusive, au regard des normes de la Charte , en ce sens qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait plus intrusive que n\u00e9cessaire. Il plaide que les enqu\u00eateurs ont \u00e9largi de fa\u00e7on injustifi\u00e9e la port\u00e9e de la fouille des appareils \u00e9lectroniques pour qu\u2019elle comprenne les infractions d\u2019agression sexuelle et (ce qu\u2019ils ont cru \u00eatre) de pornographie juv\u00e9nile, alors que le mandat visait uniquement les infractions d\u2019introduction par effraction, de m\u00e9fait, d\u2019interception, de harc\u00e8lement et de voyeurisme. Selon lui, une fois que les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve inattendus, la Charte exigeait qu\u2019ils mettent fin \u00e0 la fouille, qu\u2019ils saisissent les appareils \u00e9lectroniques et qu\u2019ils obtiennent un mandat subs\u00e9quent permettant l\u2019analyse des fichiers en question.\n[36] Je ne peux accepter cet argument. Il est incontest\u00e9 que le mandat de la Virginie n\u2019englobait pas l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les infractions d\u2019agression sexuelle. Toutefois, la d\u00e9couverte d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve inattendus n\u2019invalide pas l\u2019autorisation d\u2019effectuer une fouille pour les fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le mandat original. Ce principe n\u2019est pas nouveau et il rend l\u2019argument du caporal McGregor sans fondement, du moins en ce qui concerne la preuve recherch\u00e9e (voir, par exemple, Canadian Pacific Wine Co. c. Tuley, [1921] 2 A.C. 417 (C.P.), p. 424\u2011425). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert la preuve contest\u00e9e alors qu\u2019ils effectuaient le tri des appareils \u00e9lectroniques du caporal McGregor sur les lieux de la fouille, comme l\u2019autorisait express\u00e9ment le mandat. Les enqu\u00eateurs ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les appareils incriminants en vue de la saisie et d\u2019une analyse plus approfondie. De fait, le SNEFC a obtenu des mandats canadiens avant d\u2019analyser davantage leur contenu. \u00c0 mon avis, un tel processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte .\n[37] L\u2019admission des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve inattendus d\u00e9couverts pendant le processus de triage ne contrevient pas non plus aux droits que l\u2019art. 8 garantit au caporal McGregor. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 de mon raisonnement est l\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue aux fichiers r\u00e9v\u00e9lant la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle. Cette th\u00e9orie de common law repousse la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les saisies doivent \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es par voie judiciaire. La jurisprudence de notre Cour nous enseigne que deux exigences doivent \u00eatre remplies pour que la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue s\u2019applique : (1) les policiers doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab pr\u00e9alablement justifi\u00e9[s] [pour une raison l\u00e9gitime] de s\u2019introduire dans les lieux o\u00f9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis les objets \u201cbien en vue\u201d \u00bb (R. c. Buhay, 2003 CSC 30, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 631, par. 37); et (2) la preuve incriminante doit \u00eatre bien en vue en ce qu\u2019elle est \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement apparente \u00bb et \u00ab d\u00e9couverte par inadvertance \u00bb par les policiers (R. c. Law, 2002 CSC 10, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 227, par. 27; voir aussi Buhay, par. 37). Des auteurs ont exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves sur la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue dans le contexte des saisies d\u2019appareils \u00e9lectroniques (p. ex., L. J\u00f8rgensen, \u00ab In Plain View?: R v Jones and the Challenge of Protecting Privacy Rights in an Era of Computer Search \u00bb (2013), 46 U.B.C. L. Rev. 791). Vu la fa\u00e7on dont la pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exprimer une opinion d\u00e9finitive sur les limites de la th\u00e9orie. Toutefois, je suis convaincue qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique sous une forme ou une autre aux appareils \u00e9lectroniques (R. c. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ne fait aucun doute que la th\u00e9orie s\u2019applique.\n[38] Un mandat fournit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une justification l\u00e9gitime pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019intrusion, ce qui satisfait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re exigence de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. Tel n\u2019est pas le cas, toutefois, lorsque les policiers effectuent une fouille abusive. Dans le contexte des fouilles num\u00e9riques, l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable s\u2019applique uniquement aux types de fichiers qui sont \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire[s] \u00bb \u00e0 la bonne ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une telle fouille (Vu, par. 22). Autrement dit, il doit y avoir un lien raisonnable entre les fichiers examin\u00e9s et les fins du mandat pour que la fouille r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re exigence de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue.\n[39] M\u00eame lorsque les policiers sont au d\u00e9part justifi\u00e9s d\u2019examiner un fichier num\u00e9rique, la preuve inattendue qui y est contenue n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement bien en vue. Le raisonnement de la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Law illustre bien la deuxi\u00e8me exigence de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. Dans cette affaire, un policier a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen superficiel des documents en question et a conclu que les documents \u00ab ne paraissaient pas irr\u00e9guliers \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00bb (par. 27). Le policier n\u2019a \u00ab d\u00e9tect\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment incriminant par le seul usage de ses sens \u00bb, car la nature incriminante de la preuve \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte seulement apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut examin\u00e9, fait traduire et photocopi\u00e9 plusieurs documents \u00bb (par. 27; voir aussi Buhay, par. 37; R. c. Gill, 2019 BCCA 260, par. 59 (CanLII)). En cons\u00e9quence, notre Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument selon lequel les documents \u00e9taient bien en vue, puisqu\u2019ils \u00ab n\u2019[avaient] pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvert[s] par inadvertance et [. . .] n\u2019\u00e9taient pas [des] \u00e9l\u00e9ment[s] de preuve manifeste[s] \u00bb (Law, par. 10).\n[40] Appliquant les principes susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que les deux exigences de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue sont respect\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019application de cette th\u00e9orie aux fouilles num\u00e9riques donne sans aucun doute lieu \u00e0 des questions complexes, mais la pr\u00e9sente cause est relativement simple. Le juge militaire a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue s\u2019applique \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle stock\u00e9e dans les appareils du caporal McGregor.\n[41] Premi\u00e8rement, les enqu\u00eateurs avaient une justification l\u00e9gitime pour inspecter les fichiers contenant la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle sur les lieux de la fouille. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le mandat de la Virginie satisfaisait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vu, applicable aux fouilles num\u00e9riques. De plus, le juge militaire a conclu que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a d\u00e9couverte des fichiers relatifs \u00e0 une possible agression sexuelle [. . .] a eu lieu pendant la recherche des types de fichiers sp\u00e9cifiquement recherch\u00e9s et autoris\u00e9s \u00bb (d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019issue du voir\u2011dire, par. 25 (CanLII)). Les enqu\u00eateurs [traduction] \u00ab [ont] fait preuve de tact afin de limiter les incidences de la fouille en effectuant un tri et en r\u00e9alisant une fouille cibl\u00e9e qui impliquait le moins de renseignements personnels possible \u00bb (par. 27). Dans de telles circonstances, la fouille initiale menant \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte des fichiers en cause respecte l\u2019exigence de justification pr\u00e9alable.\n[42] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les fichiers num\u00e9riques r\u00e9v\u00e9lant la preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e9taient bien en vue, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts par inadvertance et de leur caract\u00e8re illicite imm\u00e9diatement apparent. Les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert ces dossiers pendant le processus de triage, lequel visait \u00e0 identifier rapidement les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019interception et du voyeurisme. Le juge militaire a rejet\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab les arguments selon lesquels les enqu\u00eateurs ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher dans des fichiers qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 regarder selon le mandat \u00bb (par. 25). Il a aussi fait observer que [traduction] \u00ab tous les appareils qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s comme contenant possiblement de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile et des fichiers relatifs \u00e0 une agression sexuelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en vue de la saisie et d\u2019analyses plus pouss\u00e9es au Canada \u00bb (par. 25). En outre, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner en profondeur les fichiers afin de confirmer leur caract\u00e8re incriminant \u2014 contrairement aux documents dans l\u2019affaire Law, lesquels n\u2019\u00e9taient pas illicites \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Je conclus donc que la preuve contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait bien en vue et que la saisie de celle\u2011ci pendant le processus de triage ne violait pas l\u2019art. 8, que ce soit dans le cadre d\u2019une fouille effectu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou d\u2019une saisie abusive.\n[43] Avec \u00e9gards pour l\u2019opinion contraire de mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Karakatsanis et Martin, je crois que l\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue est n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je ne vois pas sur quel fondement la police pourrait justifier la saisie des appareils contenant la preuve d\u2019une agression sexuelle, ou les donn\u00e9es r\u00e9elles constituant cette preuve, sans avoir recours \u00e0 cette th\u00e9orie. Je reconnais que les appareils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fouill\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au mandat de la Virginie, mais ce mandat n\u2019autorisait pas la saisie de preuves d\u2019une agression sexuelle. Apr\u00e8s tout, le mandat a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en vue de la recherche et de la saisie de preuves pour voyeurisme. Un mandat en soi ne constitue pas un pouvoir de chercher tout ce qui pourrait servir de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toute infraction que ce soit, ou de saisir de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments; la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue ou l\u2019art. 489 du Code criminel peut autoriser de telles saisies, mais seulement si les exigences relatives \u00e0 celles\u2011ci sont respect\u00e9es. Pour \u00eatre claire, je suis donc en d\u00e9saccord avec mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Karakatsanis et Martin, et je ne vois pas l\u2019utilit\u00e9 d\u2019analyser davantage leurs motifs \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[44] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le SNEFC s\u2019est manifestement conform\u00e9 aux exigences de la Charte . Les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve incriminants lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une fouille num\u00e9rique express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par un mandat valide. La preuve de l\u2019agression sexuelle, m\u00eame si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9e par le mandat original, tombait nettement sous le coup de la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. Les enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC ont saisi la preuve conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette th\u00e9orie et ont par la suite obtenu des mandats canadiens avant d\u2019effectuer une analyse plus approfondie des fichiers en cause. M\u00eame selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du droit que fait le caporal McGregor, il est difficile de voir comment les enqu\u00eateurs du SNEFC auraient pu se conformer davantage \u00e0 la Charte . Comme j\u2019ai conclu que le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me penche sur l\u2019argument du caporal McGregor selon lequel la preuve doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e en vertu du par. 24(2) .\nVI. Conclusion\n[45] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi et de confirmer les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 du caporal McGregor.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLes juges Karakatsanis et Martin \u2014\nI. Aper\u00e7u\n[46] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un membre des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes qui doit subir son proc\u00e8s devant un tribunal canadien invoque les protections offertes par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de mesures prises par des agents canadiens \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Le caporal McGregor r\u00e9clame l\u2019exclusion du contenu de certains appareils \u00e9lectroniques saisis chez lui par des agents canadiens et am\u00e9ricains dans l\u2019\u00c9tat de Virginie. Il soutient que l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte s\u2019applique et qu\u2019il y a eu atteinte aux droits que lui garantit la Charte parce que, selon le droit canadien, il fallait obtenir un autre mandat pour fouiller ses appareils.\n[47] Bien que nous soyons d\u2019accord pour dire que le pourvoi doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, nous nous pronon\u00e7ons aussi sur la question centrale directement en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi : la Charte s\u2019applique\u2011t\u2011elle, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 32 , aux mesures d\u2019enqu\u00eate prises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger par les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes dans de telles circonstances? Il s\u2019agissait clairement de la question principale et pr\u00e9liminaire d\u00e9battue par les parties et de multiples intervenants, c\u2019\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9e, et nous avons entendu des observations \u00e9toff\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, tant en droit constitutionnel qu\u2019en droit international. L\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte est nettement soumise \u00e0 la Cour et c\u2019est une question qui se pose rarement, qui peut ais\u00e9ment \u00e9chapper au contr\u00f4le judiciaire, et qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019importantes critiques nourries de la part d\u2019experts en droit international.\n[48] Bien que l\u2019extraterritorialit\u00e9 de la Charte puisse entrer en jeu dans de nombreux types diff\u00e9rents de situations, nous nous pronon\u00e7ons seulement sur la question pr\u00e9cise dont nous sommes saisis, \u00e0 savoir si la Charte s\u2019applique aux personnes assujetties au droit criminel canadien en raison d\u2019actes commis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u2014 que ce soit du fait du service militaire ou autrement \u2014 et aux agents canadiens dont les enqu\u00eates sur des infractions d\u00e9passent les fronti\u00e8res canadiennes.\n[49] Nous commen\u00e7ons par interpr\u00e9ter le par. 32(1) de la Charte , et nous concluons que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique requise \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on extraterritoriale \u00e0 la conduite des agents du Service national des enqu\u00eates des Forces canadiennes (\u00ab SNEFC \u00bb) lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019acquittent de leurs fonctions d\u2019enqu\u00eate dans un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, et qu\u2019un tribunal canadien peut \u00e9valuer cette conduite pour d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la Charte . Il s\u2019agissait \u00e9galement de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 32 approuv\u00e9e par les juges majoritaires dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Hape, 2007 CSC 26, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 292. Cependant, ils estimaient en outre que les principes de comp\u00e9tence en droit international exigeaient une interpr\u00e9tation plus restrictive de l\u2019art. 32. Nous disons qu\u2019il est temps de revoir cette interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, car celle\u2011ci s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9e de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ant\u00e9rieurs et les a infirm\u00e9s en l\u2019absence d\u2019un d\u00e9bat complet sur les principes de droit international. De plus, selon les sp\u00e9cialistes du domaine, la Cour a mal appliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape certains principes cl\u00e9s du droit international pour arriver aux conclusions qu\u2019elle a tir\u00e9es. M\u00eame si nous convenons que, s\u2019agissant de la correction d\u2019erreur, le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame que la Charte s\u2019applique ou non, l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 des agents canadiens qui font enqu\u00eate sur des Canadiens \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger est un enjeu pressant qui est nettement soulev\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que des questions importantes se posent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la justesse de la conclusion tir\u00e9e dans Hape selon laquelle la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 une telle mesure d\u2019enqu\u00eate, vu la conclusion des juges majoritaires, nous trancherons \u00e0 une autre occasion la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est mal fond\u00e9.\nII. Interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1) de la Charte\n[50] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte doit \u00eatre t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, lib\u00e9rale et qu\u2019elle doit viser \u00e0 faire en sorte que les citoyens b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pleinement des protections accord\u00e9es par la Charte (R. c. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, p. 344; Hunter c. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 R.C.S. 145, p. 156). Suivant cette approche, le texte et l\u2019objet de la Charte appuient tous les deux son application extraterritoriale ainsi que la conclusion selon laquelle la Charte s\u2019applique aux autorit\u00e9s canadiennes qui m\u00e8nent des enqu\u00eates \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[51] Rien dans le texte de l\u2019art. 32 n\u2019impose ni m\u00eame ne sugg\u00e8re quelque limite territoriale que ce soit. Le texte restreint express\u00e9ment \u00e0 qui la Charte s\u2019applique : les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial ainsi que leurs l\u00e9gislatures. Le paragraphe 32(1) restreint express\u00e9ment aussi \u00e0 quoi la Charte s\u2019applique : \u00ab . . . tous les domaines relevant . . . \u00bb du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales. Fait important, le par. 32(1) n\u2019impose aucune restriction expresse sur le lieu o\u00f9 la Charte s\u2019applique (Hape, par. 161, le juge Bastarache).\n[52] On ne peut pas non plus affirmer que la restriction de la port\u00e9e de la Charte pr\u00e9vue au par. 32(1) \u00e0 \u00ab tous les domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures impose implicitement une limite territoriale au champ d\u2019application de la Charte . D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019a dit la juge Wilson (avec qui le juge en chef Dickson \u00e9tait d\u2019accord sur ce point) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Operation Dismantle Inc. c. La Reine, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 441, cette expression utilis\u00e9e au par. 32(1) , \u00ab comme son pendant \u201crelevant de cette l\u00e9gislature\u201d [. . .], n\u2019[\u00e9tait] qu\u2019un renvoi au partage des comp\u00e9tences pr\u00e9vu aux art. 91 et 92 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 \u00bb (p. 455 et 463\u2011464). Elle d\u00e9crit simplement \u00ab les mati\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles le Parlement du Canada peut l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer ou le gouvernement du Canada peut agir en tant qu\u2019ex\u00e9cutif \u00bb (p. 464). En cons\u00e9quence, dans le contexte du par. 32(1) , ces expressions n\u2019impliquent ni n\u2019imposent aucune restriction territoriale \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte . Leur donner ce sens serait non seulement incompatible avec la jurisprudence (voir C. Sethi, \u00ab Does the Charter Follow the Flag? Revisiting Constitutional Extraterritoriality after R v Hape \u00bb (2011), 20 Dal. J. Leg. Stud. 102, p. 113; R. J. Currie et J. Rikhof, International & Transnational Criminal Law (3e \u00e9d. 2020), p. 633\u2011634), mais ne reconna\u00eetrait pas non plus que le Canada a le pouvoir constitutionnel d\u2019adopter des lois d\u2019application extraterritoriale (Statut de Westminster de 1931 (R.\u2011U.), 22 Geo. 5, c. 4, art. 3; Reference re Offshore Mineral Rights of British Columbia, [1967] R.C.S. 792, p. 816; Hape, par. 66 et 68; voir aussi Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation , L.R.C. 1985, c. I\u201121, par. 8(3) ).\n[53] Si le par. 32(1) \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 faire une distinction entre les actes des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019\u00c9tat en sol canadien et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, une telle distinction aurait pu ais\u00e9ment \u00eatre formul\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re expresse, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ailleurs dans des dispositions comme les art. 3 , 6 et 23 de la Charte , lesquels \u00e9tablissent des distinctions en fonction de la citoyennet\u00e9 (A. Attaran, \u00ab Have Charter, Will Travel? Extraterritoriality in Constitutional Law and Canadian Exceptionalism \u00bb (2008), 87 R. du B. can. 515, p. 523; voir aussi L. West, \u00ab Canada Stands Alone : A Comparative Analysis of the Extraterritorial Reach of State Human Rights Obligations \u00bb (U.B.C. L. Rev., \u00e0 venir), p. 8\u201110). Lorsqu\u2019on tient compte de ce qui n\u2019est pas dans le texte du par. 32(1) , mais qui se trouve ailleurs dans la Charte , on est confirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019aucune limite territoriale n\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue. Le silence du par. 32(1) quant aux limites territoriales de la Charte , alors que d\u2019autres dispositions sont fond\u00e9es sur la citoyennet\u00e9 ou ne s\u2019appliquent explicitement qu\u2019au Canada, n\u2019est ni une omission ni le fruit du hasard : il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019un choix d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ne pas restreindre la port\u00e9e territoriale de la Charte qui doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9.\n[54] L\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 32 \u00e9tait de restreindre l\u2019action de l\u2019\u00c9tat dans la nouvelle d\u00e9mocratie constitutionnelle \u00e9tablie. Comme notre Cour l\u2019a reconnu, les mots utilis\u00e9s au par. 32(1) \u00ab indiquent clairement que l\u2019application de la Charte se restreint \u00e0 l\u2019action gouvernementale. [. . .] [L]a C harte est essentiellement un instrument de contr\u00f4le des pouvoirs du gouvernement sur le particulier \u00bb (McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, p. 261). Le fait de permettre une action de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui n\u2019est pas restreinte par la Constitution serait incompatible avec notre structure constitutionnelle, laquelle est bas\u00e9e sur le fait de pr\u00e9venir la conduite arbitraire de l\u2019\u00c9tat (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la s\u00e9cession du Qu\u00e9bec, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 217, par. 70). La seule revendication du gouvernement, qui inclut l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, d\u2019exercer une autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gitime \u00ab r\u00e9side dans les pouvoirs que leur conf\u00e8re la Constitution. Cette autorit\u00e9 ne peut avoir d\u2019autre source \u00bb (par. 72). En cons\u00e9quence, il n\u2019y a aucune action gouvernementale l\u00e9gitime sans l\u2019existence de limites constitutionnelles correspondantes \u2014 peu importe le lieu o\u00f9 survient la conduite. Comme l\u2019a dit une autrice, [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019ex\u00e9cutif ne peut pas agir \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la Constitution et \u00eatre n\u00e9anmoins respectueux de la r\u00e8gle de droit. Lorsqu\u2019il est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale, il doit y aller comme un gouvernement constitutionnel \u2014 et non pas un gouvernement arbitraire. Il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re arbitraire \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de son territoire \u00bb (M. Webb, \u00ab The Constitutional Question of Our Time : Extraterritorial Application of the Charter and the Afghan Detainees Case \u00bb (2011), 28 R.N.D.C. 235, p. 256).\n[55] Par cons\u00e9quent, une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique du par. 32(1) m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que la disposition n\u2019\u00e9tablit aucune distinction entre l\u2019application interne et extraterritoriale de la Charte . Au contraire, elle indique clairement que la Charte est un instrument de contr\u00f4le des pouvoirs du gouvernement sur le particulier et d\u2019interdiction de toute action de l\u2019\u00c9tat incompatible avec les droits et libert\u00e9s que la Charte consacre (McKinney, p. 261; voir aussi Hape, par. 91). En cons\u00e9quence, vu cette interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1) , la Charte s\u2019appliquerait afin de restreindre les actions des autorit\u00e9s canadiennes qui m\u00e8nent des enqu\u00eates, que cette conduite survienne \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada.\nIII. L\u2019arr\u00eat Hape\n[56] Dans Hape, s\u2019exprimant au nom des juges majoritaires, le juge LeBel a \u00e9galement commenc\u00e9 avec le texte du par. 32(1) de la Charte et a lui aussi conclu qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9voyait aucune limite territoriale expresse (par. 32 et 94). Les juges majoritaires de la Cour ont toutefois jug\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat que la Charte ne s\u2019appliquait pas aux fouilles, perquisitions et saisies de documents bancaires effectu\u00e9es par la Gendarmerie royale du Canada aux \u00eeles Turks et Caicos (par. 2\u201114). La majorit\u00e9 a infirm\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Cook, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 597, et \u00e9nonc\u00e9 un nouveau cadre en deux \u00e9tapes qui permet de d\u00e9terminer si une r\u00e9paration peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour l\u2019action \u00e9tatique canadienne extraterritoriale qui aurait viol\u00e9 la Charte . \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019activit\u00e9 en question tombe sous le coup du par. 32(1) en se demandant : (1) si la conduite en question est celle d\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien; et (2), dans l\u2019affirmative, selon les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, s\u2019il existe une exception au principe de souverainet\u00e9 justifiant l\u2019application de la Charte aux activit\u00e9s extraterritoriales du repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019\u00c9tat. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019exception et que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas, alors, \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape, le tribunal doit se demander si la preuve devrait \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e du proc\u00e8s au motif que son admission est de nature \u00e0 compromettre l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s (par. 113).\n[57] Le juge LeBel a choisi de recourir aux r\u00e8gles prohibitives du droit international coutumier pour faciliter l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 32 de la Charte (par. 35\u201139). Le droit international coutumier se compose de normes qui r\u00e9pondent aux deux exigences de la pratique des \u00c9tats et de l\u2019opinio juris : les \u00c9tats doivent respecter la norme et la consid\u00e9rer comme juridiquement contraignante (par. 46). Les juges majoritaires dans Hape se sont attach\u00e9s au principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 souveraine, lequel repose sur le respect de la souverainet\u00e9 territoriale et est \u00ab indissociable \u00bb du principe de non\u2011intervention, selon lequel tous les \u00c9tats sont souverains et \u00e9gaux (par. 40 et 45\u201146). Les juges majoritaires se sont fond\u00e9s sur la doctrine de l\u2019adoption pour conclure que les principes de non\u2011intervention et de souverainet\u00e9 territoriale doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la Charte . Ils ont \u00e9galement appliqu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9, un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative selon lequel une loi est r\u00e9put\u00e9e conforme au droit international, \u00e0 moins que son libell\u00e9 ne commande un autre r\u00e9sultat (par. 39, 46 et 53). Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la Charte , la Cour doit tendre \u00e0 assurer le respect des obligations du Canada en droit international lorsque le libell\u00e9 expr\u00e8s de la Charte le permet.\n[58] Les juges majoritaires ont constat\u00e9 que la courtoisie entre les nations \u2014 d\u00e9finie comme \u00ab la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et le respect que des \u00c9tats doivent avoir pour les actes qu\u2019un autre \u00c9tat a l\u00e9gitimement accomplis sur son territoire \u00bb \u2014 \u00e9tait un autre principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui aide \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e extraterritoriale de la Charte (par. 32\u201133, 47, 50 et 53\u201156, citant Morguard Investments Ltd. c. De Savoye, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 1077, p. 1095). Le juge LeBel a fait observer que la courtoisie incite les \u00c9tats \u00e0 collaborer les uns avec les autres pour \u00e9lucider les crimes transfrontaliers et veut que l\u2019\u00c9tat qui en aide un autre respecte la fa\u00e7on dont cette assistance est fournie sur le territoire de celui\u2011ci. Toutefois, il a clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 que le principe de la courtoisie \u00ab ne saurait justifier un \u00c9tat de tol\u00e9rer la violation du droit international par un autre \u00c9tat \u00bb et que la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence li\u00e9e \u00e0 la courtoisie \u00ab cesse d\u00e8s la violation manifeste du droit international et des droits fondamentaux de la personne \u00bb (par. 51\u201152).\n[59] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ces autres principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, les juges majoritaires ont examin\u00e9 et appliqu\u00e9 les principes de comp\u00e9tence en droit international. Le juge LeBel a fait remarquer qu\u2019il y a trois formes de comp\u00e9tence : la comp\u00e9tence normative, la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution et la comp\u00e9tence juridictionnelle. La comp\u00e9tence normative \u00ab conf\u00e8re le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles, des prescriptions ou des droits opposables \u00e0 des personnes, physiques ou morales \u00bb (par. 58). La comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00ab permet de recourir \u00e0 des moyens coercitifs pour faire respecter r\u00e8gles, prescriptions ou droits \u00bb (ibid.). Enfin, la comp\u00e9tence juridictionnelle \u00ab consiste dans le pouvoir des tribunaux d\u2019un \u00c9tat de r\u00e9gler des diff\u00e9rends ou d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la loi au moyen de d\u00e9cisions ayant force obligatoire \u00bb (ibid.). Il a \u00e9galement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 plusieurs fondements sur lesquels un \u00c9tat peut exercer sa comp\u00e9tence, y compris les principes de territorialit\u00e9, de nationalit\u00e9 et d\u2019universalit\u00e9 (par. 59\u201161).\n[60] Les juges majoritaires ont ensuite proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse des principes relatifs \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence extraterritoriale dans le contexte canadien. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab il est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un \u00c9tat peut faire appliquer ses lois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger seulement s\u2019il obtient le consentement de l\u2019\u00c9tat en cause ou, \u00e0 titre exceptionnel, si le droit international l\u2019y autorise par ailleurs \u00bb (par. 65). Faisant remarquer que, conform\u00e9ment au Statut de Westminster de 1931, le Canada a le pouvoir d\u2019adopter des lois d\u2019application extraterritoriale (par. 66), ils ont relev\u00e9 que la capacit\u00e9 du Parlement d\u2019adopter des lois extraterritoriales est aussi \u00e9clair\u00e9e par les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation susmentionn\u00e9s. Ils ont conclu que certes, le Parlement peut adopter des lois incompatibles avec ces principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, mais que le Canada ne peut mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution ses r\u00e8gles de droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger qu\u2019avec le consentement d\u2019autres \u00c9tats (par. 67\u201168).\n[61] Puis, ces principes en t\u00eate, les juges majoritaires ont examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence de notre Cour et ont expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi l\u2019arr\u00eat Cook, le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la Cour autorisant l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte aux actes de la police canadienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, devait \u00eatre revu. Dans Cook, la Cour avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019accus\u00e9 par la police canadienne aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis relativement \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate portant sur une infraction devant \u00eatre instruite au Canada.\n[62] Les juges majoritaires ont formul\u00e9 trois critiques de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cook. Premi\u00e8rement, ils ont fait remarquer que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas de distinction entre la comp\u00e9tence normative et la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution (par. 84\u201185). Puisqu\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte comme un exercice de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, et comme l\u2019application extraterritoriale des lois canadiennes n\u2019est pas possible (sans le consentement de l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019accueil), ils ont conclu que l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte est impossible (par. 85).\n[63] Deuxi\u00e8mement, ils ont relev\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s pratiques et th\u00e9oriques d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e dans Cook \u00e0 des faits diff\u00e9rents, comme ceux de l\u2019affaire Hape, o\u00f9 un mandat concernant la fouille contest\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire selon le droit de Turks et Caicos (par. 86\u201192). Les juges majoritaires ont conclu, en raison des obstacles th\u00e9oriques et pratiques, que la Charte ne pouvait pas s\u2019appliquer aux fouilles, aux perquisitions et aux saisies effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger (par. 86\u201192).\n[64] Troisi\u00e8mement, ils ont conclu que l\u2019arr\u00eat Cook ne prenait pas suffisamment en compte le libell\u00e9 du par. 32(1) (par. 93\u201195). Interpr\u00e9tant le par. 32(1) \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation susmentionn\u00e9s, ils ont conclu que les actes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution extraterritoriale d\u00e9bordaient du champ d\u2019application de la Charte . Le paragraphe 32(1) dispose que la Charte s\u2019applique aux \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures des provinces. Apr\u00e8s avoir jug\u00e9 que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures des provinces n\u2019avaient pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser des mesures d\u2019application de la loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, les juges majoritaires ont conclu que les activit\u00e9s comme les enqu\u00eates criminelles men\u00e9es en territoire \u00e9tranger n\u2019appartiennent pas \u00e0 l\u2019un des \u00ab domaines relevant \u00bb du Parlement ou des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, et qu\u2019elles ne sont donc pas vis\u00e9es par le par. 32(1) (par. 94).\n[65] M\u00eame s\u2019il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la Charte ne pouvait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas s\u2019appliquer aux actions des agents canadiens accomplies dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape a relev\u00e9 trois exceptions d\u2019apr\u00e8s lesquelles les protections offertes par la Charte peuvent n\u00e9anmoins s\u2019appliquer. Premi\u00e8rement, la Charte peut s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re extraterritoriale lorsque l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019accueil y consent (par. 106). Deuxi\u00e8mement, le principe de courtoisie \u00ab peut cesser de justifier \u00bb la participation d\u2019un policier canadien \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate lorsque cette participation emporterait le manquement du Canada \u00e0 ses obligations internationales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (par. 101). Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019application combin\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 7 et de l\u2019al. 11d) de la Charte peut avoir pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par les agents canadiens \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, si l\u2019admission de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve est susceptible de rendre le proc\u00e8s in\u00e9quitable (par. 107\u2011112).\nIV. Critiques formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape\n[66] L\u2019arr\u00eat Hape et la m\u00e9thode qui y est pr\u00f4n\u00e9e ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019importantes critiques nourries de la part d\u2019experts en droit international[4]. Trois principales lacunes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9es \u00e0 cet arr\u00eat : (1) Hape a appliqu\u00e9 de mauvais principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, notamment des principes de comp\u00e9tence en droit international et un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1); (2) Hape a qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tort l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte d\u2019exercice ill\u00e9gal de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution; (3) les trois exceptions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans Hape sont inad\u00e9quates. Le recours \u00e0 ces principes de droit international et leur mauvaise application par le juge LeBel ont suscit\u00e9 le type et le degr\u00e9 de critiques convaincantes et d\u2019instabilit\u00e9 doctrinale qui n\u00e9cessitent un r\u00e9examen de cet aspect de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Nous examinons \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacune de ces trois principales critiques.\n[67] En premier lieu, une assise fondamentale de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est le fait que le par. 32(1) doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer le respect des r\u00e8gles de droit international qui lient le Canada, et qui, dans cette affaire, ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation plus restrictive de l\u2019art. 32 (par. 56). D\u2019un point de vue m\u00e9thodologique, imposer des principes de droit international en prime pour limiter la port\u00e9e de la Charte sape le caract\u00e8re t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte (West, \u00ab Canada Stands Alone \u00bb, p. 9\u201110; Cook, par. 147, le juge Bastarache). Le droit international devrait plut\u00f4t g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour appuyer ou confirmer une interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9gag\u00e9e en appliquant la d\u00e9marche t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (R. c. Bissonnette, 2022 CSC 23, par. 98; H. S. Fairley, \u00ab International Law Comes of Age : Hape v. The Queen \u00bb (2008), 87 R. du B. can. 229, p. 236). En outre, les principes de comp\u00e9tence en droit international ne sont pas un fondement ad\u00e9quat permettant de limiter le sens du terme \u00ab relevant \u00bb employ\u00e9 au par. 32(1) en mati\u00e8re de droit constitutionnel interne. Le Parlement a pleine comp\u00e9tence en ce qui a trait aux cat\u00e9gories de sujets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 91 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 , et cette comp\u00e9tence s\u2019\u00e9tend aux mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution extraterritoriales, y compris aux mesures qui violent le droit international lui\u2011m\u00eame (Statut de Westminster de 1931, art. 3; Croft c. Dunphy, [1933] A.C. 156 (C.P.), p. 163; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique c. Assoc. canadienne des fournisseurs Internet, 2004 CSC 45, [2004] 2 R.C.S. 427, par. 141, le juge LeBel; J. H. Currie, \u00ab Khadr\u2019s Twist on Hape : Tortured Determinations of the Extraterritorial Reach of the Canadian Charter \u00bb (2008), 46 A. can. D. int. 307, p. 318\u2011319; Hape, par. 39, 53 et 68; G. van Ert, \u00ab Jurisprudence canadienne en mati\u00e8re de droit international public en 2006-7 \u00bb (2007), 45 A. can. D. int. 527, p. 551; West, \u00ab Canada Stands Alone \u00bb, p. 13\u201114). En outre, on ne devrait pas permettre que des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la courtoisie internationale et l\u2019objectif de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019accro\u00eetre la coop\u00e9ration internationale entre les forces polici\u00e8res aient le dessus sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qu\u2019il convient de retenir ou soient utilis\u00e9s pour soustraire la conduite de l\u2019\u00c9tat au contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Currie et Rikhof, p. 628\u2011629).\n[68] De plus, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, la Cour a appliqu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de conformit\u00e9 \u2014 un principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative (par. 53) \u2014 \u00e0 son interpr\u00e9tation du par. 32(1) (Currie (2008), p. 315; Sethi, p. 113; J. H. Currie, \u00ab International Human Rights Law in the Supreme Court\u2019s Charter Jurisprudence : Commitment, Retrenchment and Retreat \u2014 In No Particular Order \u00bb (2010), 50 S.C.L.R. (2d) 423, p. 441\u2011443 et 453\u2011454). Les pr\u00e9somptions utilis\u00e9es dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles utilis\u00e9es dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative (Hunter, p. 155). Au lieu de pr\u00e9sumer la conformit\u00e9, nous pr\u00e9sumons dans le cadre de la Charte qu\u2019elle \u00ab accorde une protection \u00e0 tout le moins aussi grande que celle qu\u2019offrent les dispositions similaires des instruments internationaux que le Canada a ratifi\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00bb, ce qui a pour effet de cr\u00e9er un plancher \u2014 et non un plafond \u2014 pour les protections offertes par la Charte sur la base des instruments internationaux contraignants en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313, p. 349, le juge en chef Dickson; Slaight Communications Inc. c. Davidson, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1038, p. 1056, cit\u00e9 dans Hape, par. 55; L. West, \u00ab \u201cWithin or Outside Canada\u201d : The Charter \u2019s Application to the Extraterritorial Activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service \u00bb (2023), 73 U.T.L.J. 1, p. 39; Currie (2008), p. 321). L\u2019application, dans Hape, des principes de droit international et des principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui y est faite du par. 32(1), contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique \u00e9tablie, tend \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019il faut revoir cet arr\u00eat.\n[69] En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les sp\u00e9cialistes du droit international, cette partie de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape caract\u00e9rise erron\u00e9ment l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte comme \u00e9tant un exercice ill\u00e9gal de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape pour dire que les agents canadiens qui m\u00e8nent une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger exercent une comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution extraterritoriale (Hape, par. 58, 64\u201165 et 105; Currie et Rikhof, p. 98). Les sp\u00e9cialistes soutiennent cependant que, lorsque les principes de comp\u00e9tence sont bien appliqu\u00e9s, il devient \u00e9vident qu\u2019exiger des agents canadiens qu\u2019ils respectent la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et permettre aux tribunaux canadiens d\u2019\u00e9valuer leur conduite afin de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit conforme \u00e0 la Charte constituent des exercices des comp\u00e9tences, respectivement, normative et juridictionnelle, et ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre ne viole le droit international ni ne fait obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 souveraine d\u2019un autre \u00c9tat (van Ert, p. 552; J. Crawford, Brownlie\u2019s Principles of Public International Law (9e \u00e9d. 2019), p. 462; voir aussi Currie (2008), p. 317). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 ces critiques, il y a lieu de revoir l\u2019analyse effectu\u00e9e dans Hape.\n[70] De plus, l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape a assimil\u00e9 l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019exigence que la proc\u00e9dure canadienne r\u00e9gisse l\u2019enqu\u00eate (par. 84, 86 et 98), ce qui a embrouill\u00e9 l\u2019analyse. Appliquer la Charte \u00e0 la conduite des agents canadiens exer\u00e7ant leurs fonctions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose que d\u2019exiger que les lois canadiennes en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure criminelle r\u00e9gissent une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger (Currie et Rikhof, p. 634). La Charte ne r\u00e9git pas les activit\u00e9s des agents \u00e9trangers, et les agents canadiens qui se livrent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi dans un autre \u00c9tat doivent respecter les lois de cet \u00c9tat (R. c. Terry, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 207, par. 19; R. c. Harrer, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 562, par. 15). La souverainet\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat est respect\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019on obtient le consentement de participer \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate et lorsqu\u2019on exige que les agents canadiens qui accomplissent leurs t\u00e2ches \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger respectent les lois de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger. Exiger que les autorit\u00e9s canadiennes se conforment en outre \u00e0 la Charte n\u2019exclut pas le besoin de respecter les pr\u00e9requis du droit \u00e9tranger.\n[71] Qui plus est, la doctrine et la jurisprudence \u00e9trang\u00e8re tendent \u00e0 indiquer que les pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de courtoisie sont minimales. Les \u00c9tats appliquent couramment leur droit interne aux actions que leurs agents effectuent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, et ils le font sans solliciter le consentement de l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019accueil (M. Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties : Law, Principles, and Policy (2011), p. 65; voir, p. ex., United States c. Verdugo\u2011Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990), p. 283, note 7, le juge Brennan, dissident; C. McLachlan, Foreign Relations Law (2014), par. 5.154\u20115.156; Smith c.

Attorney\u2011General, [2018] NZCA 307, [2018] 3 N.Z.L.R. 827, par. 28\u201130; Smith c. R., [2020] NZCA 499, [2021] 3 N.Z.L.R. 324, par. 92; Afghan Nationals c. Minister for Immigration, [2021] NZHC 3154, [2022] 2 N.Z.L.R. 102, par. 39; Federal Intelligence Service \u2014 foreign surveillance, BVerfG, 1 BvR 2835\/17, d\u00e9cision du 19 mai 2020 (Allemagne), par. 91, 93\u201194, 101 et 104). Cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la pratique des \u00c9tats sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019aucune norme de droit international coutumier n\u2019interdit \u00e0 un \u00c9tat de r\u00e9glementer les actions de ses agents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger par le truchement de son droit interne. Cela indique aussi qu\u2019on ne porte aucunement atteinte \u00e0 la courtoisie en appliquant le droit interne aux actions des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, parce que les \u00c9tats ne consid\u00e8rent pas cela comme une infraction aux r\u00e8gles de courtoisie ou une violation du droit international.\n[72] En outre, les obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e9tayent l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte . Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, R.T. Can. 1976 no 47, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ratifi\u00e9 par le Canada et lie donc celui\u2011ci, [traduction] \u00ab couvre en grande partie les m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00bb et est \u00ab pertinent pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Charte \u00bb (P. W. Hogg et W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5e \u00e9d. suppl.), \u00a7 36:28; Bissonnette, par. 99). Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme imposant des obligations extraterritoriales aux \u00c9tats parties (par. 2(1); Cons\u00e9quences juridiques de l\u2019\u00e9dification d\u2019un mur dans le territoire palestinien occup\u00e9, avis consultatif, Rec. C.I.J. 2004, p. 136, par. 108\u2011111; Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019homme, Observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale no 31 : La nature de l\u2019obligation juridique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale impos\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats parties au Pacte, Doc. N.U. CCPR\/C\/21\/Rev.1\/Add.13, 26 mai 2004, par. 12; Munaf c. Roumanie, Communication no 1539\/2006, Doc. N.U. CCPR\/C\/96\/D\/1539\/2006 (2009), par. 14.2; Lopez Burgos c. Uruguay, Communication no 52\/1979, Doc. N.U. CCPR\/C\/13\/D\/52\/1979 (1981), par. 12.3; Currie (2010), p. 440\u2011441). Puisque la Charte est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e offrir une protection tout aussi grande (Slaight, p. 1056), il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019elle devrait aussi s\u2019appliquer aux actions des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019\u00c9tat lorsqu\u2019ils sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[73] En troisi\u00e8me lieu, les critiques soutiennent que les trois exceptions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u2014 consentement, violations des obligations internationales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et \u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s \u2014 sont inad\u00e9quates. Elles n\u2019accordent pas les m\u00eames protections robustes que celles express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vues dans la Charte . Cela a de quoi inqui\u00e9ter et tend \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019il faut revoir la conclusion tir\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape.\n[74] Les sp\u00e9cialistes ont soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019exception relative au consentement s\u2019av\u00e8re illusoire dans bien des circonstances (Attaran, p. 534\u2011536 et 538\u2011539; West, \u00ab Within or Outside Canada \u00bb, p. 37\u201139). De plus, si l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte n\u2019est pas un exercice de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ex\u00e9cution (comme le soutiennent les sp\u00e9cialistes du droit international), l\u2019exception relative au consentement est fond\u00e9e sur : (1) l\u2019id\u00e9e intenable que les agents canadiens demandent \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00c9tats la permission d\u2019appliquer les limites constitutionnelles du Canada \u00e0 sa propre conduite; et (2) le postulat que l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019accueil comprendrait la question ou devrait contr\u00f4ler la r\u00e9ponse (van Ert, p. 555).\n[75] Les universitaires ont fait remarquer que l\u2019exception relative aux droits de la personne ouvre des br\u00e8ches o\u00f9 les protections accord\u00e9es par la Charte exc\u00e8dent les droits garantis dans les instruments internationaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (West, \u00ab Within or Outside Canada \u00bb, p. 39; Currie (2008), p. 320\u2011321). La survenance de ces br\u00e8ches est un fait compte tenu de la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle la Charte conf\u00e8re des protections \u00e0 tout le moins aussi grandes que celle qu\u2019offrent les obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (Slaight, p. 1056). De plus, il est illogique que la nature de la violation dicte l\u2019application de l\u2019instrument prot\u00e9geant les droits (Attaran, p. 520; voir aussi Amnistie internationale Canada c. Canada (Chef d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2011major de la D\u00e9fense), 2008 CF 336, [2008] 4 R.C.F. 546, par. 312\u2011313, conf. par 2008 CAF 401, [2009] 4 R.C.F. 149). Sur le plan de la doctrine, l\u2019exception ne cadre pas avec le principe voulant que les trait\u00e9s, la principale source des obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ne fassent pas directement partie du droit canadien sauf s\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre par une loi, et elle ne reconna\u00eet pas que la Charte est le moyen par lequel le Canada a mis en \u0153uvre bon nombre de ces obligations (Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 817, par. 69; van Ert, p. 553; J. H. Currie, \u00ab Weaving a Tangled Web : Hape and the Obfuscation of Canadian Reception Law \u00bb (2007), 45 A. can. D. int. 55, p. 80\u201181; Currie et Rikhof, p. 636; voir aussi K. Sun, \u00ab International Comity and the Construction of the Charter \u2019s Limits : Hape Revisited \u00bb (2019), 45 Queen\u2019s L.J. 115, p. 145). Le r\u00e9sultat [traduction] \u00ab curieux \u00bb de l\u2019exception \u2014 on recourt au droit international des droits de la personne plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la Charte pour \u00e9valuer les actions des repr\u00e9sentants canadiens qui exercent leurs fonctions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger (van Ert, p. 553) \u2014 cr\u00e9e de l\u2019incertitude chez les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien exer\u00e7ant leurs fonctions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui ne connaissent probablement pas les obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (Amnistie internationale, par. 314; Hape, par. 173, le juge Bastarache).\n[76] Enfin, des critiques postulent que l\u2019exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s laisse aussi des br\u00e8ches, parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019applique pas lorsque l\u2019on porte atteinte aux droits garantis \u00e0 une personne par la Charte d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ne donnant pas lieu \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui mettraient l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s en question, ou lorsque la conduite attentatoire de l\u2019\u00c9tat ne donne jamais lieu \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s criminel au Canada (K. Roach, \u00ab R. v. Hape Creates Charter\u2011Free Zones for Canadian Officials Abroad \u00bb (2007), 53 Crim. L.Q. 1, p. 2; Currie et Rikhof, p. 634). En outre, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au d\u00e9part dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Harrer, l\u2019exception devait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillie par des autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 qui la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cens\u00e9e combler la br\u00e8che cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019omission d\u2019appliquer la Charte aux autorit\u00e9s canadiennes. Plus important encore, \u00e0 notre avis, l\u2019exception ne fait qu\u2019accorder les protections pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 11d) de la Charte . Ces deux droits \u00e0 eux seuls ne suffisent pas pour garantir un proc\u00e8s enti\u00e8rement conforme \u00e0 la Charte . Tenter de super\u2011charger l\u2019art. 7 et l\u2019al. 11d) afin qu\u2019ils remplacent tous les autres droits figurant dans la Charte va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objectif m\u00eame de la Charte : garantir tous les droits et libert\u00e9s qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\nV. Conclusion sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape\n[77] La d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape demeure importante \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, comme ses \u00e9nonc\u00e9s sur l\u2019incorporation du droit international coutumier par la common law (voir Nevsun Resources Ltd. c. Araya, 2020 CSC 5, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 166, par. 86; van Ert, p. 555), sur la souverainet\u00e9 \u00e9tatique et l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 souveraine, et sur le principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon lequel les lois sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es s\u2019appliquer conform\u00e9ment aux obligations internationales du Canada (voir Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, par. 114; van Ert, p. 555).\n[78] La Cour, toutefois, n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune observation sur le droit international, et elle s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9e du fondement th\u00e9orique \u00e9tabli par notre Cour dans sa jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure sur l\u2019application de la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger m\u00eame si aucune partie ni intervenant devant la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Hape n\u2019a demand\u00e9 que la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure soit r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ou infirm\u00e9e (par. 182, 184\u2011186 et 189, le juge Binnie). De nombreux probl\u00e8mes th\u00e9oriques et pratiques ont malheureusement d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, comme le met en lumi\u00e8re la profusion de critiques formul\u00e9es par les tribunaux et les auteurs au cours des 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[79] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de pr\u00e9occupations importantes. Elles touchent au c\u0153ur de notre jurisprudence sur l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte , aux r\u00e9percussions pratiques de son application et au manque de coh\u00e9rence et de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 qui s\u2019ensuit dans ce domaine du droit. Vu ces pr\u00e9occupations, il convient de revoir cette partie de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Toutefois, comme les juges majoritaires ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas l\u2019aborder, nous remettons \u00e0 une autre occasion l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est erron\u00e9.\n[80] Puisque nous ne tirons pas de conclusion sur le point de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape est erron\u00e9, nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 expliquer comment la Charte devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u2014 un enjeu sur lequel n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ax\u00e9es non plus les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Soulignons toutefois qu\u2019\u00e0 notre avis, la Charte est suffisamment souple pour tenir compte au cas par cas, dans l\u2019analyse, du contexte \u00e9tranger et des pr\u00e9occupations connexes exprim\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Comme l\u2019a reconnu le juge Bastarache dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape (par. 125), la Charte \u00ab est un instrument souple qui se pr\u00eate \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation contextuelle et qui permet d\u2019apporter \u00e0 un droit fondamental une restriction fond\u00e9e sur un motif raisonnable \u00bb. Cette souplesse peut exister tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019atteinte qu\u2019\u00e0 celle de la r\u00e9paration. Les lois et proc\u00e9dures \u00e9trang\u00e8res peuvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utiles pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu violation de la Charte . En outre, il est possible de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations op\u00e9rationnelles caus\u00e9es par les diff\u00e9rences entre les proc\u00e9dures canadiennes et les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9trang\u00e8res au moyen d\u2019un exercice souple du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 24 .\n[81] Pour conclure, nous ajoutons que, m\u00eame si les r\u00e8gles et directives de notre Cour \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique imposent effectivement des limites \u00e0 ce que les intervenants peuvent plaider, nous ne sommes pas d\u2019accord avec nos coll\u00e8gues pour dire que les intervenants ont outrepass\u00e9 le r\u00f4le qui leur revient en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que les intervenants ne doivent pas aborder de nouvelles questions, ils ont pour r\u00f4le d\u2019exprimer leur propre avis sur les questions de droit en soumettant des arguments \u00ab utiles et diff\u00e9rents \u00bb, ce qui \u00ab \u00e9largi[t] l\u2019\u00e9ventail des points de vue \u00bb pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour (Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, Avis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique : novembre 2021 \u2014 Interventions, 15 novembre 2021 (en ligne)). Plusieurs intervenants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont fait exactement cela lorsqu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de revoir l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape : ils ont propos\u00e9 une conception diff\u00e9rente de la question de droit fondamentale de savoir si la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la conduite des agents du SNEFC. D\u2019ailleurs, ces intervenants ont obtenu l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir pour ce motif : au moment de solliciter l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir, ils ont tous clairement manifest\u00e9 leur intention de critiquer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape et de sugg\u00e9rer des modifications de son cadre, et la Canadian Constitution Foundation a affirm\u00e9 express\u00e9ment qu\u2019il faut revoir cet arr\u00eat (m\u00e9moire, par. 10). Juger que nous ne pouvons pas prendre connaissance de cet avis diff\u00e9rent tout simplement parce que les parties elles-m\u00eames ne l\u2019ont pas propos\u00e9 fait abstraction de l\u2019objet des arguments de l\u2019intervenant tel qu\u2019il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019Avis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique et va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pratique suivie dans le pass\u00e9 par la Cour dans des d\u00e9cisions qui reposent sur le cadre propos\u00e9 par les intervenants.\n[82] Mais surtout, toute restriction du r\u00f4le des intervenants ne limite aucunement le pouvoir de notre Cour de trancher des questions d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re que celle propos\u00e9e par les parties. En effet, l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape d\u00e9montre lui\u2011m\u00eame que notre Cour peut infirmer un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sans que les parties ou les intervenants ne l\u2019invitent \u00e0 le faire (par. 187, le juge Binnie). Pareille restriction va aussi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la fonction de notre Cour, laquelle ne consiste pas simplement \u00e0 corriger des erreurs. Le r\u00f4le dont est investi la Cour, en tant que plus haut tribunal du pays, consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 \u00ab d\u00e9velopper la jurisprudence \u00bb en \u00ab analys[ant] des questions ayant de \u201cl\u2019importance [. . .] pour le public\u201d \u00bb, et une grande partie du travail de la Cour \u00ab d\u00e9bord[e] n\u00e9cessairement le strict minimum requis pour trancher le pourvoi \u00bb (R. c. Henry, 2005 CSC 76, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 609, par. 53; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, art. 5 et 6, 2014 CSC 21, [2014] 1 R.C.S. 433, par. 86). En \u00ab \u00e9largiss[ant] l\u2019\u00e9ventail des points de vue pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour en plus de ceux des appelants et des intim\u00e9s \u00bb et en pr\u00e9sentant leur point de vue sur des questions de droit dont la Cour est saisie, les intervenants aident la Cour \u00e0 remplir cette mission institutionnelle (Avis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique).\nVI. Application\n[83] \u00c0 supposer que, conform\u00e9ment au par. 32(1) , la Charte s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la conduite des agents lors de leur enqu\u00eate, il n\u2019y a pas eu atteinte aux droits garantis au caporal McGregor par l\u2019art. 8.\n[84] Une fouille n\u2019est pas abusive si elle est autoris\u00e9e par la loi, si la loi n\u2019a rien d\u2019abusif et si la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re abusive (R. c. Collins, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 265, p. 278). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Vu, 2013 CSC 60, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 657, la Cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019une autorisation expresse pr\u00e9alable \u00e9tait requise pour la fouille d\u2019ordinateurs (par. 3 et 47). Cela signifie \u00ab que, si des policiers entendent fouiller tout ordinateur trouv\u00e9 dans le lieu qu\u2019ils souhaitent perquisitionner, ils doivent d\u2019abord convaincre le juge de paix saisi de la demande d\u2019autorisation qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent des motifs raisonnables de croire que les ordinateurs qu\u2019ils pourraient d\u00e9couvrir contiendront les choses qu\u2019ils recherchent \u00bb (par. 48).\n[85] Nous concluons, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de notre coll\u00e8gue la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, que ces exigences sont respect\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Premi\u00e8rement, le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par un juge de la Virginie autorisait express\u00e9ment la fouille d\u2019ordinateurs et d\u2019appareils \u00e9lectroniques. De plus, la mention des [traduction] \u00ab biens \u00bb du caporal McGregor (d.a., vol. I, p. 128) dans la note diplomatique fait en sorte que l\u2019autorisation rel\u00e8ve de la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 diplomatique. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la loi qui autorisait la fouille \u00e9tait raisonnable compte tenu des normes relatives \u00e0 la Charte \u00e9labor\u00e9es par notre jurisprudence : comme le soulignent les deux tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure, les motifs invoqu\u00e9s pour obtenir le mandat auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisants au Canada. Troisi\u00e8mement, la fouille n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re abusive, puisque le mandat autorisait express\u00e9ment le processus de tri des appareils \u00e9lectroniques sur place.\n[86] Nous ne sommes pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019appliquer la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cette th\u00e9orie permet de saisir des objets sans mandat dans des circonstances d\u00e9finies. Le caporal McGregor ne conteste pas la saisie devant notre Cour. Il a plut\u00f4t plaid\u00e9 que la fouille n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par la loi ou qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re abusive (m.a., par. 185). D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, [traduction] \u00ab une fois que les enqu\u00eateurs ont d\u00e9couvert une preuve de ce qu\u2019ils croyaient \u00eatre de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile, ils auraient d\u00fb cesser de fouiller, saisir les appareils \u00e9lectroniques et obtenir un mandat subs\u00e9quent qui d\u00e9crit cette preuve \u00bb (par. 200). Ils ont enfreint l\u2019art. 8, soutient\u2011il, en [traduction] \u00ab continu[ant] [plut\u00f4t] de fouiller les appareils sur place afin de trouver des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb, et ils ont alors visionn\u00e9 les fichiers contenant des preuves d\u2019agression sexuelle (ibid.). En somme, il soutient que [traduction] \u00ab [u]ne fois qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9couvert, lors d\u2019une fouille, la preuve d\u2019une nouvelle infraction, les enqu\u00eateurs doivent obtenir un mandat subs\u00e9quent visant cette infraction pour continuer de fouiller les appareils \u00bb (par. 199).\n[87] La Cour martiale a rejet\u00e9 les arguments du caporal McGregor selon lesquels les policiers avaient [traduction] \u00ab continu\u00e9 de chercher des fichiers de pornographie juv\u00e9nile et d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00bb plut\u00f4t que des fichiers relatifs aux infractions vis\u00e9es par le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie (2018 CM 4023, par. 25 (CanLII) (nous soulignons)). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour martiale a fait remarquer que la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e9tait une [traduction] \u00ab situation tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente de celle survenue dans [R. c. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241], o\u00f9 les enqu\u00eateurs, alors qu\u2019ils cherchaient des fichiers en lien avec une fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, avaient d\u00e9couvert par inadvertance de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile et, \u00e0 partir de ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, ils se sont mis \u00e0 chercher des types de fichiers enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rents de ceux envisag\u00e9s par leur mandat initial \u00bb (ibid. (nous soulignons)).\n[88] Comme les policiers dans l\u2019affaire Jones \u2014 contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce \u2014 ont cherch\u00e9 intentionnellement des fichiers au\u2011del\u00e0 de ce qu\u2019autorisait le mandat, ils avaient besoin d\u2019une autre justification pour cette fouille sans mandat, et ils ont tent\u00e9 de se fonder sur la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue (Jones, par. 26). En plus d\u2019\u00e9largir ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e de la fouille, les policiers dans Jones ont continu\u00e9 de fouiller le disque dur qui contenait la preuve de pornographie juv\u00e9nile apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte de cette preuve. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, par contre, les policiers n\u2019ont pas continu\u00e9 de chercher la preuve de crimes autres que ceux vis\u00e9s par le mandat. Ils ont plut\u00f4t continu\u00e9 de chercher des preuves de voyeurisme, tel que le permettait le mandat. De plus, ils n\u2019ont pas continu\u00e9 de fouiller les appareils qui contenaient des preuves d\u2019autres infractions. Au lieu de poursuivre la fouille de ces appareils, ils [traduction] \u00ab ont [. . .] mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en vue de la saisie et d\u2019analyses plus pouss\u00e9es \u00bb, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu un mandat canadien, \u00ab tous les appareils qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s comme contenant possiblement des fichiers de pornographie juv\u00e9nile et d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00bb (d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019issue du voir\u2011dire, par. 25). Les arguments du caporal McGregor voulant que la fouille ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9gale ou abusive doivent donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s. La fouille \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie, et les policiers n\u2019ont pas \u00e9largi irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la port\u00e9e de leur fouille.\n[89] Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019invoquer la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue. Les parties n\u2019ont d\u00e9battu d\u2019aucune question de saisie. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la saisie initiale de l\u2019appareil contenant une preuve d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e judiciairement par le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie, lequel permettait de saisir des appareils susceptibles de contenir une preuve de voyeurisme. La saisie et la fouille continues de l\u2019appareil \u00e9taient autoris\u00e9es judiciairement par le mandat canadien subs\u00e9quent. Comme les policiers ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 tout appareil qui contenait des preuves d\u2019infractions non connexes au lieu de continuer \u00e0 les fouiller, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce si le fait de continuer \u00e0 fouiller un appareil en particulier m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9couvert la preuve d\u2019une infraction non connexe sur cet appareil pourrait violer l\u2019art. 8. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le caporal McGregor pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9couverte de la preuve d\u2019une infraction non connexe dans un appareil obligeait les policiers non seulement \u00e0 cesser de fouiller cet appareil, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de fouiller tout autre appareil (m\u00eame dans le cas de la preuve d\u2019infractions vis\u00e9es par le mandat), nous rejetons cet argument. D\u00e9couvrir la preuve d\u2019une infraction non connexe n\u2019autorise pas les policiers \u00e0 se mettre \u00e0 chercher des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant cette infraction non connexe, ni ne les oblige \u00e0 cesser enti\u00e8rement leur recherche relativement \u00e0 ce que le mandat les autorisait \u00e0 fouiller. Cette conclusion est tout ce qu\u2019il faut pour r\u00e9gler la question li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 8 que le caporal McGregor a effectivement soulev\u00e9e : le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la poursuite du triage d\u2019autres appareils apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on ait d\u00e9couvert une preuve de pornographie juv\u00e9nile.\n[90] En concluant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue, les juges majoritaires supposent que les fichiers r\u00e9v\u00e9lant une preuve d\u2019agression sexuelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis lorsque les policiers les ont aper\u00e7us, m\u00eame si les policiers effectuaient une fouille l\u00e9gale de l\u2019ordinateur \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de voyeurisme en vertu d\u2019un mandat valide. Le caporal McGregor n\u2019a jamais avanc\u00e9 pareil argument, pas plus que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des intervenants. Notre Cour ne s\u2019est jamais prononc\u00e9e sur la question de savoir dans quelles circonstances un fichier en particulier sur un appareil est saisi, par opposition aux circonstances o\u00f9 l\u2019appareil (p. ex. un portable) lui\u2011m\u00eame est saisi. Notre Cour ne devrait pas trancher cette question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le fait de statuer sur la question sans disposer d\u2019arguments pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences impr\u00e9vues. En outre, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de la trancher pour r\u00e9gler le dossier.\n[91] De plus, la pr\u00e9misse suivant laquelle les fichiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis lorsque les policiers les ont vus au d\u00e9part est hautement discutable d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Dyment, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 417, notre Cour a donn\u00e9 des orientations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la \u00ab ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre une saisie et la simple r\u00e9union d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00bb, que nous avons d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant le \u00ab point o\u00f9 on peut raisonnablement affirmer que l\u2019individu n\u2019a plus droit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation du caract\u00e8re confidentiel de l\u2019objet \u00bb (p. 435). \u00c0 notre avis, le simple fait d\u2019avoir aper\u00e7u le fichier au domicile du caporal McGregor ne constituait probablement pas une saisie, parce que ce dernier avait encore \u00ab droit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation du caract\u00e8re confidentiel [du fichier] \u00bb au sens requis (ibid.), comme en t\u00e9moigne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le mandat canadien subs\u00e9quent. Qui plus est, conclure qu\u2019un dossier est saisi lorsqu\u2019il est \u00ab aper\u00e7u \u00bb confond le simple fait de voir un dossier et sa saisie. Pour faire une analogie avec les dossiers physiques, cela reviendrait \u00e0 dire que les policiers saisissent chaque feuille de papier qu\u2019ils aper\u00e7oivent durant la fouille d\u2019un classeur.\n[92] Au lieu de statuer sur cette question complexe sans disposer d\u2019arguments, nous concluons que la saisie initiale du portable \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie \u2014 comme l\u2019admet le caporal McGregor (m.a., par. 200\u2011201) \u2014, et que la fouille et la saisie subs\u00e9quentes de ses fichiers \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es par le mandat canadien. Le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie n\u2019englobait pas l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur des infractions d\u2019agression sexuelle, et les policiers n\u2019ont d\u00e9couvert le dossier relatif \u00e0 l\u2019agression sexuelle reproch\u00e9e qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 ils cherchaient d\u2019autres types de fichiers express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9s par le mandat (d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019issue du voir\u2011dire, par. 25). Le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie autorisait, par contre, la saisie des appareils \u00e9lectroniques qui auraient pu contenir des preuves de voyeurisme. Le mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie autorisait \u00e9galement la saisie des fichiers du portable pour y chercher des preuves de voyeurisme, ce qui explique comment les policiers ont trouv\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019agression sexuelle et les raisons pour lesquelles ils ont agi l\u00e9galement quand ils l\u2019on vu. Les policiers ont alors adopt\u00e9 une solution sage dans les circonstances : ils ont mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le portable (d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisi) et ont par la suite obtenu un mandat canadien les autorisant \u00e0 fouiller le contenu des ordinateurs et des appareils \u00e9lectroniques en vue d\u2019obtenir des preuves de l\u2019agression sexuelle (par. 20; d.a., vol. I, p. 100). Par cons\u00e9quent, leur conduite n\u2019exc\u00e9dait pas les limites de l\u2019autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue.\n[93] Nous faisons remarquer qu\u2019en plus d\u2019\u00eatre en possession l\u00e9gale de l\u2019ordinateur en vertu du mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie, les policiers, au moment o\u00f9 ils ont d\u00e9couvert le dossier d\u2019agression sexuelle, auraient pu \u00eatre aussi autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre en charge le portable \u00ab temporairement et dans le but bien limit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server un \u00e9ventuel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u2019un crime jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle obtienne un mandat de perquisition \u00bb propre \u00e0 l\u2019agression sexuelle (R. c. Cole, 2012 CSC 53, [2012] 3 R.C.S. 34, par. 65 (italique omis)). L\u2019arr\u00eat Vu envisageait lui aussi la saisie d\u2019ordinateurs en vue de pr\u00e9server la preuve d\u2019une infraction, m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 le mandat n\u2019accordait pas l\u2019autorisation de fouiller l\u2019ordinateur pour y chercher des preuves de cette infraction, \u00ab pour autant qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de croire que l\u2019appareil contient le genre de choses que le mandat autorise \u00e0 saisir \u00bb (par. 3 et 49). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les policiers croyaient raisonnablement que le portable aurait pu contenir des preuves de voyeurisme, et ils \u00e9taient donc justifi\u00e9s, au titre du mandat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en Virginie, de saisir le portable afin de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es.\n[94] Non seulement est\u2011il superflu d\u2019invoquer la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue et de se fonder sur des pr\u00e9misses douteuses quant aux circonstances dans lesquelles un fichier est saisi, mais la question de savoir si la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la fouille du contenu d\u2019un ordinateur est une question \u00e9pineuse que la Cour n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9e. Nous n\u2019avons jamais approuv\u00e9 l\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie aux fichiers \u00e9lectroniques comme l\u2019a fait la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jones. La fouille et la saisie d\u2019ordinateurs personnels sont incroyablement envahissantes, d\u2019une grande ampleur et attentatoires \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e (R. c. Morelli, 2010 CSC 8, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 253, par. 2\u20113). \u00c0 cette fin, nous avons exig\u00e9 une autorisation sp\u00e9ciale pour la fouille et la saisie d\u2019ordinateurs (Vu) et modifi\u00e9 l\u2019approche en common law \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des fouilles de t\u00e9l\u00e9phones cellulaires effectu\u00e9es accessoirement \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation (R. c. Fearon, 2014 CSC 77, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 621). Il y a des consid\u00e9rations sp\u00e9ciales associ\u00e9es aux donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectroniques qui sugg\u00e8rent que nous ne devrions pas pr\u00e9sumer que la th\u00e9orie des objets bien en vue s\u2019applique, ou qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique sans modification. De plus, nous n\u2019avons re\u00e7u aucune observation \u00e0 ce sujet. Nous sommes d\u2019avis de reporter l\u2019examen de cette question \u00e0 une autre occasion.\n[95] En cons\u00e9quence, les policiers n\u2019ont pas enfreint l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte , et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont admissibles. Nous sommes d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs rendus par\nLe juge Rowe \u2014\n[96] J\u2019ai lu les motifs de la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, et je souscris enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 son analyse. Je pr\u00e9cise que ses motifs refl\u00e8tent l\u2019opinion des juges majoritaires de notre Cour.\n[97] J\u2019ai aussi lu les motifs de mes coll\u00e8gues les juges Karakatsanis et Martin, dont une grande partie est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la critique d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de notre Cour, l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Hape, 2007 CSC 26, [2007] 2 R.C.S. 292. Leur fa\u00e7on de traiter cet arr\u00eat sous\u2011entend que sa valeur jurisprudentielle peut valablement \u00eatre remise en cause dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\n[98] Je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec leur approche, laquelle d\u00e9borde le cadre des questions soulev\u00e9es par les parties et vise, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u00e0 l\u2019invitation des intervenants. Comme je l\u2019explique ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, cette invitation outrepasse les limites bien \u00e9tablies du r\u00f4le des intervenants. Pour \u00eatre clair, je n\u2019avalise ni ne r\u00e9fute les critiques de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape que font mes coll\u00e8gues; je ne prends pas position sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans cet arr\u00eat. Je m\u2019oppose plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la m\u00e9thodologie de mes coll\u00e8gues, qui les a amen\u00e9es \u00e0 se prononcer sur une question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment soumise \u00e0 notre Cour.\n[99] Bien que mes coll\u00e8gues aient raison de dire que les parties ont d\u00e9battu longuement de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Charte , leurs motifs ne rendent pas compl\u00e8tement compte du litige : les parties se sont oppos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la Charte dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, tenant pour acquis que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent applicable. Aucune des parties n\u2019a remis en cause cet arr\u00eat \u2014 ni au proc\u00e8s, ni devant la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale, ni devant notre Cour. Au contraire, elles ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appliquer, avec les exceptions qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voit, aux faits du litige qui les oppose. Les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont fait valoir que la pr\u00e9sente affaire est un [traduction] \u00ab cas d\u2019application pure et simple de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape \u00bb (m.i., par. 51), puis, lors des plaidoiries, ils ont exhort\u00e9 la Cour \u00e0 ne pas r\u00e9examiner ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (transcription, p. 118\u2011119). Les observations de l\u2019appelant portaient essentiellement sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des exceptions \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape (m.a., par. 86\u2011181). L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, et n\u2019a pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures pour appuyer une demande en ce sens. Le juge militaire et la Cour d\u2019appel de la cour martiale ont trait\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente affaire comme un cas d\u2019application ordinaire du cadre d\u2019analyse \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape.\n[100] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019insistance de mes coll\u00e8gues pour dire que ni elles ni les intervenants ne se sont \u00e9cart\u00e9s de la question dont la Cour est saisie est ind\u00e9fendable. Les arguments sur le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s seulement par les intervenants devant la Cour, introduisant ainsi une nouvelle question. La directive de pratique de la Cour, sur laquelle se fondent mes coll\u00e8gues (au par. 82), met en garde contre cette situation : les intervenants peuvent pr\u00e9senter leur propre point de vue sur une question de droit dont la Cour est saisie; ils ne doivent pas soulever de nouvelles questions; et la Cour conserve en tout temps le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de prendre toute mesure qu\u2019elle juge indiqu\u00e9e afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que les parties subissent une injustice (voir l\u2019Avis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique : novembre 2021 \u2014 Interventions, 15 novembre 2021 (en ligne) (\u00ab Avis de novembre 2021 \u00bb)).\n[101] \u00c0 cette fin, je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec mes coll\u00e8gues lorsqu\u2019elles affirment que les observations des intervenants repr\u00e9sentent simplement un point de vue diff\u00e9rent sur une question de droit dont la Cour est saisie. Cela signifierait dans les faits que chaque fois qu\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent applicable est pertinent pour trancher une affaire, les intervenants pourraient s\u2019introduire dans le d\u00e9bat devant notre Cour pour demander qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9, greffant ainsi au litige entre les parties ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un renvoi relatif \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision judiciaire que les intervenants souhaitent faire infirmer. Une telle d\u00e9marche n\u2019est pas compatible avec les r\u00e8gles de notre Cour. De plus, en tant qu\u2019importante consid\u00e9ration de principe, une telle d\u00e9marche risque de faire en sorte que la Cour prenne des d\u00e9cisions malavis\u00e9es, puisqu\u2019elles seraient prises sans le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une analyse faite par les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, sans dossier de preuve ad\u00e9quat ou sans observations de ceux qui seraient touch\u00e9s (notamment les groupes vuln\u00e9rables) mais qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s que la question serait soumise \u00e0 la Cour. C\u2019est simple : la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait continuer \u00e0 faire autorit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise aux juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, pas plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la Cour. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je cherche \u00e0 expliquer la place qui revient aux intervenants par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de la fonction juridictionnelle de la Cour.\n[102] Bien que l\u2019expos\u00e9 qui suit porte sur le r\u00f4le des intervenants, je rel\u00e8ve un point distinct d\u2019ordre m\u00e9thodologique. Mes coll\u00e8gues s\u2019appuient fortement sur ce qu\u2019elles consid\u00e8rent \u00eatre un consensus parmi les auteurs, qui sont critiques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape. Je ne r\u00e9p\u00e9terai pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail dans les motifs concordants dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Kirkpatrick, 2022 CSC 33, sauf pour souligner que le fait de recourir principalement \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9marche compromet le principe du stare decisis et entra\u00eene de l\u2019instabilit\u00e9 dans la doctrine (par. 246\u2011249). Les critiques d\u2019auteurs peuvent \u00eatre convaincantes lorsque ceux\u2011ci font la d\u00e9monstration d\u2019un motif reconnu pour l\u2019infirmation d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, mais la Cour ne peut \u00e9carter un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00ab simplement parce que de nombreuses voix, m\u00eame bien inform\u00e9es, expriment leur d\u00e9saccord avec nos d\u00e9cisions \u00bb (par. 247, citant Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, par. 274, les juges Abella et Karakatsanis, motifs concordants). De plus, je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que mes coll\u00e8gues insistent pour dire que la Cour est libre de s\u2019\u00e9carter d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent comme elle l\u2019entend, et \u00e0 plus forte raison, en l\u2019absence d\u2019observations ou de dossier de preuve (par. 82). Le respect des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00ab renforce les valeurs fondamentales de la primaut\u00e9 du droit comme la coh\u00e9rence, la certitude, la justesse, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et une saine administration de la justice \u00bb (R. c. Sullivan, 2022 CSC 19, par. 64). Ces valeurs qui caract\u00e9risent notre syst\u00e8me de justice sont n\u00e9cessairement compromises lorsqu\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent est \u00e9cart\u00e9 en l\u2019absence d\u2019une m\u00e9thodologie ad\u00e9quate. D\u2019ailleurs, si l\u2019on applique les crit\u00e8res implicites de mes coll\u00e8gues, il serait difficile de concevoir quels jugements de la Cour pourraient demeurer \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute attaque. Cela \u00e9tant dit, je retourne maintenant au r\u00f4le des intervenants.\nI. Le r\u00f4le des intervenants \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\n[103] Une intervention vise \u00e0 \u00ab saisir la cour d\u2019all\u00e9gations utiles et diff\u00e9rentes du point de vue d\u2019un tiers qui a un int\u00e9r\u00eat sp\u00e9cial ou une connaissance particuli\u00e8re de la question vis\u00e9e par la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel \u00bb (R. c. Morgentaler, [1993] 1 R.C.S. 462, p. 463; voir aussi R. c. Barton, 2019 CSC 33, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 579, par. 52; R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, DORS\/2002\u2011156, al. 57(2)b)). Les intervenants fournissent d\u2019autres points de vue sur les questions juridiques soulev\u00e9es par les parties et les cons\u00e9quences plus larges que pourrait avoir la d\u00e9cision de la Cour. Selon le contexte, ils peuvent mettre en valeur la jurisprudence pertinente, formuler des arguments \u00e9clairants ou clarifier les cheminements analytiques possibles qui sont susceptibles de r\u00e9soudre les questions soumises \u00e0 la Cour. Les intervenants peuvent \u00e9galement favoriser l\u2019exactitude en repr\u00e9sentant divers segments de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne et en fournissant une analyse fond\u00e9e sur leur exp\u00e9rience particuli\u00e8re ou leurs connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les causes qu\u2019entend notre Cour repr\u00e9sentent souvent des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, leur exp\u00e9rience et leurs connaissances peuvent \u00ab permett[re] \u00e0 la cour de trancher des questions complexes dont les r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9passent le cadre des int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance \u00bb (Barton, par. 52). Par leurs observations, les intervenants renseignent la Cour quant aux cons\u00e9quences directes et indirectes du litige sur diverses parties prenantes et d\u2019autres domaines du droit. De cette fa\u00e7on, les intervenants fournissent souvent une contribution importante. Pour ce faire, toutefois, ils doivent agir \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des limites reconnues. Les R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9noncent clairement ces limites et la Cour a publi\u00e9 plus d\u2019une fois des directives de pratique \u00e0 l\u2019intention des \u00e9ventuels intervenants afin de leur rappeler les limites qu\u2019ils doivent respecter (voir l\u2019Avis de novembre 2021; et l\u2019Avis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juridique : mars 2017 \u2014 D\u00e9termination du temps allou\u00e9 pour les plaidoiries orales, 2 mars 2017 (en ligne)).\n[104] De telles contraintes refl\u00e8tent une conception judicieuse du r\u00f4le des intervenants dans le cadre d\u2019un litige et du r\u00f4le de notre Cour. Bien que la Cour soit souvent appel\u00e9e \u00e0 trancher des questions dont les r\u00e9percussions vont au\u2011del\u00e0 des parties, elle demeure un organe juridictionnel. Le caract\u00e8re polycentrique d\u2019une question de droit ne transforme pas la Cour en comit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatif ou en commission royale (J.H. c. Alberta (Minister of Justice and Solicitor General), 2019 ABCA 420, 54 C.P.C. (8th) 346, par. 25\u201127). Le fonctionnement de la Cour demeure toujours solidement ancr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me accusatoire : les parties m\u00e8nent leur cause comme elles l\u2019entendent et d\u00e9cident quelles questions soulever. Cela ne change pas lorsque les parties plaident devant la Cour supr\u00eame. Au contraire, l\u2019importance de ce principe ne fait que s\u2019accro\u00eetre : le r\u00f4le de notre Cour, en tant que tribunal de derni\u00e8re instance, consiste \u00e0 trancher des litiges \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es en premi\u00e8re instance et des motifs de jugement de la juridiction d\u2019appel concernant les questions ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement d\u00e9battues par les parties.\n[105] De telles consid\u00e9rations aident \u00e0 expliquer les limites pr\u00e9cises qui encadrent les interventions. Premi\u00e8rement, les intervenants ne sont pas des parties. Le but d\u2019une intervention n\u2019est pas d\u2019appuyer une partie \u2014 par l\u00e0, je veux dire les appelants et les intim\u00e9s \u2014 mais de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intervenant de pr\u00e9senter son propre point de vue sur une question de droit dont la Cour est d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisie. Malgr\u00e9 la participation des intervenants, le pourvoi demeure un litige entre les parties (Avis de novembre 2021, point 2). C\u2019est pourquoi les intervenants ne doivent pas prendre position quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel (R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, par. 42(3); Avis de novembre 2021, point 3).\n[106] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les intervenants ne doivent pas soulever de nouvelles questions ou \u00ab \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e des questions en litige ou [. . .] y ajouter quoi que ce soit \u00bb (Morgentaler, p. 463; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la taxe sur les produits et services, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 445, p. 487; R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, par. 59(3); Avis de novembre 2021, point 4). Cependant, les intervenants peuvent pr\u00e9senter leurs propres arguments juridiques sur les questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulev\u00e9es et faire des observations quant \u00e0 l\u2019incidence qu\u2019elles ont sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats des personnes qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent (voir, p. ex., Premi\u00e8re nation crie Mikisew c. Canada (Ministre du Patrimoine canadien), 2005 CSC 69, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 388, par. 40; Canada (Justice) c. Khadr, 2008 CSC 29, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 143, par. 18; Barton, par. 52).\n[107] Les intervenants doivent veiller \u00e0 distinguer la formulation d\u2019un argument juridique permis de l\u2019ajout de nouvelles questions inadmissibles; ce sont l\u00e0 deux concepts distincts. Pr\u00e9senter un autre point de vue ou un argument juridique sur une question de droit existante n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose que soumettre une nouvelle question qui d\u00e9borde le cadre de l\u2019appel ou, pis encore, qui contredit les observations des parties quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de celui\u2011ci. Dans le premier cas, l\u2019intervention est susceptible d\u2019aider la Cour lors de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, tandis que dans le second, elle nuit \u00e0 celles\u2011ci. Bien que, dans de rares cas, il puisse \u00eatre difficile de distinguer les deux, ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En demandant \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape, certains intervenants, auxquels se rallient les juges Karakatsanis et Martin, ont soulev\u00e9 ce qui constitue clairement une nouvelle question.\n[108] Enfin, les intervenants ne sont pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 apporter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter autrement le dossier sans permission pr\u00e9alable (R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, al. 59(1)b)). Ils peuvent, bien entendu, pr\u00e9senter des observations pour expliquer l\u2019incidence que pourrait avoir le pourvoi sur les groupes qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent; il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un exercice appropri\u00e9 de leur r\u00f4le. Par contre, ils doivent prendre la cause et le dossier tels qu\u2019ils se trouvent, ou alors demander la permission de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, comme des faits l\u00e9gislatifs suppl\u00e9mentaires ou des \u00e9tudes contest\u00e9es (voir, p. ex., D. L. Watt et autres, Supreme Court of Canada Practice 2022 (2022), p. 369\u2011370, citant R.J.R. MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), Bulletin des proc\u00e9dures, 10 juin 1994, p. 990, et Anderson c. Amoco Canada Oil and Gas, Bulletin des proc\u00e9dures, 19 mars 2004, p. 453). Notre Cour, comme toujours, conserve le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de prendre toute mesure qu\u2019elle juge indiqu\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019un intervenant pr\u00e9sente de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sans permission ou lorsqu\u2019il formule des observations inappropri\u00e9es (voir l\u2019Avis de novembre 2021, point 6).\n[109] En somme, les intervenants peuvent faire des contributions utiles s\u2019ils respectent les r\u00e8gles, les directives de pratique et la jurisprudence de la Cour. En revanche, ils d\u00e9passent leur r\u00f4le lorsqu\u2019ils cherchent \u00e0 modifier la nature du litige en usurpant le r\u00f4le des parties, en \u00e9largissant la port\u00e9e des questions soumises \u00e0 la Cour ou en pr\u00e9sentant de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Les interventions qui contreviennent aux r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies sont inappropri\u00e9es et entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pour les parties, les intervenants potentiels et l\u2019administration de la justice.\nII. Les cons\u00e9quences des interventions inappropri\u00e9es\n[110] En premier lieu, les intervenants qui outrepassent leur r\u00f4le causent pr\u00e9judice aux parties en usurpant la direction du litige. Ce sont les parties \u2014 et non les intervenants \u2014 qui doivent diriger leur litige. Elles d\u00e9cident quelles questions soulever et quelles r\u00e9parations demander. Une intervention appropri\u00e9e respecte le partage des responsabilit\u00e9s parce qu\u2019elle est ancr\u00e9e dans les questions soulev\u00e9es par les parties. Une intervention inappropri\u00e9e compromet l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en for\u00e7ant les parties \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles elles n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au proc\u00e8s, et en [traduction] \u00ab retir[ant] la cause aux personnes directement concern\u00e9es \u00bb (Attorney-General of Canada c. Aluminum Co. of Canada (1987), 35 D.L.R. (4th) 495 (C.A. C.\u2011B.), p. 507; M. (K.) c. M. (H.), [1992] 3 R.C.S. 3, p. 4\u20115; voir aussi R. c. N.S., 2021 ONCA 605, 497 C.R.R. (2d) 75, par. 49). Les interventions inappropri\u00e9es peuvent aussi entra\u00eener des formes d\u2019iniquit\u00e9s sur le plan pratique pour les parties, comme des frais juridiques accrus ou des retards caus\u00e9s par le fait que les parties doivent r\u00e9pondre aux observations des intervenants ou pr\u00e9senter des requ\u00eates en radiation concernant des portions de celles\u2011ci.\n[111] En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, et plus fondamentalement, les intervenants qui, \u00e0 tort, soul\u00e8vent de nouvelles questions ou \u00e9largissent la port\u00e9e des questions en appel peuvent causer des effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 la saine administration de la justice. Le risque d\u2019inexactitude augmente lorsque les intervenants invitent la Cour \u00e0 raisonner dans l\u2019abstrait sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des d\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures et d\u2019un dossier de preuve complet.\n[112] En troisi\u00e8me lieu, les interventions inappropri\u00e9es minent le processus d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel. La Cour d\u00e9cide si elle accorde ou refuse une autorisation d\u2019appel apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 soigneusement le dossier d\u2019appel et les questions express\u00e9ment soulev\u00e9es par les parties. Les arguments d\u2019un intervenant qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre des questions pour lesquelles l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e compromettent l\u2019examen minutieux fait par la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande d\u2019autorisation.\n[113] En dernier lieu, les intervenants potentiels, que ce soit des organismes ou des procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, d\u00e9cident s\u2019ils interviennent dans une affaire donn\u00e9e en fonction des questions que les parties ont soumises \u00e0 la Cour. Lorsque les intervenants \u00e9largissent les questions en cause, les intervenants potentiels qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas intervenir subissent un pr\u00e9judice. En effet, ces derniers auraient pu d\u00e9cider d\u2019intervenir s\u2019ils avaient su que de nouvelles questions seraient soulev\u00e9es (voir Morgentaler, p. 463\u2011464). Au moment o\u00f9 les intervenants introduisent de nouvelles questions, toutefois, il est trop tard : les intervenants potentiels ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter, et la Cour de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir, de pr\u00e9cieux points de vue sur ces nouvelles questions.\n[114] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi illustre ces cons\u00e9quences s\u00e9rieuses. Soulever la nouvelle question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape devrait continuer \u00e0 faire autorit\u00e9 est une intervention inappropri\u00e9e. Elle fragilise l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 mener leur cause comme elles l\u2019entendent et, en fait, est contraire \u00e0 leurs observations selon lesquelles la Cour devrait appliquer cet arr\u00eat. Elle mine le processus d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel et exclut les intervenants potentiels qui pourraient faire des observations utiles concernant l\u2019application extraterritoriale de la Charte . Et au lieu de favoriser la justesse des d\u00e9cisions, elle invite la Cour \u00e0 raisonner dans l\u2019abstrait sans le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des d\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, d\u2019un dossier de preuve complet ou d\u2019observations de la part des parties.\n[115] Les r\u00e8gles, les directives de pratique et la jurisprudence de la Cour ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement con\u00e7ues en vue d\u2019\u00e9viter ces cons\u00e9quences, tout en faisant en sorte que les intervenants aident ad\u00e9quatement la Cour. Il est donc crucial que ces derniers respectent les limites qui leur sont impos\u00e9es. \u00c0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de ces limites, ils peuvent faire des contributions utiles fond\u00e9es sur leur expertise et leur exp\u00e9rience. Or, ce n\u2019est pas ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisque certains intervenants ont outrepass\u00e9 les limites bien \u00e9tablies de leur r\u00f4le. La Cour n\u2019est pas saisie de la question de savoir si l\u2019arr\u00eat Hape doit continuer de faire autorit\u00e9.

Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des deux victimes du vol qualifi\u00e9 n\u2019a vu clairement les auteurs des infractions, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient masqu\u00e9s. Pour identifier l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme participant au vol qualifi\u00e9, la Couronne s\u2019est fond\u00e9e exclusivement sur deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle : (1) l\u2019ADN de l\u2019accus\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 sur un m\u00e9got de cigarette d\u00e9couvert dans le v\u00e9hicule d\u2019une des deux victimes, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9 sur la sc\u00e8ne du crime et retrouv\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9; et (2) le t\u00e9moignage de la m\u00eame victime selon lequel elle a possiblement entendu pendant le vol qualifi\u00e9 un des auteurs des infractions prononcer le nom de famille de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel par l\u2019accus\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9. La juge dissidente aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et substitu\u00e9 des acquittements aux d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 sur le fondement du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable des verdicts.\nArr\u00eat (les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et O\u2019Bonsawin sont dissidentes) : L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nLes juges Rowe, Martin et Kasirer : Les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre annul\u00e9es et des verdicts d\u2019acquittement y \u00eatre substitu\u00e9s. Les verdicts \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables et ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9s par la preuve.\nLa preuve d\u2019ADN, prise isol\u00e9ment, ne suffisait pas pour \u00e9tablir la culpabilit\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable. Elle permettait, au mieux, d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 dans le v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 un certain moment avant que celui\u2011ci soit r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 par la police, mais aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019indiquait quand et pourquoi il a pu se trouver dans le v\u00e9hicule.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de la victime selon lequel il avait entendu le nom de famille de l\u2019accus\u00e9 durant le vol qualifi\u00e9 \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 de nombreuses faiblesses. L\u2019acceptation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de la victime ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par aucune interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la preuve. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 un aspect du t\u00e9moignage de la victime, et il n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re significative des nombreuses pr\u00e9occupations entourant l\u2019\u00e9tat mental et physique de la victime.\nCompte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, aucun juge des faits, agissant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re judiciaire, ne pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait la seule conclusion raisonnable. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des faiblesses de la preuve, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019accus\u00e9 de ne pas t\u00e9moigner peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e contre lui.\nLes juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et O\u2019Bonsawin (dissidentes) : L\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es. Le juge du proc\u00e8s pouvait \u00eatre raisonnablement convaincu que la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait la seule conclusion raisonnable compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve.\nPremi\u00e8rement, il \u00e9tait loisible au juge du proc\u00e8s de prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019absence totale de toute explication raisonnable pour justifier la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019ADN de l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans le v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9. Le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 la preuve d\u2019ADN isol\u00e9ment. Il s\u2019est plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 sur d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9liminer la possibilit\u00e9 que le m\u00e9got de cigarette ait pu se retrouver dans le v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9 avant le vol qualifi\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une autre occasion. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exigeaient une explication que seul le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019accus\u00e9 aurait pu fournir, de sorte qu\u2019il doit accepter les cons\u00e9quences de son choix d\u2019avoir gard\u00e9 le silence.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, le juge du proc\u00e8s occupait une position privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve d\u2019identification. Il faut faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses conclusions selon lesquelles le t\u00e9moignage de la victime \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et fiable. La question de savoir si un autre juge des faits aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente ne justifie pas d\u2019intervenir en appel. C\u2019est l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de la preuve d\u2019identification et de la solide preuve d\u2019ADN, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es logiquement et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine, qui a permis au juge d\u2019inf\u00e9rer la culpabilit\u00e9 quant au vol qualifi\u00e9 sous\u2011jacent.\nJurisprudence\nCit\u00e9e par le juge Rowe\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s : R. c.

La seule question au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait celle de l\u2019identit\u00e9. Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des deux victimes du vol qualifi\u00e9 n\u2019a vu clairement les auteurs des infractions, lesquels \u00e9taient au nombre de trois ou quatre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient masqu\u00e9s. Pour identifier l\u2019appelant comme participant au vol qualifi\u00e9, la Couronne s\u2019est fond\u00e9e exclusivement sur deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle : (1) l\u2019ADN de l\u2019appelant trouv\u00e9 sur un m\u00e9got de cigarette d\u00e9couvert dans le v\u00e9hicule d\u2019une des deux victimes, M. Iten, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9 sur la sc\u00e8ne du crime et retrouv\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 environ 11 heures apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9; et (2) le t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten selon lequel il a possiblement entendu pendant l\u2019infraction un des intrus prononcer le nom \u00ab Metzger \u00bb. Sur la base de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est dit convaincu hors de tout doute raisonnable que l\u2019appelant avait particip\u00e9 au vol qualifi\u00e9. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel par l\u2019appelant de ses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9. La juge Veldhuis, dissidente, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel et substitu\u00e9 des acquittements aux d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es puisque, selon elle, ces verdicts \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables.\n[2] Je suis d\u2019avis que les verdicts \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables et que le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre accueilli. M\u00eame en tenant compte de la position privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e du juge du proc\u00e8s, je suis convaincu que les verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9 ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9s par la preuve : R. c. Brunelle, 2022 CSC 5, par. 7.\n[3] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a reconnu que la preuve d\u2019ADN, prise isol\u00e9ment, ne suffirait pas pour \u00e9tablir la culpabilit\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable. Je suis d\u2019accord. La preuve d\u2019ADN permettait, au mieux, d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que l\u2019appelant s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 dans le v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 un certain moment avant que celui\u2011ci soit r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 par la police. Par contre, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019indiquait quand et pourquoi l\u2019appelant a pu se trouver dans le v\u00e9hicule, dont on avait perdu la trace durant les 11 heures qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre le vol qualifi\u00e9 et le moment o\u00f9 les policiers l\u2019ont retrouv\u00e9. De plus, avant le vol qualifi\u00e9, M. Iten avait l\u2019habitude de laisser les cl\u00e9s dans le v\u00e9hicule. Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 la juge dissidente de la Cour d\u2019appel, des v\u00eatements ainsi que d\u2019autres objets se trouvaient aussi dans le v\u00e9hicule; ceux\u2011ci n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9s pour des analyses d\u2019ADN, comme l\u2019a reconnu l\u2019agent charg\u00e9 de l\u2019identification judiciaire. Dans les circonstances, la preuve d\u2019ADN \u00e0 elle seule ne pouvait pas constituer une preuve compl\u00e8te de la participation au vol qualifi\u00e9.\n[4] L\u2019autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve circonstancielle qui appuyait la preuve d\u2019ADN \u00e9tait le t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten selon lequel il avait entendu le nom \u00ab Metzger \u00bb durant l\u2019infraction. Or, ce t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 de nombreuses faiblesses. Monsieur Iten avait \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate avec un b\u00e2ton de baseball au d\u00e9but du vol qualifi\u00e9 et il avait perdu et repris connaissance \u00e0 plusieurs reprises par la suite. D\u2019ailleurs, durant son t\u00e9moignage, il a lui\u2011m\u00eame activement remis en question ses propres souvenirs de ce qu\u2019il avait entendu. Il n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat de ce souvenir dans ses premiers entretiens avec la police; c\u2019est plut\u00f4t un enqu\u00eateur qui a mentionn\u00e9 le nom \u00ab Metzger \u00bb \u00e0 M. Iten durant une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, des mois ou possiblement des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9. Pendant le proc\u00e8s, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il se souvenait d\u2019avoir entendu le nom avant cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, M. Iten a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative; il a indiqu\u00e9 que sa r\u00e9ponse se fondait sur des discussions entretenues apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9 avec la deuxi\u00e8me victime, M. Rivard, qui, selon lui, partageait le m\u00eame souvenir. Or, cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par ce dernier dans son t\u00e9moignage. Monsieur Iten a aussi envisag\u00e9 que son souvenir d\u2019avoir entendu le nom ait pu constituer un faux souvenir caus\u00e9 par un traumatisme datant de son enfance d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019association qu\u2019il fait avec le terme \u00ab metzger \u00bb en allemand, qui signifie \u00ab boucher \u00bb, qui est la vocation de toute une vie pour M. Iten.\n[5] M\u00eame si l\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 de M. Iten n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question, selon moi, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un des rares cas o\u00f9 l\u2019acceptation par le juge du proc\u00e8s de la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par aucune interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la preuve : R. c. Burke, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 474, par. 7; Brunelle, par. 8. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu \u00e0 tort que l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence entre les t\u00e9moignages de M. Iten et M. Rivard [traduction] \u00ab [n]\u2019avait aucune incidence \u00bb, parce qu\u2019ils se trouvaient dans deux pi\u00e8ces diff\u00e9rentes et ont pu ne pas entendre la m\u00eame chose. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le fait que M. Iten a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient le m\u00eame souvenir. De plus, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re significative des nombreuses pr\u00e9occupations entourant l\u2019\u00e9tat mental et physique de M. Iten durant et apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9.\n[6] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve \u2014 y compris les faiblesses du t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten et l\u2019absence de quelque autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve inculpatoire hormis la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019ADN de l\u2019appelant sur le m\u00e9got de cigarette \u2014, je suis convaincu qu\u2019aucun \u00ab juge des faits, agissant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re judiciaire, [ne] pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait la seule conclusion raisonnable \u00bb : R. c. Villaroman, 2016 CSC 33, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 1000, par. 55. Les verdicts \u00e9taient donc d\u00e9raisonnables.\n[7] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des faiblesses \u00e0 la fois de la preuve d\u2019ADN et du souvenir de M. Iten, je suis avec \u00e9gards en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019opinion selon laquelle il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019appelant de ne pas t\u00e9moigner peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e contre lui. Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 la juge dissidente, en citant la d\u00e9cision R. c. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, par. 69,\n[traduction] il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exigeaient une explication que seul le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant aurait pu fournir, de sorte qu\u2019il doit accepter les cons\u00e9quences de son choix d\u2019avoir gard\u00e9 le silence. La preuve de la Couronne \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s faible et reposait sur l\u2019identification. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019accus\u00e9 de ne pas t\u00e9moigner ne mine en rien son argument que le verdict \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(motifs de la C.A., par. 87 (CanLII))\n[8] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de traiter des arguments suppl\u00e9mentaires de l\u2019appelant relatifs \u00e0 la doctrine de la possession r\u00e9cente.\n[9] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019annuler les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et d\u2019y substituer des verdicts d\u2019acquittement.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise des motifs des juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et O\u2019Bonsawin rendus par\nLa juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2014\n[10] L\u2019appelant, Shawn Metzger, interjette appel de plein droit de ses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 pour vol qualifi\u00e9 et entr\u00e9e par effraction d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une invasion de domicile survenu le 24 juin 2017. La seule question en litige au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait celle de l\u2019identit\u00e9. Aucune des victimes n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de voir les trois ou quatre intrus, qui \u00e9taient masqu\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s avoir commis le vol qualifi\u00e9, ces derniers se sont enfuis \u00e0 bord d\u2019un camion appartenant \u00e0 un des occupants, M. Valentin Iten. Le camion a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 et verrouill\u00e9 environ 11 heures plus tard. Un m\u00e9got de cigarette a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 sous le si\u00e8ge du conducteur et envoy\u00e9 pour un test d\u2019ADN, qui a d\u00e9cel\u00e9 un seul profil g\u00e9n\u00e9tique correspondant \u00e0 celui de l\u2019appelant.\n[11] La question principale que pose le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est celle de savoir si le juge du proc\u00e8s a rendu un verdict d\u00e9raisonnable en d\u00e9clarant l\u2019appelant coupable sur la foi (1) de la pr\u00e9sence de son ADN dans le camion vol\u00e9; et (2) du t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten selon lequel il a entendu quelqu\u2019un prononcer le nom de famille de l\u2019appelant, \u00ab Metzger \u00bb, durant le vol qualifi\u00e9. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant, concluant que les verdicts n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9raisonnables (2022 ABCA 16). Je suis d\u2019accord. Selon moi, le juge du proc\u00e8s pouvait \u00eatre raisonnablement convaincu que la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait la seule conclusion raisonnable compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve (R. c. Villaroman, 2016 CSC 33, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 1000, par. 55).\n[12] Dans les circonstances, aucune explication raisonnable ne pouvait justifier la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019ADN de l\u2019appelant sur un m\u00e9got de cigarette retrouv\u00e9 sous le si\u00e8ge du conducteur du camion vol\u00e9, outre celle de sa participation au vol qualifi\u00e9 moins de 12 heures plus t\u00f4t. Le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 la preuve d\u2019ADN isol\u00e9ment. Il s\u2019est plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 sur d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9liminer la possibilit\u00e9 que le m\u00e9got de cigarette ait pu se retrouver dans le camion vol\u00e9 avant le vol qualifi\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une autre occasion. Il est admis que M. Iten ne connaissait pas l\u2019appelant. Il importe de souligner que [traduction] \u00ab [p]ersonne d\u2019autre n\u2019a utilis\u00e9 le camion \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du vol qualifi\u00e9 (motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, reproduits dans le d.a., p. 21). Monsieur Iten et son colocataire ont tous les deux entendu le camion d\u00e9marrer \u00e0 la fin du vol qualifi\u00e9. Le camion a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9 et ne portait aucun signe d\u2019effraction. Le m\u00e9got a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 sous le si\u00e8ge du conducteur et l\u2019ADN ne correspondait qu\u2019au profil de l\u2019appelant. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve [traduction] \u00ab exigeaient une explication que seul le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant aurait pu fournir, de sorte qu\u2019il doit accepter les cons\u00e9quences de son choix d\u2019avoir gard\u00e9 le silence \u00bb (R. c. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, par. 69; voir aussi R. c. George\u2011Nurse, 2019 CSC 12, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 570, par. 1). Il \u00e9tait loisible au juge de prendre en consid\u00e9ration \u00ab l\u2019absence totale de toute explication raisonnable \u00bb (R. c. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 59, p. 73; voir aussi R. c. Noble, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 874, par. 103) pour justifier la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019ADN de l\u2019appelant dans le camion vol\u00e9, et ce, \u00e0 peine quelques heures apr\u00e8s le vol qualifi\u00e9 et \u00e0 une courte distance de la r\u00e9sidence des victimes.\n[13] Certes, certains pourraient juger que la preuve d\u2019identification relative \u00e0 \u00ab Metzger \u00bb \u00e9tait faible, mais le juge du proc\u00e8s occupait une position privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve (R. c. Brunelle, 2022 CSC 5, par. 9, citant R. c. Beaudry, 2007 CSC 5, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 190, par. 62). La question est celle de savoir si les conclusions du juge trouvaient \u00ab suffisamment appui dans la preuve et si elle[s] [sont] exempte[s] d\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00bb (Brunelle, par. 8). \u00c0 l\u2019instar des juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il faut faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions du juge du proc\u00e8s selon lesquelles le t\u00e9moignage de M. Iten \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et fiable. La question de savoir si un autre juge des faits aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente ne justifie pas d\u2019intervenir en appel (motifs de la C.A., par. 26 et 34 (CanLII)). Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, c\u2019est l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de la preuve d\u2019identification et de la solide preuve d\u2019ADN qui a permis au juge d\u2019inf\u00e9rer la culpabilit\u00e9 quant au vol qualifi\u00e9 sous\u2011jacent.\n[14] La jurisprudence invoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, dans laquelle la preuve d\u2019ADN ou d\u2019empreintes digitales a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e insuffisante pour en d\u00e9duire la culpabilit\u00e9 pour le vol ou le vol qualifi\u00e9 sous\u2011jacent, peut \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Dans la d\u00e9cision R. c. Mars (2006), 206 O.A.C. 387, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne permettait de d\u00e9terminer quand l\u2019empreinte digitale de l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e sur la bo\u00eete de pizza qui a servi pour commettre le vol qualifi\u00e9 (par. 21). De plus, selon le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un voisin, les trois voleurs \u00e9taient noirs, [traduction] \u00ab ce qui, dans les faits, excluait l\u2019appelant qui [. . .] \u00e9tait blanc \u00bb (le juge Doherty, par. 27). De m\u00eame, dans les d\u00e9cisions R. c. Nicholl (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 549 (C.A. Ont.) \u2014 o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une cannette de boisson gazeuse portant l\u2019empreinte du pouce de l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e dans le v\u00e9hicule deux semaines apr\u00e8s que celui\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9 \u2014 et R. c. Grayston, 2016 ONCA 784 \u2014 o\u00f9 une cagoule sur laquelle se trouvait l\u2019ADN de l\u2019accus\u00e9 et d\u2019autres individus a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e dans le v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9 \u2014, la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e compatible avec des explications autres que la culpabilit\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision R. c. Ahmed, 2015 ONCA 848, l\u2019ADN de l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 \u2014 tout comme trois autres correspondances d\u2019ADN \u2014 sur un sac d\u2019\u00e9picerie en plastique utilis\u00e9 durant un vol qualifi\u00e9. Or, les sacs de ce type sont [traduction] \u00ab courants, portables, jetables et r\u00e9utilisables \u00bb (par. 7 (CanLII)). Compte tenu que les descriptions fournies par les t\u00e9moins oculaires de la Couronne \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, la preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019inf\u00e9rence selon laquelle l\u2019ADN de l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sur le sac durant l\u2019infraction.\n[15] En revanche, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires permettait au juge du proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9terminer quand la cigarette de l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e dans le camion vol\u00e9. Je note en outre qu\u2019une preuve d\u2019ADN, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e seule ou en combinaison avec une preuve d\u2019identification [traduction] \u00ab moins que solide \u00bb, a servi \u00e0 fonder des verdicts de culpabilit\u00e9 dans des causes similaires (R. c. Stjepanovic, 2006 BCCA 169, 223 B.C.A.C. 226, par. 10\u201111; voir aussi R. c. O\u2019Brien, 2011 CSC 29, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 485, par. 2 et 13\u201116).\n[16] Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une cause o\u00f9 le verdict du juge \u00ab ne peut s\u2019appuyer sur la preuve \u00bb (Brunelle, par. 7). Au contraire, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un verdict qu\u2019un juge des faits ayant re\u00e7u des directives appropri\u00e9es aurait pu raisonnablement rendre (Villaroman, par. 55). Le juge pouvait conclure que \u00ab la preuve circonstancielle, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e logiquement et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine \u00bb, ne pouvait raisonnablement fonder une inf\u00e9rence autre que celle de la culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant (Villaroman, par. 38). Je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi et de confirmer les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant.\nPourvoi accueilli, les juges C\u00f4t\u00e9 et O\u2019Bonsawin sont dissidentes.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant : Ruttan Bates, Calgary.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 : Alberta Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary."

C\u201146, art. 162(1) a).\nL\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 2 chefs de voyeurisme pour avoir subrepticement pris 38 photos de 2 gar\u00e7ons \u00e2g\u00e9s entre 12 et 14 ans dans leurs sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans des vestiaires d\u2019un ar\u00e9na de hockey. L\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019entra\u00eeneur de hockey des gar\u00e7ons. La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que la Couronne avait prouv\u00e9 les quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme au sens de l\u2019al. 162(1) a) du Code criminel hors de tout doute raisonnable : l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait pris les photos des gar\u00e7ons (1) intentionnellement; (2) subrepticement; (3) dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existait une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e; et (4) dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, en ce qui concerne le quatri\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, elle a effectivement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019al. 162(1) a) comme n\u2019ayant aucune composante temporelle implicite, affirmant que l\u2019al. 162(1) a) met l\u2019accent sur la nature du lieu dans lequel une observation ou un enregistrement est fait, mais n\u2019exige pas que la personne qui est l\u2019objet de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 nue, ou l\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, ou qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la personne soit nue. Elle a constat\u00e9 que des individus de divers \u00e2ges changent de sous\u2011v\u00eatements ou se douchent dans les vestiaires, et qu\u2019il est donc raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils y soient nus, et que cette constatation \u00e9tait suffisante pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 162(1) a).\nLes juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont accueilli l\u2019appel de l\u2019accus\u00e9, annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Ils ont conclu que la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas demand\u00e9 s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment o\u00f9 les infractions auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 s\u2019appliquer aux personnes qui s\u2019attendent \u00e0 observer ou \u00e0 enregistrer de la nudit\u00e9 ou une activit\u00e9 sexuelle. La juge dissidente \u00e9tait d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel. Selon elle, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) ne renferme aucune composante temporelle implicite; la disposition met plut\u00f4t l\u2019accent sur le \u00ab lieu \u00bb, qui, au sens de l\u2019al. 162(1)a), est un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, peu importe l\u2019utilisation pr\u00e9vue de ce lieu en particulier lorsque la conduite est survenue.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli et les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 sont r\u00e9tablies.\nCorrectement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son texte, \u00e0 son contexte et \u00e0 son objet, l\u2019al. 162(1) a) du Code criminel n\u2019a aucune composante temporelle implicite. La Couronne n\u2019a donc pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans le lieu au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Par cons\u00e9quent, c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable de voyeurisme en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1) a).\nLes objectifs qu\u2019avait le Parlement en cr\u00e9ant l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme au par. 162(1) \u00e9taient de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes. L\u2019objectif du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e se d\u00e9gage des mots introductifs du par. 162(1), qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit de circonstances o\u00f9 une personne s\u2019attendrait raisonnablement \u00e0 ne pas faire l\u2019objet du type d\u2019observation ou d\u2019enregistrement qui est effectivement survenu. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019objectif du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, il ressort de chacun des al. a), b) et c) du par. 162(1). L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes dans des lieux d\u00e9termin\u00e9s. Il n\u2019exige pas que la personne soit effectivement nue, qu\u2019elle expose des parties intimes de son corps ou qu\u2019elle se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle; il suffit qu\u2019elle se trouve dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne se trouve dans un tel \u00e9tat, par exemple dans un vestiaire, aux toilettes, dans une cabine de douche ou dans une chambre \u00e0 coucher. De plus, l\u2019al. a) n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019accus\u00e9 agisse dans un but sexuel. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)b) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes qui se livrent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir lorsque la personne est nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite, et l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans le dessein d\u2019ainsi observer ou enregistrer une personne. Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. b), la nature du lieu n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance, mais l\u2019accus\u00e9 doit avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019ainsi observer ou enregistrer le sujet. Comme dans le cas de l\u2019al. a), la Couronne n\u2019est pas tenue de prouver que l\u2019accus\u00e9 a agi dans un but sexuel. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)c) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes lorsque l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans un but sexuel. Il s\u2019applique que le sujet soit v\u00eatu ou non, peu importe ce qu\u2019il fait, et ind\u00e9pendamment du lieu o\u00f9 se trouve le sujet cibl\u00e9. Les mots introductifs du par. 162(1) prot\u00e8gent aussi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, et chacun des al. a), b) et c) du par. 162(1) prot\u00e8ge aussi la vie priv\u00e9e.\nLa question de savoir si le \u00ab lieu \u00bb dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) est assorti d\u2019une composante temporelle implicite en est une d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative. Les termes de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 sur le fondement d\u2019une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s\u2019harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble. Le texte de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) renvoie \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re concernant le \u00ab lieu \u00bb qui est objectif \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) emploie l\u2019article d\u00e9fini \u00ab la personne \u00bb lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9signe le sujet de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement, mais il emploie l\u2019article ind\u00e9fini \u00ab une personne \u00bb lorsqu\u2019il renvoie aux utilisations du lieu auxquelles on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre. Cela veut dire que la personne subrepticement observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e doit se trouver dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) pose la question de savoir s\u2019il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans le lieu, et non celle de savoir si l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019attendait subjectivement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle le soit.\nToutefois, l\u2019emploi d\u2019un crit\u00e8re objectif \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 savoir si la disposition renferme une composante temporelle, puisqu\u2019il demeure possible que le Parlement ait voulu que l\u2019\u00e9valuation objective soit faite \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis. Le principal point textuel est l\u2019absence de libell\u00e9 explicite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) indiquant que le Parlement voulait que le \u00ab lieu \u00bb soit \u00e9valu\u00e9 au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Si le Parlement entendait insister sur une telle composante temporelle, il aurait pu le faire express\u00e9ment en faisant mention de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est alors raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, ou dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement.\nLe contexte l\u00e9gislatif et l\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) tendent \u00e9galement \u00e0 indiquer que le Parlement ne voulait pas que la disposition renferme une composante temporelle. Consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) cr\u00e9e une infraction tributaire du lieu, sans composante temporelle, favorise l\u2019atteinte des objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle. Plut\u00f4t que de fournir une liste pr\u00e9cise de lieux prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)a), le Parlement a choisi de d\u00e9finir les lieux prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re rationnelle et normative. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) identifie normativement une cat\u00e9gorie de \u00ab lieux s\u00fbrs \u00bb typiques, comme les chambres \u00e0 coucher, les salles de bains et les vestiaires, o\u00f9 une personne doit avoir le droit de ne pas \u00eatre observ\u00e9e ou faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un enregistrement visuel sans son consentement, qu\u2019il soit ou non raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que cette personne, ou toute autre personne se trouvant dans ce lieu, soit nue au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement. Une observation ou un enregistrement dans un tel \u00ab lieu s\u00fbr \u00bb typique constitue un abus de confiance, et peut entra\u00eener l\u2019humiliation, l\u2019objectification, l\u2019exploitation, la honte et la perte d\u2019estime de soi de la personne, en plus de causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9motionnel et psychologique, et ce, m\u00eame si la personne n\u2019est pas observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e pendant qu\u2019elle est nue. De cette fa\u00e7on, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) prot\u00e8ge la vie priv\u00e9e, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend de nos jours.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eat examin\u00e9 : R. c.

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi concerne la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1) a) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 . Aux termes de l\u2019al. 162(1) a), commet une infraction quiconque, subrepticement, observe une personne \u2014 ou produit un enregistrement visuel d\u2019une personne \u2014 se trouvant dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, si la personne se trouve dans \u00ab un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de d\u00e9cider si le \u00ab lieu \u00bb dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1) a) est assorti d\u2019une composante temporelle implicite : plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la personne doit\u2011elle se trouver dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 la personne est subrepticement observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e?\n[2] Au vu des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si un entra\u00eeneur de hockey, l\u2019intim\u00e9, Randy William Downes, a commis l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) en photographiant subrepticement 2 gar\u00e7ons \u00e2g\u00e9s entre 12 et 14 ans dans leurs sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans des vestiaires d\u2019un ar\u00e9na de hockey, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s quant \u00e0 savoir si des gar\u00e7ons de cet \u00e2ge se douchent ou sont nus dans des vestiaires \u00e9tait contradictoire.\n[3] La juge du proc\u00e8s s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par notre Cour dans R. c. Jarvis, 2019 CSC 10, [2019] 1 R.C.S. 488, quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme. Elle a effectivement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme n\u2019ayant aucune composante temporelle implicite, et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Downes coupable de deux chefs de voyeurisme. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique (le juge Willcock, avec l\u2019accord du juge Grauer) n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par la juge du proc\u00e8s. Ils ont annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et ont ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s au motif que la juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019avait pas abord\u00e9 les contradictions dans la preuve quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que des personnes soient nues lorsque les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. La juge Dickson, dissidente, \u00e9tait du m\u00eame avis que la juge du proc\u00e8s et aurait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel.\n[4] La Couronne se pourvoit maintenant de plein droit devant notre Cour sur la question de droit \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) a une composante temporelle implicite. De plus, M. Downes pr\u00e9tend que si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) est interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9pourvu d\u2019une composante temporelle, la disposition est inconstitutionnelle pour cause de port\u00e9e excessive, en violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Monsieur Downes n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 cette question constitutionnelle au proc\u00e8s. Il l\u2019a soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant la Cour d\u2019appel, mais cette derni\u00e8re ne l\u2019a pas examin\u00e9e.\n[5] \u00c0 mon avis, correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son texte, \u00e0 son contexte et \u00e0 son objet, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019a aucune composante temporelle implicite. Le texte de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) ne contient aucune formulation sugg\u00e9rant que le Parlement ait voulu que le \u00ab lieu \u00bb soit \u00e9valu\u00e9 au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Qui plus est, comme l\u2019a fait observer notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, les objectifs qu\u2019avait le Parlement en cr\u00e9ant l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme \u00e9taient de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes. Interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme s\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune composante temporelle implicite favorise l\u2019atteinte de ces objectifs, et tenir pour incluse une pareille composante nuirait \u00e0 leur r\u00e9alisation. De fait, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) d\u00e9signe des lieux comme les chambres \u00e0 coucher, les salles de bain et les vestiaires comme des \u00ab lieux s\u00fbrs \u00bb o\u00f9 les gens doivent \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019intrusions dans leur vie priv\u00e9e et leur int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, qu\u2019il soit ou non raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne dans le lieu soit nue ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 la personne est subrepticement observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e. Enfin, je refuserais d\u2019examiner la question constitutionnelle, puisque la pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas un cas o\u00f9 il convient que notre Cour exerce exceptionnellement son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour trancher une telle question pour la premi\u00e8re fois en appel. Je suis par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de r\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9.\nII. Contexte\n[6] Monsieur Downes a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de 2 chefs de voyeurisme en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1) a) du Code criminel pour avoir subrepticement pris 38 photos de 2 joueurs de hockey adolescents, T.R. et G.C., dans des vestiaires de hockey. Monsieur Downes \u00e9tait l\u2019entra\u00eeneur de hockey des gar\u00e7ons. Il exploitait en outre une entreprise de photographie sportive \u00e0 partir de son domicile.\n[7] En mars 2016, des agents de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (\u00ab ASFC \u00bb) ont fouill\u00e9 les appareils \u00e9lectroniques de M. Downes \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re \u00e0 son retour au Canada d\u2019un court voyage de magasinage aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, et ils ont trouv\u00e9 des milliers de photos d\u2019enfants se livrant \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s sportives. Certains des enfants \u00e9taient dans des vestiaires. Monsieur Downes a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC que les photos avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises dans le cadre de son entreprise de photographie sportive. M\u00eame si aucune photo ne comprenait de la nudit\u00e9 ou de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile, l\u2019ASFC a alert\u00e9 la GRC, craignant que M. Downes ait pu avoir de la pornographie juv\u00e9nile sur son ordinateur \u00e0 la maison.\n[8] En avril 2016, la GRC a obtenu et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 un mandat de perquisition et de fouille du domicile et des appareils \u00e9lectroniques de M. Downes. Ils ont trouv\u00e9 les photos de T.R. et de G.C. qui ont men\u00e9 aux accusations de voyeurisme. Les photos de T.R. ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises alors qu\u2019il avait 13 ou 14 ans et le montrent assis sur un banc ne portant que ses sous\u2011v\u00eatements, r\u00e9v\u00e9lant la r\u00e9gion de son entrejambe et son torse nu, ou enfilant ses v\u00eatements de ville apr\u00e8s un entra\u00eenement de hockey. Les photos de G.C. ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises alors qu\u2019il avait environ 12 ans et le montrent portant uniquement des sous\u2011v\u00eatements, portant un chandail et un cale\u00e7on, ou compl\u00e8tement habill\u00e9; sur certaines photos, G.C. se tient debout, v\u00eatu, devant un lavabo dans la salle de toilettes d\u2019un vestiaire. Monsieur Downes a dit \u00e0 la GRC qu\u2019il aimait les jeunes gar\u00e7ons, mais qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un truc sexuel \u00bb (d.a., vol. III, p. 207).\n[9] Monsieur Downes a pris les photos de T.R. et de G.C. \u00e0 l\u2019aide de son iPhone. Il a supprim\u00e9 certaines photos, mais il s\u2019en est envoy\u00e9 d\u2019autres par courriel, les a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es sur un ordinateur et copi\u00e9es sur une cl\u00e9 USB. Il a \u00e9galement cadr\u00e9 certaines photos pour mettre en \u00e9vidence G.C.\n[10] Ni T.R., ni G.C., ni la m\u00e8re de G.C. ne savaient que M. Downes avait pris les photos. La juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que, selon toute vraisemblance, M. Downes savait qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement de la ligue de hockey interdisait l\u2019usage de t\u00e9l\u00e9phones cellulaires dans les vestiaires pour emp\u00eacher que l\u2019on prenne des photos d\u2019enfants.\n[11] Au proc\u00e8s, les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de la preuve quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans un vestiaire de hockey. La preuve portait sur la question de savoir si des gar\u00e7ons enlevaient leurs sous\u2011v\u00eatements ou se douchaient dans les vestiaires. Dans leurs t\u00e9moignages, T.R. et G.C. ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne se douchaient pas dans les vestiaires, mais que certains de leurs co\u00e9quipiers le faisaient. Un des anciens joueurs de hockey de M. Downes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il changeait de sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans les vestiaires et que m\u00eame s\u2019il ne se douchait pas, d\u2019autres joueurs le faisaient \u00e0 l\u2019occasion. Un autre des anciens joueurs de hockey de M. Downes a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019entre les \u00e2ges de 11 \u00e0 14 ou 15 ans, il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement ou douch\u00e9 dans les vestiaires et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais vu d\u2019autres le faire. Trois entra\u00eeneurs de hockey (dont deux avaient agi comme entra\u00eeneurs avec M. Downes) ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les gar\u00e7ons des \u00e2ges de T.R. et G.C. sont rarement nus et se douchent rarement dans les vestiaires; une ancienne g\u00e9rante d\u2019une des \u00e9quipes de hockey de M. Downes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens. Un entra\u00eeneur de hockey a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi parce que les gar\u00e7ons des \u00e2ges de T.R. et de G.C. sont trop g\u00ean\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs corps. Toutefois, il y avait un consensus sur le fait que les enfants un peu plus vieux que T.R. et G.C. et les adultes sont souvent nus ou se douchent fr\u00e9quemment dans les vestiaires.\nIII. D\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures\nA. Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2019 BCSC 992 (la juge MacNaughton)\n[12] La juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Downes coupable des deux accusations de voyeurisme. Selon elle, la Couronne avait prouv\u00e9 les quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments du voyeurisme au sens de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) hors de tout doute raisonnable : M. Downes avait pris les photos de T.R. et de G.C. (1) intentionnellement, (2) subrepticement, (3) dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existait une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e et (4) dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue.\n[13] La juge du proc\u00e8s a appliqu\u00e9 les facteurs contextuels identifi\u00e9s par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis et a conclu que T.R. et G.C. se trouvaient dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existait une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Elle a fait remarquer que T.R. et G.C. se trouvaient dans un lieu priv\u00e9 ou semi\u2011priv\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019habillage et au d\u00e9shabillage; que leurs parents les avaient confi\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Downes, un entra\u00eeneur exp\u00e9riment\u00e9; et qu\u2019ils ne s\u2019attendaient pas \u00e0 \u00eatre photographi\u00e9s par leur entra\u00eeneur par l\u2019utilisation subreptice d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire \u00e0 des fins autres que l\u2019entra\u00eenement. La juge du proc\u00e8s a statu\u00e9 que m\u00eame si T.R. et G.C. s\u2019attendaient \u00e0 \u00eatre observ\u00e9s par d\u2019autres dans le vestiaire, ils ne s\u2019attendaient pas \u00e0 \u00eatre photographi\u00e9s, et ne s\u2019attendaient pas non plus \u00e0 ce que M. Downes s\u2019envoie des photos d\u2019eux par courriel et qu\u2019il garde ces photos longtemps apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il ait cess\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des rapports avec eux.\n[14] Au proc\u00e8s, M. Downes n\u2019a pas express\u00e9ment plaid\u00e9 que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) renferme une composante temporelle implicite. Il a fait plut\u00f4t valoir que la Couronne devait prouver que T.R. et G.C. se trouvaient dans un lieu o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient nus. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, la preuve montrait que ni T.R. ni G.C. ne s\u2019attendaient \u00e0 \u00eatre nus dans les vestiaires o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 photographi\u00e9s. La juge du proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 cet argument. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) met l\u2019accent sur la nature du lieu dans lequel une observation ou un enregistrement est fait, mais n\u2019exige pas que la personne qui est l\u2019objet de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 nue, ou l\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, ou qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la personne soit nue. Aux termes de l\u2019al. 162(1)a), il suffit qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne (et non \u00ab la personne \u00bb) soit nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite. De l\u2019avis de la juge du proc\u00e8s, les domiciles, les salles de bain et les vestiaires sont des lieux traditionnellement priv\u00e9s ou quasi\u2011priv\u00e9s dans lesquels une personne peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et dans lesquels il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit nue ou partiellement nue. En mettant l\u2019accent, \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a), sur le lieu dans lequel une observation ou un enregistrement est fait, on reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il existe des espaces priv\u00e9s ou semi\u2011priv\u00e9s dans lesquels une personne doit \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre le fait d\u2019\u00eatre observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e.\n[15] La juge du proc\u00e8s a constat\u00e9 que des individus de divers \u00e2ges changent de sous\u2011v\u00eatements ou se douchent dans les vestiaires, et qu\u2019il est donc raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils y soient nus. Elle a conclu que cette constatation \u00e9tait suffisante pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. 162(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, les vestiaires dans lesquels M. Downes avait photographi\u00e9 T.R. et G.C. \u00e9taient des lieux o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue.\nB. Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2022 BCCA 8, 409 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (les juges Willcock et Grauer, la juge Dickson, dissidente)\n[16] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique ont accueilli l\u2019appel de M. Downes, annul\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Les juges majoritaires ont conclu que la juge du proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas demand\u00e9 s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue [traduction] \u00ab au moment \u00bb o\u00f9 les infractions auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises (par. 40 et 55). Les juges majoritaires ont affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 s\u2019appliquer aux personnes qui s\u2019attendent \u00e0 observer ou \u00e0 enregistrer de la nudit\u00e9 ou une activit\u00e9 sexuelle. \u00c0 leur avis, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) ne criminalise pas le seul fait de porter atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. Les juges majoritaires ont fait remarquer que m\u00eame si la conduite de M. Downes impliquait un abus de confiance et une atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, cela n\u2019avait pas n\u00e9cessairement pour effet d\u2019en faire une conduite que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) criminalisait en tant qu\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel.\n[17] Les juges majoritaires ont statu\u00e9 que m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la juge du proc\u00e8s de conclure qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans les vestiaires o\u00f9 T.R. et G.C. ont \u00e9t\u00e9 photographi\u00e9s, elle n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 les contradictions dans la preuve quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019on pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Les juges majoritaires ont par cons\u00e9quent ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\n[18] La juge Dickson a exprim\u00e9 sa dissidence. \u00c0 son avis, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) ne renferme aucune composante temporelle implicite; la disposition met plut\u00f4t l\u2019accent sur le \u00ab lieu \u00bb. Le lieu pertinent au sens de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) est [traduction] \u00ab un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, expose des parties intimes de son corps ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle, peu importe l\u2019utilisation pr\u00e9vue de ce lieu en particulier lorsque la conduite est survenue \u00bb (par. 56 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). La juge a affirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019une personne se trouve dans [traduction] \u00ab un lieu manifestement priv\u00e9 comme une salle de bain ou un vestiaire, elle est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ne pas y \u00eatre subrepticement observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 92). \u00c0 son avis, le Parlement entendait criminaliser l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement subreptice de personnes dans les lieux de ce genre.\n[19] La juge Dickson a conclu que M. Downes avait criminellement port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle de T.R. et de G.C. en les photographiant subrepticement dans leurs sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans les vestiaires, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si on pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que quelqu\u2019un soit nu \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis. La conduite de M. Downes constituait [traduction] \u00ab une exploitation grave et une atteinte \u00e0 la personne \u00bb, et elle \u00e9tait \u00ab criminalis\u00e9e \u00e0 juste titre comme une forme d\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel \u00bb (par. 97).\nIV. Questions en litige\n[20] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi soul\u00e8ve deux questions :\n(1) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1) a) du Code criminel a\u2011t\u2011il une composante temporelle implicite?\n(2) Si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019a pas de composante temporelle implicite, la disposition est\u2011elle inconstitutionnelle pour cause de port\u00e9e excessive, en violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte ?\nV. Analyse\nA. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1) a) du Code criminel a\u2011t\u2011il une composante temporelle implicite?\n(1) L\u2019infraction de voyeurisme\n[21] Le Parlement a cr\u00e9\u00e9 l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme, laquelle se trouve au par. 162(1) du Code criminel , en 2005. Le paragraphe 162(1) pr\u00e9voit :\nVoyeurisme\n162 (1) Commet une infraction quiconque, subrepticement, observe, notamment par des moyens m\u00e9caniques ou \u00e9lectroniques, une personne \u2014 ou produit un enregistrement visuel d\u2019une personne \u2014 se trouvant dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, dans l\u2019un des cas suivants :\na) la personne est dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite;\nb) la personne est nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite, et l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans le dessein d\u2019ainsi observer ou enregistrer une personne;\nc) l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans un but sexuel.\n[22] Monsieur Downes a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 de voyeurisme en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)a). L\u2019infraction est commise lorsque quelqu\u2019un, subrepticement, observe une personne \u2014 ou produit un enregistrement visuel d\u2019une personne \u2014 se trouvant dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, si l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans \u00ab un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite \u00bb. Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 162, le terme \u00ab enregistrement visuel \u00bb est d\u00e9fini au par. (2) comme visant un \u00ab enregistrement photographique, film\u00e9, vid\u00e9o ou autre, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par tout moyen \u00bb.\n[23] Personne ne conteste que les photos prises par M. Downes sont des \u00ab enregistrements visuels \u00bb. Il n\u2019est en outre plus contest\u00e9 que M. Downes a pris les photos subrepticement et dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existait une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. La question litigieuse soumise \u00e0 notre Cour est de savoir si les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises dans \u00ab un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue \u00bb. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019infraction a\u2011t\u2011il une composante temporelle? La Couronne doit\u2011elle \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans le lieu au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises?\n[24] Cette question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative oblige notre Cour \u00e0 examiner les termes de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) [traduction] \u00ab dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, par. 21, citant E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2e \u00e9d. 1983), p. 87; Jarvis, par. 24). L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab [sur le fondement d\u2019]une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s\u2019harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble \u00bb (Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601, par. 10).\n[25] Dans les paragraphes qui suivent, je vais d\u2019abord analyser l\u2019arr\u00eat de notre Cour dans Jarvis et les objets de l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme. Je vais ensuite interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) sur le fondement de son texte, de son contexte et de son objet.\n(2) L\u2019arr\u00eat de notre Cour dans Jarvis et les objets du par. 162(1)\n[26] Notre Cour a examin\u00e9 le par. 162(1) pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis. Dans cet arr\u00eat, notre Cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un enseignant au secondaire qui s\u2019\u00e9tait servi d\u2019une cam\u00e9ra dissimul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019un stylo pour enregistrer subrepticement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de sexe f\u00e9minin \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole en mettant \u00e0 l\u2019avant\u2011plan leur visage, le haut de leur corps et leurs seins, avait commis l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)c) (\u00ab l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans un but sexuel \u00bb). Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis parce que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es subrepticement dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existait une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e et que les enregistrements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans un but sexuel.\n[27] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, le juge en chef Wagner, s\u2019exprimant au nom des juges majoritaires, a fait remarquer que l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans le cadre du projet de loi C\u20112, Loi modifiant le Code criminel (protection des enfants et d\u2019autres personnes vuln\u00e9rables) et la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, 1re sess., 38e l\u00e9g., 2004\u20112005 (sanctionn\u00e9e le 20 juillet 2005), dont l\u2019objectif primordial \u00e9tait de \u00ab prot\u00e9ger les enfants et d\u2019autres personnes vuln\u00e9rables contre l\u2019exploitation sexuelle, la violence, la maltraitance et la n\u00e9gligence \u00bb (par. 51). La plupart des crimes d\u2019ordre sexuel, y compris le voyeurisme, sont commis par des hommes, alors que les victimes sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des femmes et des enfants (voir minist\u00e8re de la Justice, Voyeurisme \u2014 Une infraction criminelle : Document de consultation (2002), p. 4; R. c. Friesen, 2020 CSC 9, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 424, par. 65, citant R. c. George, 2017 CSC 38, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 1021, par. 2; J. Bailey, \u00ab Implicitly Feminist? : The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s Decision in R v Jarvis \u00bb (2020), 32 R.F.D. 196, p. 200\u2011201).\n[28] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, le juge en chef Wagner a conclu qu\u2019en adoptant le par. 162(1), le Parlement avait pour objectif de \u00ab prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes, surtout \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles menaces d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019utilisation abusive des technologies en \u00e9volution \u00bb (par. 48). La nouvelle infraction de voyeurisme \u00ab \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par la crainte que les technologies en effervescence soient utilis\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on abusive pour visionner ou filmer secr\u00e8tement des personnes dans un but sexuel et de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 porter grandement atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb (par. 49, citant le minist\u00e8re de la Justice, p. 1). Le voyeurisme est donc \u00e0 la fois une infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel et une infraction li\u00e9e au droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. Le paragraphe 162(1) a pour objet de cibler ces deux m\u00e9faits connexes : le comportement qui porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle et le comportement qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e (par. 51\u201152). Le juge Rowe, qui a souscrit au r\u00e9sultat dans Jarvis, partageait l\u2019avis du juge en chef Wagner selon lequel le par. 162(1) a pour objet de \u00ab prot\u00e9ger les droits bien \u00e9tablis \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle de tous compte tenu des menaces pos\u00e9es par les nouvelles technologies qui empi\u00e8tent sur ces droits \u00bb (par. 113).\n[29] Les objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger contre les m\u00e9faits connexes que sont les atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle ressortent du libell\u00e9 et de la structure du par. 162(1). Je vais examiner \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacun de ces objectifs.\n[30] L\u2019objectif du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e se d\u00e9gage des mots introductifs du par. 162(1), qui affirment que commet une infraction quiconque observe ou enregistre subrepticement une personne \u00ab se trouvant dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb si l\u2019un des al. a), b) ou c) s\u2019applique. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, le juge en chef Wagner a expliqu\u00e9 que les circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e au sens du par. 162(1) sont \u00ab celles o\u00f9 une personne s\u2019attendrait raisonnablement \u00e0 ne pas faire l\u2019objet du type d\u2019observation ou d\u2019enregistrement qui est effectivement survenu \u00bb (par. 28). Le tribunal doit examiner l\u2019ensemble du contexte dans lequel l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est survenu, notamment les facteurs non exhaustifs suivants : (1) l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait la personne lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e; (2) la nature de la conduite reproch\u00e9e (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une observation ou d\u2019un enregistrement); (3) la connaissance ou le consentement de la personne observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e; (4) la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; (5) le sujet ou la teneur de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement; (6) l\u2019existence de r\u00e8gles, r\u00e8glements ou politiques qui r\u00e9gissaient l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement en question; (7) la relation entre les parties; (8) le but pour lequel l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; (9) les attributs personnels de la personne observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e (par. 5 et 28\u201129).\n[31] L\u2019objectif du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle ressort aussi de chacun des al. a), b) et c) du par. 162(1).\n[32] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes dans des lieux d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, \u00e0 savoir lorsque \u00ab la personne est dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite \u00bb. Je souscris aux observations du juge Juriansz dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Trinchi, 2019 ONCA 356, 145 O.R. (3d) 721, par. 8, selon lesquelles l\u2019al. a) [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019exige pas que la personne soit effectivement nue, qu\u2019elle expose des parties intimes de son corps ou qu\u2019elle se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle \u00bb; il suffit qu\u2019elle se trouve dans un lieu o\u00f9 \u00ab il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne se trouve dans un tel \u00e9tat, par exemple dans un vestiaire, aux toilettes, dans une cabine de douche ou dans une chambre \u00e0 coucher \u00bb (voir aussi Jarvis, par. 46, le juge en chef Wagner; M. Manning et P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff : Criminal Law (5e \u00e9d. 2015), \u00b621.245). Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord pour dire que, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019al. c), l\u2019al. a) [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019accus\u00e9 agisse dans un but sexuel. Il s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 qui esp\u00e9rait tirer profit de la publication d\u2019enregistrements sur Internet \u00bb (Trinchi, par. 8; voir aussi Jarvis, par. 32, le juge en chef Wagner, et par. 143\u2011144, le juge Rowe).\n[33] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)b) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes qui se livrent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir lorsque \u00ab la personne est nue, expose ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livre \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite, et l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans le dessein d\u2019ainsi observer ou enregistrer une personne \u00bb. Encore une fois, je conviens avec le juge Juriansz que pour l\u2019application de l\u2019al. b), la [traduction] \u00ab nature du lieu n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance, mais l\u2019accus\u00e9 doit avoir pour dessein d\u2019ainsi observer ou enregistrer le sujet \u00bb (Trinchi, par. 9; voir aussi Jarvis, par. 46\u201147 et 52, le juge en chef Wagner). En outre, la Couronne n\u2019est pas tenue de prouver que l\u2019accus\u00e9 a agi dans un but sexuel : [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019alin\u00e9a b), comme l\u2019al. a), s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 ayant agi dans un dessein commercial \u00bb (Trinchi, par. 9; voir aussi Jarvis, par. 32, le juge en chef Wagner, et par. 143, le juge Rowe).\n[34] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)c) prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes lorsque l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement est fait dans un but sexuel. Cette disposition s\u2019applique [traduction] \u00ab que le sujet soit v\u00eatu ou non, peu importe ce qu\u2019il fait \u00bb. (Trinchi, par. 10). Dans Jarvis, par exemple, l\u2019enseignant accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)c), m\u00eame si les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui faisaient subrepticement l\u2019objet d\u2019un enregistrement vid\u00e9o \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement v\u00eatues et vaquaient \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s scolaires courantes. L\u2019alin\u00e9a c) s\u2019applique ind\u00e9pendamment du lieu o\u00f9 se trouve le sujet cibl\u00e9 (Jarvis, par. 46\u201147 et 52, le juge en chef Wagner, et par. 129, le juge Rowe).\n[35] Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que les mots introductifs du par. 162(1) prot\u00e8gent aussi l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, et que chacun des al. a), b) et c) du par. 162(1) prot\u00e8ge aussi la vie priv\u00e9e. Les deux objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger contre les m\u00e9faits connexes que sont les atteintes \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle et \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e apparaissent partout au par. 162(1). Par exemple, en se demandant si une personne \u00ab se trouv[e] dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb suivant les mots introductifs du par. 162(1), le tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si une personne \u00ab s\u2019attendrait raisonnablement \u00e0 ne pas faire l\u2019objet du type d\u2019observation ou d\u2019enregistrement qui est effectivement survenu \u00bb, compte tenu de la liste non exhaustive des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis (par. 5 et 28\u201129). Ces consid\u00e9rations comprennent des facteurs relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, telle la question de savoir si l\u2019objet de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement comprend les parties intimes du corps d\u2019une personne (par. 29(5)), et celle de savoir si l\u2019enregistrement vise un but sexuel (par. 29(8) et 31\u201132). De m\u00eame, les al. a), b) et c) du par. 162(1) prot\u00e8gent la vie priv\u00e9e contre les observations ou les enregistrements subreptices dans des circonstances o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle est en jeu.\n[36] Je vais maintenant d\u00e9cider si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) a une composante temporelle implicite, autrement dit si la Couronne doit prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 l\u2019enregistrement subreptice a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n(3) Interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 162(1)a)\na) Positions des parties\n[37] La Couronne soutient que les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont eu tort d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme exigeant la preuve qu\u2019il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans le lieu au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 l\u2019enregistrement subreptice est fait. Selon la Couronne, il suffit de prouver que le \u00ab lieu \u00bb o\u00f9 un enregistrement subreptice a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en est un o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) prot\u00e8ge ainsi la vie priv\u00e9e de personnes dans certains \u00ab lieux \u00bb, que l\u2019on s\u2019attende ou non \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment de l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e. La Couronne pr\u00e9tend que la preuve \u00e9taye amplement la conclusion de la juge du proc\u00e8s selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab les vestiaires de hockey, dans lesquels M. Downes a pris les photos de T.R. et de G.C., sont des lieux o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue \u00bb (m.a., par. 95, citant les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 228 (CanLII)).\n[38] Monsieur Downes plaide que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) oblige la Couronne \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment et dans le lieu pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 un enregistrement subreptice est fait. Selon lui, une composante temporelle fait en sorte que l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme conserve son objet d\u2019interdire les atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e sur le plan sexuel. \u00c0 son avis, il y a lieu d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des m\u00e9faits envisag\u00e9s dans le r\u00e9gime des infractions d\u2019ordre sexuel \u00e0 la partie V du Code criminel , et il n\u2019y a violation de cette disposition que lorsqu\u2019une personne est enregistr\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui porte atteinte \u00e0 son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle. Il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019une atteinte v\u00e9ritable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle est n\u00e9cessaire et qu\u2019un risque d\u2019atteinte ne suffit pas. Monsieur Downes fait remarquer qu\u2019aucune des photos en cause ne repr\u00e9sentait la nudit\u00e9 ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pornographique. Il pr\u00e9tend que parce qu\u2019aucun des gar\u00e7ons dans ses photos n\u2019\u00e9tait nu et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre, au moment o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises, \u00e0 ce que quiconque soit nu, on ne saurait en d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il entendait prendre une photo d\u2019une personne nue ou une photo voyeuriste autrement interdite.\n[39] \u00c0 mon avis, lorsque l\u2019al. 162(1)a) est correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son texte, \u00e0 son contexte et \u00e0 son objet, la disposition ne renferme aucune composante temporelle implicite.\nb) Texte\n[40] Le texte de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) renvoie \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re objectif concernant le \u00ab lieu \u00bb, sans \u00e9gard au moment ou au temps. Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant, le texte de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) donne donc \u00e0 penser que la disposition est d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019une composante temporelle.\n[41] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) pour le \u00ab lieu \u00bb est objectif \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) emploie l\u2019article d\u00e9fini \u00ab la personne \u00bb (\u00ab the person \u00bb) lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9signe le sujet de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement, mais il emploie l\u2019article ind\u00e9fini \u00ab une personne \u00bb (\u00ab a person \u00bb) lorsqu\u2019il renvoie aux utilisations du lieu auxquelles on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre. Cela veut dire que la personne subrepticement observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e doit se trouver dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) pose la question de savoir s\u2019il est \u00ab raisonnable \u00bb de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue dans le lieu, et non celle de savoir si l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019attendait subjectivement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle le soit. Toutefois, l\u2019emploi d\u2019un crit\u00e8re objectif \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 savoir si la disposition renferme une composante temporelle, puisqu\u2019il demeure possible que le Parlement ait voulu que l\u2019\u00e9valuation objective soit faite \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis.\n[42] Le principal point textuel est l\u2019absence de libell\u00e9 explicite \u00e0 l\u2019al. 162(1)a) indiquant que le Parlement voulait que le \u00ab lieu \u00bb soit \u00e9valu\u00e9 au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Si le Parlement entendait insister sur une telle composante temporelle, il aurait pu le faire express\u00e9ment. Par exemple, une disposition adjacente, le par. 162.1(1) \u2014 l\u2019infraction de publication non consensuelle d\u2019une image intime \u2014 renferme deux composantes temporelles explicites. L\u2019\u00ab image intime \u00bb est d\u00e9finie au par. 162.1(2) comme un enregistrement visuel d\u2019une personne, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par tout moyen, o\u00f9 celle\u2011ci \u00ab a) y figure nue, exposant ses seins, ses organes g\u00e9nitaux ou sa r\u00e9gion anale ou se livrant \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite; b) se trouvait, lors de la r\u00e9alisation de cet enregistrement, dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e; c) a toujours cette attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019enregistrement au moment de la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019infraction \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) ne renferme aucune expression temporelle de la sorte. Si le Parlement avait voulu que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) renferme une telle composante temporelle, il aurait pu facilement pr\u00e9ciser que l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement devait \u00eatre fait dans [traduction] \u00ab un lieu o\u00f9 il est alors raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit \u00bb nue, ou dans un lieu o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue \u00ab au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement \u00bb (voir les motifs de la C.A., par. 77, la juge Dickson (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Toutefois, le Parlement a choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[43] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu\u2019elle ne soit pas d\u00e9terminante, l\u2019absence de libell\u00e9 explicite quant au temps dans le crit\u00e8re objectif de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) relatif au \u00ab lieu \u00bb sugg\u00e8re que le Parlement ne voulait pas que la disposition renferme une composante temporelle.\nc) Contexte l\u00e9gislatif et objet de la disposition\n[44] Le contexte l\u00e9gislatif et l\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) tendent \u00e9galement \u00e0 indiquer que le Parlement ne voulait pas que la disposition renferme une composante temporelle. Interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme interdisant l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement subreptices de personnes dans des lieux d\u00e9termin\u00e9s sans composante temporelle favorise l\u2019atteinte des objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, en particulier celles des enfants et d\u2019autres personnes vuln\u00e9rables. Interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme renfermant une composante temporelle nuirait \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de ces objectifs et entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats arbitraires et absurdes.\n[45] Consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) cr\u00e9e une infraction tributaire du lieu, sans composante temporelle, favorise l\u2019atteinte des objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer l\u2019intervenant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, plut\u00f4t que de fournir une liste pr\u00e9cise de lieux prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)a), le Parlement a choisi de d\u00e9finir les lieux prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re rationnelle et normative : [traduction] \u00ab S\u2019il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les gens dans un certain lieu soient nus, ou exposent leurs seins, leurs organes g\u00e9nitaux ou leur r\u00e9gion anale, ou se livrent \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite, il s\u2019agit alors d\u2019un lieu o\u00f9 tout le monde a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre l\u2019observation et l\u2019enregistrement visuel subreptices \u2014 qu\u2019ils soient nus ou non, expos\u00e9s ou non ou qu\u2019ils se livrent ou non \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 sexuelle explicite \u00bb (m. interv., par. 18). Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019une personne se trouve dans des circonstances pour lesquelles il existe une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, l\u2019al. 162(1)a) identifie normativement une cat\u00e9gorie de \u00ab lieux s\u00fbrs \u00bb typiques, comme les chambres \u00e0 coucher, les salles de bains et les vestiaires, o\u00f9 une personne doit avoir le droit de ne pas \u00eatre observ\u00e9e ou faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un enregistrement visuel sans son consentement, qu\u2019il soit ou non raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que cette personne, ou toute autre personne se trouvant dans ce lieu, soit nue au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) prot\u00e8ge ainsi \u00e0 la fois la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle.\n[46] Il convient d\u2019expliquer en quoi le fait d\u2019interdire le voyeurisme dans de tels \u00ab lieux s\u00fbrs \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)a), qu\u2019il soit ou non raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement subreptices, prot\u00e8ge l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend de nos jours. Comme notre Cour l\u2019a signal\u00e9 dans les arr\u00eats Friesen et Jarvis, la mani\u00e8re dont la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7oit les infractions d\u2019ordre sexuel a \u00e9volu\u00e9, passant de l\u2019accent mis sur l\u2019atteinte fautive \u00e0 la biens\u00e9ance sexuelle \u00e0 un souci de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle (Friesen, par. 55, et Jarvis, par. 127, le juge Rowe, les deux citant E. Craig, Troubling Sex : Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity (2012), p. 68). Dans le passage cit\u00e9 avec approbation dans Friesen et dans les motifs concordants dans Jarvis, la professeure Elaine Craig a expliqu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [c]e changement d\u2019\u00e9clairage, qui passe de la biens\u00e9ance sexuelle \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, permet de mettre un accent accru sur les abus de confiance, l\u2019humiliation, l\u2019objectification, l\u2019exploitation, la honte et la perte d\u2019estime de soi plut\u00f4t que sur simplement, ou seulement, l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019honneur, \u00e0 la chastet\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique (comme c\u2019\u00e9tait davantage le cas quand le droit se souciait davantage de la biens\u00e9ance sexuelle) \u00bb (p. 68). Suivant une analyse portant sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, l\u2019accent est mis [traduction] \u00ab non seulement [sur] les mobiles sexuels, l\u2019excitation ou les parties du corps de l\u2019accus\u00e9, ou [sur] la norme de biens\u00e9ance sexuelle de la collectivit\u00e9, mais aussi [sur] la perception du plaignant, son exp\u00e9rience et les r\u00e9percussions sur celui\u2011ci \u00bb (p. 75). En outre, une analyse portant sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle met l\u2019accent non seulement sur le pr\u00e9judice physique subi par le plaignant, mais aussi sur le pr\u00e9judice \u00e9motionnel et psychologique qui dure souvent plus longtemps que le pr\u00e9judice physique, surtout chez les enfants (Friesen, par. 56\u201159).\n[47] L\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement subreptice d\u2019une personne alors qu\u2019il y a une attente raisonnable de protection en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, et qui se produit dans un \u00ab lieu s\u00fbr \u00bb vis\u00e9 par l\u2019al. 162(1)a), porte atteinte ou risque de porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement. Une observation ou un enregistrement dans un tel \u00ab lieu [typiquement] s\u00fbr \u00bb et typiquement priv\u00e9 constitue un abus de confiance, et peut entra\u00eener l\u2019humiliation, l\u2019objectification, l\u2019exploitation, la honte et la perte d\u2019estime de soi de la personne (Craig, p. 68). Elle peut aussi causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9motionnel et psychologique, et ce, m\u00eame si la personne n\u2019est pas observ\u00e9e ou enregistr\u00e9e pendant qu\u2019elle est nue. Comme l\u2019intervenante, la Clinique d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et de politique d\u2019internet du Canada Samuelson\u2011Glushko, le fait remarquer : [traduction] \u00ab De tels abus de confiance objectivent les personnes cibl\u00e9es en les r\u00e9duisant \u00e0 des parties du corps, cr\u00e9ant des images qui, dans un environnement num\u00e9rique, peuvent \u00eatre facilement reproduites, cadr\u00e9es et manipul\u00e9es par des techniques et pour des usages qui font fi de leur droit de disposer de leurs propres corps. Ces images attentatoires emp\u00eachent les sujets de d\u00e9velopper leur sexualit\u00e9 comme ils l\u2019entendent, avec la possibilit\u00e9 de les exposer \u00e0 la honte et \u00e0 l\u2019humiliation qui r\u00e9sultent souvent de la diffusion instantan\u00e9e et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e \u00bb (m. interv., par. 24).\n[48] Les pr\u00e9judices \u00e9motionnels et psychologiques caus\u00e9s par des atteintes \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, m\u00eame par des photographies o\u00f9 les sujets ne sont pas nus, sont illustr\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La juge charg\u00e9e de prononcer la peine a pris acte de la d\u00e9claration de la m\u00e8re de T.R. que, [traduction] \u00ab lorsqu\u2019elle a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 T.R. des photographies, il lui a fait part de sa d\u00e9ception, puisqu\u2019il avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 M. Downes comme l\u2019un de ses entra\u00eeneurs les plus positifs. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que la confiance de T.R. avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bris\u00e9e et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, T.R. est plus prudent et fait moins confiance aux entra\u00eeneurs et aux gens en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb (2020 BCSC 177, par. 18 (CanLII)). Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 avec justesse la juge Dickson, [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019effet traumatisant que peut avoir pour un adolescent le fait d\u2019\u00eatre subrepticement photographi\u00e9 dans un lieu aussi manifestement priv\u00e9 est \u00e9vident \u00bb (par. 97).\n[49] Pour r\u00e9sumer, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme interdisant l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement subreptice de personnes dans des lieux d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, sans composante temporelle, favorise l\u2019atteinte des objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle.\n[50] En revanche, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) avec une composante temporelle nuirait \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle. Suivant une telle interpr\u00e9tation, des photos subreptices d\u2019enfants en sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans des lieux intrins\u00e8quement priv\u00e9s seraient permises sans sanction criminelle, simplement parce que les enfants se trouvant dans ces lieux \u00e9taient trop g\u00ean\u00e9s de se d\u00e9shabiller (par exemple, des gar\u00e7ons vers l\u2019\u00e2ge de la pubert\u00e9) (voir les motifs de premi\u00e8re instance, par. 220). Pareille interpr\u00e9tation ne prot\u00e9gerait pas la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle des personnes comptant parmi les plus vuln\u00e9rables de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2014 les personnes que le Parlement a voulu prot\u00e9ger par l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme.\n[51] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Couronne plaide qu\u2019une telle interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats arbitraires et absurdes : des groupes d\u2019enfants qui sont trop g\u00ean\u00e9s par leurs corps pour se doucher ou \u00eatre nus dans des vestiaires pourraient \u00eatre photographi\u00e9s subrepticement, alors que des enfants qui ne sont \u00e2g\u00e9s que de quelques ann\u00e9es de plus et qui sont moins g\u00ean\u00e9s \u2014 et qui seraient ainsi susceptibles de se doucher ou d\u2019\u00eatre nus \u2014 ne pourraient pas \u00eatre photographi\u00e9s. Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Couronne pour dire que le Parlement ne peut pas avoir voulu des r\u00e9sultats aussi arbitraires et absurdes (voir Rizzo, par. 27). Le Parlement ne peut avoir voulu que les personnes qui choisissent habituellement de se d\u00e9v\u00eatir dans un lieu o\u00f9 on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es contre le voyeurisme, alors que les personnes qui choisissent habituellement de rester v\u00eatues ne le soient pas.\n[52] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu le contraire en adoptant un point de vue restrictif qui consid\u00e8re les infractions d\u2019ordre sexuel comme portant exclusivement sur la biens\u00e9ance sexuelle, plut\u00f4t que sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle aussi. Les juges majoritaires ont statu\u00e9 qu\u2019une composante temporelle implicite est essentielle pour que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) r\u00e9alise son objet en tant qu\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019infraction prot\u00e9geant la vie priv\u00e9e seulement. \u00c0 leur avis, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 162(1)a) comme criminalisant l\u2019observation ou l\u2019enregistrement subreptice alors qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment de l\u2019observation ou de l\u2019enregistrement aurait pour effet de [traduction] \u00ab viser une conduite qui ne pr\u00e9sente aucune des caract\u00e9ristiques distinctives du voyeurisme comme une atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e sur le plan sexuel \u00bb (par. 41 (en italique dans l\u2019original)). Les juges majoritaires ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019infraction de voyeurisme au par. 162(1) [traduction] \u00ab concern[e] fondamentalement la vie priv\u00e9e sur les plans corporel et sexuel \u00bb et \u00ab ne vis[e] pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir [une] infraction fond\u00e9[e] sur une atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e exclusivement \u00bb (par. 54). Selon eux, m\u00eame si la conduite de M. Downes \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab ind\u00e9niablement un abus de confiance et une atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, cela n\u2019en fait pas n\u00e9cessairement une conduite que cet article criminalise en tant qu\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel \u00bb (par. 54).\n[53] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Le raisonnement des juges majoritaires suppose que pour pouvoir stigmatiser une conduite en tant qu\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, et donc en tant qu\u2019infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel, il doit exister un risque de capter des images de nudit\u00e9 au moment pertinent. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, la prise de photographies subreptices d\u2019enfants en sous\u2011v\u00eatements dans un \u00ab lieu [essentiellement] s\u00fbr \u00bb comme un vestiaire de hockey porte atteinte non seulement \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des enfants, mais aussi \u00e0 leur int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue lorsque les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Prendre des photos subreptices dans un tel \u00ab lieu [essentiellement] s\u00fbr \u00bb risque de porter atteinte \u00e0 de nombreux droits li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle : une telle conduite constitue un abus de confiance, et peut entra\u00eener l\u2019humiliation, l\u2019objectification, l\u2019exploitation, la honte et la perte d\u2019estime de soi des personnes cibl\u00e9es. De telles photos peuvent porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle d\u2019une personne en la r\u00e9duisant \u00e0 des parties du corps, en l\u2019emp\u00eachant de d\u00e9velopper sa sexualit\u00e9 comme elle l\u2019entend et en cr\u00e9ant un risque de diffusion g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e des photos \u00e0 des \u00e9trangers. Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019objectif du Parlement de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle plut\u00f4t que la seule biens\u00e9ance sexuelle, la conduite de M. Downes a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des enfants et \u00e0 leur int\u00e9grit\u00e9 sexuelle. Il s\u2019est donc livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une conduite que le Parlement a criminalis\u00e9e comme infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel.\nd) Conclusion\n[54] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 162(1)a) ne renferme aucune composante temporelle implicite qui oblige la Couronne \u00e0 prouver que l\u2019on pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne soit nue au moment pr\u00e9cis o\u00f9 les photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Par cons\u00e9quent, c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la juge du proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Downes coupable de deux chefs de voyeurisme en vertu de l\u2019al. 162(1)a).\nB. Si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019a pas de composante temporelle implicite, la disposition est\u2011elle inconstitutionnelle pour cause de port\u00e9e excessive, en violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte ?\n[55] Monsieur Downes soutient que si notre Cour accepte que l\u2019al. 162(1)a) n\u2019a pas de composante temporelle implicite, la disposition est alors inconstitutionnelle pour cause de port\u00e9e excessive, en violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte . Il affirme que le par. 162(1) a pour objectif de cibler une conduite sexuelle constituant de l\u2019exploitation, et dit que l\u2019absence de composante temporelle [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9largit l\u2019infraction pour qu\u2019elle couvre une conduite n\u2019ayant aucun rapport avec son objet sous\u2011jacent de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019exploitation sexuelle \u00bb (m.i., par. 68). Monsieur Downes n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 cette question constitutionnelle au proc\u00e8s et, bien qu\u2019il l\u2019ait soulev\u00e9e en Cour d\u2019appel, cette derni\u00e8re ne l\u2019a pas examin\u00e9e.\n[56] Une question importante qu\u2019il convient de se poser est celle de savoir si M. Downes peut contester la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 162(1)a) dans le pr\u00e9sent appel form\u00e9 de plein droit par la Couronne en vertu de l\u2019al. 693(1) a) du Code criminel . Un tel appel se limite \u00e0 la question de droit au sujet de laquelle un juge de la cour d\u2019appel est dissident, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question de savoir si l\u2019al. 162(1) a) renferme une composante temporelle implicite. Bien que, dans un appel form\u00e9 de plein droit par la Couronne, l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse avancer \u00ab tout argument appuyant l\u2019ordonnance de la cour d\u2019appel \u00bb (R. c. Keegstra, [1995] 2 R.C.S. 381, par. 23), l\u2019argument de M. Downes fond\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e excessive n\u2019appuie pas l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel : s\u2019il est accept\u00e9, il donnerait probablement lieu non pas \u00e0 un nouveau proc\u00e8s, mais \u00e0 aucun proc\u00e8s, puisque l\u2019al. 162(1) a) serait inconstitutionnel (par. 36). Par cons\u00e9quent, d\u2019ordinaire, M. Downes ne pourrait pas contester la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 162(1) a) sans avoir obtenu d\u2019abord l\u2019autorisation d\u2019interjeter un appel incident sur cette question en vertu de l\u2019art. 40 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame , L.R.C. 1985, c. S\u201126 .\n[57] J\u2019ai toutefois conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si notre Cour est saisie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de la question constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e par M. Downes, puisque, de toute fa\u00e7on, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une affaire dans laquelle notre Cour devrait exceptionnellement exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de trancher une telle question constitutionnelle pour la premi\u00e8re fois en appel. Comme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Guindon c. Canada, 2015 CSC 41, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 3, par. 20, \u00ab [e]xaminer puis trancher une question constitutionnelle qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soulev\u00e9e dans le cadre des instances ant\u00e9rieures rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Cour, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, dont la teneur du dossier, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties, l\u2019importance que la question soit r\u00e9solue par la Cour, le fait que l\u2019affaire se pr\u00eate ou non \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision et les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019administration de la justice en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. \u00bb Le crit\u00e8re est strict : notre Cour doit \u00eatre convaincue qu\u2019examiner puis trancher la nouvelle question constitutionnelle ne cause aucun pr\u00e9judice aux parties (par. 22\u201123).\n[58] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9cider si l\u2019al. 162(1)a) est inconstitutionnel pour cause de port\u00e9e excessive causerait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la Couronne et obligerait la Cour \u00e0 se pencher sur une importante question relative \u00e0 la Charte dans un vide factuel. Parce que la question relative \u00e0 la Charte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s, la Couronne n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune preuve sur la question de savoir si une violation de l\u2019art. 7 de la Charte , le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier. Comme il est dit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Guindon, \u00ab [l]\u2019intim\u00e9, comme toute autre partie d\u2019ailleurs, ne peut invoquer un argument enti\u00e8rement nouveau qui aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 la production d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels au proc\u00e8s \u00bb (par. 32 (r\u00e9f\u00e9rences omises dans l\u2019original), citant Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership c. Rex, 2002 CSC 42, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 559, par. 58). Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans les affaires constitutionnelles.

Elle a suivi M quand celui\u2011ci est sorti du stationnement au volant du VTT et s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur la voie publique. La police a form\u00e9 l\u2019intention sur la voie publique de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route de l\u2019Ontario. Au moment o\u00f9 la police a rattrap\u00e9 M, celui\u2011ci avait quitt\u00e9 la voie publique pour s\u2019engager dans une entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e qui donnait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la maison de ses parents. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir intercept\u00e9, la police a observ\u00e9 chez M des signes \u00e9vidents d\u2019affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s et l\u2019a arr\u00eat\u00e9.

Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M coupable des deux accusations et a suspendu la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Le juge d\u2019appel des poursuites sommaires a accueilli l\u2019appel de M, concluant que ni le par. 48(1) ni le par. 216(1) du Code de la route ne permettaient \u00e0 la police de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e sans motifs raisonnables et probables. Il a statu\u00e9 que la police avait viol\u00e9 le droit garanti \u00e0 M par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte , et il a \u00e9cart\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vertu du par. 24(2) de la Charte et prononc\u00e9 un acquittement. Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re public contre l\u2019acquittement.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est accueilli, l\u2019acquittement est annul\u00e9, et la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et le sursis prononc\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s sont r\u00e9tablis.\nLe paragraphe 48(1) du Code de la route ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 la police le pouvoir l\u00e9gal d\u2019effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Bien que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route conf\u00e8re aux policiers le pouvoir l\u00e9gal d\u2019intercepter au hasard un v\u00e9hicule automobile pour v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 du conducteur, la d\u00e9finition que le Code de la route donne du terme \u00ab conducteur \u00bb impose des limites strictes au pouvoir des policiers de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du par. 48(1). Le Code de la route comporte deux d\u00e9finitions du terme \u00ab conducteur \u00bb. Le paragraphe 1(1) dispose que le \u00ab conducteur \u00bb est une personne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique, et le par. 48(18) pr\u00e9cise que, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 48, \u00ab conducteur \u00bb s\u2019entend en outre de quiconque a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile. La d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue au par. 1(1) est exhaustive et pr\u00e9cise la port\u00e9e du terme \u00ab conducteur \u00bb, alors que celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 48(18) est non exhaustive et \u00e9largit le sens ordinaire du terme d\u00e9fini. La d\u00e9finition du \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au par. 1(1) comporte deux volets; elle vise \u00e0 la fois une activit\u00e9 et le lieu de cette activit\u00e9. Pour \u00eatre un conducteur, il faut conduire un v\u00e9hicule (activit\u00e9) et le faire sur une voie publique (lieu). La d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue au par. 48(18) vise uniquement \u00e0 \u00e9largir le volet activit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9finition et non l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment relatif au lieu. Suivant une interpr\u00e9tation harmonieuse des deux d\u00e9finitions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 ce terme, un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb est, pour l\u2019application du par. 48(1), une personne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule automobile, ou qui en a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le, sur une voie publique. La personne qui a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile, mais qui ne se trouve plus sur une voie publique, ne serait pas un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au sens du Code de la route.\nLa police ne peut utiliser le pouvoir pr\u00e9vu au par. 48(1) pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e au motif que le conducteur se trouvait sur la voie publique au moment o\u00f9 le policier a form\u00e9 l\u2019intention subjective de l\u2019intercepter. Alors que le par. 48(1) pr\u00e9cise les circonstances dans lesquelles la police peut intercepter des conducteurs sans motifs raisonnables et probables afin de v\u00e9rifier leur sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, le par. 216(1) du Code de la route pr\u00e9voit l\u2019aspect pratique du pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la police d\u2019intercepter des v\u00e9hicules, y compris l\u2019obligation correspondante des conducteurs de s\u2019immobiliser \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux en ce sens. Les paragraphes 216(1) et 48(1) se combinent pour pr\u00e9voir un pouvoir policier d\u2019effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur des voies publiques et une obligation correspondante incombant aux conducteurs de s\u2019immobiliser \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux en ce sens. Le paragraphe 216(1) pr\u00e9voit une exigence de communication, de telle sorte que le policier qui souhaite invoquer le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au par. 48(1) doit, \u00e0 tout le moins, demander au conducteur, au moyen de signaux ou autrement, d\u2019immobiliser son v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique. La police doit donc communiquer au conducteur son intention d\u2019effectuer une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une voie publique afin d\u2019\u00eatre vis\u00e9e par le par. 48(1) du Code de la route.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un conducteur pour l\u2019application du par. 48(1) du Code de la route lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 intercept\u00e9 par la police. M\u00eame si l\u2019on peut dire qu\u2019il avait la garde ou le contr\u00f4le du VTT, il ne se trouvait pas sur une voie publique quand la police a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interception. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par le par. 48(1). Puisqu\u2019elle a attendu que M s\u2019engage dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e avant de lui signaler son intention de l\u2019intercepter, la police n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement son pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route. Comme l\u2019interception \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, la police a viol\u00e9 les droits garantis \u00e0 M par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte , car la d\u00e9tention qui n\u2019est pas l\u00e9galement autoris\u00e9e est arbitraire.\nCependant, dans l\u2019ensemble et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus dans l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re ill\u00e9gale n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en application du par. 24(2) de la Charte . La police a agi sans autorisation l\u00e9gale lorsqu\u2019elle a intercept\u00e9 M, mais vu l\u2019incertitude juridique qui existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, la violation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas grave au point d\u2019exiger de la Cour qu\u2019elle se dissocie des actes de la police. L\u2019incertitude juridique milite en faveur de l\u2019exclusion, mais seulement l\u00e9g\u00e8rement. L\u2019interception polici\u00e8re ill\u00e9gale constituait une atteinte marqu\u00e9e, sans \u00eatre des plus extr\u00eames, aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de M prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte et milite mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment en faveur de l\u2019exclusion de la preuve. Toutefois, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis par la police \u00e9taient fiables et cruciaux pour la cause du minist\u00e8re public, et la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies est une infraction grave. L\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve servirait mieux la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que remplit le proc\u00e8s criminel et n\u2019affaiblirait pas la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 long terme port\u00e9e au syst\u00e8me de justice.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eat appliqu\u00e9 : R. c.

Vue d\u2019ensemble\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur la question de savoir si la police peut, en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route, L.R.O. 1990, c. H.8, effectuer une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Un agent de la Police provinciale de l\u2019Ontario (\u00ab OPP \u00bb) a form\u00e9 l\u2019intention sur une voie publique d\u2019intercepter au hasard l\u2019intim\u00e9 afin de v\u00e9rifier sa sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, et l\u2019a suivi jusque dans une entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e pour le faire. Une fois s\u2019\u00eatre approch\u00e9 de lui, l\u2019agent a observ\u00e9 des signes \u00e9vidents d\u2019intoxication chez l\u2019intim\u00e9, lequel a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait peut\u2011\u00eatre bu 10 bi\u00e8res. Deux alcootests subs\u00e9quents ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019alcool\u00e9mie de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9passait la limite l\u00e9gale.\n[2] Selon nous, le par. 48(1) du Code de la route ne conf\u00e9rait pas aux policiers le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de suivre l\u2019intim\u00e9 jusque dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e pour effectuer l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Les policiers ont donc viol\u00e9 les droits garantis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . N\u00e9anmoins, pour les motifs qui suivent, nous n\u2019\u00e9carterions pas les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en application du par. 24(2) de la Charte . En cons\u00e9quence, nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi.\nII. Faits\n[3] Vers 0 h 30 le 26 mars 2016, les agents Jeff Lobsinger et Laura Hicks de l\u2019OPP effectuaient une patrouille g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Thessalon. Pendant la patrouille, l\u2019agent Lobsinger a rep\u00e9r\u00e9 un v\u00e9hicule tout\u2011terrain (\u00ab VTT \u00bb) gar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un d\u00e9panneur. L\u2019intim\u00e9, Walker McColman, est sorti du stationnement au volant du VTT et s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur la voie publique; c\u2019est alors que l\u2019agent Lobsinger a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente Hicks de suivre le VTT dans leur voiture de patrouille.\n[4] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a tir\u00e9 la conclusion de fait selon laquelle l\u2019agent Lobsinger avait form\u00e9 l\u2019intention sur la voie publique de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. McColman en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route. Au proc\u00e8s, l\u2019agent Lobsinger a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que M. McColman n\u2019avait pas manifest\u00e9 de signes de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies qui auraient par ailleurs justifi\u00e9 une interception. Autrement dit, les policiers n\u2019avaient pas de motifs raisonnables et probables de l\u2019intercepter.\n[5] Au moment o\u00f9 les policiers ont rattrap\u00e9 M. McColman, celui\u2011ci avait quitt\u00e9 la voie publique pour s\u2019engager dans une entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e qui donnait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la maison de ses parents ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement commercial. Personne n\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s que M. McColman s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e pour \u00e9chapper aux policiers. Il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 environ une minute entre le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019agent Lobsinger a rep\u00e9r\u00e9 le VTT et celui o\u00f9 les policiers ont intercept\u00e9 M. McColman.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir intercept\u00e9, l\u2019agent Lobsinger a parl\u00e9 avec M. McColman et a observ\u00e9 chez lui des signes \u00e9vidents d\u2019affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s, allant d\u2019une forte odeur d\u2019alcool \u00e0 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de se tenir droit debout. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019agent Lobsinger, M. McColman a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait [traduction] \u00ab peut\u2011\u00eatre bu 10 \u00bb bi\u00e8res ce soir\u2011l\u00e0 : d.a., p. 154. L\u2019agent Lobsinger a arr\u00eat\u00e9 M. McColman pour conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies \u00e0 0 h 36 et l\u2019a amen\u00e9 au poste de police.\n[7] Au poste de police, l\u2019administration de l\u2019alcootest a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e parce que M. McColman a vomi en raison de sa consommation d\u2019alcool. Un policier a plus tard effectu\u00e9 2 alcootests, qui ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une alcool\u00e9mie de 120 et 110 milligrammes d\u2019alcool par 100 millilitres de sang. La police a accus\u00e9 M. McColman de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies, infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 253(1)a), et de conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur avec plus de 80 milligrammes d\u2019alcool par 100 millilitres de sang, infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 253(1) b) du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 . L\u2019article 253 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 en 2018.\nIII. Dispositions pertinentes\n[8] Le paragraphe 1(1) du Code de la route d\u00e9finit le \u00ab conducteur \u00bb comme une \u00ab [p]ersonne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique \u00bb. Il d\u00e9finit en outre en ces termes la \u00ab voie publique \u00bb :\nS\u2019entend notamment d\u2019une route ordinaire ou d\u2019une voie publique, d\u2019une rue, d\u2019une avenue, d\u2019une all\u00e9e, d\u2019un boulevard, d\u2019une place, d\u2019un pont, d\u2019un viaduc ou d\u2019un pont sur chevalets dont une partie quelconque est pr\u00e9vue pour le passage de v\u00e9hicules ou utilis\u00e9e par le public \u00e0 cette fin. Est incluse dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition la zone comprise entre les limites lat\u00e9rales de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces ouvrages.\n[9] Le paragraphe 48(1) du Code de la route conf\u00e8re aux policiers le pouvoir l\u00e9gal d\u2019intercepter au hasard un v\u00e9hicule automobile pour v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 du conducteur. Il pr\u00e9voit :\nUn agent de police ais\u00e9ment reconnaissable comme tel peut exiger du conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile qu\u2019il s\u2019arr\u00eate pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il y a lieu ou non de le soumettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 320.27 ou 320.28 du Code criminel (Canada) .\n[10] Le paragraphe 48(18) dispose que, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 48, \u00ab \u201cconducteur\u201d [s]\u2019entend en outre de quiconque a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile \u00bb.\n[11] Enfin, le par. 216(1) du Code de la route \u00e9nonce le pouvoir policier plus large d\u2019intercepter des v\u00e9hicules et l\u2019obligation correspondante qui incombe aux conducteurs. Il pr\u00e9voit :\nUn agent de police, dans l\u2019exercice l\u00e9gitime de ses fonctions, peut exiger du conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule, autre qu\u2019une bicyclette, qu\u2019il s\u2019arr\u00eate. Si tel est le cas, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux, le conducteur ob\u00e9it imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la demande d\u2019un agent de police identifiable \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue comme tel.\nIV. Historique judiciaire\nA. Cour de justice de l\u2019Ontario\n[12] Monsieur McColman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande fond\u00e9e sur la Charte dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait, notamment, que l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale et violait ses droits garantis par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte . Il a soutenu que la police n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer l\u2019interception sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[13] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 la demande, concluant que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route autorisait l\u00e9galement l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a conclu que les policiers avaient l\u2019intention d\u2019intercepter le v\u00e9hicule de M. McColman en vue de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 du conducteur, et qu\u2019ils avaient form\u00e9 l\u2019intention de l\u2019intercepter alors que celui\u2011ci conduisait un v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique. Le juge du proc\u00e8s a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Le simple fait que [l\u2019agent Lobsinger] n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019interception qu\u2019une fois que [M. McColman] s\u2019est engag\u00e9 dans une entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e et se trouvait donc sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9limin\u00e9 ni invalid\u00e9 le pouvoir que poss\u00e9dait le policier en vertu de l\u2019art. 48 du Code de la route.\n(motifs expos\u00e9s au terme du voir\u2011dire, par. 54, reproduits dans le d.a., p. 8.)\n[14] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de sa conclusion sur le par. 48(1) du Code de la route, le juge du proc\u00e8s a refus\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la question de savoir si les policiers avaient le pouvoir, en vertu de la common law, d\u2019intercepter M. McColman dans son entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e.\n[15] Le juge du proc\u00e8s a par la suite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. McColman coupable de conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies, infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 253(1)a), et de conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur avec plus de 80 milligrammes d\u2019alcool par 100 millilitres de sang, infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019al. 253(1) b) du Code criminel . Il a suspendu sous condition la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies conform\u00e9ment aux directives donn\u00e9es par notre Cour dans Kienapple c. La Reine, [1975] 1 R.C.S. 729, et a condamn\u00e9 M. McColman aux peines minimales obligatoires, \u00e0 savoir une amende de 1 000 $ (plus une suramende compensatoire de 300 $) et une interdiction de conduire pendant 12 mois.\nB. Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario, 2019 ONSC 5359, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 375\n[16] Monsieur McColman a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario, faisant valoir, notamment, que le juge du proc\u00e8s avait commis une erreur en concluant que les policiers \u00e9taient, en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route, autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[17] Le juge d\u2019appel des poursuites sommaires a accueilli l\u2019appel, concluant que ni le par. 48(1) ni le par. 216(1) du Code de la route ne permettaient aux policiers de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e sans motifs raisonnables et probables. D\u00e8s lors que son v\u00e9hicule avait quitt\u00e9 la voie publique pour s\u2019engager dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e, M. McColman n\u2019\u00e9tait plus un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au sens du Code de la route. En cons\u00e9quence, les policiers n\u2019avaient pas le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de le d\u00e9tenir al\u00e9atoirement pour v\u00e9rifier sa sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le juge d\u2019appel a \u00e9galement conclu que l\u2019interception n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e en common law.\n[18] Comme l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, le juge d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 que la police avait viol\u00e9 l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte . Dans son analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 24(2) de la Charte , il a estim\u00e9 que les actes des policiers \u00e9taient graves, car ceux\u2011ci avaient [traduction] \u00ab poursuivi [M. McColman] sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e alors que ni la loi ni la common law ne les autorisaient \u00e0 le faire \u00bb : par. 49. L\u2019incidence de la violation \u00e9tait \u00e9galement importante, parce que M. McColman avait une attente \u00e9lev\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e sur sa propre propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat manifeste de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019affaire soit jug\u00e9e au fond, l\u2019op\u00e9ration de mise en balance militait en faveur de l\u2019exclusion en vertu du par. 24(2) de la Charte .\nC. Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, 2021 ONCA 382, 156 O.R. (3d) 253\n[19] Le minist\u00e8re public a interjet\u00e9 appel de l\u2019acquittement prononc\u00e9 par le juge d\u2019appel, faisant valoir que la police est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e si elle forme sur une voie publique l\u2019intention l\u00e9gitime d\u2019intercepter un conducteur.\n[20] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario (le juge Tulloch, maintenant juge en chef de l\u2019Ontario, avec l\u2019accord de la juge Feldman) ont rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel. La cour a statu\u00e9 que le libell\u00e9 clair du par. 48(1) et les d\u00e9finitions connexes des termes \u00ab conducteur \u00bb et \u00ab voie publique \u00bb n\u2019autorisaient pas les interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es en dehors de la voie publique. Ils ont \u00e9galement statu\u00e9 que la police n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir en common law de v\u00e9rifier au hasard la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. McColman sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019interception \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale et violait les droits garantis \u00e0 M. McColman par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte .\n[21] Les juges majoritaires ont convenu avec le juge d\u2019appel que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus dans l\u2019interception ill\u00e9gale devaient \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en vertu du par. 24(2) de la Charte . En \u00e9valuant la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019inconduite \u00e9tatique attentatoire \u00e0 la Charte , et bien qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 conclure que la police avait agi de mauvaise foi, ils ont estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une conduite [traduction] \u00ab t\u00e9m\u00e9raire \u00bb et qu\u2019un \u00ab manque de clart\u00e9 du droit [. . .] ne donne pas aux policiers toute libert\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019ils ont les pouvoirs requis \u00bb : par. 84\u201185. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019incidence de la violation, les juges majoritaires ont conclu qu\u2019il y avait une incidence importante sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 la protection de la libert\u00e9 et de la vie priv\u00e9e de M. McColman parce que la police l\u2019avait interrog\u00e9 et avait obtenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contre lui dans le cadre d\u2019une d\u00e9tention ill\u00e9gale \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 M. McColman avait une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e. Enfin, malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve compromettrait la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que remplit le proc\u00e8s, les juges majoritaires ont statu\u00e9 que, pour que le syst\u00e8me de justice soit irr\u00e9prochable, la cour ne devait pas admettre une conduite qui teste les limites des pouvoirs policiers. En cons\u00e9quence, ils ont \u00e9cart\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et confirm\u00e9 l\u2019acquittement de M. McColman.\n[22] Le juge Hourigan, dissident, s\u2019est dit d\u2019avis que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route et la common law autorisaient tous les deux l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Selon lui, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donnent les juges majoritaires au Code de la route va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son objectif de protection du public parce que la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019a pu avoir voulu que des conducteurs puissent se soustraire \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate en s\u2019arr\u00eatant sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Le juge Hourigan a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Code de la route propos\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re public et a conclu que les policiers avaient le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019interception dans les circonstances.\n[23] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, le juge Hourigan a conclu que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne devaient pas \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en vertu du par. 24(2) de la Charte et a exhort\u00e9 les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse plus s\u00e9rieuse des facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant : R. c. Grant, 2009 CSC 32, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 353. Il a estim\u00e9 que la premi\u00e8re question militait contre l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve parce que l\u2019inconduite \u00e9tatique \u00e9tait mineure ou de nature technique, et que le droit n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bien \u00e9tabli, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait une jurisprudence qui appuyait l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que les policiers avaient faite de leurs pouvoirs. La deuxi\u00e8me question militait \u00e9galement contre l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve parce que les attentes de M. McColman en mati\u00e8re de respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9taient minimes. L\u2019interception a eu lieu dans une entr\u00e9e partag\u00e9e avec une entreprise commerciale, ce qui autorisait donc implicitement la police \u00e0 y p\u00e9n\u00e9trer. Enfin, la troisi\u00e8me question militait contre l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve parce que ceux\u2011ci \u00e9taient fiables et d\u00e9montraient de fa\u00e7on accablante la culpabilit\u00e9 de M. McColman hors de tout doute raisonnable relativement aux deux chefs d\u2019accusation. En cons\u00e9quence, le juge Hourigan n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vertu du par. 24(2) de la Charte .\nV. Questions en litige\n[24] Le pourvoi du minist\u00e8re public soul\u00e8ve deux questions.\n[25] Premi\u00e8rement, le minist\u00e8re public fait valoir que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route autorisait l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il soutient qu\u2019un policier peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une telle interception en dehors d\u2019une voie publique s\u2019il forme l\u2019intention sur une voie publique de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 du conducteur. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, le minist\u00e8re public souligne que, contrairement au par. 216(1) du Code de la route, le par. 48(1) ne pr\u00e9voit rien en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la communication de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019intercepter le conducteur. Il sugg\u00e8re \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au par. 48(18) est susceptible d\u2019\u00e9carter la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au par. 1(1) pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 48. Cela autoriserait la police \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 chaque fois qu\u2019une personne a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile, que l\u2019intention d\u2019y proc\u00e9der ait ou non \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e sur une voie publique.\n[26] Deuxi\u00e8mement, si le Code de la route n\u2019autorisait pas l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re, de sorte qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une violation de l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte , le minist\u00e8re public soutient que l\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s et \u00e0 l\u2019alcool\u00e9mie de M. McColman n\u2019est pas susceptible de d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l\u2019administration de la justice. Il pr\u00e9tend que la conduite \u00e9tatique attentatoire \u00e0 la Charte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas grave, car la police a agi de bonne foi dans le contexte d\u2019une incertitude juridique relativement aux limites g\u00e9ographiques du pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le minist\u00e8re public fait valoir que l\u2019incidence de la violation n\u2019\u00e9tait ni attentatoire ni importante. Il affirme que conduire est une activit\u00e9 r\u00e9glement\u00e9e et que les interceptions de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sont br\u00e8ves et limit\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019objectif auquel elles r\u00e9pondent. Enfin, le minist\u00e8re public pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat public consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 ce que ces accusations soient jug\u00e9es au fond compte tenu du caract\u00e8re fiable et fondamental des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[27] Il faut souligner que notre Cour n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel sur la question de savoir si la police avait le pouvoir en common law d\u2019effectuer l\u2019interception.\nVI. Analyse\nA. L\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait\u2011elle autoris\u00e9e par le par. 48(1) du Code de la route?\n[28] Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi donne pour la premi\u00e8re fois l\u2019occasion \u00e0 notre Cour de se pencher sur la question de savoir si des policiers peuvent effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route.\n[29] \u00c0 plusieurs reprises, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 que diverses formes d\u2019interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9hicules violent l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte , mais sont justifi\u00e9es au regard de l\u2019article premier. Dans R. c. Hufsky, [1988] 1 R.C.S. 621, elle a statu\u00e9 que les contr\u00f4les routiers ponctuels autoris\u00e9s par la loi \u2014 les contr\u00f4les de police al\u00e9atoires effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 des endroits fixes et pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9s \u2014 violent l\u2019art. 9, mais sont justifi\u00e9s au regard de l\u2019article premier. Peu apr\u00e8s, elle a conclu, dans R. c. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1257, que les interceptions au cours d\u2019une patrouille qui sont autoris\u00e9es par la loi \u2014 les interceptions polici\u00e8res al\u00e9atoires visant \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier les permis de conduire, la preuve d\u2019assurance, l\u2019\u00e9tat m\u00e9canique des v\u00e9hicules et la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 des conducteurs \u2014 violent l\u2019art. 9, mais sont justifi\u00e9es au regard de l\u2019article premier.\n[30] Les policiers qui proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9hicules doivent exercer leurs pouvoirs avec vigilance et s\u2019assurer de ne pas outrepasser les limites de ceux\u2011ci. Comme ces interceptions al\u00e9atoires constituent une \u00ab d\u00e9tention arbitraire \u00bb, la \u00ab d\u00e9tention ne sera justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte que si la police agit dans le cadre des objectifs limit\u00e9s relevant de la r\u00e9glementation routi\u00e8re en fonction desquels les pouvoirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00bb : R. c. Nolet, 2010 CSC 24, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 851, par. 22 (r\u00e9f\u00e9rences omises).\n[31] La question de savoir si des policiers peuvent effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par diverses juridictions d\u2019appel dans l\u2019ensemble du pays sous le r\u00e9gime de leur version du Code de la route : voir, p. ex., R. c. Lux, 2012 SKCA 129, 405 Sask. R. 214; R. c. Anderson, 2014 SKCA 32, 433 Sask. R. 255; Scott c. R., 2021 QCCS 3866. Cependant, le Code de la route de l\u2019Ontario diff\u00e8re sous d\u2019importants rapports des autres lois provinciales qui r\u00e9gissent la conduite automobile et les conducteurs. Dans l\u2019analyse d\u2019une disposition du Code de la route, le tribunal doit rester concentr\u00e9 sur le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition en cause.\n[32] Le minist\u00e8re public appelant et la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario se sont tous les deux largement fond\u00e9s sur la jurisprudence de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan. Dans l\u2019affaire Lux, des policiers ont remarqu\u00e9 un v\u00e9hicule automobile qui roulait dans un stationnement priv\u00e9 et ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de celui\u2011ci en vue de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 du conducteur, et ce, alors que le v\u00e9hicule se trouvait encore dans le stationnement. La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 209.1 de la loi intitul\u00e9e The Traffic Safety Act, S.S. 2004, c. T\u201118.1, n\u2019autorisait pas les agents de la paix \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e : par. 31. Deux ans plus tard, dans l\u2019affaire Anderson, dont les faits ressemblent \u00e0 ceux de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour d\u2019appel a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un policier qui avait form\u00e9 sur une voie publique son intention d\u2019intercepter au hasard un v\u00e9hicule pouvait l\u00e9galement r\u00e9aliser l\u2019interception sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 209.1 de The Traffic Safety Act : par. 24\u201125.\n[33] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019apparente pertinence des arr\u00eats Lux et Anderson, le Code de la route de l\u2019Ontario diff\u00e8re sous des rapports pertinents de The Traffic Safety Act de la Saskatchewan. Notamment, cette derni\u00e8re ne d\u00e9finit pas le terme [traduction] \u00ab conducteur \u00bb; en revanche, comme nous le verrons, la d\u00e9finition que le Code de la route donne du conducteur impose des limites strictes au pouvoir des policiers de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route. Comme les arr\u00eats Lux et Anderson sont \u00e9troitement ax\u00e9s sur le libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019art. 209.1 de The Traffic Safety Act, ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ne renseigne beaucoup sur la fa\u00e7on dont notre Cour devrait aborder le par. 48(1) du Code de la route de l\u2019Ontario.\n(1) Le sens du par. 48(1) du Code de la route\n[34] Passons maintenant au par. 48(1) du Code de la route, qui dispose :\nUn agent de police ais\u00e9ment reconnaissable comme tel peut exiger du conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile qu\u2019il s\u2019arr\u00eate pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il y a lieu ou non de le soumettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 320.27 ou 320.28 du Code criminel (Canada) .\n[35] Selon la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, \u00ab il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi \u201cdans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur\u201d \u00bb : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c.

Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 CSC 49, par. 37. Lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9termine le sens du texte, le tribunal ne peut lire une disposition l\u00e9gislative isol\u00e9ment, mais il doit plut\u00f4t lire celle\u2011ci \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9conomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la loi : Rizzo, par. 21.\n[36] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite et lors des plaidoiries orales, le minist\u00e8re public a attach\u00e9 beaucoup d\u2019importance aux objectifs plus larges qui sous\u2011tendent le Code de la route. Cependant, une analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique n\u2019autorise pas l\u2019interpr\u00e8te \u00e0 faire abstraction du sens clair de la loi : voir R. c. D.A.I., 2012 CSC 5, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 149, par. 26.\n[37] La question cl\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de savoir si M. McColman \u00e9tait un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 48(1) du Code de la route au moment de l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Code de la route comporte deux d\u00e9finitions du terme \u00ab conducteur \u00bb susceptibles de s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 M. McColman. Le paragraphe 1(1) du Code de la route dispose que le \u00ab conducteur \u00bb est une \u00ab [p]ersonne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique \u00bb (\u00ab \u201cdriver\u201d means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway \u00bb dans la version anglaise). En revanche, le par. 48(18) pr\u00e9cise que, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 48, \u00ab \u201cconducteur\u201d [s]\u2019entend en outre de quiconque a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile \u00bb (\u00ab \u201cdriver\u201d includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle \u00bb dans la version anglaise). Dans son m\u00e9moire, le minist\u00e8re public sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le par. 48(1) de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il autorise la police \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 chaque fois qu\u2019elle voit une personne qui a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile, qu\u2019elle ait eu ou non l\u2019intention sur une voie publique de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de celle\u2011ci. Autrement dit, il soutient que le par. 48(18) \u00e9nonce des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de ce qui constitue un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb. Cet argument doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 pour deux raisons.\n[38] Premi\u00e8rement, les d\u00e9finitions figurant dans les lois ne sont pas toutes exhaustives : R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7e \u00e9d. 2022). Les d\u00e9finitions exhaustives [traduction] \u00ab donnent le sens complet du terme d\u00e9fini et \u00e9cartent compl\u00e8tement tout autre sens que celui\u2011ci pourrait par ailleurs avoir en langage courant ou technique \u00bb, tandis que les d\u00e9finitions non exhaustives \u00ab n\u2019entendent pas \u00e9carter le sens qu\u2019aurait le terme d\u00e9fini en langage courant; elles ne font que le pr\u00e9ciser, le restreindre ou l\u2019illustrer \u00bb : p. 69\u201170. En anglais, les d\u00e9finitions exhaustives commencent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par le verbe \u00ab means \u00bb, alors que les d\u00e9finitions non exhaustives sont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9es du verbe \u00ab includes \u00bb : p. 69\u201170.\n[39] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue au par. 1(1) est exhaustive et pr\u00e9cise la port\u00e9e du terme \u00ab conducteur \u00bb, alors que celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au par. 48(18) est non exhaustive et \u00e9largit le sens ordinaire du terme d\u00e9fini. D\u2019ailleurs, la d\u00e9finition du \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au par. 1(1) comporte deux volets; elle vise \u00e0 la fois une activit\u00e9 et le lieu de cette activit\u00e9. Pour \u00eatre un conducteur, il faut conduire un v\u00e9hicule (activit\u00e9) et le faire sur une voie publique (lieu). La d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue au par. 48(18) vise uniquement \u00e0 \u00e9largir le volet activit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9finition et non l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment relatif au lieu.\n[40] Deuxi\u00e8mement, notre Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que l\u2019incidence relative du sens ordinaire, du contexte et de l\u2019objet sur le processus d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation puisse varier, les tribunaux doivent chercher \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d\u2019une loi comme formant un tout harmonieux : Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601, par. 10. Nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, une d\u00e9finition non exhaustive n\u2019\u00e9carte pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019autres d\u00e9finitions. Selon le contexte, les d\u00e9finitions exhaustives et les d\u00e9finitions non exhaustives peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es ensemble. Suivant une interpr\u00e9tation harmonieuse des deux d\u00e9finitions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 ce terme, un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb est, pour l\u2019application du par. 48(1), une personne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule automobile, ou qui en a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le, sur une voie publique. La personne qui a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile, mais qui ne se trouve plus sur une voie publique, ne serait pas un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au sens du Code de la route.\n[41] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. McColman n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb pour l\u2019application du par. 48(1) lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 intercept\u00e9 par la police. M\u00eame si l\u2019on peut dire qu\u2019il avait la garde ou le contr\u00f4le du VTT, il ne se trouvait pas sur une voie publique quand la police a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interception. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par le par. 48(1) du Code de la route.\n[42] Le minist\u00e8re public sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019une question fondamentale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si la police doit communiquer sur une voie publique son intention d\u2019effectuer une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 afin d\u2019\u00eatre vis\u00e9e par le par. 48(1) du Code de la route. Il fait valoir que le pouvoir pr\u00e9vu au par. 48(1) entre en application au moment o\u00f9 la police forme l\u2019intention de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire en vue de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un conducteur qui se trouve sur une voie publique, et non \u00e0 celui o\u00f9 elle communique cette intention au conducteur. Le minist\u00e8re public soutient que cette interpr\u00e9tation est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le par. 216(1) du Code de la route.\n[43] Selon le minist\u00e8re public, le par. 216(1) t\u00e9moigne du choix l\u00e9gislatif de faire entrer en ligne de compte la communication de l\u2019intention d\u2019intercepter un conducteur. Comme la l\u00e9gislature a choisi de ne pas inclure les mots \u00ab d\u2019une demande ou de signaux \u00bb au par. 48(1), cette disposition n\u2019oblige pas la police \u00e0 communiquer sa d\u00e9cision pour pouvoir intercepter un conducteur. D\u00e8s lors que le conducteur se trouvait sur la voie publique au moment o\u00f9 le policier a form\u00e9 l\u2019intention subjective de l\u2019intercepter, le policier peut se pr\u00e9valoir du pouvoir pr\u00e9vu au par. 48(1) pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. \u00c0 notre avis, cet argument doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\n[44] Les paragraphes 48(1) et 216(1) ne t\u00e9moignent pas de choix l\u00e9gislatifs divergents parce les deux dispositions n\u2019ont pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. En fait, elles sont souvent cit\u00e9es ensemble comme conf\u00e9rant le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 : voir, p. ex., R. c. Sivarasah, 2017 ONSC 3597, 383 C.R.R. (2d) 1, par. 108; R. c. Holland, 2017 ONCJ 948, par. 11 (CanLII); R. c. Warha, 2015 ONCJ 214, par. 5 (CanLII); R. c. Vander Griendt, 2015 ONSC 6644, 331 C.C.C. (3d) 135, par. 4 et 21. Le paragraphe 216(1) pr\u00e9voit l\u2019aspect pratique du pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la police d\u2019intercepter des v\u00e9hicules, y compris l\u2019obligation correspondante des conducteurs de s\u2019immobiliser \u00ab \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux \u00bb en ce sens. Par contraste, le par. 48(1) pr\u00e9cise les circonstances dans lesquelles la police peut intercepter des conducteurs sans motifs raisonnables et probables afin de v\u00e9rifier leur sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Les deux dispositions se combinent pour pr\u00e9voir un pouvoir policier d\u2019effectuer des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur des voies publiques et une obligation correspondante incombant aux conducteurs de s\u2019immobiliser \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux en ce sens.\n[45] Selon cette interpr\u00e9tation, l\u2019absence des mots \u00ab \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande ou de signaux \u00bb au par. 48(1) ne t\u00e9moigne pas d\u2019un choix l\u00e9gislatif de privil\u00e9gier le moment o\u00f9 la police forme l\u2019intention de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le paragraphe 216(1) pr\u00e9voit une exigence de \u00ab communication \u00bb, de telle sorte que le policier qui souhaite invoquer le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au par. 48(1) doit, \u00e0 tout le moins, demander au conducteur, au moyen de signaux ou autrement, d\u2019immobiliser son v\u00e9hicule sur une voie publique.\n[46] De plus, l\u2019inclusion du mot \u00ab exiger \u00bb au par. 48(1) implique la communication d\u2019une attente ou d\u2019un ordre \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un. Selon le Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise informatis\u00e9 (en ligne), le terme \u00ab exiger \u00bb signifie \u00ab [f]aire savoir que l\u2019on veut imp\u00e9rativement que quelque chose soit fait \u00bb. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend le minist\u00e8re public, une personne ne peut pas exiger d\u2019une autre personne qu\u2019elle fasse quelque chose simplement en ayant subjectivement l\u2019intention de l\u2019exiger.\n[47] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police a attendu que M. McColman s\u2019engage dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e de ses parents avant de lui signaler son intention de l\u2019intercepter. Elle n\u2019a donc pas invoqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement son pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du par. 48(1).\n[48] Enfin, le minist\u00e8re public soutient que le fait de maintenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donnent les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel au par. 48(1) du Code de la route cr\u00e9erait le probl\u00e8me du sanctuaire, en ce sens qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avenir, les conducteurs dont les facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies n\u2019auraient qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019engager sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e chaque fois qu\u2019ils rep\u00e8rent une voiture de patrouille. Le juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [d]ans de nombreux cas, ce sanctuaire sera \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, car le conducteur dont les facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies ne demeurera sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e que tant que la voiture de patrouille se trouve dans les parages. D\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a disparu, le conducteur pourra de nouveau s\u2019engager dans la voie publique et continuer \u00e0 compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique \u00bb : par. 96, le juge Hourigan. \u00c0 notre avis, le probl\u00e8me du sanctuaire est exag\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[49] Premi\u00e8rement, les interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne constituent pas le seul outil dont dispose la police pour lutter contre la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Bien qu\u2019ils ne puissent pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires pour v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de conducteurs sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e en vertu du par. 48(1) du Code de la route, les policiers peuvent intercepter des conducteurs s\u2019ils ont des motifs raisonnables et probables de le faire : Ladouceur, p. 1287. Cet arr\u00eat n\u2019interdit pas compl\u00e8tement les interceptions polici\u00e8res de conducteurs sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Divers sc\u00e9narios factuels peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 des motifs raisonnables et probables. Par exemple, si une personne conduit de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, un policier peut avoir des motifs raisonnables et probables de la poursuivre jusque sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. De plus, comme les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019ont fait observer, un [traduction] \u00ab v\u00e9ritable cas de fuite pourrait bien contribuer \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de motifs raisonnables de d\u00e9tenir l\u2019accus\u00e9, selon les circonstances \u00bb : par. 42. En cons\u00e9quence, il n\u2019est pas interdit en toutes circonstances aux policiers d\u2019intercepter des conducteurs sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[50] Deuxi\u00e8mement, sauf en cas de contestation constitutionnelle couronn\u00e9e de succ\u00e8s, notre Cour doit respecter la volont\u00e9 que la l\u00e9gislature a exprim\u00e9e dans une loi valide. Il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la Cour de r\u00e9\u00e9crire la loi ou de se demander quelle loi elle aurait elle\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9dict\u00e9e. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son contexte, le par. 48(1) du Code de la route n\u2019autorise pas les policiers \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Il est du devoir de la Cour de respecter la volont\u00e9 de la l\u00e9gislature. Si cette derni\u00e8re croit que les policiers devraient exercer des pouvoirs plus \u00e9tendus en vertu du par. 48(1), elle peut modifier la disposition.\n(2) L\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 a viol\u00e9 les droits garantis \u00e0 M. McColman par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte\n[51] Le paragraphe 48(1) du Code de la route conf\u00e9rait certes aux policiers le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interceptions al\u00e9atoires pour v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 de conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules automobiles, mais ceux\u2011ci n\u2019avaient pas le pouvoir d\u2019intercepter M. McColman parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un \u00ab conducteur \u00bb au sens du Code de la route au moment de l\u2019interception. Comme l\u2019interception \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, les policiers ont viol\u00e9 les droits garantis \u00e0 M. McColman par l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte , lequel proclame que \u00ab [c]hacun a droit \u00e0 la protection contre la d\u00e9tention ou l\u2019emprisonnement arbitraires \u00bb. Notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab la d\u00e9tention qui n\u2019est pas l\u00e9galement autoris\u00e9e est arbitraire et elle viole l\u2019art. 9 \u00bb : Grant, par. 54. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la conclusion qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de selon laquelle les policiers n\u2019avaient pas le pouvoir l\u00e9gal d\u2019intercepter au hasard M. McColman, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9tenu arbitrairement ce dernier.\n[52] La question \u00e0 laquelle il faut ensuite r\u00e9pondre est celle de savoir si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les policiers ont obtenus dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e et plus tard au poste de police doivent \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en application du par. 24(2) de la Charte .\nB. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus auraient\u2011il d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en application du par. 24(2) de la Charte ?\n[53] Le paragraphe 24(2) exige que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus dans des conditions qui portent atteinte aux droits garantis \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 par la Charte soient \u00e9cart\u00e9s du proc\u00e8s s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli, \u00ab eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, que leur utilisation est susceptible de d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb. L\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 24(2) est une analyse objective, qui se fait du point de vue d\u2019une personne raisonnable, et il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui sollicite l\u2019exclusion de convaincre le tribunal que l\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve est susceptible de d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l\u2019administration de la justice : Grant, par. 68.\n[54] Le paragraphe 24(2) est ax\u00e9 sur le maintien \u00e0 long terme de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de justice et de la confiance du public \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019exclusion d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vertu du par. 24(2) ne vise pas \u00e0 sanctionner l\u2019inconduite des policiers ou \u00e0 d\u00e9dommager l\u2019accus\u00e9, mais a plut\u00f4t une port\u00e9e syst\u00e9mique et institutionnelle : Grant, par. 70. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant, notre Cour a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 24(2) soul\u00e8ve trois questions : (1) la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite \u00e9tatique attentatoire \u00e0 la Charte ; (2) l\u2019incidence de la violation sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019accus\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte ; et (3) l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019affaire soit jug\u00e9e au fond. Les tribunaux sont charg\u00e9s de mettre en balance l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de chacune de ces questions, mais comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans Grant, \u00ab [l]a mise en balance requise par le par. 24(2) est de nature qualitative, la pr\u00e9cision math\u00e9matique est donc impossible \u00bb : par. 140.\n[55] Les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance doivent \u00e9valuer en profondeur chacune des trois questions. Un examen superficiel du test de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant emp\u00eache un contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9 en appel et fait passer l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le par. 24(2) d\u2019une analyse contextuelle \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle de d\u00e9marcation tr\u00e8s nette.\n[56] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant, puisqu\u2019il a conclu que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route autorisait l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 et que l\u2019art. 9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, notre Cour doit effectuer de nouveau l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant.\n(1) La gravit\u00e9 de la conduite attentatoire \u00e0 la Charte\n[57] La premi\u00e8re question met l\u2019accent sur la mesure dans laquelle la conduite \u00e9tatique en cause s\u2019\u00e9carte du principe de la primaut\u00e9 du droit. Comme notre Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant, par. 72, lorsqu\u2019il se penche sur cette question, \u00ab le tribunal doit \u00e9valuer si l\u2019utilisation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9consid\u00e9rerait l\u2019administration de la justice en donnant \u00e0 penser que les tribunaux, en tant qu\u2019institution devant r\u00e9pondre de l\u2019administration de la justice, tol\u00e8rent en fait les entorses de l\u2019\u00c9tat au principe de la primaut\u00e9 du droit en ne se dissociant pas du fruit de ces conduites ill\u00e9gales \u00bb. Ou, pour reprendre les termes utilis\u00e9s par la Cour dans R. c. Harrison, 2009 CSC 34, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 494, par. 22 : \u00ab S\u2019agit\u2011il d\u2019une inconduite [polici\u00e8re] dont le tribunal devrait souhaiter se dissocier? \u00bb\n[58] Lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9value la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite \u00e9tatique en cause, le tribunal doit \u00ab situer cette conduite sur l\u2019\u00e9chelle de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00bb : R. c. Paterson, 2017 CSC 15, [2017] 1 R.C.S. 202, par. 43. Comme le juge Doherty l\u2019a fait observer dans R. c. Blake, 2010 ONCA 1, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 4, [traduction] \u00ab plus l\u2019inconduite de l\u2019\u00c9tat est grave, plus il est n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9server la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 long terme port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019administration de la justice en dissociant les processus judiciaires de cette inconduite \u00bb : par. 23. Pour situer ad\u00e9quatement la conduite \u00e9tatique sur l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9chelle de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00bb, les tribunaux doivent \u00e9galement se demander si la pr\u00e9sence de circonstances contextuelles diminue ou exacerbe la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite \u00e9tatique : Grant, par. 75. La police \u00e9tait\u2011elle oblig\u00e9e d\u2019agir rapidement pour emp\u00eacher la disparition d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve? A\u2011t\u2011elle agi de bonne foi? Aurait\u2011elle pu obtenir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sans violer la Charte ? Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en adoptant une analyse globale que le tribunal peut situer ad\u00e9quatement la conduite \u00e9tatique sur l\u2019\u00e9chelle de culpabilit\u00e9.\n[59] Il convient de signaler d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu que la premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me question sont distinctes. La premi\u00e8re question \u00e9value la conduite \u00e9tatique elle\u2011m\u00eame, tandis que la deuxi\u00e8me question va plus loin et appr\u00e9cie l\u2019incidence de la conduite \u00e9tatique sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019accus\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte . Notre Cour a soulign\u00e9 que \u00ab [b]ien que les deux premi\u00e8res questions agissent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en tandem en ce qu\u2019elles font toutes deux pencher la balance en faveur de l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le niveau de force avec lequel elles font pencher la balance n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre identique pour que l\u2019exclusion soit requise \u00bb : R. c. Le, 2019 CSC 34, [2019] 2 R.C.S. 692, par. 141. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 dans R. c. Lafrance, 2022 CSC 32, par. 90, \u00ab c\u2019est le poids cumulatif des deux premi\u00e8res questions que les juges du proc\u00e8s doivent consid\u00e9rer et mettre en balance par rapport \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me question lorsqu\u2019ils examinent si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devraient \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s \u00bb (en italique dans l\u2019original). Dans certaines situations, seule une des deux premi\u00e8res questions militera en faveur de l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. La conduite \u00e9tatique qui n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement grave pourrait n\u00e9anmoins avoir une incidence importante sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019accus\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte . \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, la conduite \u00e9tatique qui est scandaleuse pourrait avoir une incidence minimale sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019accus\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte . Les tribunaux doivent prendre garde de ne pas regrouper les deux premi\u00e8res questions en une seule analyse non structur\u00e9e.\n[60] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la premi\u00e8re question milite l\u00e9g\u00e8rement en faveur de l\u2019exclusion. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019une jurisprudence pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, compte tenu de l\u2019incertitude juridique qui existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les policiers auraient d\u00fb agir avec plus de prudence. En cas d\u2019incertitude juridique, \u00ab la police ferait bien de p\u00e9cher par exc\u00e8s de prudence \u00bb : R. c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 TELUS Communications, 2013 CSC 16, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 80.\n[61] Au moment de l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, la jurisprudence applicable \u00e9tait incertaine : voir R. c. Vu, 2013 CSC 60, [2013] 3 R.C.S. 657, par. 71. Le juge dissident de la Cour d\u2019appel a cit\u00e9 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions ontariennes \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son affirmation selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab il existait une jurisprudence qui tendait \u00e0 confirmer le pouvoir des policiers de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019interception dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e partag\u00e9e \u00bb : par. 178, le juge Hourigan. Voir en particulier R. c. Alrayyes, 2013 ONSC 7256; R. c. Calder (2002), 29 M.V.R. (4th) 292 (C.S. Ont.), conf. par (2004), 47 M.V.R. (4th) 20 (C.A. Ont.); R. c. McGregor, 2015 ONCJ 692, 92 M.V.R. (6th) 333; et Warha. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Alrayyes, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario a jug\u00e9 que sous le r\u00e9gime du par. 48(1) du Code de la route, le pouvoir d\u2019un policier d\u2019intercepter un v\u00e9hicule circulant sur une voie publique ne s\u2019est pas \u00e9vapor\u00e9 simplement parce que le v\u00e9hicule s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e : par. 31 (QL, WL).\n[62] Cependant, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toute la jurisprudence applicable qui appuyait la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019agent Lobsinger de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans R. c. George, 2004 ONCJ 316, le juge du proc\u00e8s a conclu que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route n\u2019autorisait pas le policier \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire afin de v\u00e9rifier la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une personne qui avait quitt\u00e9 la voie publique pour s\u2019engager dans son entr\u00e9e priv\u00e9e : par. 15\u201116 (CanLII). De m\u00eame, dans R. c. Nield, 2015 ONSC 5730, 88 M.V.R. (6th) 274, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario a statu\u00e9 que le par. 48(1) du Code de la route ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 une personne qui conduisait un v\u00e9hicule, mais qui ne se trouvait pas sur une voie publique : par. 26 et 29. Voir aussi R. c. Hajivasilis, 2013 ONCA 27, 114 O.R. (3d) 337, par. 13; R. c. Larocque, 2014 ONCJ 601, par. 11 (CanLII); et Vander Griendt, par. 19\u201121.\n[63] En d\u00e9finitive, cependant, les policiers en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont agi sans justification l\u00e9gale. Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, le Code de la route ne leur conf\u00e9rait pas le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Ils n\u2019avaient pas non plus de motifs raisonnables et probables. Compte tenu de l\u2019incertitude juridique en jeu, les policiers avaient l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir avec prudence et de s\u2019interroger sur les limites de leurs pouvoirs. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge en chef Dickson, dissident, dans Dedman c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 2, p. 10, \u00ab [o]n a toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9, comme principe fondamental de la primaut\u00e9 du droit dans ce pays, que dans l\u2019accomplissement de leurs devoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 titre d\u2019agents de l\u2019\u00c9tat charg\u00e9s de l\u2019application de la loi, les policiers ont des pouvoirs limit\u00e9s et n\u2019ont le droit de porter atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 personnelle ou \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que dans la mesure autoris\u00e9e par la loi \u00bb. Bien qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans le contexte du pouvoir policier en common law, les propos du juge en chef Dickson s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019exercice par les policiers du pouvoir que leur conf\u00e8re la loi. Ceux\u2011ci ne peuvent exercer que les pouvoirs qui leur sont accord\u00e9s par la loi. Dans les situations marqu\u00e9es par l\u2019incertitude juridique, ils ne devraient pas s\u2019appuyer sur cette incertitude, mais devraient plut\u00f4t p\u00e9cher par exc\u00e8s de prudence.\n[64] Suivant la premi\u00e8re question, les tribunaux doivent \u00e9galement se demander s\u2019il existe d\u2019autres circonstances att\u00e9nuantes qui influent sur leur conception de la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite \u00e9tatique. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la police aurait pu proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la voie publique en actionnant les gyrophares ou la sir\u00e8ne de la voiture de patrouille d\u00e8s que M. McColman a quitt\u00e9 le d\u00e9panneur \u00e0 bord de son VTT. Ainsi, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00ab auraient pu \u00eatre obtenus sans violation de la Charte \u00bb : R. c. Jacoy, [1988] 2 R.C.S. 548, p. 559. En somme, les policiers auraient pu effectuer l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant que M. McColman ne s\u2019engage sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[65] Nous estimons que, dans l\u2019ensemble, la premi\u00e8re question milite l\u00e9g\u00e8rement en faveur de l\u2019exclusion. La police a agi sans autorisation l\u00e9gale lorsqu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019interception, et une jurisprudence confirmait qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 intercepter M. McColman. En revanche, une autre jurisprudence appuyait sa conduite. Vu l\u2019incertitude juridique qui existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019interception al\u00e9atoire de v\u00e9rification de la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, la violation n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas grave au point d\u2019exiger de notre Cour qu\u2019elle se dissocie des actes de la police. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette m\u00eame incertitude juridique, cependant, les policiers auraient d\u00fb agir avec plus de prudence. Tout compte fait, nous sommes d\u2019avis que ces deux cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019incertitude juridique militent en faveur de l\u2019exclusion, mais seulement l\u00e9g\u00e8rement.\n(2) L\u2019incidence de la violation sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. McColman prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte\n[66] La deuxi\u00e8me question vise la crainte que l\u2019utilisation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus en violation de la Charte puisse donner \u00e0 penser aux citoyens que les droits garantis par la Charte ne rev\u00eatent pas d\u2019utilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle pour eux. Les tribunaux doivent \u00e9valuer la port\u00e9e \u00ab r\u00e9elle de l\u2019atteinte [par la violation] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le droit en cause \u00bb : Grant, par. 76. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de la premi\u00e8re question, la deuxi\u00e8me question envisage une \u00e9chelle variable de conduites, les violations \u00ab passag[\u00e8res] ou d\u2019ordre simplement formel \u00bb se trouvant \u00e0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9chelle et les violations \u00ab profond\u00e9ment attentatoire[s] \u00bb se trouvant \u00e0 l\u2019autre : par. 76.\n[67] Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Tim, 2022 CSC 12, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que l\u2019incidence sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019accus\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019art. 9 se situait quelque part au milieu du spectre. L\u2019incidence de l\u2019arrestation arbitraire de l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 att\u00e9nu\u00e9e dans une certaine mesure parce que, bien qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur la base d\u2019une erreur de droit quant au statut juridique d\u2019une drogue, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenu l\u00e9galement aux fins d\u2019une enqu\u00eate li\u00e9e \u00e0 un accident de la route : par. 92. En revanche, dans Harrison, notre Cour a conclu que l\u2019incidence \u00e9tait plus importante parce que l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intercept\u00e9 et que son v\u00e9hicule avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fouill\u00e9 sans justification l\u00e9gitime : par. 31; voir aussi R. c. Mann, 2004 CSC 52, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 59, par. 56.\n[68] Dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, la deuxi\u00e8me question milite mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment en faveur de l\u2019exclusion de la preuve. L\u2019interception a eu une incidence sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. McColman \u00e0 la protection de sa libert\u00e9 parce que la police l\u2019a interrog\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une d\u00e9tention ill\u00e9gale. La police avait certes le pouvoir d\u2019intercepter au hasard M. McColman pour v\u00e9rifier sa sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais elle n\u2019a pas agi dans les limites l\u00e9gales de ce pouvoir. De plus, le fait que la d\u00e9tention arbitraire a eu lieu sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e est pertinent parce que \u00ab [s]e retirer dans une r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e (m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de leur r\u00e9sidence) sera parfois le seul moyen pratique pour des personnes d\u2019exercer leur droit de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9es \u00bb : Le, par. 155. Par suite de l\u2019interception ill\u00e9gale, M. McColman a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et amen\u00e9 au poste de police, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenu pendant plusieurs heures. La police a obtenu une preuve appr\u00e9ciable contre M. McColman, dont les observations du policier sur les signes d\u2019affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s, les d\u00e9clarations de M. McColman au sujet de sa consommation d\u2019alcool et les r\u00e9sultats de deux alcootests. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re ill\u00e9gale constituait une atteinte marqu\u00e9e, sans \u00eatre des plus extr\u00eames, aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. McColman prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Charte .\n(3) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019affaire soit jug\u00e9e au fond\n[69] La troisi\u00e8me question vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que remplit le proc\u00e8s criminel serait mieux servie par l\u2019utilisation ou par l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Pour ce faire, les tribunaux doivent tenir compte tant des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives qu\u2019aurait l\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la consid\u00e9ration dont jouit l\u2019administration de la justice que des r\u00e9percussions qu\u2019aurait leur exclusion : Grant, par. 79. Dans chaque cas, \u00ab c\u2019est la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 long terme pour l\u2019administration de la justice qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00bb : Harrison, par. 36.\n[70] Suivant cette troisi\u00e8me question, les tribunaux devraient tenir compte de facteurs comme la fiabilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, l\u2019importance de ceux\u2011ci pour la cause du minist\u00e8re public et la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e, quoique notre Cour ait reconnu que le dernier facteur pouvait jouer dans les deux sens : Grant, par. 81 et 83\u201184. Bien qu\u2019il ait un int\u00e9r\u00eat accru \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait un jugement au fond si l\u2019infraction est grave, le public a aussi un int\u00e9r\u00eat vital \u00e0 ce que le syst\u00e8me de justice demeure irr\u00e9prochable : par. 84.\n[71] Quoique l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une preuve obtenue en contravention de l\u2019art. 9 de la Charte ait une incidence manifeste sur l\u2019administration de la justice, l\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019affaiblir la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 long terme port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019administration de la justice. Premi\u00e8rement, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis par la police \u00e9taient fiables et cruciaux pour la cause du minist\u00e8re public. L\u2019agent Lobsinger a observ\u00e9 sur les lieux plusieurs signes d\u2019affaiblissement des facult\u00e9s, notamment une forte odeur d\u2019alcool et l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de M. McColman de se tenir droit debout. Monsieur McColman a admis aux policiers qu\u2019il avait [traduction] \u00ab peut\u2011\u00eatre bu 10 \u00bb bi\u00e8res ce soir\u2011l\u00e0. Deux alcootests, effectu\u00e9s quelque temps apr\u00e8s que M. McColman eut vomi en raison de sa consommation d\u2019alcool, ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 chez lui une alcool\u00e9mie qui \u00e9tait notablement sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la limite l\u00e9gale.\n[72] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies est une infraction grave. Notre Cour a reconnu que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a un int\u00e9r\u00eat vital \u00e0 lutter contre l\u2019alcool au volant. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 R.C.S. 254, par. 16, le juge Cory a soulign\u00e9 :\nChaque ann\u00e9e, l\u2019ivresse au volant entra\u00eene \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, de blessures, de peine et de destruction. Au plan num\u00e9rique seulement, l\u2019ivresse au volant a une plus grande incidence sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne que tout autre crime. Du point de vue des d\u00e9c\u00e8s et des blessures graves donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019hospitalisation, la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies est de toute \u00e9vidence le crime qui cause la plus grande perte sociale au pays.\n(Voir aussi R. c. Lacasse, 2015 CSC 64, [2015] 3 R.C.S. 1089, par. 8.)\n[73] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019importance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction reproch\u00e9e, la troisi\u00e8me question milite fortement en faveur de l\u2019inclusion. L\u2019utilisation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce servirait mieux la fonction de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que remplit le proc\u00e8s criminel et n\u2019affaiblirait pas la consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 long terme port\u00e9e au syst\u00e8me de justice.\n(4) Mise en balance des facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant\n[74] Lorsqu\u2019on met en balance les facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant, le poids cumulatif des deux premi\u00e8res questions doit \u00eatre mis en balance par rapport \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me question : Lafrance, par. 90; R. c. Beaver, 2022 CSC 54, par. 134. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la premi\u00e8re question milite l\u00e9g\u00e8rement en faveur de l\u2019exclusion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et la deuxi\u00e8me question milite mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment en faveur de celle\u2011ci. Cependant, la troisi\u00e8me question penche fortement en faveur de l\u2019inclusion et, \u00e0 notre avis, l\u2019emporte sur le poids cumulatif des deux premi\u00e8res questions en raison de la nature cruciale et fiable des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que des importantes pr\u00e9occupations d\u2019ordre public en ce qui a trait au fl\u00e9au de la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Dans l\u2019ensemble, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne doivent pas \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en application du par. 24(2).\nVII. Conclusion\n[75] Nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi au motif que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus dans l\u2019interception polici\u00e8re ill\u00e9gale n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en application du par. 24(2) de la Charte . En cons\u00e9quence, nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019annuler l\u2019acquittement et de r\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ainsi que le sursis prononc\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Kienapple. Le minist\u00e8re public est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 interjeter appel de la peine. Nous sommes d\u2019avis d\u2019\u00e9liminer la suramende compensatoire (R. c.

C-46, art. 254(2) b), 254(5) .\nLe 2 avril 2017, deux policiers sont inform\u00e9s par des patrouilleurs de sentiers forestiers qu\u2019un individu conduit un v\u00e9hicule tout terrain (\u00ab VTT \u00bb) en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Vers 13 h 35, les policiers arrivent sur les lieux, remarquent puis interpellent B qui s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 quitter les lieux \u00e0 pied. Un des policiers constate que B a les yeux inject\u00e9s de sang et qu\u2019une forte odeur d\u2019alcool \u00e9mane de son haleine. \u00c0 13 h 41, ce policier demande sur les ondes radio qu\u2019on lui apporte un appareil de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9 (\u00ab ADA \u00bb), puisque les policiers n\u2019en ont pas en leur possession. Une fois la demande d\u2019ADA effectu\u00e9e, le policier ordonne \u00e0 B, en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2) b) du Code criminel , de lui fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine. \u00c0 compter de 13 h 45, B refuse \u00e0 trois reprises de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon demand\u00e9 au motif qu\u2019il ne conduisait pas le VTT en question. Il est mis en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon demand\u00e9 en contravention avec le par. 254(5) C. cr.\nLe juge de la Cour municipale statue que la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9 par le policier ne d\u00e9pend pas de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux de l\u2019interception. Il d\u00e9clare B coupable de l\u2019infraction d\u2019avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un ordre donn\u00e9 en vertu du par. 254(2) C. cr., contrevenant ainsi aux par. 254(5) et 255(1) C. cr. L\u2019appel de B \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure est rejet\u00e9, mais son appel subs\u00e9quent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel est accueilli. Selon la Cour d\u2019appel, la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre d\u00e9pend de la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019agent de la paix d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un conducteur de fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, ce qui implique que l\u2019agent de la paix doive avoir un acc\u00e8s imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 un ADA. La cour estime que l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9 par le policier \u00e0 B \u00e9tait invalide, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA. Elle infirme les jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et ordonne l\u2019inscription d\u2019un jugement d\u2019acquittement.\nArr\u00eat : Le pourvoi est rejet\u00e9.\nLe minist\u00e8re public n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019aucune circonstance inhabituelle justifiant l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur place et, par le fait m\u00eame, l\u2019application d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par le policier \u00e9tait invalide. Le refus exprim\u00e9 par B n\u2019a donc pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle, et l\u2019acquittement inscrit par la Cour d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLe mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb au par. 254(2)b) C. cr. doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation fid\u00e8le \u00e0 son sens ordinaire et ce, au regard du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de cette disposition. Selon le sens ordinaire et grammatical des termes \u00ab fournir \u00bb et \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb, que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la disposition sous \u00e9tude, le conducteur doit \u00ab faire avoir \u00bb un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine \u00e0 l\u2019agent de la paix \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame, tout de suite \u00bb. Le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb qualifie l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. auquel doivent ob\u00e9ir les conducteurs intercept\u00e9s. Ces derniers n\u2019ont pas le loisir de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon quand bon leur semble. Certes, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb comprend implicitement un d\u00e9lai d\u2019ordre op\u00e9rationnel, car le policier doit pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel et indiquer au suspect ce qu\u2019il doit faire; toutefois, ce type de d\u00e9lai se distingue du d\u00e9lai relatif \u00e0 la livraison d\u2019un appareil sur les lieux.\nLa constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. d\u00e9pend d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb conforme \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, car la pr\u00e9sence de ce mot comprend une restriction implicite au droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . En effet, comme le conducteur d\u00e9tenu doit fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, il ne peut consulter un avocat pr\u00e9alablement. Cette restriction est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en raison de la tr\u00e8s courte dur\u00e9e de la d\u00e9tention. La proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9tection dans laquelle s\u2019inscrit l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. a pour objectif de combattre la menace que constitue la conduite en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans la poursuite de cet objectif, le Parlement entendait trouver un compromis entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 ce que la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies soit \u00e9limin\u00e9e et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server les droits individuels garantis par la Charte . Ce compromis doit \u00eatre gard\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019esprit lors de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\nL\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles peut justifier une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il ne soit ni n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable d\u2019identifier dans l\u2019abstrait et exhaustivement les circonstances pouvant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019inhabituelles, sachant qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que celles\u2011ci soient identifi\u00e9es au cas par cas, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits propres \u00e0 chaque affaire, il importe, n\u00e9anmoins, de tracer des lignes directrices afin de guider les tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure dans cet examen. Premi\u00e8rement, le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles repose sur le minist\u00e8re public. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les circonstances inhabituelles doivent \u00eatre identifi\u00e9es eu \u00e9gard au texte de la disposition afin d\u2019en pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 constitutionnelle, en faisant en sorte que les tribunaux n\u2019\u00e9largissent pas ind\u00fbment le sens ordinaire strictement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 254(2)b) C. cr. pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon recueilli doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable, ce qui ouvre la porte \u00e0 des d\u00e9lais caus\u00e9s par des circonstances inhabituelles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019appareil ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat. Des circonstances relatives \u00e0 l\u2019urgence d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public ou celle des policiers pourraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre reconnues comme \u00e9tant inhabituelles. Troisi\u00e8mement, les circonstances inhabituelles ne peuvent \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de consid\u00e9rations budg\u00e9taires ou d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 pratique puisque c\u2019est le lot quotidien de tout gouvernement d\u2019allouer des ressources budg\u00e9taires limit\u00e9es. Quatri\u00e8mement, l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux au moment de la formulation de l\u2019ordre ne constitue pas en soi une circonstance inhabituelle.\nUn ordre formul\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 valide en l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux de l\u2019interception. Rien dans cette disposition n\u2019indique que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er une telle pr\u00e9somption de validit\u00e9. Une personne ne peut engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 un ordre auquel il \u00e9tait concr\u00e8tement impossible d\u2019ob\u00e9ir en raison de l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA au moment de la formulation de l\u2019ordre. Enfin, la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre ne peut \u00eatre conditionnelle au d\u00e9lai de livraison de l\u2019ADA \u00e0 destination, car une telle approche placerait le conducteur devant une incertitude insoutenable. En effet, lorsqu\u2019un conducteur d\u00e9tenu est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un ordre lui intimant de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, il doit \u00eatre en mesure de savoir si l\u2019ordre est valide et si son refus engagera sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle. Dans un contexte o\u00f9 ce dernier n\u2019a pas le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat, on ne saurait attendre de lui qu\u2019il accepte \u00e0 l\u2019avance d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer, puis qu\u2019il sache ensuite d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel moment le d\u00e9lai de livraison de l\u2019ADA justifie un refus.\nJurisprudence\nArr\u00eat rejet\u00e9 : R. c.

Introduction\n[1] Ce pourvoi concerne l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 contenue dans ce qui \u00e9tait, au moment des faits, l\u2019al. 254(2)b) (aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019al. 320.27(1)b))[1] du Code criminel , L.R.C. 1985, c. C\u201146 (\u00ab C. cr. \u00bb). Selon cette disposition, un agent de la paix ayant des motifs raisonnables de soup\u00e7onner qu\u2019un conducteur a de l\u2019alcool dans son organisme peut lui ordonner de \u00ab fournir imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine que celui\u2011ci estime n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un appareil de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9 (\u00ab ADA \u00bb).\n[2] L\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 qui d\u00e9coule de cette disposition poss\u00e8de \u00e0 la fois une composante implicite et une composante explicite. Elle est \u00ab implicite en ce qui concerne l\u2019ordre de la police de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, et explicite quant \u00e0 l\u2019ob\u00e9issance obligatoire : le conducteur doit fournir \u201cimm\u00e9diatement\u201d un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine \u00bb (R. c. Woods, 2005 CSC 42, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 205, par. 14). La pr\u00e9sente affaire porte sur cette derni\u00e8re composante.\n[3] Aux termes du par. 254(5) C. cr., la personne qui, sans excuse raisonnable, omet ou refuse d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un tel ordre commet une infraction.\n[4] La question au c\u0153ur du litige porte sur le d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel un agent de la paix doit permettre \u00e0 un conducteur ainsi intercept\u00e9 de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine requis pour r\u00e9aliser une analyse convenable au moyen d\u2019un ADA. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, notre Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par un agent de la paix en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. requiert de cet agent qu\u2019il ait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ADA \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame o\u00f9 il formule cet ordre.\n[5] Notre Cour a ainsi l\u2019occasion de trancher une controverse jurisprudentielle relative \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Cette controverse est illustr\u00e9e par les approches adopt\u00e9es, d\u2019une part, par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans les arr\u00eats R. c. Degiorgio, 2011 ONCA 527, 275 C.C.C. (3d) 1, et R. c. Quansah, 2012 ONCA 123, 286 C.C.C. (3d) 307, et, d\u2019autre part, par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans le jugement entrepris. Apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. conform\u00e9ment au texte, au contexte et \u00e0 l\u2019objet de cette disposition, je conclus que l\u2019approche de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec est essentiellement bien fond\u00e9e.\n[6] Les interceptions visant la fourniture d\u2019un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine se veulent rapides. Les conducteurs ainsi intercept\u00e9s sont alors en d\u00e9tention. La jurisprudence de notre Cour tol\u00e8re que soit restreint, durant cette d\u00e9tention, le droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Cette restriction est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte , car l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. est le fruit du compromis auquel est parvenu le Parlement entre la pr\u00e9servation des droits constitutionnels des conducteurs et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 \u00e9radiquer la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies (Woods, par. 29). L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fid\u00e8le \u00e0 son sens courant ou ordinaire est une exigence essentielle de ce compromis.\n[7] Exceptionnellement, des circonstances inhabituelles peuvent justifier d\u2019adopter une interpr\u00e9tation plus souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb que celle impos\u00e9e par le sens courant ou ordinaire de ce mot (Woods, par. 43, citant R. c. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 R.C.S. 254). Toutefois, ces circonstances doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cela : inhabituelles. Elles ne peuvent pas r\u00e9sulter de consid\u00e9rations utilitaires ou de commodit\u00e9 administrative. Par ailleurs, l\u2019identification de ce qui constitue des circonstances inhabituelles doit \u00eatre principalement ancr\u00e9e dans le texte de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\n[8] La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec se dirige bien en droit lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que le libell\u00e9 de la disposition permet une interpr\u00e9tation souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb en pr\u00e9sence de circonstances inhabituelles notamment li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019appareil ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat qui sera g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, puisque le texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon recueilli doit permettre la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une \u00ab analyse convenable \u00bb.\n[9] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable de dresser une liste exhaustive des circonstances pouvant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019inhabituelles. Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, qu\u2019il suffise de mentionner que l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur les lieux au moment de l\u2019ordre ne constitue pas en soi une telle circonstance inhabituelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel.\nII. Contexte factuel\n[10] Le 2 avril 2017, les agents Dale Atkins et Jean\u2011Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux sont inform\u00e9s par des patrouilleurs de sentiers forestiers qu\u2019un individu conduit un v\u00e9hicule tout terrain (\u00ab VTT \u00bb) en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Val\u2011B\u00e9lair. Alors qu\u2019ils sont en route, ils apprennent que l\u2019individu a stationn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule et s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 quitter les lieux \u00e0 pied.\n[11] Les agents arrivent sur les lieux vers 13 h 35. Ils remarquent puis interpellent l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019agent Atkins constate que ce dernier a les yeux inject\u00e9s de sang et qu\u2019une forte odeur d\u2019alcool \u00e9mane de son haleine. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019identifie au moyen de son permis de conduire, il s\u2019agit de M. Pascal Breault. Questionn\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins, il admet avoir bu une bi\u00e8re, mais nie avoir conduit le VTT. Quant \u00e0 lui, l\u2019agent C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux discute avec les patrouilleurs qui confirment que l\u2019intim\u00e9 conduisait le v\u00e9hicule; il communique cette information \u00e0 son coll\u00e8gue. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, les agents sont d\u2019avis qu\u2019ils s\u2019adressent bel et bien \u00e0 l\u2019individu dont parlaient les patrouilleurs.\n[12] \u00c0 13 h 41, les agents n\u2019ayant pas d\u2019ADA en leur possession, l\u2019agent Atkins demande sur les ondes radio qu\u2019on lui en apporte un. L\u2019agent C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux t\u00e9moignera qu\u2019il ignore pourquoi l\u2019agent Atkins et lui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019ADA : \u00ab . . . je ne peux pas vous dire si on n\u2019en a pas pris cette journ\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0 ou il n\u2019y en avait plus de disponible . . . \u00bb (d.a., vol. II, p. 81). Un coll\u00e8gue patrouillant dans le secteur de Charlesbourg lui r\u00e9pond qu\u2019il en a un et qu\u2019il est en route. L\u2019agent Atkins estime que Charlesbourg est \u00e0 environ 10 minutes de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 il se trouve, bien qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 15 minutes ne soit pas impossible.\n[13] Une fois la demande d\u2019ADA effectu\u00e9e sur les ondes, l\u2019agent Atkins ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr., de lui fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine. Ni lui ni l\u2019agent C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux ne l\u2019informent de l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur les lieux. \u00c0 compter de 13 h 45, l\u2019intim\u00e9 refuse trois fois plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon demand\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s un premier refus exprim\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019agent Atkins l\u2019informe des cons\u00e9quences auxquelles il s\u2019expose. \u00c0 deux reprises par la suite, l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9it\u00e8re son refus. Durant cette interaction, il indique vouloir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat, demande \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019agent Atkins refuse d\u2019acc\u00e9der. Chacun des trois refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est ainsi motiv\u00e9 : il ne conduisait pas le VTT en question. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est donc mis en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon demand\u00e9 en contravention avec le par. 254(5) C. cr.\n[14] Vers 14 h, il n\u2019y a toujours pas d\u2019ADA sur les lieux. Vu le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9, les agents annulent la demande qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9alablement effectu\u00e9e sur les ondes radio pour qu\u2019on leur apporte un ADA. Ils saisissent le VTT de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et lib\u00e8rent celui\u2011ci.\nIII. D\u00e9cisions des juridictions inf\u00e9rieures\nA. Cour municipale de la Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, 2019 QCCM 114 (le juge Simard)\n[15] S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Degiorgio de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, le juge Simard statue que la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins ne d\u00e9pend pas de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux de l\u2019interception. Le juge note \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ignorait tout de l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA et a imm\u00e9diatement refus\u00e9 de souffler \u00e0 trois reprises pour un motif tout autre. Par ailleurs, de l\u2019avis du juge Simard, les voitures de police n\u2019ont pas toutes \u00e0 \u00eatre munies d\u2019ADA. Finalement, le juge conclut que la poursuite a prouv\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019infraction. En effet, l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins \u00e9tait clair, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment inform\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences de son refus et il n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 aucune excuse raisonnable en vue de justifier ce refus. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de l\u2019infraction d\u2019avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un ordre donn\u00e9 en vertu du par. 254(2) C. cr., contrevenant ainsi aux par. 254(5) et 255(1) C. cr.\nB. Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, 2020 QCCS 1597 (le juge Pronovost)\n[16] Devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet la justesse juridique de l\u2019analyse du juge Simard au regard de la ratio decidendi des arr\u00eats R. c. Piazza, 2018 QCCA 948, 48 C.R. (7th) 80, et Petit c. R., 2005 QCCA 687, [2005] R.J.Q. 2463. Prenant appui sur l\u2019obiter dictum du juge Vauclair dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Piazza, il annonce son intention de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec afin qu\u2019elle infirme l\u2019arr\u00eat Petit. Le juge Pronovost rejette l\u2019appel.\nC. Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2021 QCCA 505, 75 M.V.R. (7th) 4 (les juges Doyon, Vauclair, Hogue, Ruel et Rancourt)\n[17] Dans des motifs unanimes r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le juge Doyon, la Cour d\u2019appel accueille l\u2019appel. Ce faisant, elle se base grandement sur la revue jurisprudentielle effectu\u00e9e par le juge Vauclair dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Piazza. De cet examen, elle conclut que la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre d\u00e9pend de la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019agent de la paix d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un conducteur \u00ab de fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, avant m\u00eame d\u2019avoir le temps, de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9aliste, de communiquer avec un avocat \u00bb, malgr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9tention. Elle conclut \u00e9galement que ceci implique que l\u2019agent de la paix doive avoir un acc\u00e8s imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 un ADA (motifs de la C.A., par. 42). Le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. doit donc recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation conforme \u00e0 son sens ordinaire. Il est n\u00e9anmoins justifiable de s\u2019\u00e9carter de ce sens lorsque le d\u00e9lai est d\u00fb \u00e0 des circonstances inhabituelles notamment li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019appareil ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat qui sera g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[18] La Cour d\u2019appel estime illogique qu\u2019un conducteur puisse engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 un ordre auquel il \u00e9tait de toute fa\u00e7on concr\u00e8tement impossible d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement. De m\u00eame, la cour consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas souhaitable que la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre soit \u00e9valu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s coup en fonction du d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel l\u2019ADA devient disponible; cela cr\u00e9e de l\u2019incertitude et m\u00e8ne \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats incoh\u00e9rents. Le conducteur qui refuse sur\u2011le\u2011champ d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un ordre de fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine lorsqu\u2019un ADA n\u2019est pas disponible sur les lieux pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de l\u2019infraction, alors que ce ne serait pas le cas s\u2019il acceptait puis se r\u00e9tractait \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un d\u00e9lai \u00ab trop \u00bb long.\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, la cour estime que l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait invalide, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA. Le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a donc pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle. La cour infirme les jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs, ordonne l\u2019inscription d\u2019un jugement d\u2019acquittement et d\u00e9clare que l\u2019arr\u00eat Petit, qui permettait un d\u00e9lai de 10 minutes pour la livraison d\u2019un ADA, n\u2019a plus valeur de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nIV. Question en litige\n[20] La r\u00e9solution du litige r\u00e9side dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question suivante : La validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par un agent de la paix en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. requiert\u2011elle de ce dernier qu\u2019il ait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ADA \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame o\u00f9 il formule cet ordre?\nV. Position des parties\n[21] Portant en appel le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, le minist\u00e8re public soutient qu\u2019une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative \u00e0 cette question s\u2019impose. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb ne doit pas recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation fid\u00e8le \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, car cela m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats contraires \u00e0 l\u2019intention qui animait le Parlement lors de la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue au par. 254(5) C. cr., soit adopter une mesure dissuasive ayant pour objectif de convaincre les conducteurs intercept\u00e9s de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine. De l\u2019avis du minist\u00e8re public, afin de combattre le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019alcool au volant et de dissuader les conducteurs avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies de conduire, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 avec souplesse. Se fondant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Quansah, l\u2019appelant avance que l\u2019on doit permettre un d\u00e9lai court, raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, ce qui inclut un d\u00e9lai d\u00fb au temps requis pour apporter un ADA \u00e0 un agent qui en requiert un. L\u2019adoption d\u2019une approche souple \u00e9viterait \u00e9galement des probl\u00e8mes dans la r\u00e9alisation du travail des policiers, lesquels n\u2019ont pas toujours un tel appareil avec eux ou ne peuvent pas, pour diverses raisons d\u2019ordre pratique, proc\u00e9der sans d\u00e9lai au pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement d\u2019\u00e9chantillons d\u2019haleine. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le minist\u00e8re public argue que la possession d\u2019un ADA lors de la formulation de l\u2019ordre n\u2019est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue au par. 254(5) C. cr. Le minist\u00e8re public pr\u00e9tend que, si le Parlement avait voulu faire de la possession d\u2019un ADA une exigence, il l\u2019aurait \u00e9nonc\u00e9 clairement, comme il l\u2019a fait \u00e0 l\u2019actuel par. 320.27(2) C. cr. N\u00e9anmoins, le minist\u00e8re public reconna\u00eet que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 notre Cour conclut que l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA a rendu invalide l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins, l\u2019acquittement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 inscrit par la Cour d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide que, sauf circonstances inhabituelles, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, car, pendant une interception visant la fourniture d\u2019un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, le conducteur intercept\u00e9 est d\u00e9tenu sans avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini exhaustivement les circonstances inhabituelles pouvant justifier une interpr\u00e9tation plus souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb, mais elle a correctement conclu que la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un nombre insuffisant d\u2019ADA pour des raisons budg\u00e9taires ou administratives ne constitue pas une telle circonstance. Puisque le minist\u00e8re public n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles, l\u2019ordre donn\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins \u00e9tait invalide et l\u2019acquittement inscrit par la Cour d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nVI. Analyse\n[23] Il importe d\u2019abord de reproduire l\u2019al. 254(2)b) et le par. 254(5), tels qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient libell\u00e9s au moment des faits :\n254 . . .\nContr\u00f4le pour v\u00e9rifier la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019alcool ou de drogue\n(2) L\u2019agent de la paix qui a des motifs raisonnables de soup\u00e7onner qu\u2019une personne a dans son organisme de l\u2019alcool ou de la drogue et que, dans les trois heures pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, elle a conduit un v\u00e9hicule \u2014 v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur, bateau, a\u00e9ronef ou mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire \u2014 ou en a eu la garde ou le contr\u00f4le ou que, s\u2019agissant d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef ou de mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire, elle a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 le conduire, le v\u00e9hicule ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en mouvement ou non, peut lui ordonner de se soumettre aux mesures pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a), dans le cas o\u00f9 il soup\u00e7onne la pr\u00e9sence de drogue, ou aux mesures pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des alin\u00e9as a) et b), ou aux deux, dans le cas o\u00f9 il soup\u00e7onne la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019alcool, et, au besoin, de le suivre \u00e0 cette fin :\na) subir imm\u00e9diatement les \u00e9preuves de coordination des mouvements pr\u00e9vues par r\u00e8glement afin que l\u2019agent puisse d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de donner l\u2019ordre pr\u00e9vu aux paragraphes (3) ou (3.1);\nb) fournir imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine que celui\u2011ci estime n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un appareil de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9.\n. . .\nOmission ou refus d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer\n(5) Commet une infraction quiconque, sans excuse raisonnable, omet ou refuse d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un ordre donn\u00e9 en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article.\n[24] Au terme d\u2019un exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire, je suis d\u2019avis que la Cour d\u2019appel s\u2019est bien dirig\u00e9e en droit en concluant que le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb doit, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation fid\u00e8le \u00e0 son sens ordinaire. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est conforme au texte, au contexte et \u00e0 l\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. Elle s\u2019accorde aussi avec la jurisprudence de notre Cour qui, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Thomsen, [1988] 1 R.C.S. 640, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Woods, interpr\u00e8te le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, hormis dans des circonstances inhabituelles.\nA. Les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire applicables\n[25] Tout exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire consiste \u00e0 lire les termes d\u2019une disposition [traduction] \u00ab dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, par. 21, citant E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2e \u00e9d. 1983), p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership c. Rex, 2002 CSC 42, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 559, par. 26; voir aussi R. c. J.D., 2022 CSC 15, par. 21).\n[26] Les tribunaux sont donc appel\u00e9s \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le \u00ab texte au moyen duquel le l\u00e9gislateur entend atteindre [son] objectif \u00bb, car \u00ab l\u2019exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation recherche une harmonie entre le texte de la loi et l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9, et non l\u2019atteinte de cet objectif \u201c\u00e0 n\u2019importe quel prix\u201d \u00bb (M\u00e9diaQMI inc. c. Kamel, 2021 CSC 23, par. 39, citant Sun Indalex Finance, LLC c. Syndicat des M\u00e9tallos, 2013 CSC 6, [2013] 1 R.C.S. 271, par. 174). En cons\u00e9quence, aussi louable et importante que soit la lutte contre la conduite avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies, on ne peut, dans la poursuite de cet objectif, d\u00e9naturer le sens devant \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 au texte de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire.\n[27] Enfin, lorsqu\u2019ils interpr\u00e8tent une disposition de droit criminel comme l\u2019al. 254(2)b), les tribunaux doivent \u00eatre soucieux de ne pas cr\u00e9er d\u2019incertitude, car \u00ab [l]\u2019une des exigences fondamentales de la primaut\u00e9 du droit veut qu\u2019une personne puisse savoir qu\u2019un acte est criminel avant de l\u2019accomplir \u00bb (R. c. Mabior, 2012 CSC 47, [2012] 2 R.C.S. 584, par. 14; voir aussi R. c. Kelly, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 170, p. 203; R. c. Levkovic, 2013 CSC 25, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 204, par. 1; Renvoi relatif \u00e0 l\u2019art. 193 et \u00e0 l\u2019al. 195.1(1)c) du Code criminel (Man.), [1990] 1 R.C.S. 1123, p. 1155).\n[28] Je me penche \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\nB. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 254(2)b) C. cr.\n(1) Le texte\n[29] Il importe de s\u2019attarder au sens de deux mots que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la disposition sous \u00e9tude : \u00ab fournir \u00bb et \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb. \u00ab Fournir \u00bb signifie \u00ab [f]aire avoir \u00bb quelque chose \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un (Le Petit Robert (nouv. \u00e9d. 2023), p. 1088). \u00ab Imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb veut dire \u00ab [\u00e0] l\u2019instant m\u00eame, tout de suite \u00bb (Woods, par. 13, citant Le Nouveau Petit Robert (2003), p. 1312; voir aussi R. c. Grant, [1991] 3 R.C.S. 139, p. 150).\n[30] Selon le sens ordinaire et grammatical de ces termes, le conducteur d\u00e9tenu en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. doit \u00ab faire avoir \u00bb un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine \u00e0 l\u2019agent de la paix \u00ab [\u00e0] l\u2019instant m\u00eame, tout de suite \u00bb. Par ailleurs, selon le libell\u00e9 de la disposition, cet \u00e9chantillon doit \u00eatre \u00ab n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ADA.\n[31] Partant, et contrairement \u00e0 ce pr\u00e9tend le minist\u00e8re public, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb qualifie l\u2019ordre auquel doivent ob\u00e9ir les conducteurs. En effet, les conducteurs intercept\u00e9s \u00ab sont tenus par le par. 254(2) d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb (Woods, par. 45). Ils n\u2019ont pas le loisir de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon quand bon leur semble.\n[32] Certes, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb comprend implicitement un d\u00e9lai d\u2019ordre op\u00e9rationnel, car l\u2019agent \u00ab doit pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel et indiquer au suspect ce qu\u2019il doit faire \u00bb (Bernshaw, par. 64). Toutefois, ce n\u2019est pas ce type de d\u00e9lai qui est en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais plut\u00f4t le d\u00e9lai relatif \u00e0 la livraison d\u2019un appareil sur les lieux.\n(2) Le contexte\n[33] Le pouvoir pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. est relatif \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il s\u2019agit de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9tection et d\u2019ex\u00e9cution en deux \u00e9tapes, la seconde \u00e9tant l\u2019alcootest dont l\u2019administration se d\u00e9roule g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au poste de police et requiert que l\u2019agent de la paix ait des motifs raisonnables de croire que le conducteur pr\u00e9sente un taux d\u2019alcool\u00e9mie sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la limite permise (Woods, par. 6).\n[34] La constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. d\u00e9pend d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb conforme \u00e0 son sens ordinaire :\nLe paragraphe 254(2) autorise le contr\u00f4le routier pour v\u00e9rifier la consommation d\u2019alcool, sous peine de poursuite criminelle, en violation des art. 8 , 9 et 10 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s . Sans son exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9, le par. 254(2) ne r\u00e9sisterait pas \u00e0 l\u2019examen de sa constitutionnalit\u00e9. Cette exigence ne saurait \u00eatre \u00e9largie au point d\u2019englober la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue du retard survenu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(Woods, par. 15)\n[35] En effet, bien que le conducteur intercept\u00e9 soit d\u00e9tenu pendant la r\u00e9alisation de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9tection, il n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat; il n\u2019y a droit qu\u2019\u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape (Woods, par. 31). C\u2019est le cas, car la pr\u00e9sence du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb comprend une restriction implicite au droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte . Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une condition d\u2019application de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.; puisque le conducteur d\u00e9tenu doit fournir imm\u00e9diatement un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, il ne peut consulter un avocat pr\u00e9alablement. Notre Cour a reconnu que cette restriction \u00e0 l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019article premier (Thomsen, p. 653; Woods, par. 30), pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en raison de la tr\u00e8s courte dur\u00e9e de la d\u00e9tention (Bernshaw, par. 23). Plus le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb est interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 avec souplesse, moins la justification reconnue \u00e0 la restriction du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat tient la route.\n[36] De plus, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le conducteur qui refuse ou omet d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 s\u2019expose \u00e0 des sanctions criminelles aux termes du par. 254(5) C. cr. Ne constitue donc pas une infraction l\u2019expression d\u2019une intention de refuser lorsque l\u2019ADA arrivera sur les lieux; c\u2019est le refus de fournir imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u00e9chantillon qui, sans excuse raisonnable, constitue l\u2019infraction (Woods, par. 14 et 45). Cela sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019il doit exister une possibilit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle et r\u00e9elle d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer.\n[37] Enfin, tant dans ses observations \u00e9crites que dans ses observations orales, le minist\u00e8re public a invit\u00e9 notre Cour \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du nouveau r\u00e9gime entr\u00e9 en vigueur en 2018. Je suis d\u2019avis de d\u00e9cliner l\u2019invitation, et voici pourquoi.\na) Le nouveau r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9tection de l\u2019alcool au volant\n[38] Le 21 juin 2018, la Loi modifiant le Code criminel (infractions relatives aux moyens de transport) et apportant des modifications corr\u00e9latives \u00e0 d\u2019autres lois, L.C. 2018, c. 21, re\u00e7oit la sanction royale. Par cette loi, le Parlement abroge les art. 249 \u00e0 261 du Code criminel et introduit les art. 320.11 \u00e0 320.4, lesquels sont entr\u00e9s en vigueur le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2018.\n[39] Pour l\u2019essentiel, le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 320.27(1)b) C. cr. est analogue \u00e0 celui de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 320.27(1)b) C. cr. pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019agent de la paix qui a des motifs raisonnables de soup\u00e7onner qu\u2019une personne a de l\u2019alcool dans son organisme et qu\u2019elle a conduit un moyen de transport dans les trois heures pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes peut lui ordonner de fournir imm\u00e9diatement les \u00e9chantillons d\u2019haleine qu\u2019il estime n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ADA. Aux termes du par. 320.15(1) C. cr., quiconque, sans excuse raisonnable, omet ou refuse d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 un tel ordre, s\u2019expose \u00e0 des sanctions criminelles.\n[40] L\u2019une des distinctions entre le nouveau r\u00e9gime et l\u2019ancien est le par. 320.27(2) C. cr., lequel autorise le d\u00e9pistage al\u00e9atoire des conducteurs par l\u2019agent de la paix ayant en sa possession un ADA et agissant dans l\u2019exercice l\u00e9gitime de ses pouvoirs, et ce, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de motifs raisonnables de soup\u00e7onner la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019alcool dans l\u2019organisme du conducteur interpell\u00e9.\n[41] Selon l\u2019argument du minist\u00e8re public, puisque l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. ne requiert pas explicitement que les agents de la paix aient en leur possession un ADA lorsqu\u2019ils formulent l\u2019ordre, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ayant, dans les faits, cr\u00e9\u00e9 une obligation en ce sens. Devant nous, l\u2019appelant a invit\u00e9 notre Cour \u00e0 voir dans le nouveau r\u00e9gime un \u00ab indice \u00bb que le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a pris acte de la jurisprudence de certaines cours d\u2019appel du pays qui tol\u00e8re des d\u00e9lais de plusieurs minutes, et n\u2019a pas voulu la r\u00e9pudier. Je suis d\u2019avis que cet argument doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, pour deux raisons.\n[42] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019\u00e9volution l\u00e9gislative subs\u00e9quente, soit les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la version d\u2019une disposition en vigueur au moment des faits, \u00ab ne peut jeter aucune lumi\u00e8re sur l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, qu\u2019il soit f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou provincial \u00bb quant \u00e0 cette version ant\u00e9rieure aux modifications (\u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique c. Dynar, [1997] 2 R.C.S. 462, par. 45; voir aussi Banque de Montr\u00e9al c. Marcotte, 2014 CSC 55, [2014] 2 R.C.S. 725, par. 78). Comme le pr\u00e9cise le par. 45(3) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation , L.R.C. 1985, c. I\u201121 , \u00ab [l]\u2019abrogation ou la modification, en tout ou en partie, d\u2019un texte ne constitue pas ni n\u2019implique une d\u00e9claration sur l\u2019\u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur du droit. \u00bb Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le par. 45(4) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ajoute que \u00ab [l]a nouvelle \u00e9diction d\u2019un texte, ou sa r\u00e9vision, refonte, codification ou modification, n\u2019a pas valeur de confirmation de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e, par d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou autrement, des termes du texte ou de termes analogues. \u00bb\n[43] M\u00eame dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la conservation du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb au par. 320.27(1) C. cr. (le mot \u00ab forthwith \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par \u00ab immediately \u00bb dans la version anglaise) pourrait \u00eatre vue comme une confirmation de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que lui ont donn\u00e9e les tribunaux (et qu\u2019est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 conna\u00eetre le l\u00e9gislateur), ce corpus jurisprudentiel est compos\u00e9, au premier chef, des arr\u00eats Thomsen, Grant, Bernshaw et Woods de notre Cour qui interpr\u00e8tent ce mot conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, sauf dans des circonstances inhabituelles (motifs de la C.A., par. 67 in fine). Comme le souligne \u00e0 juste titre le juge Doyon dans ses motifs, si le Parlement souhaitait s\u2019\u00e9loigner de cette interpr\u00e9tation, il lui \u00e9tait loisible d\u2019employer d\u2019autres termes \u2014 tels que \u00ab d\u00e8s que raisonnablement possible \u00bb ou \u00ab dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais \u00bb (par. 68). Pourtant, il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[44] Deuxi\u00e8mement, et plus important encore, il existe une diff\u00e9rence conceptuelle entre l\u2019exigence de possession pr\u00e9vue au par. 320.27(2) C. cr. et l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9, laquelle est relative \u00e0 la temporalit\u00e9. D\u2019ailleurs, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb figure aussi au par. 320.27(2) C. cr. Il s\u2019ensuit que les enseignements du pr\u00e9sent arr\u00eat relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 contenue \u00e0 l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019al. 320.27(1)b) C. cr.\n(3) L\u2019objet\n[45] La proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9tection dans laquelle s\u2019inscrit l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. poursuit un objectif ayant \u00e0 la fois un aspect pr\u00e9ventif et un aspect curatif, \u00e0 savoir combattre la menace que constitue la conduite en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. D\u2019abord, pour ce qui est de l\u2019aspect pr\u00e9ventif, la proc\u00e9dure augmente dans l\u2019esprit des conducteurs dont les facult\u00e9s sont affaiblies le risque qu\u2019ils soient d\u00e9couverts, afin de les dissuader de prendre le volant. Ensuite, en ce qui concerne l\u2019aspect curatif, la proc\u00e9dure vise \u00e0 d\u00e9tecter rapidement puis \u00e0 \u00e9carter des routes les conducteurs dangereux (Woods, par. 6 et 30; Thomsen, p. 655).\n[46] Dans la poursuite de cet objectif, le Parlement entendait \u00e9galement trouver un compromis \u00ab entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 ce que la conduite avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies soit \u00e9limin\u00e9e et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server les droits individuels garantis par la Charte \u00bb (Woods, par. 29). Notre Cour doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ce compromis lorsqu\u2019elle interpr\u00e8te l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\n(4) Conclusion sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\n[47] Le sens ordinaire du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb s\u2019accorde avec l\u2019objet de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. et le contexte dans lequel s\u2019inscrit cette disposition. D\u2019ailleurs, la jurisprudence de notre Cour a constamment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce mot en lui attribuant ce sens pr\u00e9cis sous r\u00e9serve de circonstances inhabituelles. Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant, notre Cour refuse d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb comme permettant un d\u00e9lai de 30 minutes pour la livraison d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux d\u2019une interception (voir aussi Thomsen, p. 653\u2011655; Woods, par. 13 et 43\u201144).\n[48] C\u2019est dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernshaw que notre Cour ouvre la porte \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Cette affaire concerne un conducteur qui est intercept\u00e9 et chez qui un policier d\u00e9c\u00e8le une odeur d\u2019alcool. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question du policier, le conducteur admet avoir consomm\u00e9 de l\u2019alcool. Il est alors somm\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9tection \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ADA, test qu\u2019il \u00e9choue. La fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat est contest\u00e9e, en raison de la possible pr\u00e9sence d\u2019alcool depuis moins de 15 minutes dans la bouche du conducteur au moment du test ce qui peut faussement \u00e9lever le r\u00e9sultat sur l\u2019ADA. Notre Cour conclut que le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb tol\u00e8re une attente de 15 minutes en vue de recueillir un \u00e9chantillon fiable. Pour conclure ainsi, elle prend appui sur le libell\u00e9 de la disposition en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, qui pr\u00e9cisait que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon obtenu doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour une analyse au moyen d\u2019un ADA. La disposition comportait donc des exigences relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019ADA afin d\u2019assurer la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une analyse convenable justifiant une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 tout, un tel d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pas acceptable dans tous les cas, mais bien uniquement lorsque l\u2019agent dispose d\u2019informations lui permettant de croire que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 sans attendre ne serait pas fiable (Bernshaw, par. 71\u201173, citant R. c. Pierman (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 704 (C.A.), conf. en partie par [1996] 1 R.C.S. 68).\n[49] Notre Cour s\u2019inspire de l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernshaw dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Woods. Dans cette affaire, deux policiers interpellent un conducteur. D\u00e9celant une forte odeur d\u2019alcool dans la voiture de ce dernier, les policiers lui demandent de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine en vertu de ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque le par. 254(2) C. cr. Le conducteur refuse, est arr\u00eat\u00e9 en vertu du par. 254(5) C. cr. et est emmen\u00e9 au poste de police, o\u00f9 il arrive environ une heure apr\u00e8s son arrestation. \u00c0 cet endroit, on ordonne une deuxi\u00e8me fois au conducteur de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine. Celui\u2011ci accepte. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs essais, il fournit un \u00e9chantillon valable, qui g\u00e9n\u00e8re un r\u00e9sultat positif. Par cons\u00e9quent, on lui ordonne de se soumettre \u00e0 un alcootest. Sur la base du r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019alcootest, le conducteur est accus\u00e9, puis reconnu coupable d\u2019avoir conduit un v\u00e9hicule avec un taux d\u2019alcool\u00e9mie sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la limite permise.\n[50] Sous la plume du juge Fish, notre Cour conclut que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine est inadmissible en preuve, puisqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni environ une heure et 20 minutes apr\u00e8s la formulation de l\u2019ordre et non pas \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb comme l\u2019exige le par. 254(2) C. cr. Citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernshaw, le juge Fish affirme que, dans des circonstances inhabituelles, le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb peut \u00ab recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation plus souple que celle que son sens ordinaire semble strictement lui r\u00e9server \u00bb (Woods, par. 43). Par contre, notre Cour rappelle que l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 doit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au sens courant du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb, notamment en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. C\u00f4t\u00e9 (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 667 (C.A.), dans lequel la juge Arbour, plus tard juge de notre Cour, conclut qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 14 minutes d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux de l\u2019interception ne respectait pas l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 :\nR\u00e9digeant l\u2019arr\u00eat unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel, la juge Arbour (plus tard juge \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada) a cit\u00e9 le passage de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grant que j\u2019ai reproduit et a expliqu\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Si l\u2019accus\u00e9 doit \u00eatre emmen\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement, o\u00f9 il est plus facile \u2014 que ce ne l\u2019est sur le bord de la route \u2014 de donner suite \u00e0 sa demande de communiquer avec un avocat, une bonne partie de la justification donn\u00e9e dans Thomsen tombe. Autrement dit, si l\u2019agent de police n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine avant que celui\u2011ci ait, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste, la possibilit\u00e9 de consulter un avocat, l\u2019ordre de l\u2019agent n\u2019est pas un ordre fait en vertu du par. 238(2). Il ne s\u2019agit pas strictement de calculer le nombre de minutes comprises dans le mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019agent \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine en moins de la moiti\u00e9 du temps qu\u2019il a fallu \u00e0 l\u2019agent dans Grant. Toutefois, vu les circonstances, en particulier l\u2019attente au d\u00e9tachement, je conclus que l\u2019ordre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au sens du par. 238(2). Comme l\u2019ordre n\u2019est pas conforme au par. 238(2), l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer et son refus ne constitue pas une infraction. [Je souligne; p. 285.]\nC\u2019est pour ces raisons qu\u2019il nous est constitutionnellement interdit d\u2019\u00e9largir le sens de \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb au par. 254(2) de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober le retard survenu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(Woods, par. 35\u201136)\nAinsi, le d\u00e9lai pertinent relatif \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 explicite est la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e entre la formulation de l\u2019ordre et le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine peut \u00eatre fourni (motifs de la C.A., par. 42). L\u2019extrait pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Woods reprend l\u2019id\u00e9e, d\u2019abord \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Thomsen, que la restriction du droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat d\u00e9coule implicitement du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr., plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb. Effectivement, sans l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9, la disposition \u00ab ne r\u00e9sisterait pas \u00e0 l\u2019examen de sa constitutionnalit\u00e9 \u00bb (Woods, par. 15). Certes, l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 est d\u2019ordinaire discut\u00e9e en lien avec le droit \u00e0 l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat garanti par l\u2019al. 10b) de la Charte . N\u00e9anmoins, ce droit n\u2019est pas le seul droit constitutionnel que cette exigence met potentiellement en cause, il peut s\u2019agir aussi de ceux pr\u00e9vus aux art. 8 et 9 de la Charte qui garantissent respectivement la protection contre les fouilles, perquisitions et saisies abusives ainsi que contre la d\u00e9tention ou l\u2019emprisonnement arbitraires (Woods, par. 15).\n[51] Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Quansah doit \u00eatre nuanc\u00e9e. Il est vrai que l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e si la dur\u00e9e de la d\u00e9tention est telle que le conducteur intercept\u00e9 aurait pu r\u00e9alistement consulter un avocat. Il est \u00e9galement vrai que, dans le cas contraire, l\u2019analyse n\u2019est pas pour autant termin\u00e9e, car il existe des situations o\u00f9 l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 n\u2019est pas observ\u00e9e m\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai ne permet pas la consultation d\u2019un avocat (Quansah, par. 34\u201135). Toutefois, avec \u00e9gards, la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario \u00e9largit ind\u00fbment l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 en concluant qu\u2019elle doit permettre un d\u00e9lai qui est [traduction] \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019agent de s\u2019acquitter de son devoir conform\u00e9ment au par. 254(2) \u00bb (Quansah, par. 47). \u00ab Imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb n\u2019est pas synonyme de \u00ab d\u00e9lai raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb; ce mot doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation conforme \u00e0 son sens ordinaire, sauf dans les circonstances inhabituelles \u00e9voqu\u00e9es par le juge Fish au par. 43 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Woods.\n[52] Ceci \u00e9tant, il convient de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux au moment de la formulation d\u2019un ordre en vertu de l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. constitue une circonstance inhabituelle justifiant une interpr\u00e9tation plus flexible du terme \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb.\nC. Les circonstances inhabituelles permettant une interpr\u00e9tation souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb\n[53] La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec se dirige bien en droit lorsqu\u2019elle indique que des circonstances inhabituelles li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019ADA ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat qui sera g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 peuvent justifier une interpr\u00e9tation souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr.\n[54] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, il n\u2019est ni n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable d\u2019identifier dans l\u2019abstrait et exhaustivement les circonstances pouvant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019inhabituelles et pouvant justifier une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. Il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que celles\u2011ci soient identifi\u00e9es au cas par cas, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits propres \u00e0 chaque affaire. Cependant, afin de guider les tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure dans cet examen, il importe de tracer des lignes directrices.\n[55] Premi\u00e8rement, le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles repose sur le minist\u00e8re public.\n[56] Deuxi\u00e8mement, comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernshaw, les circonstances inhabituelles doivent \u00eatre identifi\u00e9es eu \u00e9gard au texte de la disposition (Piazza, par. 82). Ceci permet de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de la disposition en faisant en sorte que les tribunaux n\u2019\u00e9largissent pas ind\u00fbment le sens ordinaire strictement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb.\n[57] Tout comme la disposition en cause dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernshaw, l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019\u00e9chantillon recueilli doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une \u00ab analyse convenable \u00bb, ce qui ouvre la porte \u00e0 des d\u00e9lais caus\u00e9s par des circonstances inhabituelles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019appareil ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat.\n[58] Ceci dit, les tribunaux pourraient reconna\u00eetre des circonstances inhabituelles autres que celles directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019ADA ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sultat qui sera g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9. Par exemple, dans l\u2019optique o\u00f9 la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9tection d\u2019alcool au volant vise d\u2019abord et avant tout \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous, des circonstances relatives \u00e0 l\u2019urgence d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public ou celle des agents de la paix pourraient \u00eatre reconnues.\n[59] Troisi\u00e8mement, les circonstances inhabituelles ne peuvent \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de consid\u00e9rations budg\u00e9taires ou d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 pratique. Une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par l\u2019importance des fonds publics devant \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019approvisionnement des forces polici\u00e8res en ADA, ou par le temps requis pour former des agents \u00e0 leur utilisation. De telles consid\u00e9rations utilitaires n\u2019ont rien d\u2019inhabituel. Le lot quotidien de tout gouvernement consiste \u00e0 allouer des ressources budg\u00e9taires limit\u00e9es (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie\u2011Britannique c. Colombie\u2011Britannique, 2020 CSC 13, [2020] 1 R.C.S. 678, par. 153).\n[60] Quatri\u00e8mement, l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA sur les lieux au moment de la formulation de l\u2019ordre ne constitue pas en soi une circonstance inhabituelle.\nD. Un ordre formul\u00e9 en l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 valide\n[61] Durant sa plaidoirie, le procureur du minist\u00e8re public a argu\u00e9 qu\u2019un ordre formul\u00e9 en l\u2019absence d\u2019un ADA est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 valide. Selon lui, le conducteur d\u00e9tenu doit donc accepter de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon demand\u00e9, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019il lui est impossible de s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter vu l\u2019absence d\u2019un appareil. Ce n\u2019est que si l\u2019appareil arrive trop tardivement (expression qui n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pas d\u00e9finie clairement), que ce dernier peut alors refuser de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine et \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle; la validit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019ordre serait en quelque sorte p\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Au contraire, toujours selon le minist\u00e8re public, si le conducteur exprime d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu son intention de refuser de fournir l\u2019\u00e9chantillon, l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9vue au par. 254(5) C. cr. est alors consomm\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9.\n[62] La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario adopte ce raisonnement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Degiorgio. L\u2019affaire concerne une conductrice qui refuse \u00e0 trois reprises de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine alors m\u00eame que l\u2019agent n\u2019avait pas d\u2019ADA avec lui. Confirmant le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9, la Cour d\u2019appel conclut que l\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 ne d\u00e9finit pas la substance de l\u2019infraction. Ainsi, lorsque le refus d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer est exprim\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement, la poursuite n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 ce refus, les policiers auraient pu administrer le test de mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 (Degiorgio, par. 57\u201158, citant avec approbation R. c. Danychuk (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.)).\n[63] Avec \u00e9gards, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 qualifie l\u2019ordre de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine. C\u2019est le refus d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 cet ordre de fournir imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u00e9chantillon qui constitue une infraction criminelle, et non pas l\u2019expression anticip\u00e9e d\u2019un refus d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019ordre lorsqu\u2019un ADA sera disponible sur les lieux. Au demeurant, et comme le note avec justesse le juge Doyon aux par. 49\u201150 et 55 du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel, comment une personne peut\u2011elle engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 un ordre, soit celui de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, auquel il \u00e9tait concr\u00e8tement impossible d\u2019ob\u00e9ir en raison de l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA au moment de la formulation de l\u2019ordre? Poser la question, c\u2019est y r\u00e9pondre.\n[64] Plus fondamentalement, un m\u00eame ordre ne peut \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois valide et invalide. En d\u2019autres termes, et pour reprendre dans leur essence les propos de la Cour d\u2019appel, la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre ne peut \u00eatre conditionnelle au d\u00e9lai de livraison de l\u2019ADA \u00e0 destination (motifs de la C.A., par. 51\u201161). Cette situation pr\u00e9vaudrait si l\u2019on adh\u00e9rait \u00e0 l\u2019approche du minist\u00e8re public et de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario.\n[65] Une telle approche place le conducteur devant une incertitude insoutenable. En effet, suivant un principe de droit \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, nul n\u2019est cens\u00e9 ignorer la loi. D\u00e8s lors, il doit \u00eatre possible pour les justiciables de conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019avance la nature criminelle de l\u2019acte avant de l\u2019accomplir (Mabior, par. 14). Lorsqu\u2019un conducteur d\u00e9tenu est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un ordre lui intimant de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine, il doit \u00eatre en mesure de savoir si l\u2019ordre est valide et si son refus engagera sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle (motifs de la C.A., par. 51). Dans un contexte o\u00f9 ce dernier n\u2019a pas le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat, on ne saurait l\u00e9gitimement et r\u00e9alistement attendre de lui qu\u2019il accepte \u00e0 l\u2019avance d\u2019obtemp\u00e9rer, puis qu\u2019il sache ensuite d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel moment le d\u00e9lai de livraison de l\u2019ADA justifie un refus. De m\u00eame, cela d\u00e9montre pourquoi il faut adopter une approche restrictive dans l\u2019identification de ce qui peut constituer une \u00ab circonstance inhabituelle \u00bb permettant une interpr\u00e9tation souple du mot \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb. Plus l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est flexible, transformant ainsi l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 en une exigence \u00e0 g\u00e9om\u00e9trie variable, plus l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat devient n\u00e9cessaire pour le conducteur (R. c. Talbourdet (1984), 9 D.L.R. (4th) 406 (C.A. Sask.), p. 414\u2011415, a contrario). C\u2019est, du reste, le souhait qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir refus\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re fois de fournir un \u00e9chantillon d\u2019haleine.\n[66] Rien dans l\u2019al. 254(2)b) C. cr. n\u2019indique que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er la pr\u00e9somption de validit\u00e9 que propose le minist\u00e8re public. Cela \u00e9tant dit, les agents de la paix qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019ADA avec eux lorsqu\u2019ils interceptent un automobiliste soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 d\u2019avoir de l\u2019alcool dans son organisme ne sont pas enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9pourvus de moyens. En effet, ils peuvent requ\u00e9rir de l\u2019automobiliste qu\u2019il effectue des tests de coordination comme le permet l\u2019actuel al. 320.27(1)a) C. cr. De m\u00eame, ces agents disposent des pouvoirs de common law en mati\u00e8re de v\u00e9rification de sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Lorsque cela est raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire, ils peuvent notamment questionner un conducteur l\u00e9galement intercept\u00e9 sur sa consommation pr\u00e9alable d\u2019alcool ou lui demander de se soumettre \u00e0 des \u00e9preuves physiques autres que celles pr\u00e9vues dans le Code criminel (R. c. Orbanski, 2005 CSC 37, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 3, par. 43\u201149; Leclerc c. R., 2022 QCCA 365, par. 45\u201148 (CanLII)).\n[67] En derni\u00e8re analyse, il convient de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019argument du minist\u00e8re public voulant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne puisse justifier son refus par l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur les lieux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il ignorait tout de cette absence durant l\u2019interception. Avec \u00e9gards, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Accepter cet argument pourrait avoir l\u2019effet d\u2019encourager les agents de la paix \u00e0 manquer de transparence, puisque, dans les cas o\u00f9 ils interceptent un conducteur, ces derniers sont normalement les seuls \u00e0 savoir s\u2019ils sont en possession ou non d\u2019un ADA. Cela signifierait que les agents de la paix pourraient, \u00e0 leur seule discr\u00e9tion et d\u2019une fa\u00e7on arbitraire, rendre valide un ordre qui autrement ne l\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 si le conducteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur les lieux au moment de l\u2019interception.\nE. Application aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[68] Le minist\u00e8re public n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019aucune circonstance inhabituelle justifiant l\u2019absence d\u2019ADA sur place et, par le fait m\u00eame, l\u2019application d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation souple de l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, l\u2019appelant ne peut expliquer la raison pour laquelle les agents Atkins et C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2011Lemieux n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019ADA en leur possession. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019ordre formul\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Atkins \u00e9tait invalide. Le refus exprim\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a donc pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle, et l\u2019acquittement inscrit par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nVII.
